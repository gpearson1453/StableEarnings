CALTHA tracked leaders to the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, split horses inside the final furlong to inch clear under good handling to the wire.
KENYA SUN close up well off rail throughout, came running widest through the stretch but too late. LEA ME ALONE hesitated start at the start, settled to
the turn ran on to a short lead at the furlong marker but run down and settled for the show spot. SUPORB inside speed to the front, dueled to the turn, shook
free and stayed game in the late stages. WINWARD FLO quick speed from outside, dueled in the two path but could not keep up in the final furlong. MY
ANGELICA inside run throughout with no punch when needed.
