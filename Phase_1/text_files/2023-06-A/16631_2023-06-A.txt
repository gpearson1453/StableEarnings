Footnotes
CEBOLLA was unhurried early and raced in the back, advanced around the turn, bid seven wide, dueled for the lead and proved best. GOLDEN MERGER
was unhurried early, saved ground, slipped through along the rail on the second turn, dueled for the lead and was outfinished in a game effort. ABSTRACT
KAT broke slowly, was taken outside and raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid six wide, assumed command with a short lead and was outfinished.
REVOLT AND RIOT was sent early to get a position along the inside, angled out for the drive, bid and hung. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE was reluctant to
load, was never far back, got boxed in on the turn and in the upper stretch and lacked a bid. RAFAEL'S SURPRISE stalked the pace, rallied into the turn to
challenge, leveled off and faded. ABETEMARCO vied to the second turn and flattened out. BLUE LUNA WHO was slow early, widest in the drive and outrun
in an even effort. TENACIOUS LION vied to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
KEEP IT ROLLIN pressed the pace along the inside, challenged into the turn, assumed command, swung wide entering the stretch, was under pressure
through the drive and just lasted. GONNABEE came in after the start, raced mid pack, closed inside and was gaining fast late. HAUTE LADY was crowded
after the start, raced wide, rallied into the turn, was carried out entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire and earned show. I GET STORMED lagged
early, finished well mid track and improved position. ANNA B bumped at the start, vied to the turn, dropped back and hung in the lane.
SHEZACONSTANTSONG was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a mild bid only. DOM PROUD was crowded after the start, dropped
inside and fell far back, put in a steady effort and improved position. ROSES FOR SUZZETT vied to the turn, dropped back and gave way. BELLA Y SOFIA
was in tight after the start and was not a threat. TERAS SILENCE bumped at the start, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. STELLA WHEAT broke out,
stalked the pace to the turn, tired and stopped. CAANFOOLERY had brief speed only.

RYDERS UP held a good position inside, rallied around the turn, got a head in front and inched clear late to prove best. QUANTUM BULL set a pressured
pace, drew off into the turn for a clear lead, fought back when headed, continued to contend to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. WILD FIREWATER vied
inside, fell back into the turn, angled out, came again, hung late and settled for show. PAINTED SMOKE saved ground in an even effort and showed little.
LUCKY MATT broke slowly, was crowded and steadied at the start, raced wide and failed to contend. CANDY RASCAL was never far back, raced outside,
was through after a half and stopped. WHO'S ON THE RUN pulled up and was vanned off.

ALL CHROME was unhurried and trailed the field, circled the field going around the turn, closed willingly, drew off and won going away. DIABOLICAL
STORM stalked the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out, bid to contend and was no match for the winner. STORM BAYOU was
never far back, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to get up for show. GO RED RASCAL vied inside, drew clear into the turn, faltered at the top
of the stretch and dropped back. ANCIENT LAND bobbled and bumped at the start, was slow early and lacked a bid. TUCUM raced close to the pace while
racing towards the outside, rallied on the turn, bid and came up empty. HENNESSY'S SQUIRT broke out and bumped at the start, vied between horses,
was through early and stopped. LIFE JACKET broke sharply, vied to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
LIL MISS CASSIE vied to the turn, drew clear and extended the lead under mild urging. EMOTION N DEVOTION moved up inside to vie to the turn, fell
back, went evenly late and held for place. BYE BYE HANNAHBO raced mid pack towards the outside, rallied four wide on the turn and lacked the needed
late response. MARKING'S MIRACLE raced close to the pace along the rail, lacked a bid and did not threaten. BYE BYE BROOKY bumped at the start,
dropped inside to save ground, angled out for the drive and lacked a response. BLAME THE TEQUILA was not a factor. WHY FOR bumped at the start
while getting away well, held a good position to the turn and stopped. MS JAZZ vied early, stopped and dropped back steadily. LEAP YEAR NIGHT was
outrun.
