Footnotes
MC COUGAR came away last and quickly advanced along the inside to race off the top flight, had to wait for racing room around the turn, shifted out three
to four wide entering the lane, roused forward to challenge SINCERLY MINE for the lead in the final furlong, briefly matched strides then edged away.
SINCERELY MINE raced up close in opening stages then engaged WICKED HOT FOOT for the lead, vied two wide around the turn, shook free with a
furlong left to run then got denied by the winner in the final sixteenth. WICKED HOT FOOT broke on top and quickly established the lead, vied inside of
SINCERLY MINE around the turn, fought back to the eighth pole then gave way. NICE ONE JULIO raced in contention just off the top flight, chased two
wide around the turn, came out wider into stretch run and gave way. D D'S LEGACY raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, lugged in down
the lane and brushed repeatedly against the rail, had no late response. D'S MIC DROP lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and never
threatened.

Footnotes
FLEETRIDGE vied inside of MEDICINE TAIL around the first turn, battled on up the backstretch, shook free midway around the far turn, saved ground
entering the lane, roused for more, responded willingly, quickly widened to a commanding advantage and kept to task. HARD ATTACK was allowed to settle
out of the gate and raced in the back around the first turn, continued unhurried up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid turning for home, rallied along
the outside and captured place. ALLO ENRY stalked the top flight up the backstretch, given cue to pick up the tempo late on the far turn, was no match for
pulling away winner in upper stretch but ran on and cleared a share. MEDICINE TAIL vied outside of FLEETRIDGE around the first turn, battled on up the
backstretch, could not move on with eventual winner past the mid-way point on the far turn, kept on then weakened in the final furlong. DAVIDIC LINE
tracked the top flight along the inside up the backstretch, flattened out when called upon around the far turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
PARALISSFRMANALYSS vied for the lead with BIG HEARTED FACTOR around the first turn, battled on to the half mile marker then briefly shook free,
took on the challenge of BILLY YANK with three furlongs left to run, held a slim lead over rival around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, cleared
command in upper stretch and held sway. BILLY YANK stalked the top pair in early stages, made a move for the leader with three furlongs left to run, raced
in striking distance around the far turn, could not stay in touch with eventual winner at the head of the lane but sustained bid and cleared second best.
INCITATUS hopped at the start and came away last but was never far back, tracked the pace up the backstretch, made a bid in the three path late on the
far turn, ran on down the lane and just lasted for show. COOL CATOMINE was unhurried and raced well off the early pace, swung five wide into the stretch,
showed response in the final furlong and just missed show. FAKE SOLUTION was well reserved racing near the back, swung four wide into the lane and
lacked a needed rally. BIG HEARTED FACTOR vied with the eventual winner around the first turn and battled on into the backstretch, could not match
strides past the half mile marker, weakened around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. A. K. SAFARI came up empty after a half mile, retreated
and jogged in.

CODETOWIN was well placed sitting three to four wide just off the early leaders, let out a notch midway around the turn, loomed up to challenge for the lead

fought back gamely but could not match late. TIZHOTNDUSTY raced up close three wide in the opening quarter, engaged rivals for the lead at the quarter

GARBO SPEAKS tracked three to four wide just off the embattled leaders, moved up three wide to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter pole, took over
the lead at the head of the lane and kept clear. CLAY'S OPAL INDY raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane,
tipped two to three wide and finished well. BAYSHORE FOXES was not too far back in early stages, hustled along three wide around the turn, came four
wide into the lane, sustained bid and cleared the rest. TROPINKA raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
RAINBOW SUREBET dueled for the lead up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner at the head of the lane
and gave way. GOLD MAKER dueled inside of rivals for the early lead, battled on around the turn then tired in the drive. LITTLE ROCKER briefly vied for
the lead, steadied while weakening leaving the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
BIG PINES SANDY was well placed tracking the embattled trio up the backstretch, made a move entering the far turn, took a slim lead along the outside
near the five sixteenths pole, dug in over stubborn KOBES CAUSE in upper stretch, drifted out wider, urged right handed, took control and held clear. EVIL
KNIEVEL got bumped repeatedly between foes and got pinched back to last at the start, remained unhurried up the backstretch, swung five wide into the
stretch run, rallied through the lane and captured place. KOBE'S CAUSE dueled for the early lead racing three deep, continued to battle leaving the
backstretch, took on the challenge of BIG PINES SANDY entering the far turn, lost the lead but fought back stubbornly remaining in striking distance then
weakened in late stages. WELLER ROGUE rated off the top flight up the backstretch, urged to pick up the pace mid-way around the far turn, hustled along
three wide into the drive and ran on evenly. JUSTICE ONCE was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced three wide into the first turn, continued
unhurried up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, tipped three wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL dueled
inside of rivals around the first turn and up the backstretch, remained in striking distance around the far turn, ran on to mid-stretch then came up empty.
LEAPIN TY MAN bobbled at the start, quickly recovered and engaged rivals for the lead around the first turn, battled for command between rivals up the
backstretch, could not match strides past the midway point on the far turn and retreated.
