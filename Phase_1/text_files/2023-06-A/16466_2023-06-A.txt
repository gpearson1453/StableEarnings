LOLA M rushed to the lead while securing the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and
widened her advantage late to prove best. ARUNDEL CASTLE away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground entering the first
turn, awaited racing rom midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide from between rivals through the final turn, and closed willingly one out from
the rail in the drive to get up for the place. CHI CHI'S SONG away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied
from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive and just failed to hold the place. MATSQUI stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, got shuffled back to trail the field into the final turn while racing three wide, and finished two
out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. B C CHRISTIE was off a step slow and trailed the field into the first turn while racing
two out from the rail, advanced three wide soon after entering the backstretch, loomed a danger three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong while unable to sustain her bid. The rider of B C CHRISTIE lost his whip leaving the final turn. SWANGIN broke sharply, but steadied sharply when
put in tight quarters at the rail passing the wire the first time, held a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final
turn, steadied from between rivals leaving the turn, and had little left for the drive. Following the running of this race there was a rider's claim of foul, the rider
of SWANGIN lodged a claim of foul against the rider of LOLA M, for alleged interference passing the wire the first time. After review the claim of foul was
disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

KOALA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run to the final turn, and widened her
advantage through the final furlong under confident handling. ANIMA broke sharply and stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the

the early pace at the back of a compact field entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly
from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. HARLAN'S ANGEL was sent hard in the run to the first turn to press the pace from the outside of KOALA,
held a tracking trip two wide in the run down the backstretch, continued to chase the pacesetter two wide into the final turn, but was outfinished in the late
going. KANDY KATIE stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, dropped back to trail midway through the final turn, and had
little to offer late.
