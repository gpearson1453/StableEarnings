the winner in a game effort. TRUTH PREVAILS away well, tried to stay close on the backstretch, had to drop back to avoid having to get shuffled going into
the turn, continued along the inside on the turn, made steady progress along the rail and rallied mildly to get up for third in the lane. TIZ A MASTER stalked
pace along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, eased out three wide entering the lane, and made mild progress to the wire.
GLITTER LAKE tracked pace three wide on the backstretch, began to advanced early on the turn and had to shift out to avoid retreating rival, continued
wide rest of turn and kept on willingly in the lane after losing so much ground. BLUE BUTTERFLY vied in between rivals on the backstretch, settled for
chasing position on the turn and in range entering the lane before giving way in upper stretch. LA CROIX vied for lead three wide on the backstretch, began
to drift out and weaken midway on the turn and offered nothing in the lane in a well beaten effort.
