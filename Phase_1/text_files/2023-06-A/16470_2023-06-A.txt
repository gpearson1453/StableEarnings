Footnotes
PRIDDIS dueled with an inner rival throughout the first three quarters, then kicked clear in the late stretch and just had more in the end to prevail.
TWENTYTWENTYREDO was unhurried leaving the gate then saved ground down the backstretch, bid while two wide on the far turn then closed belatedly
from the four path to be up for the place prize. POET LAUREATE was unchallenged for third position throughout the first three quarters, then closed gamely
down the stretch and still held the show position in the end. ITS MY MONEY TOO dueled from the inside down the backstretch, continued to battle gamely
throughout the turn and into the early stretch then gave way in the end. TOOTIE chased the pace while two wide, bid on the far turn and flattened out in the
stretch. MIDNIGHT'S GIRL chased the pace while four wide, then bid from the two path on the far turn and needed more in the end.
ITSONLYMONEYHONEY settled along the inside, then made a mild bid on the far turn and needed rally in the end. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in
regards to inference in the stretch drive. After reviewing the replay, no changes were made.

Footnotes
CARLOS LOVES TEE moved up between horses on the first turn to duel on the lead, battled from between to the three-eighths pole, pulled clear on the turn
from the pace pressure and held the closing runner-up safe without being seriously threatened late. MAZI reserved off the pace into the first turn, steadied
briefly off heels in turn, settled into tracking trip along the rail in the second flight, split rivals turning for home and finished willingly. NORA'S LEGACY
reserved near the rear of the field, made steady progression down the backside, rallied wide in the final bend and continued to gain ground in the lane
in-spite of drifting out. SIMPLE PLEASURE chased the pace from two wide in the second flight, rallied three wide in the turn and failed to sustain his bid in
the lane. MRS. KRINKLES sped up the fence to be engaged in a three way duel on the lead, kept on for a half mile and steadily gave way in the final
three-eighths. PAINTBRUSH dueled on the lead from three wide for three quarters of a mile and faded in the stretch. SHESMYBROKER went evenly posing
no threat. MAYAPRETTY trailed all the way and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MY PATRIOTIC GIRL was rated while stalking the pace from the two path, took command at the top of the far bend, then drew off in the stretch to win in
hand confidently. REASON OVER RICHES chased the pace while two wide, then bid on the far turn to rally from the four path in the early stretch and
closed well to be best for second place. LEXINGTON DIVA stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then rallied leaving the far turn, dueled
for the place position with an outer rival in late stretch and was out finished in the end. SI QUERE settled in the two path throughout the backstretch, then
rallied from the three path in the upper stretch but came up empty. TWITTER TRAFFIC set the pace along the inside into the first turn, was in a long drive
then gave way heading into the home stretch. TRANQUILITY chased the pace from the inside, then faded gradually throughout the second half and was no
menace. GUITAR GROUPIE was brushed at the start then settled along the inside and failed to rally.

JAN'S TURN TO WIN broke sharply, was taken in hand to settle into stride, moved up three wide in the turn to duel on the lead, assumed command in
upper stretch and drew away in a determined drive. UPTOWNBLINGITHOME raced up two wide behind the dueling pacesetters, steadied off heels shortly
before the turn, rushed through an opening two wide in the turn to bid for the lead, dueled down the lane with the winner but could not get passed. LADY
AVE pressed the pace from the fence, rallied in the turn to be on the lead briefly between calls, battled on to upper stretch and was out-finished late. HAPPY
SAILOR tracked the leaders in striking position through the turn and lacked a closing kick. TEXAS ASCOT QUEEN sped up to take the lead shortly from the
gate while racing three wide, dropped to the two path in the turn to duel on the pace and weakened turning for home. DISCREET SMILE trailed the field in
close proximity but lacked a response when called upon for the drive.

the early stretch and was closing strong but was forced out in late stretch by an inner rival and hung in the end. GOLDEN SLEW was bumped at the start,

stretch and was closing well but it wasn't enough. POQUITO LADY chased the pace while five wide, bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. MORO

Footnotes
MARFA SKY settled in to press the pace from two wide, engaged the front runner at the quarter pole, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and drew
away as much the best in a perfect trip. OZZIES WINGS Y G broke sharply to open a clear advantage in the opening strides, was taken in hand to settle on
the lead, dueled with the winner through the turn, was no match for that one but held on to the place gamely. SON OF A BLING bumped rival away from the
gate, settled to stalk from three wide, moved into striking position in a long drive leaving the five-sixteenths and was gaining on the runner-up late. SILENT
BLING reserved off the pace early, saved ground through the turn and made a late rally down the lane. BUBBA'S RECKLESS trailed the field to the top of
the stretch and passed tired rivals in the lane. SILVER ASSASSIN went evenly and failed to respond when called upon in the turn. HEZAKOOLKAT flashed
brief speed to be in early contention and was finished early tiring through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUNLIT SONG hesitated at the start, then moved up to track the pace in the middle of the field from the two path, was well rated throughout the far turn,
then dug in gamely mid stretch to kick clear of rivals and held on well to prove much the best in the end. SINGAPORE FLASH dueled for the lead into the
first turn and into the second turn, then continued to bid grudgingly down the lane but was out finished by a an outer rival and was best for place. STANS
HOOKIN BULL tracked the pace while two wide, then bid from the four path on the far turn to menace in the stretch and closed well for a gamely third.
EASTER SNAP was in a long drive to duel for the lead from the inside down the backstretch and into the home stretch, then gave way in the end. TRULY
DANZIG settled along the inside, then rallied on the far turn and into the stretch but needed more in the end. TAPITS KASH tracked the pace in the middle
of the field from the inside, bid mildly on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. CANATLAN settled in the two path down the backstretch, then came
out five on the far turn to bid in the stretch but did not fire.

Footnotes
DUST EM stalked the pace from between horses three wide, angled out to the clear in the five path turning for home and closed willingly to be going away
at the wire. ALGEBRA raced up the fence to press the pace from the inside to the quarter pole, assumed command in upper stretch opening a clear lead but
tired late in the drive while gamely holding the place. TOO MUCH ACTION tracked the pacesetters from two wide, was in tight in traffic nearing the
three-eighths pole steadying slightly, was set to a drive mid-turn and finished willingly. CHIEF BRADY sped up from the outside of the pack to set the pace
from two wide into the turn, dueled on the lead to upper stretch and weakened coming home. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER prominently placed in striking
distance from the rail to the quarter pole and failed to mount a rally in the lane. BLING'S BELLWETHER crowded at the start to drop back to the rear of the
field, trailed to the top of the stretch and showed some late interest. LIL SWEET THANG went evenly and was never a threat. HELLO HELLO MISTER
showed speed to be well placed in contention for a half mile and tired.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH KIKI tracked the pace while three deep, was moving up on the turn from the two path, angled out to the five path to rally and closed fastest
down the lane to be up at the wire proving best. TOO MUCH DREAMING dueled for the lead while two wide into the turn, then gained command in the early
stretch, continued to bid gamely but was caught in the end. FLYING FIRST CLASS stalked the pace while three wide, then menaced in the early stretch to
close well for the show prize. SPECIAL NOTE broke outwardly at the start, gained the early lead from the inside, then dueled to keep the lead throughout
the turn, was used up and gave way in the end. INDY LA PRIMERA stalked the pace while four wide, was in a hard drive throughout the turn then closed
well in the stretch but it wasn't enough. HIGH CALIBER CATCH was under a steady drive while chasing the pace from the inside, then rallied in the upper
stretch but came up evenly. SHE'S EXTRA was impeded at the start, then raced along the inside, bid from on the turn and was no threat. DIVERTIDA
trailed throughout and passed tiring foes in the stretch. EARLY SPRING settled in the two path and failed to rally. NIGHT BLING raced in the back of the
field while two wide, then was taken up in late stretch and did not finish, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
IMALUCKYCHARM broke alertly to take control from the gate, set a well measured, well rated pace throughout, opened a clear lead at the head of the lane
and was never threatened in the drive. IMA DISCREET LADY tracked the leaders from the rail through the first turn, continued to save ground while in
striking position from the fence to the quarter pole, angled out for the drive and finished willingly to gain the place. NO MAS TEQUILA stalked the leaders
from between horses, commenced a rally entering the far turn, was forced to steady behind the stopping pace presser, lost momentum, was set down again
while cutting the corner coming home and rallied gamely up the fence to just miss the place. ROSIE JANE well placed just off the leaders three wide,
loomed up in the turn and failed to sustain her bid. WILBURNSCLASSYLADY reserved early on to be near the rear of the field and showed mild late interest
to gain ground in the stretch. TUDELA pressed the leader for a half mile, began to fade midway on the turn causing traffic problems for NO MAS TEQUILA
and faded down the lane. TAHITIAN BREEZE trailed most of the way and was never a threat. MORO LINGERIE raced near the back of the back into the
first turn along the fence, encountered traffic in the turn to be taken in hand and flattened out after five eighths.
