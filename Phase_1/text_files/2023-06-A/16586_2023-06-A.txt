Footnotes
KISS set the pace in the two path, encountered a rail challenge from ZADORSKY in upper stretch and tenaciously clung to a margin through the final
furlong. ZADORSKY bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked from the rail while just behind the leaders around the turn, slipped through to offer a bid
in upper stretch, sparred through the final furlong but was denied. STAIRSTEP TOHEAVEN bumped with an outer rival at the start, advanced inside of foes
to a tracking position into the turn, pursued from the two path before tipping outside of the leading trio entering the lane, then sustained stride to gain show
at the sixteenth pole. EDISTRUDIS stalked from the three path, pressed the leader turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper
stretch and lost show to an outer rival a sixteenth from home. CAT'S CAVE was coaxed along off of the pace in the two path and kept on evenly. WEE BIT
O MISCHIEF pursued from midpack in the five to four path, drifted inwardly on his left lead entering the final furlong and lacked a bid. SHIMMERING
ALLURE broke slowly, trailed along the inside before gaining turning for home, shifted to the four path entering the lane before tipping further out in
midstretch, but leveled off in the final furlong. PARTAKE raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but steadied into the turn, faltered and lost position
around the turn before shifting out tot he five path turning for home and failed to menace. DANCING PRINCESS lacked speed, then trailed in the four path
around the turn and got outrun. WORLD SHOWCASE tracked in the three path early on, but weakened between horses around the turn. SEAU N'TAP
lacked speed in the four to five path, but drifted inwardly entering the lane and tired.

Footnotes
LAMUTANAATTY set the pace along the inside, was confronted by a pair of outer challengers turning for home, yet shrugged them away entering the lane
and kicked clear in upper stretch. RIDER'S SPECIAL laid off of the pace in the three to four path and between horses while coaxed along around the turn,
then stayed on outside of foes in the final furlong to gain place nearing the wire. MIDASWELLRUN checked between horses at the five furlong pole, pursued
from off of the pace in the two path under urging around the turn, then sustained a rail chase through the lane to offer a bid for place in the closing stages,
but was outfinished by an outer bidder late. SUPREMELY stalked in the two path while inside of a rival, ranged up outside of the leader along with that one
to bid turning for home, but was repelled in upper stretch and weakened between a pair of rivals in the final sixteenth. AERONAUT stalked three wide, bid
turning for home, but faltered between horses entering the lane. LUPO'S LEGACY stumbled at the start, then made little impact in the four to five path.
STAND FOR FREEDOM got keen between horses approaching the five furlong pole, altered course inside of a troubled foe soon after, but trailed into the
turn and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
EXTRA ANEJO broke awkwardly while bobbling outwardly a touch, stalked in the three to two path and outside of foes, quickly inhaled the leader
approaching the five sixteenths pole to lead under confident urging from an outer rival entering the lane, then drew away from that one while well in hand
through the lane. TALL BOY checked between horses around the first turn, gained from well back entering the far turn, ranged up three wide to press
outside of the new leader turning for home, but quickly proved no match for that one in upper stretch and remained well clear of the rest. CLASSIC LEGACY
trailed early on, lagged behind down the backstretch, then surpassed a tiring inner pair in the lane. WESTERN GHENT hit the outer half of the gate at the
start, tracked along the inside, chased bidders while shifting out around the far turn, but weakened through the lane. TAKE THE CHARGE pulled clear
around the first turn, but was overhauled by an outer pair approaching the five sixteenths pole and readily stopped.

Footnotes
BOUDIN tracked three wide, tipped five wide turning for home to take aim on the leaders, bid entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch and inched
away through the final furlong. SCOTCH NO ROCKS stalked two wide, tracked behind the leaders around the turn, offered a rail bid simultaneously with
that of BOUDIN's outer challenge entering the lane, but only managed to chase that foe home and proved second best. SECRET EDGE broke a step slow,
lagged well behind the field into the turn, cut the gap on the rest while swinging to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on willingly outside of rivals
after changing leads at the furlong grounds and gained show at the wire. STAYINYOURLANE pursued from off of the pace in the two path under steady
coaxing, tipped in entering the lane, sustained a rail chase to gain show in the final sixteenth, but was caught at the wire by an outer rival. SERGEANT
COUNTZLER bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, then moved up between horses. HAIL ALLEN prompted the pace three wide, vied in
the four path around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane and gave way through the final furlong. KVETCHING MAW brushed
with an inner rival at the start before taking contact from both sides soon after, set the pace inside of a vying pair while remaining a path off of the inner rail,
then weakened between horses in upper stretch. CLOSE KNIT exchanged light contact with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, stalked along the inside
but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. GARY'S FLYING LION brushed an outer rival soon after the start, prompted the pace two wide and between
horses, vied in the three path around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
TWIN MISCHIEF set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, got headed at the three furlong pole, yet fought back entering the lane to regain an advantage
in upper stretch, dueled with an outer pair through the late stages and prevailed gamely. EXCELLENT QUESTION stalked along the inside, moved between
horses turning for home, smoothly tipped out to take aim outside of the top pair in upper stretch, then sustained a grinding charge to offer a late bid but
missed. VANISHED vied for the lead two wide and between horses, led narrowly around the far turn, got re-headed by her inner counterpart in upper
stretch, sustained a duel into the final furlong, sparred between horses in the closing stages, but was fended off in the duel and lost place to her outer
counterpart late. LACIE BE GOOD bobbled slightly at the start, tracked two wide, tipped outside of the leading trio entering the backstretch, ranged up to
offer a four wide bid around the far turn, vied turning for home, but gave way to inner foes entering the lane yet held fourth from an inner rival. COPPA GIRL
stumbled severely after the start causing her to spot the leaders multiple lengths early on, saved ground while trailing, improved inside of rivals around the
far turn, but failed to sustain a bid. CATHERINE BLAZE failed to factor from the three path. EVIE'S ENCORE made little impact from the two path.
RAGGITY SAND prompted the pace three wide, then among foes around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
MUGSY MALONE took a bump from an inner rival upon leaving the gates, prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn and drove clear entering
the lane. MAD ADAM tracked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, encountered traffic in upper stretch before splitting foes two wide at
the furlong grounds to vie for place while hanging on his left lead, changed over and battled with a pair of outer foes for that position through the late stages
and narrowly prevailed. HEY BOSS laid off of the pace in the two path, gained four wide around the far turn, vied for place while changing leads at the
furlong grounds, but was outfinished by an inner rival for that position. BRIT'S WIT tracked two wide and between horses, bid for place among foes three
wide at the furlong grounds, dueled with rivals on either side for that position in the late stages, but was bested. LEVEE PROUD broke outwardly and
bumped a rival at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe down the backstretch, got headed by that one at the three furlong pole, then weakened in
upper stretch. PRIMER DIMER stalked three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. NORDIC LIGHT broke slowly, leaned out and checked
behind a rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, took the far turn in the five path and failed to factor. STUD PUPPY lagged behind and
showed little.

OBRIGADA broke a bit outwardly, pressed two wide, bid entering the lane, dueled through midstretch and edged away in the final sixteenth. FAST GISELLE
set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge entering the lane, dueled into deep stretch, but was bested with a sixteenth to go. LOVE
OF MY LIFE tracked three wide, then chased the top pair through the lane while holding show. PROUD FOOT stumbled at the start, laid off of the pace in
the three to four path and ran on evenly while chasing show. HOLIDAY DECISION broke a step slow at the start, trailed while hung in the five path around
the turn and moved up. JUST LIKE MAGIC tracked the main group but weakened in the four path around the turn. ELECTRIC SENSE stalked along the
inside but weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON stalked three wide, bid while changing leads entering the final furlong, wrestled a narrow advantage at the sixteenth pole and
maintained that margin from his inner counterpart through the late stages. TILTED TOWERS vied two wide, gained an advantage turning for home, resisted
an outer challenge while hanging on his left lead entering the final furlong, but was headed by that one while changing over at the sixteenth pole, fought on
thereafter but failed to regain even terms. BLUE KENTUCKY laid off of the pace along the inside, improved past outer rivals while tipping two wide in
midstretch and ran on to gain show at the sixteenth pole. SOLIDIFY trailed in the two path, swung out to the six path nearing the lane and stayed on
willingly. SOARING BIRD laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a bid. SHADY EMPIRE dueled for the lead along the
inside, but was headed by an outer vying rival at the five sixteenths pole and gave way through the final furlong. TIZ OF THEE bobbled a bit at the start,
pursued from midpack in the four path and faded around the turn. SPEND BENJAMINS raced towards the rear in the three path, got floated to the seven
path by an inner rival at the quarter pole and failed to factor. CAN'T HUSH THIS tracked in the two path, chased turning for home and faded.

Footnotes
TIWANAKU set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one around the far turn, gamely clung to an advantage as the battle prolonged through the
lane and narrowly won the nod at the wire. SAQEEL bobbled at the start, pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, sparred through a long duel as the
battle sustained through the lane, but just missed. THE PRINCE'S SPUR stalked along the inside, chased the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, tipped
outside of them nearing the final sixteenth, but did not have enough to reel them in late. JR'S GIFT laid off of the pace in two path, retreated to trail at the
five sixteenths pole, yet sustained a rail chase through the lane to improve position. EMPIRESTRIKESFAST bumped with an inner rival at the start, tracked
two wide and between horses, chased from midpack around the far turn and lacked a bid. PROVE WORTHY rated at the rear two wide, took the far turn in
the four path and stayed on between horses to miss reaching a minor share. MY UNCLE LEON tracked three wide, chased around the far turn, got floated
outwardly by an inner foe in the final furlong and weakened. QUATERNION took contact from an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, then took
the far turn in the five path and failed to menace. TEN GAUGE laid off of the pace in the four to three path and faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
TSHIEBWE was put to a bit of tight quarters soon after the start, stalked the leading trio from the two path, ranged up in the three path to bid turning for
home, then drew off in upper stretch. ACTIVE DUTY bumped with an outer rival, lacked speed two wide, advanced turning for home before tipping four wide
entering the lane, and stayed on while changing on his left lead to gain place at the wire. CAFE RACER pursued from midpack along the inside, tipped three
wide turning for home, ran on to gain place in midstretch, but was caught at the wire. OWN THE FIELD bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked in
midpack two wide, then chased in the six path and between horses through the lane. ST. ELMO raced at the rear along the inside, swung to the seven path
turning for home while picking up stride, but leveled off. BOBWHITE BOBBY broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, advanced turning for home, tipped
two wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid between horses. ALILNALOT dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, led turning for home, but
proved no match for an outer bidder entering the lane and faltered. BLOCKED dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but faded at the five sixteenths
pole. FIGHTING BACK lacked speed two wide, but was herded out to th eight path nearing the lane and made little impact. SHADY DAREDEVIL dueled for
the lead three wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole and caved. AZTECA STAR chased in the four path, but weakened around the turn before being
eased through the lane.
