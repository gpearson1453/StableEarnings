pace two wide and was outfinished in a game effort. LIL RICKYS JEWEL stalked the pace three then four wide and failed to respond. ORLEANS STORM
swung wide and was no threat. MARVIN'S EXPRESS trailed, also swung wide and was no factor. PLAYING BALL well placed, was through after a half.

mild late rally between horses. HAPPILEA was hustled along, stalked the pace four wide and went evenly. T MONEY was no threat. FAHRENHEIT was no
factor. RESCUE FIVE dueled for the lead between horses two wide into the turn then was used up. TOMATO BILL pressed the pace along the rail and

right handed urging. MALICED was bumped, forced inward having her heels clipped soon after the start, stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in four wide
and was steadily gaining on the winner late. PULPIT'S PURRFECT away alertly, dueled along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. COMMAND
STRIKE bore in at the start bumping MALICED forcing that one inward, dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch and weakened late. SHEISTHEHERO
