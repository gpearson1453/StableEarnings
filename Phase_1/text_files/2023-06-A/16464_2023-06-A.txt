Footnotes
MY LEGAL BET rated nicely in the early stages, advanced outside of rivals heading to the turn and stalked the decent pace to the quarter marker, was
roused three wide into the drive, confronted ANGI'S THIRSTY nearing the furlong pole, took command inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the
late stages to prevail. MISS IVES took back off of the solid early pace, was a bit keen while behind rivals in the early stages, improved position on the turn
while two wide between runners, slipped to the rail leaving the quarter marker and came in a bit tight entering the top of the stretch, gained ground heading
to the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner in the final stages and ran on in the final sixteenth to secure second. ANGI'S THIRSTY broke
alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter pole, was confronted and overtaken by MY LEGAL BET at
mid-stretch, faltered in the drive and was outfinished for second, while holding for third. MOUNT MARY (IRE) forwardly placed early on, chased the solid
pace into the turn, ran in pursuit of ANGI'S THIRSTY to the quarter pole, was steered three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong
marker and weakened. LION'S LAIR lacked early speed, swung four wide for the drive and did not factor in the late stages. SONOMA DREAMING chased
the solid early pace, lost position on the turn while saving ground and tired in the stretch.

ELEGANCE CODE was forwardly placed in the early stages then took back to stalk the pace to the turn, advanced outside of rivals along the bend, vied for
the lead in upper stretch with LAURA BRANIGAN, battled with that foe to mid-stretch, wore down LAURA BRANIGAN in the final stages and kept to task in
deep stretch to prove best. LAURA BRANIGAN asked to show early speed and contested the pace into the turn, pressed WINSOME ROSE to the quarter
marker, overtook that rival then vied for the lead in upper stretch with ELEGANCE CODE, battled with that foe to the furlong pole, was not able to match
strides with ELEGANCE CODE in deep stretch and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for second. J AND M EXPRESS stalked the decent early
pace, advanced two wide on the turn and came within aim at the quarter pole, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace in the drive
and weakened, while well clear in the end for third. WINSOME ROSE was prominent in the early running, dueled for pace duties to the turn then took a
narrow lead into the bend, set moderate fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNCLE WALT was well placed in the early running, saved all of the ground while tracking the decent pace through the backstretch run, was roused three
wide into the stretch, advanced nearing the furlong pole, caught BOOMING BERNARDO nearing the sixteenth-marker, took command into deep stretch and
kept to task while on the left lead to prevail. BOOMING BERNARDO was prominent in the early running, ceded the early lead to HOWDOYALIKEMENOW
and stalked that rival into the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pace to the second turn, overtook the pacesetter leaving the quarter marker and
took command into upper stretch, was set down at mid-stretch, could not hold off UNCLE WALT nearing the sixteenth-marker, resisted into deep stretch but
was outfinished and held for second. BLUEGRASS RYDER allowed to settle in the early stages, inched closer along the backstretch run while outside of a
rival, was steered two wide into the far turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch, advanced at the furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch and just
missed for second while holding for third. DO IT FOR DAVE was crowded then bumped by MR MAKUNOUCHI at the start and was off slowly, was allowed
to settle in the early running, was coaxed along three wide into the far turn, mounted a five wide rally into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker,
closed willingly in the final sixteenth and missed for third. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace while
outside of a rival through the backstretch run, improved position two wide along the far turn, was asked for run three wide into the stretch, ran evenly while
within aim to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. MR MAKUNOUCHI was bothered at the start by a neighboring rival then crowded and
bumped DO IT FOR DAVE and was away slowly, spotted the field in the early stages and trailed through the backstretch run, raced two wide into the stretch
and did not factor. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW broke in a step at the start and bothered MR MAKUNOUCHI, was prominent in the early running and assumed
command into the first turn, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken heading to
the top of the lane and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
IRISH CORN was hustled in the early going and established the pace leaving the break, set fast fractions into the turn, extended the lead approaching the
quarter marker, opened to a clear lead into upper stretch while in hand, kept to task under steady urging to deep stretch and was ridden out in the final
stages to be much the best. THE BULLION BOMBER (IRE) was prominent in the early running and tracked the fast pace, chased IRISH CORN along the
turn, could not keep pace with that rival into upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive and held safely for second at the finish. HOT CHICKS
ONLY stalked the fast early pace, lost position on the turn while saving ground, tipped two wide for the drive, was outfinished for second and just held for
third at the wire. CHILLY WILLY chased the fast early pace, raced two wide between rivals into the turn, came in a bit tight entering the turn and steadied
slightly while between rivals, slipped to the rail into upper stretch and just missed for third at the finish. BIG DON'S SMILING chased the fast early pace, lost
ground three wide on the turn, could not keep pace in the drive and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TESORO took back off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the first turn while on a snug hold, was well placed through the backstretch run while
racing along the rail, came in a bit tight entering the second turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, angled four wide into upper stretch and rallied
approaching the furlong marker, vied for the lead at the sixteenth-pole, found another gear in deep stretch and drew away in the final stages. AMERICA
GREAT was forwardly placed in the early stages, attended to the solid pace through the backstretch run, ran in pursuit of JIMMY BLUE JEANS to the
quarter marker, chased that rival to mid-stretch, vied for the lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with TESORO into deep stretch
and was outfinished, while holding safely for second. JIMMY BLUE JEANS was sent after an alert beginning and dictated terms into the first turn, set solid
fractions through the backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, was set down nearing the furlong marker, came
under pressure nearing the sixteenth-pole, could not keep pace with TESORO into deep stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for
second, while holding for third. SEATTLE BOLD settled just off of the early pace, raced three wide along the first turn, tracked the solid fractions from the
two path through the backstretch run, slipped to the rail heading into the far turn, improved position at the quarter marker, continued to gain ground into the
drive, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and gave way. TARANTINO was unhurried in the early stages, tracked the solid fractions between rivals
through the backstretch run, was steered four wide into the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and lacked a final
response. CONUNDRUM was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, inched closer heading to the far turn,
raced three wide to the quarter marker and gained ground nearing the top of the lane, was steered five wide into the drive, could not sustain his bid in the
stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MISS UNION was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the fast pace from a two wide path into the turn, kept attendance to DOLCE GHOST to the
quarter marker, chased that rival into upper stretch, ran in pursuit to the furlong marker, responded to urging nearing the sixteenth-pole, drew to even terms
with DOLCE GHOST in deep stretch, surged in the final strides and just held for the win in a blanket finish. CANDY'S CLONE stalked the fast early pace
while outside of rivals, raced three wide along the turn, lost position into upper stretch, shifted to the right lead inside of the furlong marker and re-rallied,
finished well in deep stretch, came within aim of the leaders in the final strides and just missed for the win, while getting up in time to secure the place.
DOLCE GHOST was asked to show early speed and was sent to the lead, carved out solid fractions while well handled through the turn, quickened in upper
stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, held foes at bay to deep stretch, battled gamely against oncoming rivals approaching the finish and was
caught in the final strides for the win and place, while just holding for the show. BLUE WILDCAT stalked the fast early pace while on a tight hold, saved
ground along the turn, came in a bit tight nearing the top of the lane, found room in upper stretch, rallied inside of the furlong marker, came within aim of the
leaders inside of the sixteenth-pole and just missed for third. SEEMS LOGICAL was away a step slowly leaving the break, recovered to chase the fast pace
heading to the turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and closed willingly in the
final stages. ZAZEN was keen in the early running, came in a bit tight nearing the half-mile marker and took up, was still a bit hard to place entering the turn,
chased from the rail along the bend, tipped two wide for the drive, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed well in the final stages, encountered traffic
in deep stretch, waited behind horses inside of the sixteenth-marker and was not able to make a late impact.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI MIST broke alertly then conceded the early lead, stalked the decent pace into the first turn, kept attendance to the pacesetter through the
backstretch run, gained ground along the second turn, made a steady advance on SHE'S SO SHINY in upper stretch and confronted that foe at the furlong
marker, took command inside of the furlong pole, kept to task to deep stretch and drove clear in the final stages. SHE'S SO SHINY showed good early
speed and dictated terms into the first turn, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, had the lead cut into a bit along the far turn,
came under pressure nearing the furlong pole, could not match strides with SHANGHAI MIST approaching the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished in deep
stretch and just held for second. DRESS REHEARSAL settled just off of the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, was well placed heading to
the far turn, saved all of the ground to the quarter pole, chased the leaders into upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and just missed for third at the
finish, while clear in the end for third. ESCAPE FREE (IRE) unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground to the second turn, was steered two wide
heading to the quarter pole, was roused four wide into the stretch, found her best stride late but could not impact the leaders in deep stretch. LIAM'S
SECRET settled off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, came two wide into the backstretch run, lost position heading to the half-mile
marker, chased from the inside along the second turn, was steered three wide into the stretch, offered a mild rally in the final stages but did not factor.
PACIFIC ZIP settled outside of rivals in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, mounted
a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain that bid into the stretch and gave way. STATEFOREST settled off of the early pace while in the
second flight, advanced along the backstretch run and tracked the pace to the far turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the
stretch run and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ON RAGLAN ROAD off a step slow, quickly seized the rail and the lead going into the first turn, led the field through moderate fractions with a couple of
stalkers to the outside, quickened going into the far turn while still maintaining the advantage, was set down passing the quarter pole, had plenty left to hold
the field at bay and won by widening lengths. CLASS CODE held up through the first half mile while tracking a few lengths back in the two path, waited until
the about the five-sixteenths marker to launch a bid, had to wait for room, fell back to last, tipped four wide into the stretch then rallied strongly with a late
surge to get up for the place. CHIEF JACKSON stalked the moderate pace three wide to the far turn, went to challenge the leader with three furlongs to run,
loomed a big threat turning for home and ran on well but was unable to catch the winner while getting tagged late for second. SYNC saved ground early,
raced mid-pack down the backstretch, began to improve position heading into the turn, awaited room to the top of the stretch, had clear run turning for home
but was unable to muster the needed rally. GORDY'S BOY stalked just to the outside of ON RAGLAN ROAD to the far turn, struggled to keep up as the
pace quickened near the five-sixteenths marker, ran on somewhat evenly to the end but was outfinished by several in the final yards. POUR ON THE COLE
lacked speed, went three wide into the first turn, remained wide down the backstretch, swung out five wide for the stretch run and ran on a little but was
never a threat. PHANTOM DROP close up early but four wide through the clubhouse turn, launched a bid under heavy pressure from the three-sixteenths
pole then weakened in the final furlong.
