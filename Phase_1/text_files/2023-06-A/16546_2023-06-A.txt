STREETSTER sprinted clear early on and held a clear lead through the stretch run and a strong hand ride. FURIOUS AVENGER was coaxed along early
from the outside of rival racing two deep and was no match for the winner in the drive. ELUSIVE FREUD chased the early leader from the inside and had
not enough. IRA CHAMP was off slowly, raced near the inside and raced evenly with no closing bid. JEANO dropped back early, raced five wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a bid.

RIGGED RIGHT chased the early pace, made a strong bid four wide near the quarter pole, angled in thereafter and proved best under strong handling.
CURIOUS IRISH dropped back off the early pace, loomed three to four wide through the far turn to take aim and missed in a game effort. OKLAHOMA
MOON settled early on, raced three to four wide and had not enough for the top pair. ARCH OF SWORDS raced mid pack early, saved ground and had no
rally. EASTER JIM showed good early foot between horses and faded. SHINE JACK'S DREAM pressed the pace from the inside and faded. J BOB pressed
the early going three wide from the outside of foes and faltered.

Footnotes
MRSG'S LIL DREAMER raced four wide around the first turn chased the early pace, raced from the outside in the stretch and got up under strong handling.
GODDESS OF WONDER press the early pace between, led late and gave way grudgingly late. RAINING coaxed along early, made a strong bid three wide
at the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. BOUJEE BRITT pressed the early pace from the inside and weakened late. SHAWK'S LIL AVA settled
off the early pace, raced three to four wide and lacked a rally. BROWN LIAISON dropped back early, saved ground and never was a factor. ZATANNA Z
raced far back and never threatened.
