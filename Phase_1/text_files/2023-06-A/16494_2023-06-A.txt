Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS went to the front to an unchallenged pace through the final turn then was challenged down the stretch by outside rival, fended off the
challenge and prevailed. COMMAND POINT tracked the leaders from the two path down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn, engaged
leader at the top of the stretch and dueled in the drive, couldn't overtake the leader and proved to be second best. NO NANNETTE NO raced in the middle
of the pack down the backstretch, had traffic entering the final turn, moved out to two wide on that turn then moved inside and slipped through going into the
stretch but was empty and was best of the rest. EMBARRASSING was unhurried around the first turn then steadily advanced on the inside down the
backstretch, ran into traffic going into the final turn and moved out to two to three path on the final turn, tipped out to five wide in upper stretch to make a late
run to improve position. SPENDER was allowed to settle down the backstretch then made a mild two wide bid on the final turn, moved out to six wide in
upper stretch but only passed tiring rivals. ZANDREA'S was rank going around the first turn, saved ground throughout but was never a threat. NORTHERN
ALLIANCE was off the pace to the middle of the final turn and gave way. CELESTIAL SPIN stalked the pace from three wide down the backstretch then
made a mild bid on the final turn but lacked a late response and dropped back.

ACT A FOOL was restless in the gate before the start, then went to the front going into the first turn to set the pace, held that position to the top of the
stretch and pulled away to be a clear winner. FAMILY TRADITION tracked the leaders down the backstretch from the two path, made a three wide bid on
the final turn and chased the winner home to be second best. MILLARD'S SMILE settled off the pace down the backstretch then made a mild rail bid on the
final turn but lacked a late response. ROCKET HOTSHOT was off the pace in the two path down the backstretch then dropped back on the final turn. ICE
BLAST settled at the back not far off the pace but never made a bid.

POWER THROUGH was hustled along to press the pace from the two path around the first turn then fell back slightly to be off the pace through the final
turn, engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and drew clear late. SIMPLE LOGIC was off the pace through the final turn then angled out to three wide in
the stretch but couldn't catch the leader and proved to be second best. DANCE SOME MO went to the lead into the first turn then inched away on the
backstretch, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly to be a clear third. LORING PARK raced near the back around the first turn then
steadily advance down the backstretch but failed to menace and was best of the rest. SON OF GRACE was allowed to settle down the backstretch then
made a three to four wide bid on the final turn and improved position. MODIFIER stalked the pace around the first turn then dropped back on the
backstretch and was not a factor. ANDREW THE GIANT was unhurried down the backstretch then made a rail bid on the final turn and hung. SLAVA
UKRAINI saved ground down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the final turn but was not a threat.

AWESOME WILLY sprinted to a clear lead to set the pace throughout and was kept to task in the stretch drive. POWERFUL MAN stalked the pace down
the backstretch from three wide then made a three or four wide bid with three furlongs left, took aim at the leader at the top of the stretch but was too late
and was a clear second. FLASHY RICHIE raced back down the backstretch then made a rail bid to be along for the show. UNCLE NICK raced in the middle
of the pack around the first turn then made bid from between horses and passed tiring rival in the stretch. CHOCOLATE BUNNY had the early foot to be off
the pace and held that position through the final turn and gave way. PIRATE BIRD raced back down the backstretch, moved out to five wide in upper stretch
but failed to menace. BLOOMING GARDEN was four wide into the first turn then tracked the leaders to the top of the stretch and faded. EGOMANIAC was

Footnotes
BEE A WINNER raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then moved up the rail on the backstretch, split horses at the top of the stretch and
drew clear late. LOTTA ROSES was roused away from the gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch then made a bid at the three eighths pole and took
the lead at the top of the stretch but couldn't fend off the closer but held the place. TEXAS PRINCESS tracked the leaders from the middle of the pack then
made a rail bid on the final turn, moved out tor four wide in upper stretch to save the show. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY went to a clear lead to the three eighths
pole then was challenged and matched strides to the top of the stretch and weakened. PRETTY IN PRADO rushed up to track the leaders to the middle of
the final turn and tired. LIL CARRIE D was taken back in the early stages then was unhurried down the backstretch, made a three or four wide bid on the
final turn and improved position. TWICK OR TWEAT raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch from the two path then saved ground around the
final turn but failed to menace. THIS IS ANFIELD was never a threat. MY JO JO was reluctant to load, then off a step slow and remained back. PRADA'S
MIRACLE was off a step slow, then was allowed to settle around the first turn, moved up the rail on the backstretch and flattened out.
