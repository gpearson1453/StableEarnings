Footnotes
MOMENT TO SHINE was well placed early and made a inside bid off the turn, drew clear and then maintained a safe margin late to prove best, driving.
SWEET LITTLE LISA was bumped both sides at the start, then was forced very wide on the turn, then shifted in off the turn and closed well up the inside to
be getting to the winner late, tough trip. ANGEL EXPRESS dueled for the lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, but weakened the final
furlong, bested rest. WILDWOOD ENOUGH was slow into stride, settled and advanced on the inside on the turn, steadied nearing the quarter pole, then
finished with some late interest. TU ROYAL dueled for the early lead towards the inside, then got out badly on the turn, weakened.

FIRST KITTEN was away alertly and got to the inside to set a pressured pace, then was challenged on the turn, repelled that bid and kicked clear to prove
best under left handed crop urging. SAMARITA pressed the pace and made a three wide bid to vie for command but flattened out, held place award. LONG
TALL WOMAN was rated along on the inside, angled out in the lane but had no kick. RACEDAY ATTIRE chased the early pace four wide, shifted in and
was two wide on the turn but lacked the needed rally in the lane. SEAWARD shifted out shortly after the start to be wide while trailing, advanced on the
outside on the turn and came widest into the lane and had a belated rally. WAY TOO SMARTE was on the inside early, shifted out on the turn and came
four wide into the lane and had no rally. AUNT STELLA was between rivals early and stopped.

Footnotes
GOOD MONGOLIA was well placed early and saved ground on the turn, angled off the inside when straightened, then was between rivals making a bid,
then dug in gamely and proved best late, driving. GO STORMIN GIRL was allowed to settle on the inside, swung three wide off the turn while making a bid,
bumped with a rival nearing the furlong marker, then fought it out with the winner but was outfinished, missed. RARE ACTION ATTACK was reserved early
and guided to the inside, saved ground on the turn and finished well up the inside and gained the show award late. FIRST SQUADRON set a pressured
pace on the inside, then vied for command off the turn and faded late, lost show award late. APRIL'S GEM was alowed to settle early, inside into the lane
and angled out in mid stretch and had a belated rally. STACY ATTACK pressed the pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn, then was bumped by
the furlong marker and was empty. GOTTA B KITTEN ME was reserved three wide early and lacked a rally. PLAY TWENTY chased the pace on the inside,
swung out four wide leaving the urn but was empty in the lane.

EASY FAST set a pressured pace early on the inside, then shook clear on the turn, then remained clear in the lane under mild right handed crop urging.
WILDWOOD MINISTRY pressed the winner two wide and proved to be no match for that rival while keeping on to be clearly second best. BLACK RAVEN
was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and was up for the show award on the inside. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS chased the early pace three wide,
two wide on the turn and weakened in the lane. AMBER EDGE was off slowly and then was not a factor.

Footnotes
SON OF GRACE was reserved early, shifted to the outside on the turn and advanced four to five wide, came six wide into the drive and closed well on the
outside to get up in time, driving. BAKENEKO stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid and drew clear leaving the turn, but was denied late to
just miss. DYNABLUE tracked the early pace on the inside, was shuffled back on the turn, angled off the inside in the lane and finished willingly, won bob for
the show award. IOYA AGAIN was reserved early, saved ground on the backstretch, shifted out for racing room on the turn and advanced four wide, angled
in nearing the furlong marker and finished well up the inside late to just miss the show award. MITZRAYIM set the pace on the inside and was headed off
the turn and weakened. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS was settled early, four wide pursuit on the backstretch, shifted to the inside on the turn and had no late
rally. BIG BLUE was settled in the three path early, then made a three wide move on the turn and was in between rivals but faded in the drive. MALIGATOR
was settled back early, made a five wide middle move and was four wide on the turn but weakened. DRAMATIC KITTEN chased the pace three wide and
tired. DIAMOND DAVE showed little.
