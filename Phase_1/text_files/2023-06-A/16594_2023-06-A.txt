ANAAMY away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid one out from the rail entering the final
turn, angled in to avoid getting carried out leaving the turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to prevail. NO PEOPLE away well and
tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three
wide in the drive to get up for the place. VALERIE VALESKI broke sharply and raced to the lead while racing two wide entering the backside, controlled the
pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was collared entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late. ROSE OF TEXAS hopped at
the start to get away slowly, and trailed the field entering the first turn, began to advance midway down the backstretch, saved ground at the rail entering the
final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. SKY FACTOR tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing
two out from the rail, began to lose touch with the pacesetters in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

BAK TO LIBERTY hopped at the start, but easily assumed command in the run to the first turn while racing just out from the rail, controlled the pace in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, turned back a bid by MAGIC ROAD leaving the final turn, and drew clear in the lane while under confident
handling to prove much the best. MAGIC ROAD away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn to loom a threat, but was no match for the winner late while proving clearly
second best. TONTO missed the break to get away slowly and trailed the field into the first turn, advanced three wide through the turn to gain a tracking trip
entering the backstretch, struggled to keep tabs on the pacesetter entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the pacesetter while racing
two wide entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and was never seriously threatened late. INDYGOGOLD unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, eased into the two path entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for the
place in the closing strides. AMANDA away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to just miss the place. ALOBRAH rushed up from along the rail to assume command passing the wire the first
time, controlled the speed into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, battled from the inside of LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND entering the final turn,
was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and faded in the late going. KAY'S KITCHEN away well and stalked the leader into the
backstretch, continued three wide from a stalking trip entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong while finishing five wide in the drive.

BELLAROO away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from just off the rail entering the final turn,
and closed two wide in the drive to prove best. THE KAT'S BACK away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the
pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a solid effort. ZETAMARIE settled off the early pace while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide for the drive and closed willingly to
garner a share. JERSEY LILLIE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide
entering the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival while drifting four wide entering the lane, and was outfinished late. QUEEN OF LOVE
settled at the back of the pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from
the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. IMA DAREDEVIL stalked the early pace into the backstretch while racing two out from the
rail, rallied three wide from a tracking trip entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. IRISH LUNA stalked the early pace while racing one out from
the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to hold her position midway to the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon in a dull
effort.

Footnotes
LUCKY FORCE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, battled two wide from the outside of
ROCKCLIFFE entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and held off a late charge from LEGACY SQUARE to prevail. LEGACY
SQUARE was pushed in at the start and squeezed slightly from between rivals to get away sluggishly, settled off the early pace while racing two out from
the rail entering the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed with late interest three wide in the drive to get up for the place while gaining
ground late. ROCKCLIFFE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled through the final turn from the inside of
LUCKY FORCE, was unable to keep tabs with that rival entering the lane, but battled determinedly through the lane to garner a share. TIME TICKER settled
off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly one out from the rail in
the drive. ARISTOCRACY away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, steadied while running up on heels in the
run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. ACCIDENTAL HERO settled off the early pace while
racing four wide in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon.

AIR FORCE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and held off a late surge from ABOVE AVERAGE to prevail. ABOVE AVERAGE tracked the dueling
leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide to split
rivals entering the lane, and closed determinedly to just miss. KEY TO SUCCESS tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, advanced three wide midway down the backside and collared the leaders entering the final turn, and battled willingly four wide in the drive to garner
a share. FORCE TO REKN WITH away well and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the
inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from just off the rail in the drive. NEIGHNEIGH away alertly and pressed the pace from the
outside of AIR FORCE entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn,
was unable to keep pace with that rival midway through the turn, and weakened in the late stages. FREESTYLE settled at the back of the pack while racing
one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced three wide in the run to the final turn while racing into a stalking position, rallied two out from the rail
entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon.

STAR FINALITY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, pulled her way into a tracking trip behind the dueling leaders
approaching the final turn, bided her time through the final turn while awaiting racing run, slipped through along the rail in mid stretch to take command and
draw clear late. DRILL BABY DRILL settled off the early pace while racing mid pack entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
closed willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place in the closing strides. SHE'S ON FIRE away well and pressed the pace from the outside of
LILSISTERLEE entering the backstretch, continued to force the pace two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner
a share. LILSISTERLEE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backside and through the final turn, was overtaken in mid stretch, and was outfinished late. STRIKING VALUE settled off the contested early pace while
saving ground entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted five wide midway through the turn, and
finished evenly five wide in the drive. HARBOUR STORM lagged well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. OKANAGAN GOLD was squeezed soon after the start, and took
back to last, was always well back and failed to make an impact. BETTER WITH TIME broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing three wide
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.
