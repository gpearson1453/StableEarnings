BUY LAND AND SEE was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, drew clear by the quarter pole, then widened the margin off the turn and was given one
pop with the crop and then was ridden out to prove much the best, sharp. YOU MUST CHILL was rated three wide early, then shifted to the inside and
saved ground on the turn, tipped out leaving the turn but proved to be no match for the winner, second best. CRISPER was allowed to settle early, came
four wide into the drive and had a mild rally. MIDNIGHT HAULER was reserved early, made a three wide middle move nearing the three eighths and then
weakened. DEE JAY was inside into the first turn, then shifted off the inside entering the backstretch to stalk the winner two to three wide and then
weakened by the quarter pole. LACCO AMENO showed no speed and then failed to menace. TRENDING UP chased the early pace and tired.
