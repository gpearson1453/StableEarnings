Footnotes
CALL ME ANDY bumped with an inner rival soon after the start, recovered and advanced to an inside tracking position entering the turn, took aim on the
clear leader two wide entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage entering midstretch, then inched clear in the final sixteenth before holding
safely from an inner rallying rival late. TOP OF THE STREET saved ground off of the pace, offered a rail rally in the final furlong, quickly closed in on the
leaders in the late stages, but ran out of ground. SONOFASHIP set the pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and
lost place to an inner foe late. HAILSTORM chased in the four path and outside of rivals while within striking range around the turn, but was outmoved by an
inner rival entering the lane, ran on evenly while in pursuit through midstretch and lost place an inner rival in the final sixteenth. LOU'S LEGACY bumped
with an outer rival early on, laid off of the pace in the four to five path and lacked a bid. CARD TRICK broke slowly before shifting inwardly, then trailed in the
two path and made little impact. HIGGINS BOAT pressed the leader from the three path, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
LUPO'S LEGACY set the pace along the inside, drew off entering the lane and was driven home to seal the deal. MAGNIFICENT MILE stalked along the
inside, took aim outside of the leader entering the lane, but only managed to chase that one and proved second best. BOURBON FEVER broke a bit slowly
before drifting outwardly, laid off of the pace in the four path, then stayed on while delaying his lead change until the final sixteenth. LOTS OF MISCHIEF
laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to menace. PHILHARMONIC spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the start, saved ground while trailing, then
surpassed tired outer rivals in the final furlong. FORGE IN FIRE chased three wide but faded turning for home. CHITWOOD pressed two wide but
weakened after being floated three wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
PLATINUM GHOST took contact from rivals on either side at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe around the turn, inched clear of that one in
midstretch and held firm. THE BIG MOZZ brushed an outer rival while off a step slow, improved to an inside tracking position into the turn, tipped outside of
the leading pair entering the lane, took aim on them from the five path in upper stretch, but only managed to chase the clear leader through the final furlong
while hanging on his left lead and gained place late. MONCRIEF stalked three wide, pressed two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the
leader at the furlong grounds and lost place to an outer foe in the final sixteenth. CREPE YARNS was slow early on despite breaking towards the front,
lagged behind in the two path around the turn, then stayed on well with a rail rally through the lane. TEXAS TED laid off of the pace three wide around the
turn, fanned to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. LITTLE STEVEN tracked four wide and outside of rivals early on, chased three wide under
urging around the turn and gave way. DAVID'S TUITION lacked speed three wide and faded in the four path around the turn. SCAT DANZ bumped an inner
rival at the start, pressed two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position entering the turn, then weakened on his left lead through the lane
and was eased up through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAMP HOPE laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to reel in the new leader at the sixteenth pole and
edged ahead. GRAY'S FABLE saved ground off of the pace, took closer order entering the lane, split the leaders leaving the three sixteenths pole to drive
clear at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer bidder a sixteenth from home. HOZIER settled far back along the inside, trailed between horses
entering the far turn, took that bend at the rear in the two to three path, got floated to the nine path entering the lane, yet rallied willingly outside of foes to
gain show in the final sixteenth. GREYES CREEK laid far back two wide, swung to the eight path entering the lane and stayed on between horses while
hanging on his left lead. PLAY ACTION PASS tracked along the inside, loomed a danger from the pocket behind the leaders around the far turn, tipped to
the four path to take aim entering hte lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch and chased between horses after flopping back to his left
lead at the furlong grounds. GENTLE SOUL trailed along the inside, saved ground around the far turn after moving out of last, then improved two wide in
upper stretch, but flattened out along the rail in the final furlong. ENGLISH BEE pressed two wide, vied around the far turn as outer rivals applied pressure,
led entering the lane, but was headed by an inner bidder leaving the three sixteenths pole and weakened between horses in midstretch. TRADEMARK
stalked three wide, pressed into the far turn as an outer rival forced his hand, but gave way turning for home. STITCHED set the pace inside of a prompting
foe, vied with that one around the far turn, but got headed entering the lane and weakened. CADDO RIVER pursued from midpack in the three to four path
entering the backstretch, moved forward to press outside of the top trio entering the far turn, sustained striking range around that bend, but weakened in the
five path and between horses in upper stretch.

PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE stalked along the inside, muscled his way outside of the top pair while inside of rivals at the three furlong pole, bid turning for
home, struck the front in upper stretch and drove clear. COOL RAGS trailed, ranged up five wide while circling inner rivals around the far turn and ran on to
gain place in the final sixteenth. CARMICHAEL vied for the lead two wide, led around the far turn, but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch,
yielded and lost place late. RAM stalked in the three path, inched closer between horses in the four path around the far turn, but gave way in upper stretch.
PRODIGIOUS BAY vied along the inside, but faded turning for home and was vanned off post-race.

Footnotes
FRIGID LADY stalked outside of the top pair, ranged up turning for home to bid in the five path entering the lane, gained an advantage in upper stretch,
drove clear entering midstretch and desperately lasted from an inner bidder late. PIGALLE bumped the gate while off slow, settled towards the rear in the
two path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, tipped inwardly before rallying between horses in the final furlong, bid inside of the leader in the closing
stages, but narrowly missed. NEED SOME MONEY lacked early speed, gained in the four path around the turn, took aim in the six path entering the lane,
but only managed to chase thereafter while not having enough to reel in the leader. GHOSTLY GIRL tracked along the inside, altered course two wide
approaching the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. PACHANGA LOCA set the pace along the inside, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch
while hanging on her left lead, changed over in midstretch, but weakened through the final furlong. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY pursued from midpack two wide,
took the turn in the three path, turned for home between horses and failed to menace. CHARLEE MAE laid off of the pace, retreated to trail in the five path
around the turn and failed to factor. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY pressed two wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole and was eased up through the
lane.

Footnotes
PRO OXIDANT bumped an inner rival at the start, vied along the inside, backed off to stalk his outer counterpart around the turn, tipped two wide to take
aim on that one from the outside entering the lane, pursued well through midstretch while inching closer, then drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole and
edged ahead. RADICAL RIGHT vied two wide, gained an advantage into the turn, showed the way turning for home, dug in to resist an outer challenger's
bid leaving the furlong grounds, but was bested by that one entering the final sixteenth. CHASING TIME transferred contact from an outer foe to an inner
rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path into the turn, fanned five wide entering the lane and stayed on well to prove best of the rest. DIVINE
LEADER laid off of the pace in the three path, inched closer turning for home before spinning into the lane four wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival
while leveling off in midstretch. HOWLING TIME raced at the rear while held up behind traffic in the two path around the turn, spun into the lane in the four
path, tipped out five wide in midstretch for clear sailing and moved up. BAGBOSS took a brush from an outer rival soon after the start, saved ground off of
the pace, but to no avail. TULANE TRYST tracked two wide and between horses, but gave way. MISTER MMMMM tracked outside of foes early on, applied
pressure tucking three to two wide around the turn, but weakened after being floated three wide again entering the lane.

Footnotes
HIDDEN PATH pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, gained an advantage from an inner BLUE DEVIL entering the lane, but shifted in and bumped
that one in upper stretch, exchanged a pair of more bumps with his inner counterpart while sparring in midstretch, battled gamely between horses through
the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed. BLUE DEVIL set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed by that one entering the lane, took a bump from
him in upper stretch while sustaining a duel, battled into midstretch while exchanging contact twice once again, fought on gamely through the late stages,
but just missed. UNLEASH THE POWER bumped with an inner rival before before steadying out of crowded quarters early on, saved ground off of the
pace, improved inside of foes down the backstretch to track from the pocket around the far turn, tipped outside of the embattled leading pair entering the
lane, sustained a grinding gain to offer a bid in the final furlong, but was kept at bay. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD saved ground far back, improved inside of
foes in upper stretch, shifted four wide entering the final sixteenth and offered a good late kick but ran out of ground. MAASAI WARRIOR bumped with an
outer foe while put to tight quarters before taking up early on, trailed two wide, saved ground around the far turn, rallied strongly along the rail through the
lane, vacated it in the final sixteenth and belated surged between the leaders at the wire. POLICY OPTION pursued from midpack along the inside, steadied
entering the backstretch, lost position between horses approaching the far turn, then was shuffled back while fading turning for home. SANTORINI stalked
three wide, chased within striking range around the far turn but gave way once floated four wide in upper stretch. GAMER pursued from midpack three to
four wide, fanned five wide entering the lane and yielded. HE'S A ANGEL laid off of the pace two to three wide around the first turn, then in the four path
around the far turn and failed to menace. PLAUSIBLE DENILE tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but checked nearing the backstretch,
retreated to the rear in the three path entering the far turn and failed to factor. SAM STORMY tracked two wide and between horses, but steadied around
the first turn before shifting three wide, and faded between horses around the far turn. A LA CARTE stalked along the inside, but was surpassed by an inner
rival at the half mile pole and weakened between horses around the far turn. THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF BLUE DEVIL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF HIDDEN PATH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
