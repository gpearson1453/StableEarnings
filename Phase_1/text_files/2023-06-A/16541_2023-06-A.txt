Footnotes
PRICELESS PICTURE stumbled badly start, inside run turn, steadied, ran on clear. under vigorous urging to the wire OHIO LADY chased leader to the turn,
took over in the stretch but outgamed to the wire. DESDEMONA KAY bobbled at the break run up to turn split horses no match to top pair. HEIDI'S
SHADOW outside run to turn, three wide into stretch faded back readily. SUPER SCAMP outside run to turn while never a threat and dropped back readily.
APPALACHIAN SPIRIT sent to the front from inside, overtaken turn and surrendered.
