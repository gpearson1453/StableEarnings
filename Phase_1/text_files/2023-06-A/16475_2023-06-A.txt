Footnotes
MISS SAN GABRIEL took over early while about two wide and was nicely handled while dealing with a very rank rival to her inside, was joined soon into the
backstretch by NEGRA GATA, handled pressure from that one to about the five sixteenths, spurted clear under some nudging soon after, kicked away
under a steady hand ride in mid stretch, wandered outward, was corrected with a right handed ask a sixteenth out, kept on under a hand ride and held firm.
DETERMINED EMPIRE angled out entering the first turn to avoid the rank rival, stalked off the inside, was put to pressure as the leaders got away leaving
the far turn, raced two wide advancing in upper stretch and continued willingly to the wire. SILLY LILY , bumped and in tight at the break, recovered and
settled in last, rated behind foes heading to the half, angled out and made a four wide under urging into the lane, straightened away and churned on.
NEGRA GATA , bumped at the break, prompted the pace three wide outside the winner, was under a ride pursuing into the stretch and weakened in the
final furlong. CAROLINA HIDEAWAY broke outward bumping with a rival, stumbled then was a bit rank through the opening furlong, saved ground off the
pace, angled out around the final turn but lacked a serious response. DON DIVA , bumped and in tight at the break, raced off the pace while about three
wide and lacked a punch. STARTERS ORDERS , bumped at the break, settled off the pace, raced between runners into the far turn and faded.
DETERMINED STELLA broke outward bumping a rival which in turn caused a jam up, rushed up inside then steadied along when very rank through the
opening five sixteenths of a mile, stalked towards the rail into the far turn then retreated.

Footnotes
GOD IS LOVE grabbed command early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined leaving the three eighths, lost the lead into the lane, battled back to
reclaim the lead nearing mid stretch, kicked clear, drifted a bit and held sway while kept alert. SOROLLA , unhurried early, raced behind foes into the far
turn, swung five to six wide for the drive, advanced outside runners past mid stretch and continued willingly to just nab the place. TAPIT BRIO hopped the
break, quickly recovered and moved up to a forward position, stalked between runners near the half, eased out and gained three to four wide into the lane,
gave hard chase leaving mid stretch, kept on to be the closest pursuer past the sixteenth pole but was nipped for second at the wire. BAIL OUT , well placed
stalking inside, eased out for the drive but came up empty. TIZ TACT TOE , off the pace and between runners leaving the far turn, altered in working
through some traffic and continued willingly to the wire. PURSUING PACE , allowed to settle, saved ground near the three eighths but lacked a rally.
LIGHTNING LAD , bumped at the break, raced three wide nearing the half mile pole, shifted wider for the drive but lacked a bid. MOSLEY NATURAL ,
bumped at the break then steadied when in tight, was taken four wide early, gained three wide in hand into the far turn, bid three deep near the five
sixteenths, took over into the stretch, failed to sustain in mid stretch and weakened. QUINCANNON prompted the pace two wide, battled briefly between
foes near the five sixteenths, failed to kick on entering the lane and faltered.

Footnotes
ADMIT NOTHING , three wide entering the first turn, moved to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, stalked the pace, eased out to the two path
turning for home, split horses near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. CATCHING STARS prompted the pace outside CORRECTED PEDIGREE, gained a
short lead entering the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened late. SUCCEED , three wide entering the first turn, trailed down the backstretch,
swung four wide leaving the far turn and passed tired foes. CORRECTED PEDIGREE set the pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong.
TOAST TO COAST caught in some traffic on the first turn, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, remained
on his left lead in the stretch and failed to rally. MODERN SOCIETY was not a factor.

COMMUNITY ADJUSTED rated forwardly while saving ground, tracked the battling trio leaving the three eighths, sat chilly in the clear past the five
sixteenths, edged up into the lane then worked through an opening along the rail, kicked clear a furlong out, moved way under aggressive hand
encouragement past the sixteenth marker then was geared down a touch in the final yards. SURYA settled off the pace while saving ground, continued
towards the rail into and through the lane and finished with good energy to claim the place. TIC TIC TIC BOOM , three deep past the five eighths while not
too far back, was put to urging as the leaders got away from her exiting the far turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and came back on in willing fashion.
MISS DELICIOUS prompted the pace three wide outside rivals, was urged chasing in upper stretch but lacked a finishing punch. CASHING BIG CHECKS
took over early and set the pace towards the rail, was hounded by a pair of foes leaving the far turn came off the inside holding a tenuous advantage into the
lane, failed to resist the winner's inside bid near mid stretch and gave way. DRY WELL , firmly rated while saving ground early on, was coaxed along around
the final turn, swung out near mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on. SILVER CURRENCY , between runners past the five eighths, was urged along
leaving the far turn but failed to respond. DOUBLE FIREBALL pressed the pace outside CASHING BIG CHECKS, lacked a response entering the lane and
gave way.

Footnotes
WUDI stalked the pace outside HOLLYWODLAND down the backstretch, engaged that one leaving the far turn, dueled through the stretch and narrowly
prevailed. HOLLYWOODLAND , taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace, dueled inside the winner through the stretch and just missed.
APPEALINGTOTHE EYE , three wide the first turn, was unhurried outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, challenged for the
lead outside the top pair in upper stretch and continued gamely. CONNIE'S DANCE , inside horses on the far turn, was in hand waiting for room in mid
stretch, eased off the rail and steadied when blocked approaching the finish. BELLA PALOMA , fractious during the post parade, steadied when rank on the
first turn then was rank in a crowd leaving the backstretch. HAINT BLUE lacked speed, raced three deep on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch.
BROOKLYN GIRL stalked the pace racing along the inner rail and gave way after six furlongs. ITALIAN WAR CRY stumbled at the break and trailed.

Footnotes
LINNY KATE broke a step slow, dropped in early and settled, was angled out for the backstretch run, edged up three wide into the far turn, tracked patiently
leaving the five sixteenths, responded when put to stout asking and engaged rivals from the outside in mid stretch, wrested command inside the sixteenth
pole and drew clear late. CHELICHNA , three deep early, prompted the pace outside foes past the five eighths, moved between runners to take a slim lead
in mid stretch, battled inside the winner past the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE rated off the inside
while not far back, was kept in as the winner moved past her heading to the far turn, worked outward to be four wide in upper stretch and steadily gained.
NICOLAR rated inside, lightly steadied off heels near the far turn, swung widest for the drive, ranged up a bit past mid stretch then hung. DAILY PLANET
took command between rivals around the first turn, moved clear past the five eighths and set a soft pace, came under pressure in upper stretch, battled
inside foes in mid stretch then gave way. BETCHA BY GOLLY prompted the early issue inside rivals then was steadied back off the lead nearing the
backstretch, continued to steady along, stayed in range to about upper stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
FREEZE THE FIRE sped to the lead leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, was challenged in mid stretch then
asserted himself and drew clear. DILLINGER broke alertly, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide, advanced to mid stretch and
flattened out. BOX N BEN , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, failed to menace the top pair and gained the showed position. DONEGAL
DANNY , three wide on the turn, failed to rally. MARGIE'S FUN SON , forced in by ISRAELI ARMY leaving the starting gate, swung very wide in the stretch
and passed tired rivals. CHILDERS broke in the air and steadied lacking room approaching the sixteenth pole. JOLLY BY GOLLY lacked speed, was four
wide leaving the turn and gave way. ISRAELI ARMY bore in leaving the staring gate, chased the pace two wide around the turn, gave way and was eased.
