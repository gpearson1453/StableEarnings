Footnotes
DANVILLE stalked the pace from the three path, moved up from three wide going into the final turn then engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and
drew off. GLOBAL EMPIRE was allowed to settle down the backstretch, saved ground around the final turn then moved out to four wide in the stretch to
make a late run and was second best. BEEALEA tracked the leaders from the inside while advancing down the backstretch and around the final turn, angled
out to three wide into upper stretch but lacked a response in the stretch but was a clear third. TROY OUNCE went to the front and took a clear lead while
setting most of the pace, was headed nearing the top of the stretch and gave way. ASTI SKY prompted the pace down the backstretch from the two path
then was in tight nearing the three eighths pole and dropped back.

TRIPLE CHROME hopped and rubbed the gate at the start spotting the field many lengths, made some gain around the turn from off the rail then drifted out
in the stretch to be out in the three or four path and rallied to be just up in an all out effort. IRONMAN RICHIE was rushed up to be off the pace, continued to
move up from three wide on the turn and engaged the leader in early stretch and dueled down the stretch to take the lead in the final yards but was nailed
by the late closing outside rival. BOURBON TEDDY sprinted to a clear lead around the turn then dueled down the stretch and gave way grudgingly. TEA
AFTER BALLET chased the leaders from off the rail around the turn, was out to three or four wide in upper stretch and just passed tiring rival. SPEEDY G
was hustled along the rail to prompt the pace to the turn then dropped back.

PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) dueled for the early lead on the backstretch then inched away entering the turn, drew clear in mid turn and was kept to task in the
stretch. CHROME ATTACK chased the leaders down the backstretch, moved up while saving ground around the turn then moved out to three or four wide
in upper stretch to make a late gain on the leader and proved second best. STARS ON FIRE (IRE) was rushed up to vie for the lead from three wide on the
backstretch, ran into traffic entering the turn when trying to drop to the rail and had to steady slightly, angle back out to three or four wide into the stretch to
make a late run in the stretch to be up for the show. NO KAY NEVER (IRE) was hustled along to be off the pace from three wide then moved up on the turn
but was out finished in the stretch. MOVE IT BABY was slightly restless in the gate before the start, tracked the leaders from the inside around the turn then
moved out to four wide into upper stretch then drifted in and proved to be the best of the rest. SHE'S WANDAFUL raced near the back and was not a threat.
CRYSTAL SNOW raced at the back on the backstretch then moved up from three wide on the turn and tipped out to six wide in upper stretch but didn't
make a rally. I DON'T KNOW MARGO was roused to the front to prompt the pace to the turn then slowly faded. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER was roused to be
forwardly place while racing wide then lacked a late response in the drive.

Footnotes
DRAGONERA went to the front to take a clear lead on the first turn, set all the pace, challenged on the final turn, dug in in early stretch and drew off. TAR
HEEL GIRL was hustled along to be off the pace from the two path around the first turn, fell back on the backstretch then made a rail bid entering the stretch
but couldn't gain on the leader but was a clear second. PASTA SALAD RHONDA broke in and bumped inside rival at the start, was allowed to settle down
around the first turn then slowly advanced to the final turn, started a three wide bid midway through the turn tipping out to four wide in the upper stretch and
made a late run to be up for the show. COTTON CANDY ANNIE saved ground around the first turn then was slightly rank entering the backstretch, was
allowed to settle through the turn, made a late inside rail bid in the stretch to be best of the rest. SUNSET PAYNTER was rushed up to be close to the pace
on the first turn, engaged the leader midway through the final turn and weakened. LORRAINE'S LEGACY bobbled at the start, moved up to stalk the pace
from the three path down the backstretch, engaged the leader midway through the final turn but couldn't match strides and gave way. DESSERT FIRST
hopped and was bumped by outside rival at the start then raced near the back around the first turn, advanced down the backstretch from the two path then
moved out to three wide in upper stretch and ran into traffic in mid stretch and dropped back.

BORN AGAIN GEORGE sprinted to the lead from the inside then was engaged midway through the turn and dueled to deep stretch and inched away to
prove best. MUD ISLAND was rushed up from three wide and engaged the leader midway through the turn and dueled to mid stretch, drifted out but held on
for the place. KING TITO prompted the pace from the two path to the turn then fell back around the turn, dug back in late to save the show. DEVIL'S RULE
had a slow start, saved ground through out and improved position in the stretch. TAPIT SAM chased the leaders from three wide through the turn and
gained late. D'FEVER tracked the leaders from off the rail then moved out to four wide in upper stretch but was empty. RESTORING HOPE had no speed
and was not a threat.

ALL CHOKED UP went to the front to set the unchallenged pace throughout and drew off in the stretch. WOLF HUNTER tracked the leaders while saving
ground through the final turn then moved up the rail in the stretch to be second best. EVEN THE WIND saved ground down the backstretch while racing in
the middle of the pack then made a two wide bid on the final turn, moved out to three wide in the stretch and fought gamely to be up for show. MONEY
AGENT was off the pace on the inside through the turn and weakened. ELECTRIC CHARGE saved ground to no avail. GOLD SMOKE was unhurried and
not a factor. GOING AT IT was allowed to settle in the middle of the pace but never made a bid. MINNESOTA MOON was off the pace in the two path
through the final turn and gave way. COOL AND COLLECTED was allowed to settle and never a threat.
