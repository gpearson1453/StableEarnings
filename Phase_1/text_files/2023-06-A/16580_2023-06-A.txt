O'BABE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole
and kicked clear. SAVONA led the way through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the two path around the bend, could not go with the winner in the
final furlong and kept on to the finish from there. ROYALS' LIL DIVA raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and finished
evenly. THORN CROWN was away from the gate a bit slowly, rushed up the press the pace on the outside, dueled from the three path around the turn and
weakened in the lane. CHAPARRITA trailed the field through the opening stages, came around the bend in the three and four path and made no bid.
