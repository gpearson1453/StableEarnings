GEHRIG unhurried early, closed rapidly four wide through the stretch, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack by the runner up through upper stretch,
made the lead late and drew clear. MR LIGHTNING BOY stalked the early pace, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead entering the stretch,
drifted out to the eight path under left handed urging then couldn't handle the winner. PAT DADDY close up from the start, swung widest of all, angled inside
the top pair near the furlong marker and went evenly. KHALFANI failed to menace. UHAVETOBEKITTENME dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch
then gave way. TUFF ATTACK matched strides for the lead along the rail for a half then stopped.

PRACTICAL MAN prompted the pace three wide into the turn, gained a narrow lead near the quarter pole, drifted to the six path and proved best in a stiff
drive while fully extended. AWESOME ENOUGH close up from the start, rallied four wide through the turn engaging the winner at the top of the stretch,
drifted to the seven path and finished second best. UNCLEJACKOMO trailed early then had a mild late rally in the three path. GOLD HERITAGE offered a
mild bid near the inside approaching the quarter pole then weakened late. MASTER away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside for nearly a half
then was used up. MURTAGH pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and gave way on the turn.
