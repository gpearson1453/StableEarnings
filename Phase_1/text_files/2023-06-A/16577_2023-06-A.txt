Footnotes
LOVE TO SHOP settled comfortably off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final
furlong, closed strongly to get the lead approaching the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under steady urging. SPUN SPECIAL settled just off the pace,
drafted in the three path going around the turn, shifted four wide while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued the leader under a drive into the final sixteenth and
proved no match for the winner late while willingly earning the place. OOLONG HAI (IRE) went to the front, showed the way with company to her outside,
vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths, held a clear lead under a drive into the final furlong, was overtaken by the
winner coming to the sixteenth-pole and weakened then lost the place while just able to get the show. RIVIERE was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, moved up on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased the leader to the sixteenth-pole and just missed the show. ROMAN
GODDESS bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was rated just off the pace between foes, traveled around the turn in the two path, was asked for her
best in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. ROMEINADAY settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed
to threaten. ACCEPT THE OUTCOME (IRE) moved up after the start, stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, chased the leader under
a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. QUIESCENT pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, vied in the two path
on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. CINDYLOUWHO was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced off the pace while inside of
an opponent, was taken up outside the five-eighths then checked sharply while traveling very erratically, continued erratic into the turn, dropped from the
four path to the two path going around that bend and was no factor. ADVANCE ATTACK was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, raced on the
outside while ridden along, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. AVALANCHE IS COMIN broke a step slow, was reserved towards the back, came
under urging while three then four wide on the turn and failed to respond. GET RESPECT bumped soundly with a foe at the start, was rated just off the pace
on the inside, saved ground on the turn and retreated.

LISA'S VISION three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying in tandem with WEEKEND RAGS to over throw the leader a furlong out, dug in dueling to the finish and gamely prevailed on the wire. SILVER
SKILLET chased just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining and angled five wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive surging inside the final seventy yards and missed at the end while just up for the place honors at the finish. WEEKEND RAGS forwardly
placed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, rallied in concert with LISA'S
VISION to take command a furlong from home, dug in knocking heads to the finish but was ultimately denied at the end while also just getting nipped for the
place honors. SOLIB grew a bit fractious just prior to the start, then tossed her head at the break and got away near the rear of the field conceding five
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. ROYAL DANCER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and got roused
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared just outside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.
U SHOULD B DANCING chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
LADY OF THOROTON off to a hesitant start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out eight wide into upper stretch, had
no rally. I'M NERVOUS NOW four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
GALLEY HEAD chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. I'MHAVINGAMOMENT chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ELITE POWER settled off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, rallied quickly to the lead into upper
stretch, kicked clear outside the eighth-pole, was given one pop of a left-handed crop into the final furlong, maintained a clear advantage while kept to the
task into the final sixteenth and proved best under a hand-ride to the finish. ANARCHIST brushed the inside of the gate at the start, moved up after the start
then settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail near the three-eighths, moved back to the two path late on the turn, shifted out while asked
for his best near the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner on the outside into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage for the place. STROBE
stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead briefly at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. TODAY'S FLAVOR went to the front, showed the way down the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper
stretch and gave way. FEARLESS dropped back while urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. SYNTHESIS settled off the pace, passed the five-eighths pole under some restraint, checked at the nine-sixteenths and lost position, moved from
the rail to the two path at the three-eighths, shifted four wide late on that bend and capitulated.

Footnotes
EMMANUEL was reserved at the rear of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a
left-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead, swapped to the proper lead while making a bid outside the sixteenth-pole and got up late to prevail
under strong handling. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) went to the front, showed the way with an uncontested easy lead, raced inside on the turn, responded well
when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led determinedly into the final sixteenth, fought on well to the finish but was
denied while able to get the place. CHEZ PIERRE (FR) was hard held while tugging keenly on the bit for the opening three-sixteenths of a mile, moved
outside the leader near the three-quarter pole, stalked that opponent under restraint, went around the turn in the two path, made a bid at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into the stretch, reached even terms with the leader in upper stretch, fought under a drive in the final furlong and missed while just able to
get the show. ANACONDA was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths, moved up under tight restraint outside the three-quarter pole, was rated off
the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, chased the leading duo under a drive with an open gap between them
into the final furlong, dropped in when that hole closed at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the trifecta. DREAMS OF TOMORROW was
reserved under solid restraint, moved from the hedge to the two path on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. EMARAATY (GB) was reserved on the outside under a snug hold, tucked into path nearing the turn, shifted three wide while
roused near the five-sixteenths then was driven four wide into the stretch, dropped back around the furlong marker and came up empty.

Footnotes
CARAVEL came away in good order, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path going around the turn, took over while set
down in upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole and held sway under strong urging. BIG INVASION broke a
bit awkwardly, was reserved under a tight hold, traveled two then three wide going around the turn, shifted four wide while asked into upper stretch then
moved further out, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished with good energy to just get the place. CASA CREED settled off the pace, was
roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and finished willingly but was caught for the place while able to
get the show. DR ZEMPF (GB) settled off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, waited in the three path from the quarter-pole to inside
the three-sixteenths, was asked outside the furlong marker then moved a bit more and finished willingly to just earn the last spot in the superfecta.
NOTHING BETTER was hustled to the front, moved in while showing the way, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) settled in the back half of the field, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, shifted
out in upper stretch, moved further out near the furlong marker and improved position. ARREST ME RED settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn,
was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FRONT RUN THE FED was last into stride, angled in at the rear, raced inside for
most of the turn then moved to the two path, angled out in upper stretch and improved. YES AND YES was bumped at the start and forced in, settled near
the back, went two then three wide on the turn and showed some late energy but failed to impact. THIN WHITE DUKE raced near the back of the field, went
three to four wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. COPPOLA settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn,
dropped back six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. AIR FORCE RED was rated just off the pace, brushed with a foe near the half-mile pole,
rounded the turn in the two path, chased under a drive into the final furlong and came up empty. GO BEARS GO (IRE) broke in and bumped with a rival,
was rated just off the pace on the inside, brushed with an opponent near the half-mile pole, drafted along the hedge on the turn, raced behind foes in upper
stretch, dropped back readily into the final furlong and had nothing left. SURPRISE BOSS was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then
four wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and capitulated.

CODY'S WISH broke in at the start a step and was corrected, chased just off the inside under a light rating hold near the rear of the field, began to tip out
three wide at the nine-sixteenths before making his way four wide half a mile from home under a firm grasp to maneuver outside rivals and steadily made
his way to be five wide three furlongs from home, advanced in the clear under his own power and then came under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths,
unleashed a five wide sweep to command taking over at the quarter pole, before spinning five wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to the eighth
pole and was under vigorous hand urging to the finish. ZANDON coaxed from the gate, chased five wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while hooking up in head to head combat through the
final sixteenth with WHITE ABARRIO running on to gamely claim the place honors on the wire. WHITE ABARRIO stumbled forward at the start getting away
second best while recovering, tucked seven then six wide while vying for the front and crowded REPO ROCKS into HOIST THE GOLD when tucking over
seven and a half furlongs from home forcing both rivals to take hold, settled six paths off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing tucked
three wide at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to knock heads through the final sixteenth with the
aforementioned foe to his inside but was ultimately bested on the wire while clear for the show honors. CHARGE IT got bumped at the start while under
coaxing by HOIST THE GOLD, who broke outwards, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced bidding five wide into upper stretch, then stayed on one paced through to the finish making no late
headway. DR. SCHIVEL vied from the four path early on with a trio before emerging to show the way narrowly six furlongs from home, tucked to the two
path near the nine-sixteenths and was displaced from the front by HOIST THE GOLD, backed away to be just off the pace coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, angled three wide for home and weakened in the drive. SLOW DOWN ANDY vied from the three path early on among a quintet latched on
before prompting the pace of the aforementioned foe along the his inside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and joined HOIST THE GOLD along the rail
now applying pressure to that foe as the early leader backed away, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
prominent, couldn't sustain the momentum and weakened through to the finish. REPO ROCKS coaxed from the gate, vied briefly and got bumped and
forced to steady after making contact with HOIST THE GOLD when WHITE ABARRIO tucked over in front with seven and a half furlongs to go, chased
three to four wide, tucked inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. HOIST THE GOLD coaxed from
the gate, vied briefly from the six path before being bumped and steadied at the seven and a half furlong marker by REPO ROCKS as WHITE ABARRIO
tucked over from the outside in front, applied pressure six then five wide before advancing to take command nearing the nine-sixteenths tucked three wide,
showed the way through the turn under pressure and coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and was overhauled
by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, then tired in the stretch. DOPPELGANGER broke a half a beat slow when hesitant at the start, chased three wide
under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed.

came away at the rear of the field, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved near the middle of the field, traveled around the far turn in the two path,
bumped with a foe outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty. SO HIGH (GB) was rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, was driven

ARCANGELO saved ground just off the top pair into the first turn and lost some position into the backstretch tipping three paths off the inside, advanced
mildly to regain what was lost seven furlongs from home settling back to be just off the pace once more, began another small advance five furlongs out and
tucked inside with nine-sixteenths to go, was given a nudge midway on the turn and bid to be on near even terms with five-sixteenths remaining, traded a
small bump and brush with NATIONAL TREASURE at the quarter pole before seizing command straightened away in the inside route into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, then began to drift out through to the finish seven paths despite being flashed the crop to the right side along
with an active left rein but held safe even though giving away ground to the end. FORTE just off the inside through the first turn, raced four wide in pursuit
from mid pack down the backstretch, tipped out five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing and being flashed the crop to the right side when drifting
slightly at the three-eighths pole, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and offered up a mild kick closing belatedly to just get up for the place honors in
the final jumps. TAPIT TRICE away last without incident, came under coaxing and chased just off the inside through the first turn before tipping five to six
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide at the nine-sixteenths and commenced a bid on the front stacking outside a trio just off the leader
at that station, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in offering up a mild bid but was collared in the final strides for the place. honors and forced to settle
for the show. HIT SHOW four then three wide through the opening turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the top pair, tucked
three wide into the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths between rivals among a quartet just off the leader, got nudged by ANGEL OF
EMPIRE to the two path at the three-eighths, tipped three wide at the head of the stretch and kept on to dead heat with his main rival at the finish. ANGEL
OF EMPIRE coaxed from the start, raced five then four wide through the first turn before tipping six paths off the inside down the backstretch, briefly tucked
five then four wide into the far turn, came in three wide three furlongs from home and nudged HIT SHOW to the two path when placed to coaxing at that
station, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to dead heat at the end for the last major share. NATIONAL TREASURE forwardly placed from the
start, raced three wide into the first turn latched on the early leader to the outside, took over command with a mile and three-sixteenths remaining and tipped
to the four path down the backstretch settling in hand into a comfortable rhythm, tucked briefly three wide before taking to the two path into the far turn,
came under challenge from a quartet half a mile from home and patiently fended them off awaiting greater challenge, got one to his inside when
ARCANGELO bid with five-sixteenths to go and was called upon in response, came in slightly at the quarter pole trading a small bump and brush with his
main danger, yielded the front straightened away and steadily weakened to the finish. IL MIRACOLO just off the inside through the first turn, chased along
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into
upper stretch and tired. RED ROUTE ONE four then three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and through the far
turn under urging from the seven-sixteenths, cornered four wide at the top of the stretch and was eased home to the finish. TAPIT SHOES coaxed from the
gate, established the front and showed the way briefly from the two path until headed for command with a mile and three-sixteenths to go, chased forwardly
placed along the inside of NATIONAL TREASURE through to the nine-sixteenths, retreated thereafter and continued just off the inside into upper stretch,
then got eased home to the wire.

Footnotes
SPIRIT OF ST LOUIS swerved in then was taken up at the rear at the start, settled towards the rear, paused while going by the injured foe inside the
seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, drifted in while gaining fast outside the furlong marker then took
the lead and drew away under steady handling. CLEAR CONSCIENCE bumped with a rival at the start then ducked in, steadied then dropped back behind
a rival while saving ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, steadied briefly to avoid an injured foe leaving the backstretch, moved from the rail to three
wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, was carried in by the winner nearing the furlong marker then was guided with extra right-rein pressure and
proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. LET'S GO BIG BLUE ducked in at the start then was taken up, settled on the inside,
steadied leaving the backstretch, moved closer on the far turn, held a good striking position into upper stretch, waited while blocked outside the furlong
marker, was roused at that marker and finished willingly to just miss the place while up for a share of the show. KING OF COMEDY went four then three
wide under restraint while pulling on the first turn, tracked the pace under a hold, ranged up four then three wide on the final turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker and proved no match then lost the place while
able to save a share of third. BARREL OF QUESTS rounded the first turn in the three path, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn,
chased into the final furlong and tired. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT went around the opening bend in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground
on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, was taken in hand while dropping back coming to the furlong marker and weakened. MIGHTY ATLAS bumped
with a foe at the start then dropped back while taken up, went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn and lacked the
needed response. CURLY LARRY AND MO went three then two wide on the first turn, set a joint pace on the inside of a foe, vied inside on the far turn, was
urged into the stretch, dropped back outside the furlong marker and gave way. SELL SOMETHING bumped with an opponent at the start, raced three wide
on the first turn, settled off the pace, checked then swerved out to avoid the injured foe leaving the backstretch, steadied briefly around the three-sixteenths
and was no factor. STOP THE SPREAD bumped with a rival at the start, dropped back in the three path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went
five then four wide on the far turn and capitulated. SHPILKES went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, checked sharply and swerved out to avoid
the injured rival into the turn, reached around the seven path before dropping back to the four path late on that bend and was eased but walked off.
EXCURSIONNISTE came outward at the start, tugged on the bit under restraint while five then four wide on the first turn, set a joint pace on the outside,
suffered an injury leaving the backstretch and was pulled up then euthanized on the track.
