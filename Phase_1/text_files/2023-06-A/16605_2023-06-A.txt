Footnotes
CASUAL ENCOUNTER pressed the pace while racing outside, assumed command on the turn and drew off in the drive while kept to task. MISS ABILITY
bobbled at the start, was slow early, bid six wide leaving the turn and closed to earn place while no threat to the winner. HALEY WHO raced in the back,
shifted out along the backstretch, bid five wide and got up late for show. ARTFUL ROSE was crowded and checked past the gap, stayed close, bid and
came up empty late. RESTLESS MOVER broke slowly and was crowded at the start, was unhurried early, swung wide leaving the turn and closed well.
SOCIAL CLUB came in past the gap, led to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. SHADOW JUMPER raced close to the pace inside, was
crowded and steadied past the gap, awaited room on the turn and lacked a stretch response. STORMING PEACE broke in, was crowded and bumped past
the gap, stalked to the turn and gave way. UNBRIDLED DIVA showed good early speed, was crowded and bumped past the gap and was through early.
Following a stewards' inquiry, SOCIAL CLUB was disqualified and placed ninth for causing interference on the backstretch.

Footnotes
FRANKS DEHERE raced close to the pace along the inside, got through along the rail on the turn, assumed command, inched clear and held under
pressure. REINING PESOS pressed the pace four wide, challenged between horses on the turn, fell back into the stretch, continued willingly to the wire and
didn't have enough late. DECK HUMOR pressed the pace while racing five wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, swung out entering the stretch, fell
back and settled for show. MR. SILVER EXPRESS dueled to the turn, weakened in the drive and faded from contention. FULL OF DRIVE was void of early
speed, saved ground to the turn, advanced to get within striking distance and hung late. JUVAL dropped back quickly, raced outside and failed to menace in
an outside trip. QUANTICO JOE was not a factor. HOT CHARLIE pressed the pace to the turn, fell back, angled out and stopped. STYLE BENDER dueled
to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
NONAME BANDIT dueled throughout and prevailed in a long drive. DISCOVERY N SIGHT was snatched up at the start, fell far back, dropped inside and
steadily advanced along the inside, got through along the rail on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outnodded in a game effort.
SMARTSREALGOOD was taken up at the start, held a good position, challenged four across entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire and didn't have
enough late. MONIKER vied two across, fell back in the upper stretch and went evenly late. JET SET WARRIOR raced mid pack in an even effort and failed
to threaten. CRYSTAL WHO was never far back, lacked a stretch response and was outrun. REMEMBER SIXTYTWO trailed the field and was vanned off.
