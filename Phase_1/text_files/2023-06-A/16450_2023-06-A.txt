Footnotes
NO WHAMMIE stalked near the rear just off the fence down the back straight, started her run three wide outside rivals on the turn, had clear running room
widest in the five path turning for home and got up just at the wire winning the bob in a close compact field finish. AMERICAN GAMBLE was shuffled back
on the rail to be in midfield at the half, regrouped angling out three wide midpoint on the turn, rallied four wide straightening out for the drive and finished
strong just missing the nod in a close photo for the win in the end. OLD SECRETS did not have the early speed of the other rivals and was allowed to settle
trailing the field in the beginning, saved ground inside on the turn, started a run on the fence in upper stretch shifted to the three path finding a seam and
determinedly split runners to be involved in the win photo in the end. GREEN GABLES chased just outside in the early going, bid three wide at the top of the
lane, began to creep away from the field at the sixteenth pole and was caught by the closers just before they hit the line. SPANISH BEAUTY took the field
into the turn, continued to set the fractions on the turn, was collared outside turning for home and faded inside in the very late stages of the race.
SYSTEMATIC chased on the rail down the backstretch, was nestled in behind the frontrunner through the turn, tossed her head and appeared to take a
misstep inside the quarter pole and shifted outside three wide for the stretch drive only to come up empty running to the wire.

Footnotes
NATIVE PRINCE settled nicely three wide in the middle of the pack entering the first turn, advanced smartly three wide down the back straight, bid for the
lead outside midpoint on the final turn and drew away easily through the lane for the comfortable win. UNILATERAL was compromised at the start being
pinched on the break, trailed the field down the backside, continued to see the field running on the far turn, angled out five wide at the top of the lane and
closed well to get up late for the place share. PAPA'S PLACE prompted the early going just outside, took control taking the field down the backstretch, was
headed by the winner with five sixteenths remaining, offered little resistance and faded late losing the place share nearing the wire. REDOUTE'S LIGHT
settled near the rear outside in the early stages of the race, was scrubbed on for more three furlongs from the prize, made little headway, angled four wide
for the drive and passed tired runners in the lane. BLOCKBUSTER sat on the rail watching the top pair in the first turn, settled in midfield between runners
through the backside, offered a mild run three furlongs from the line and finished evenly down the lane. THELONIOUS lead the field on the fence into the
first turn, lost position inside to be in midpack at the half, could not gain on horses through the final turn and was a non factor to the wire. TARADAR broke
inwards to start, tracked the front duo into the first turn, chased the pacesetter down the backside, was ridden between rivals midway on the far turn, could
not keep up and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was in hand having a good inside position tracking the top engaging pair through the turn, slipped through on the rail to lead at the
quarter pole and stubbornly prevailed to the finish. STRIKING HEIR settled near the back of this compact field still not too far from the pace entering the
turn, found a seam in the two path offering a bid at the top of the lane and needed more between runners late to be a threat to the winner. COMMANDER
TOM had a slim lead outside runners with a half remaining, was floated six wide in upper stretch contesting for the lead, battled to the wire but had to settle
for a clear third finish in the end. BEND IN THE RIVER pressed the issue between rivals at the half, could not match strides with the other competitors for
the lead four wide at the quarter pole and gave way in the final eighth. FIFTH SEASON broke out at the start, hit the gate to trail considerable down the
backside, could not recover through the turn and made no impression running to the wire.

FORESTER HUMOR was in a good spot tracking on the rail in the second flight down the backstretch, advanced sharply on the fence with two furlongs
remaining, swung outside four deep in upper stretch and closed strongly to get up in time. ALLEN DIGGS led the field down the back straight inside,
continued to set the fractions running on the turn, still led the field at the furlong marker, drifted out through the stretch and was caught by the winner shortly
before the wire while still narrowly holding for the place share in the end. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN was void of early speed and could see the field down the
backside, started to rally from last on the rail to be seven wide turning for home and was full of run late just missing out in the three horse photo for the win
at the finish. HARDWARE GAP was away poorly soon after the start, recovered to have a good position down the back straight sitting just outside in the
tracking flight, was on hold with three eighths to go watching the runner in front of him navigate the turn, angled to the four path for the drive and had no
finish to the wire. PRINCE SUSSEX pressed the pace two wide at the half, was getting out chasing the frontrunner on the turn, drifted to the six path in
upper stretch and retreated in tight quarters between rivals at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
ANGELOU broke inwards to begin, assumed the lead with ears pricked into the first turn, loafed along alone upfront down the backside, continued
unchallenged into the far turn, was finally asked for run at the quarter pole, quickly opened up and coasted home in the final furlong. EPHRATA (GB)
travelled three wide into the first turn in midpack outside, was on hold four deep down the backstretch waiting to move, rallied outside runners on the far turn
three wide, was floated out entering the stretch to the six path for the drive and finished up closing well to be the clear runner up in the end. SILVER
MAGNATIZED was content sitting off the soft pace set by the lone speed winner at the half, was nudged along midpoint on the far turn, was angled out five
wide at the top of the lane and levelled at the furlong marker losing the place share. BUTTERED TOAST was squeezed at the start, trailing into the first turn,
was still travelling at the back of the pack with four furlongs left to run, made little impression on the leaders running on the far turn but passed a straggler at
the five sixteenths pole for a minor share. WHO SAYS settled near the rear on the rail in the early going, took closer order to the leaders while in hand inside
with a half left to run, was hard ridden to keep pace with rivals three eighths from the finish and had nothing to offer through the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT RESERVE led the field on the rail down the back straight, opened up comfortably on rivals through the turn and pulled away even more down the
lane for the easy victory at the finish. KID MARVELOUS chased the speed at the half, could not match strides with the winner on the turn losing ground to
him and finished up with intent to hold safe for the place share at the wire. CELENTANO was taken back soon after the start trailing the field in the early
stages, began picking up runners three wide at the quarter pole, angled out to the five path continuing a strong closing finish and just missed getting up for
the runner up share in the end. BEE BEE THE KING was three wide stalking in midfield down the backstretch, put in a mild turn of foot three wide with five
sixteenths remaining, was in the hunt for a small reward turning for home and was one paced to hold for a minor role. IMPERIAL STAR was urged on the
rail in midpack running into the turn, lost ground to rivals on the fence with five sixteenths from the wire and could not get involved running to the finish.
TAZMAN settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, was scrubbed on between foes at the three sixteenth marker and made little impact in the drive to
the wire. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #5 CELENTANO AGAINST #6 KID MARVELLOUS AT THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
SEA TO AIR led the field down the backside, was running comfortably setting pace on the turn, was roused at the top of the lane and drew away under left
handed urging in mid stretch. CRUMLIN LAD stalked four wide in the early going, was taken a hold of briefly around the five furlong pole, circled four wide
around runners with three eighths to go and finished up closing in the five path to garner the runner up placing. RAT PORTAGE angled in to track three wide
outside with four furlongs left to run, chased in vain the speed frontrunner through the turn making no gains and weakened in the final furlong losing the
place award. FOUR K FORCE had a good spot behind the leader on the rail at the half, offered little run inside on the turn and finished evenly to best the
rest for a minor placing in the end. MR. MARSHALL chased in the two path down the backstretch, could not keep up with horses on the turn, was shuffled
back some and levelled off in upper stretch. GIZMO'S MISSION was away slowly due to the gate not opening up properly trailing the pack, recovered to be
