STREET ART was hustled out early, was encouraged to stay forwardly placed, shuffled back a bit into a stalking position, saved ground and raced on the
fence, shifted out at the quarter pole, was four wide and driving down the stretch, caught the early leaders in deep stretch, was encouraged and cleared
those two rivals as he drew away for the win. AUX ARCS was sharp out of the gates, vied for the early lead, shifted down into the three path, matched
strides with another foe and raced in a set, set the fractions and showed the way as a pair, battled past the quarter, eighth and the sixteenth poles, were
cleared by an outside closer within the last few strides, kept on with the momentum of the horse who passed on the outside and ended with second place
honors today. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE vied for the early lead, raced along the rail, was joined by another rival and co led, setting the fractions in a set,
continued a set into the stretch, matched strides and battled into deep stretch, the pair was cleared by the eventual winner, battled a few more strides with
the same foe he had been battling and just came up short, settling for third today. ALL OF US was between rivals early angled over towards the rail while
taking back a bit out of traffic, settled along the rail, raced off the pace, was in contention at the five sixteenth pole, drifted wide, raced seven wide in the
stretch and closed passing tired rivals. MARKETBOOK was forwardly placed early, raced in the two path while in between foes, stayed in the second tier
beside another foe tucked in behind the early leaders, found room in the stretch but had no late kick. PREMIUM vied for the early lead, raced six wide while
stalking the leaders, was encouraged and driven, was wide into the stretch and flattened out.. DRIVER showed little. NEVER OVER ME was never involved.

Footnotes
READY SHOES raced majority of the race two wide from the rail, stalked HUMOR ME PLEASE until the five eighths pole, then made a move going on the
outside around the second turn to take the lead and drew off. HUMOR ME PLEASE ran three wide the whole race, stalked CADILLAC COWBOY, then took
the second turn two wide off pace from READY SHOES. CADILLAC COWBOY broke out front quickly took to the rail and set the early pace along the rail,
then slowly faded coming out of the second turn, steadied down the stretch. SWEET PRESENT had a clean break, ran behind the pack on the rail didn't
have any kick to progress for a podium finish. THERE WAS A RIDER OBJECTION HUMOR ME PLEASE ON READY SHOES.

Footnotes
DOUBLE TRAP broke sharp, settled into a stalking position from the three path, stalked the early pace setters closely from the outside, launched a bid at
the three eighths pole, gained ground, improved position into the stretch, drew beside the early leaders at the eighth pole, was encouraged and hand ridden
past that set of foes and drew off late for the win. MESABI was out and forwardly placed early, raced just off the pace on the rail under a loose rein, saved
ground and closed up the rail, was encouraged in the stretch but was second best today. JESUIT raced mid pack inside of another rival, raced in the three
path while maintaining positioning, drifted out in the stretch, and had no finish. PRICED RIGHT vied for the early lead, raced in the two path wile showing
the way and attending to the pace, was challenged at the eighth pole by an outside attacker and and inside rival battled for a few more strides and tired.
DEPART was never involved. MADMARTIGAN made no impact. WEST TEXAS BOB was no menace. SUPER GEEK awkward start, trailed through out.
SUPER GEEK WAS PULLED UP AFTER THE WIRE AND VANNED OFF.

ORDER OF MERIT vied for the early lead, raced on the rail, had pressure from outside foes, was kept on point, cut the corner at the quarter pole stayed on
the rail, was encouraged with a strong right handed crop, drew off for the win. SEEKING SAWYER was mid pack early on, stayed on the rail while stalking,
was pushed to advance and be closer still on the rail and behind the early leaders, was in contention at the quarter pole, was still being encouraged, was
challenged by a set of outside foes, repelled those challengers and went on chasing after the eventual winner but to no avail. AHIMAAZ vied for the early
lead from the three path, pressed the pace, drifted out leaving the turn was challenged by an outside foe and had a rival to the inside racing on the rail, gave
way to the inside rival but out finished the outside challenger getting up for third. ZAICI raced mid pack, raced four wide advancing up on the outside, was
carried out a bit leaving the turn, was asked to close but hung in the stretch while struggling to switch leads. NATE'S WAY was sharp out of the gates,
settled off the pace, raced in between foes and tucked in behind the leaders, found room but lacked a late bid. WHEELS showed little. WINGS OF GOLD
