Footnotes
GRAND WISER was well rated on the inside, shifted out leaving the five sixteenths and made a four wide bid to take over leaving the turn, then drew off
under left handed crop urging to prove much the best. ECONOMIC POWER stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then was
headed in upper stretch and proved to be no match for the winner, second best. VOUCH was three wide into the first turn, then set the pace and moved to
the inside, headed on the far turn and weakened, bested rest. NIGHT OPS was settled back early, split rivals and was between rivals by the five sixteenths,
came three wide into the lane and had no rally. EVEN THUNDER was settled on the inside and failed to respond. RUNABOUT was settled three wide and
stopped on the far turn, eased final furlong, walked off.
