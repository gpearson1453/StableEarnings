Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MEADOW settled on the rail in midfield running down the backside, angled out three wide with five sixteenths remaining, loomed four wide
straightening out for the drive, took control at the eighth pole and was kept to the task holding off the closers at the line. WEST PAW had a good position
tracking the front duo down the back straight, waited patiently inside on the turn keeping a close eye on the leaders, rallied up the fence at the top of the
lane and finished up determinedly the final sixteenth just missing out for the win. MANITOULIN ISLAND trailed the field running on the rail in the early going,
advanced on runners inside throughout the turn, angled five wide turning for home and closed well outside just missing the place share in a tight photo.
CALL ME BROOKE prompted the early pace, tracked the frontrunner on the turn, bid three wide in upper stretch and weakened at the eighth pole settling
for a minor share. PRACTICAL GIZMO led the field through the backstretch, opened up some running on the turn, was swallowed up by runners on either
side at the furlong marker and retreated in the late stages. STORMY SUZIE stalked in midpack outside runners at the half, was roused just off the rail on the
turn, made little headway on rivals and could not get involved running to the wire. BLONDEONAMISSION travelled near the rear in the beginning, was hard
ridden to keep pace with three furlongs to go, offered no response and was not a factor in the stretch drive.

PLUS POWER took command with five eighths remaining, opened up while unchallenged through the turn and drew away when asked at the furlong
marker. FIRE EMOJI chased the leader down the backstretch, continued to be behind the loose front running winner through the turn and could not make
any gain down the straight to be a threat at the finish. HARD ROCK WARRIOR settled near the rear in the early stages, split foes rallying between horses in
the two path midway on the turn, angled out widest in the five path at the top of the lane and found her best stride late closing to be a solid third in the end.
LOOKINGFORTREASURE settled between rivals down the backside, battled with runners on either side for a share showing a brief turn of foot on the turn
and finished up evenly to the wire getting a minor role. MAKAYLA stalked in the third flight inside runners four furlongs from the prize, was ridden on the rail
throughout the turn keeping her inside position, was in the mix for a share in upper stretch and levelled off the final sixteenth. INFINITE PASSION had a
stalking position in the middle of the pack four wide outside rivals at the half, offered a brief three wide run at the quarter pole and tired with a furlong left
losing positions late. BLUEBERRY DOLL travelled near the back of the pack inside down the back straight, made little impression throughout the turn and
was never a presence running to the finish line. BOOMERANG was off slow inside trailing the field down the backside, caught up to runners on the turn,
angled six wide at the top of the lane and had little finish to give to the wire.

Footnotes
REMEMBERING RHODA settled near the rear in the early going, was well in hand waiting patiently inside on the turn, gamely shot up the fence in mid
stretch and was pulling away from her rivals crossing the wire. SILVER BULLET LADY broke inwards at the start, had a good spot watching the top trio
battle for the lead throughout the turn, found a seam in the two path in upper stretch and was outkicked by the winner in the final furlong. KNOW HOW (GB)
had a brief lead on the rail down the backside, put away two early challengers through the turn, opened up briefly at the three sixteenths pole and was
caught by the fast closing winner a hundred yards from the line. NORTHERN PASSAGE fought for the early lead between runners down the backstretch,
continued to press the issue in the two path midway on the turn, was in with a chance straightening out for the stretch drive and could only offer an even
finish in the final eighth for a small share. GOLD FORESTER watched the front threesome engage for the lead four furlongs from the line, continued to be
on hold between runners waiting on the turn, angled three wide for the drive to be in range for a share and offered little finish down the lane. SPEEDY ESSA
was rambunctious behind the gate prior to loading, hopped at the start to trail down the back straight, saved ground seeing the field on the turn and passed
a tired runner in deep stretch. UNABLE bid three deep outside for the lead at the half, lost ground to other pace setters through the turn racing outside, was
pushed out to the four path in upper stretch and tired six wide in the late stages of the race.

Footnotes
HONEY WON'T rated in behind the leaders racing inside, edged closer willingly late on the turn, moved out a bit turning into upper stretch, split foes past
the furlong marker and forged clear. DIXIE GIANT moved forward inside to force the pace on or just off the rail, was hounded through the turn, overtaken
inside the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but kept on to hold place. COMBATIVE was bumped at the break, moved forward between runners,
hounded the leader into and on the turn racing two to three wide, held show honors but needed more late. SAILOR'S PASSION bumped a rival at the start,
was forced in a bit early crossing the gap, raced near the inside off the pace, angled out seven wide in upper stretch, gained steadily on everyone but the
winner through the lane but was too late and missed third. AL HEYBAY stalked from between runners in the second flight, was up close turning for home but
failed to rally. HARD TO CAPTURE got away well, attended the early pace from outside, dropped back to race outside the second group into the turn going
three to four wide on that bend, failed to rally. WENJACK got away slowly spotting the field about five lengths, swung eight wide into upper stretch, was
never near enough to threaten. SEA SCOUT shifted in early but raced outside a rival in behind the leaders, swung seven wide for the drive, failed to rally.
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
STYLISH GENT broke sharp clearing outside to lead the field on the rail at the half, continued to set an honest pace being the loose front runner on the turn,
was unchallenged in upper stretch and was kept to the task to win comfortably at the finish. SOUP SPOON was steadied between runners soon after the
break, began picking up horses splitting foes at the three furlong marker, loomed the threat four wide at the top of the lane and finished up on the wrong
lead to the wire holding on for the place award. DRAGON'S KEY settled three wide outside in the second flight down the backstretch, was roused at the
quarter pole to go after the winner, chased inside to no avail through the stretch and lost the nod for second at the finish. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN travelled
three deep outside near the rear in the early going,, began to lengthen his stride around runners midpoint on the turn and was one paced through the lane
settling for a minor role. SCENIC HOLIDAY trailed inside at the half mile marker, advanced on the fence three eighths to the finish and showed some late
interest passing weary ones in deep stretch. SILENT LUCIDITY tracked the frontrunner on the rail down the backside, could not quicken with others on the
rail through the turn and was not involved running to the wire. FAST LANE watched the lone front speed with rivals on either side with a half mile remaining,
offered a mild burst of energy chasing the winner inside on the turn and yielded at the furlong marker. SUPER HEADLINE was unhurried three wide outside
near the rear down the backside, could not find another gear to make an impact on the turn and was not a factor in the stretch running to the wire.

Footnotes
STAR CANDY tracked the front pair on the rail in the beginning stages, slipped up the fence at the top of the stretch, took control inside at the furlong
marker and held safe to the wire. ZANA tracked the contesting duo two deep at the half, loomed four wide three sixteenths from home, was gaining slowly in
the stretch but could not threaten the winner in the end. GET OUT THE VOTE hopped at the start to trail four wide down the backside, continued to see
most of the field on the turn, straightened out for the drive and was full of run in the final sixteenth closing well to get up for third. CARA CARA quickly
pressed the pace outside down the back straight, took over the frontrunning with three eighths left to go, was clinging onto the lead entering the stretch and
faded inside in the late stages of the race. YORKSHIRE hopped at the break, travelled between runners in midfield in the beginning , was coaxed for more
run at the three furlong marker, shifted out to the six path turning for home and was never a threat running to the finish line. SUMMER SNOW was away
alertly to lead in the early going, surrendered the top spot with three eighths remaining inside, tapped on the brakes running on the rail twice on the turn,
shifted outside at the quarter pole trying to rebid and retreated between in deep stretch. TOP OF THE MORNIN broke sharply inside at the start, travelled
near the back after the poor beginning, advanced inside on rail through the turn and took closer order to rivals finishing up the fence in the stretch. MISS
BRIANNA stalked near the back four deep down the backside, was four wide on the turn losing ground to the field, could not contend at the top of the lane
and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
RESERVENOTATTAINED prompted the pace two off the fence in the early going, took over the top spot three wide at the eighth pole and stubbornly held to
the finish in a gritty performance. SUNSPEAR tracked widest four deep around horses into the turn, rallied three wide at the two furlong marker, shifted out
to the five path in upper stretch and battled gamely to win the duel for second money. DRAGON'S BREW was allowed to settle trailing the field down the
backside, started to move inside midway on the turn, rallied four wide angling out at the quarter pole, six wide for the run to the wire and lost the battle for
the place share. WESTERN TROUBLE settled in the two path between horses with a half remaining, was on hold with a tight rein running on the turn,
attempted to shift out for clear running room turning for home, could not get position, angled inwards at the furlong marker and continued to have traffic
problems in the late stages. HAPPYMAC lead the field down the backstretch and throughout the turn inside, was headed by rivals outside at the furlong pole
and gave way on the fence with a sixteenth left to run. FORESTER'S TURN was off slowly, recovered to sit behind the leaders on the rail at the half, waited
inside on the turn, lost his path at the furlong marker and could not regroup in time to be involved. JACK BEANSTALK was in the tracking foursome three
wide at the three furlong marker, was steadied, shuffled to last and could not recover enough to be a factor down the lane.

Footnotes
HUMOR ME JIM broke sharply, was encouraged to get forward position, pressed the pacesetter from outside, took a narrow lead past the quarter pole,
forged clear in the lane and was kept to the task. SUPER SICILY lacked early speed racing in the back half of the field, came out six wide in upper stretch,
finished strongly to secure the place. BURLAP chased from between runners, kept on in the stretch to get show honors. NOT A LOST CAUSE settled
mid-pack, advanced outside rivals four to five wide on the turn looming a threat turning for home but could not sustain the effort and evened out. HEKLA'S
AURA lacked early speed, swung seven wide into upper stretch, gained some but too late. VICTORIA ELIZABETH tracked from inside the second flight,
came out a path or two in upper stretch seeking room, kicked on evenly. SPEEDY BUBBLES coaxed forward, set a pressured pace inside, weakened in the
stretch. LOIS was outpaced early, angled out in upper stretch. MY ASSISTANT veered out just after the break, failed to threaten while racing off the inside.
FOREVER DANISH chased in behind the leading pair three to four wide, dropped back and faded.
