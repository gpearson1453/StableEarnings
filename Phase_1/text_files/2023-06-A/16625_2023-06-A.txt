Footnotes
BLOOD ORANGE unhurried early to be at the rear of the field, crept closer down the backside, unleashed a strong five wide rally in the turn to sweep to the
lead, cleared in upper stretch and drew off down the lane as much best. RIVER'S END was carried well wide in the first turn by rival, dropped inside that one
to stalk the pace down the backside, overtook the pacesetter turning for home but was immediately passed by the winner and kept on gamely to be second
best. GOLD MEMORIES rated in mid-pack comfortably within striking distance, well positioned to make his rally at the quarter pole and lacked a late
response when called upon for the drive. LA VALEDORA reserved off the pace to settle in mid-field, saved ground while rallying along the rail and made up
ground late. THEHUNKSCLASSYLADY moved up in the first turn to take the lead down the backside, set a pressured pace to the head of the lane and
weakened down the stretch. RON'S LAVENDER went evenly never posing a threat. MEMORABLE FLIGHT sped to the lead down the lane the first time,
bore out significantly in the first turn carrying out RIVER'S END, raced wide down the backside and failed to navigate the far turn as well, racing wide again
and dropped back from contention.

Footnotes
ABIGAIL ALDEN set the pace throughout while well rated, responded when challenged turning for home and dug-in gamely to be a determined winner.
GOVERNOR ANN well placed the entire trip along the fence, saved all the ground, angled out in upper stretch and rallied three wide to gain the place.
MOLA MIA prompted the pace while well in hand down the backside, ranged up at the quarter pole to mount a challenge, failed to gain on the winner and
was out-finished late for the place. TEXAS TWINKIES reserved off the pace to the far turn and showed late interest gaining ground late in the lane.
RECLAIMED raced four wide through the first turn, settled in mid-pack down the backside, made a bid into the far turn and went evenly down the stretch.
LUMBERJACK LESLIE raced five wide between horses through the first turn, tracked the leaders down the backside, rallied three wide in the final bend and
flattened out in the drive. ADELE'S BLING was fanned six wide in the first turn, dropped near the back of the field and went evenly. KAYLEE'S SHADOW
stalked the pace for a half mile and came up empty. HIGH DEF RIDGE fanned very wide in the first turn, dropped to the rear of the field and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
MONEY TAKER was moving up along the inside throughout the first half of the course, then vied for the lead while two wide heading into the early stretch,
then drew off to win easily in the end. TEQUILA EMPIRE set the pace into the first turn, was in the clear heading into the second turn, then was challenged
by an outer rival, continued to rally gamely before giving way on late stretch. TALKATIVE was impeded at the start, then saved ground in the early furlongs
while three wide, was gaining on the far turn to close well along the rail down the home stretch and was best for the show prize. LO PROFILE settled along
the inside throughout the first half, then was in a hard drive on the far turn to rally in the stretch and closed well in the end. LEPRECHAUN CHARM broke
outwardly and bumped rival, then chased the pace while four wide, rallied on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. BOBBIE O settled in the two path,
was moving up swiftly down the backstretch to rally from the three path on the far turn, was hard used and weakened in late stretch. EMMYLOU SQUALL
raced in the middle of the field while five wide, then steadily lost ground throughout the second half and was no menace. UNION BABE chased the pace
from the two path down the early backstretch, then dropped back and failed to rally.

Footnotes
STRAIGHT LUCK sped to the early lead after breaking alertly, was carried wide into the turn to avoid the rider-less horse, dropped back in while re-gaining
stride, pursued the leader through the lane and gamely wore that one down to take command in deep stretch as clearly the best. DRAG MALIBU prompted
the early pace from three wide, assumed command when the winner was carried wide, responded when challenged in upper stretch but could not hold off
the winner in a good try. TEAM LEADER rated in mid-pack early to track the leaders, rallied three wide turning for home and made a steady gain to be up
for the show. WITT AMERICA bumped at the start by inside rival, raced up into contention to stalk the pace, checked into the turn when encountering traffic
due to the loose horse, re-gained stride and finished evenly to hit the board in a rough trip. HARD CANDY checked off heels in traffic just before the turn,
tracked the leaders to upper stretch, made a mild rally down the lane while being squeezed again in mid-stretch. JUST OKIE went evenly and was never a
factor. SONGWRITER prominent in the early going but lacked a rally fading in the lane. MOONSHINE STEVE steadied briefly away from the gate, dropped
to the rear of the field and was no threat. PITALE leaned out at the start, lost rider a few strides from the gate, rushed up the inside rail to be in front and
bolted to the outside fence into the turn to interfere with the winner and cause traffic problems for much of the field.

IMPRESSED lead the way from the gate, then pressed the pace down the backstretch, then dueled in the upper stretch with an inner rival, kicked clear mid
stretch and held on well to prevail. AMERICAN XPERIMENT chased the pace from the inside, was urging on the turn to rally from the three path in the early
stretch then continued to close well and was up for the place prize. JACKMAN set the pace along the inside into the turn, then dueled with an outer rival in
the early stretch then gave way in the end. IT MAKES SENSE stalked the pace while three wide, then rallied gamely on the turn, was used up and gave way
in the stretch. DAME PLATA chased the pace while three wide, then faded throughout the second half and was no menace.

Footnotes
TAYLOR'S SECRET rushed up the fence to duel on the lead down the backside, was headed at the quarter pole and sawed off in upper stretch when the
pacesetter dropped in, took up sharply, was gathered up and re-set to a drive and was just up in time from between horses in a very game effort. GIRONA
reserved off the early pace, made up ground into the turn, rallied four wide while steadily grinding down the middle of the racetrack, continued to close in
spite of drifting out to the wire and just missed the nod. SHESMYBROKER slow early to trail the field, found her best stride turning for home and closed with
a belated rush from between horses to almost get up in time in a blanket finish. SWEET BAY stalked the pace from three wide through the turn, was put to
an early drive to loom in upper stretch and kept on down the lane. PAISLEY CROSS took command leaving the gate, dueled with the winner through the
turn, shook free turning for home, dropped over impeding the winner in upper stretch, dug-in down the lane but tired late in the drive. BEBOP BABY went
evenly and never menaced. ICY CAPE was never a threat from an inside trip. MY BABYS GONE prominently placed early and came up empty dropping
back through the field.

Footnotes
GET SERIOUS stalked the pace while two wide, then gained command heading into the far turn, was in a long drive, then dueled grudgingly with an outer
foe in the late stretch and was up by a nose in the end. RIVERCREST GIRL was unhurried early, then was moving up while four wide down the backstretch,
menaced on the far turn then dueled in the late stretch with an inner rival and hung in the end. GHOST BAYOU set the pace down the backstretch, was in a
long drive on the far turn to vie for the lead in the early stretch then gave way grudgingly in the end. GLITTERARY saved ground while settling along the
inside down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to rally from the four path in late stretch and closed willingly. OH DOO DAH DAY settled along the
inside throughout the first half then rallied while three wide on the far turn to close evenly down the stretch. CLAIRE JUNE raced in the middle of the field
while two wide, was moving up down the late backstretch to rally on the far turn then gave way in the stretch. GIRL ON THE GO chased the pace from the
two path down the backstretch, bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. LOLLIPOP GUMDROP chased the pace from the inside, then gradually lost
momentum throughout the far turn and failed to rally.
