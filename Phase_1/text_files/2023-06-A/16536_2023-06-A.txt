then advanced well inside to gain the place. XENATOWN raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then flattened out in the stretch. TUDOR PEAK angled
outside on the first turn, bid into the far turn then weakened. SO SOFTLY hustled to a clear advantage early, was collated after the half and came up empty
late.

Footnotes
NEECIE MARIE forced the pace outside, edged to the front at the eighth pole then pulled clear driving. ISTRIA earned a narrow lead inside and battled
gamely to the finish. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE was well placed outside the dueling leaders and continued willingly. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM angled inside
early and lacked a rally. CECILITA dropped back wide and passed rivals without menacing. SEAHORSE D'ORO trailed for half a mile then caught fading
rivals. ELEVENMONTHSLATER was urged close up inside to the final turn and faltered. LOST LUGGAGE raced in midpack between foes and faded.
GOLD MEDAL ANNA chased within range for half a mile and stopped. NEON CITY raced very wide off the leaders and stopped.

LADY SICARIA dueled outside, took over into the stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole then drew away. MAARTY'S DILEMMA trailed far behind then
finished with good energy inside. WICKED LADY hustled to the front inside, vied to the stretch and weakened. QUEEN LUCKY angled inside advancing on
the turn then flattened out. ESCANDALO chased wide throughout and was never a factor. LEAPING FOR CANDY saved ground off the pace and weakened
steadily. BOHEMIA BABE flashed speed between rivals then stopped abruptly.

OFFALY COOL bobbled soon after the start, forced the pace outside then edged away through the stretch. RICH'S WAY stalked the dueling leaders outside
then raced evenly through the stretch. JAMIE DREAMS hustled to a narrow advantage for three quarters and weakened. SECRET ALLIANCE prompted the
pace inside, was bothered by loose horse and taken up near the three eighths pole. NORTHERN EXPRESS dropped back early and was never in
contention. AFJAN stumbled badly at the start unseating his rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.
