Footnotes
CHILLVILLE was hung four wide into the clubhouse turn, made the lead two wide before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the far turn, gave up the
advantage, fought back to regain the lead in upper stretch and edged clear under left handed urging. BEAUTIFUL LASS stalked the pace into the stretch,
had a mild late rally in the five path and finished second best. ROARING GINGER allowed to settle, found her best stride late in the six path.
STARLITESLEW saved ground and failed to menace. SECRETS UNTOLD pressured the winner along the inside into the far turn, gained a narrow lead, set
the pace into the stretch then came up empty. LADY ITCH was restless in the gate, broke slowly and trailed throughout.

game effort. PANAMANIAC away alertly, all the pace, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and was caught in the final stages completing a four horse
photo finish. CAT'S RHYTHM trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. TOTALLY OBSESSED was in tight at
the start and failed to menace. CALI DREAM hopped at the start, had good early speed three wide then weakened in the stretch. LEXY ANNA vied for the
lead along the rail into the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
HERE COMES DOLLY never far back, closed with a burst of speed in the five path through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. SUGAR LOVES IT
was bumped hard at the start, set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch, opened a daylight lead before the furlong maker then couldn't handle the late
charge of the winner. C MORE PRIDE stalked the pace and went evenly in the five path through the stretch. ANGEL'S DESTINY was shut off at the start
and had a mild late rally. DANCE DRAMA pressed the pace along the rail into the stretch then weakened. EXTRA CRAFTY was no factor. PENNY'S
TREASURE had brief speed. MORNINGBEACHWALK was outrun. DEE'S KY WILDCAT broke in tangle, bore in bumping hard with DANCE DRAMA at the
start and unseated her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW TOOK NO ACTION.

BLAME IT ON EDDIE for the lead four wide for a half, drew on even terms for the lead with YOU ARE AWESOME nearing the far turn, battled with that one
until deep stretch, edged clear and just lasted under strong handling. SAY HEY KID unhurried early, closed rapidly three wide through deep stretch and just
missed getting up in time. YOU ARE AWESOME had good early speed along the rail through the first turn, dropped back and shifted out three wide before a
half, split horses to make the lead nearing the far turn, dropped inside, matched strides until deep stretch then was outfinished. KING ANDRES failed to
menace. VALHALLA AIR BASE battled for the early lead four then two wide and was through after a half. OPEN OUT hopped at the start and was outrun.
KLAATU contested the lead two wide then along the inside for a half and gave way on the far turn.

SWEET UNIQUE pressed the pace into the turn, inherited the lead past the five sixteenths pole under a hold, was set down in upper stretch, struck twice
with a left handed whip then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. DOMINUS O'S ME well placed, rallied along
the rail through the stretch and finished clear for second. JUPITER ECLIPSE trailed until deep stretch then passed tiring rivals in the four path. CANELA
FINA stalked the pace from between horses and failed to respond. GOLD APPEAL was no factor. COUNTRY STYLE sped to the lead soon after the start,
set the pace along the inside until the middle of the turn then folded.

Footnotes
MR LOOOCH away alertly, set all the pace while nicely rated and drew off under confident handling. SUSIE'S KID chased the winner and held on for
second in the three path. DERBY INCLUDED broke in a tangle, stalked the pace and went evenly. GONE IN A FLASH trailed for a half then closed some
ground late two wide. SAMMY'S SMILE well placed, failed to respond. VICTORY DIVISION was no factor. ELLIOT THE DRAGON stalked the pace along
the inside and faded in the stretch. PLATE IT UP had brief speed.
