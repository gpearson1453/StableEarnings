Footnotes
GYPSY JANIE stalked close up two wide, bid on the turn, took over coming to the quarter pole, drew clear under some urging, then was in hand for the final
sixteenth. EXPECT TO BE READY away alertly, set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, was no match, then jogged home the
final sixteenth. PURE ELEGANCE raced two wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, then slammed into an injured rival at the top of the stretch,
lost the rider, walked off after. JAMMINJL raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide on the far turn, then was injured entering the stretch and fell,
euthanized after. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident, the race was declared official.
