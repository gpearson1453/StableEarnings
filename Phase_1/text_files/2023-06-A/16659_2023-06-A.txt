Footnotes
HOMEGROWN LEGEND rushed from outset, established an inside stance, set the pace in tandem, and refused to lose the stretch duel for the score.
MISTER TYRO hustled from the break, was in concert for command, locked into a stretch duel, and was outdueled in final strides. OLD TOBY rated as the
solo rival in the second flight, chased the front running duo while trekking the two path, and finished evenly for the show. CRYPTO MINER settled in behind
rivals, trekked two wide around the bend, and was of little impact in the finish. RED ACE rated back and saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
PEARLY hustled form outset and established a ground saving stance, led the field at every call and drew off in the end for a wire to wire score. CALI settled
into mid pack in the early going, trekked three wide around the opening bend, tucked to save ground near the half way point, was roused inside the quarter
pole, and earned the place but was no match for tough winner. KIMBELL'S STRATEGY showed reserve and gave chase to front runners while trekking the
two path, swung wide rounding the final bend, and dug in for the show in homestrech. CON SUERTE was unhurried and trailed the field through the opening
half, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, and came up empty in the closing strides. CANADA CANDY retreated rapidly in final stages after
pressing the pace from a two path pose.

BABY LIAISON broke alertly, gained first command, set the pace as the inner most rival of three abreast, led every call, and inched away in the end for the
wire to wire victory. HERO TIME hustled from outset to press the pace from a two path pose, rated close up along the backstretch and at upper stretch, but
proved to e no match for winner in final sixteenth. TUFF MANDATE was unhurried through the openig half, swung to be widest of all at upper stretch, and
rallied mildly to share the show. MAJESTIC LOVER pressed the pace from outset as the widest of three abreast through the opening half before fading in
closing strides. STOLEN GHOST trekked three wide throughout and was no threat to top three. TRUE DOMINUS tucked to the inside shortly after the start,
saved ground all the way, and failed to menace.

TOMMYHAWK showed reserve in the opening half, split foes while under urging along the backstretch, angled out at upper stretch and rallied for the score.
ABSAROKA hustled from outset and led the field in tandem while trekking the inside lane, led the field at upper stretch, but couldnt fend off the late rally of
eventual winner in final sixteenth. ROWDY RASCAL trekked two wide, led the field briefly near the quarter pole, and weakened in the crucial strides. BOX
SEAT settled into second flight and chased the pacesetting duo from a three wide pose, was roused inside the quarter pole and gained mildly in the late
stages. UNRESTRICTED lacked a needed late kick after tucking to the inside and giving chase from second flight.

ELUSIVE FREUD showed reserve and loomed behind the pacesetting duo around the first turn, responded to urging in closing bend, swung wide at upper
stretch, and got up in time for the score. SPEND AGAIN hustled from the break and led the field from a two path pose through the opening half, had a slight
advantage at upper stretch, was met with a challenge near the sixteenth pole, and was nailed at wire for the score. BLAKE FROM TISH was unhurried
through the opening half, closed the gap on front runners inside the quarter pole and rallied to duel in the final sixteenth between rivals. SCHLEICHER
trailed the field from outset and passed tiring rival in closing strides. MACER THE RACER rushed form outset to lead the field in concert as the inside rival,
backed out of the bid at upper stretch, and faded rapidly in final furlong. AFTER AN INQUIRY, THE BOARD OF STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED 5:SPEND
AGAIN FROM SECOND PLACE AND PLACED HIM THIRD

evenly. NOMOREMRNICEGUY trekked widest of all through the opening half, rated mid pack at upper stretch, and failed to produce a closing bid.
