Footnotes
BOHEMIAN JIGGLES broke back, moved up closer on the outside into the turn, stalked through the turn, engaged the leader when straightened for home,
extended duel to the finish, proved best while trying to lug in late. CUSTOM SUNSHINE broke to the inside forcing LONG LEGGED LADY into SARAH'S
COURT, was quickly straightened to clear early, continued to show the way through the turn, responded when confronted by the winner in upper stretch,
dueled with that one to the wire and proved stubborn to the end. JAYDYN CAT within striking distance along the inside for three furlongs, shifted out a bit for
the drive, proved no match for the top two. LONG LEGGED LADY bumped by the runner up then ducked in at the break causing SARAH'S COURT to
check up, was straightened and turned in an even effort in lacking a closing response. SARAH'S COURT cut off then checked up at the break, fell far back,
continued to lag through the turn and into the stretch, displayed some late interest after the issue had been decided. C C LLAM void of speed, faded through
the lane to finish well back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
FOR HARPER unhurried early toward the inside, inched closer in the second flight far turn, steered out three wide when moving to challenge entering the
stretch, took over and quickly drove clear. SHES A LUCKY REBEL broke on top, showed the way into the far turn, dueled the middle half mile closest to the
inside, proved no match for the winner through the lane, remained clear for the place. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA broke out to bother THE CALLING STONE,
was quickly straightened to move up and challenge the runner up early in the first turn, continued to alternate for the advantage up the backstretch and
through the final turn, gradually weakened but managed to save the show. THE CALLING STONE broke in the air then was bothered to be las away, moved
up to race on the outside, continued well out in the strip to be four wide through the second bend when with the main body, went evenly through the lane in
lacking a closing kick. MUCHMORETHANREADY settled off the pace, continued evenly into the final turn, had little for the stretch drive. WORLD OF HURT
fell back to trail after the start, never a threat. TENSAS BERTIE chased the dueling leaders early and stopped.

Footnotes
CREEKSIDE broke alertly from along the inside, showed the way into the first turn while under some pressure, rated kindly in the run up the backstretch,
continued to hold the advantage through the second bend, kicked clear when straightened for home and maintained daylight to the wire. UP N GONE broke
in to help jam a pair of inner rivals, settled in mid pack off the rail, four wide through the second turn, roused for the drive, rallied to be edging clear for the
place late while still well out in the course, not a serious threat to the winner. RACY BILLE away in good order, prompted the issue early three wide and in
hand, continued in a forward position the middle half mile, chased the winner through upper stretch and past the furlong marker, could do little with that one,
caught for the place. SPIRIT OF DREAMS forced back at the break, recovered to advance and race within striking distance toward the inside, continued in
the second flight up the backstraight, in some traffic far turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. SEA OF LIGHT broke out to help jam a couple of outer
foes, was straightened, pressed that one from the outside for six furlongs and began to weaken, continued to falter through the stretch. ZIPPY TOGA lacked
early foot while outside, four to five wide through the second turn, lacked a serious rally down the lane. OUR HEATSEEKER jammed back at the break,
trailed early as a result and made little impact. POPPA BEAR finished early in trailing most of the way.

STRONG PROMISE lacked early foot, steered out and swept up strongly to challenge five wide into the lane, quickly kicked well clear under his own
courage to win going away and ridden out. OVER PAID behind the early leaders along the inside, angled out four wide to challenge turning for home while
inside the winner, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, edged clear for the place. CAJUN CYCLONE pressed the issue early from the outside,
vied into the lane three wide, came in to saw JANET'S BROTHER off nearing the furlong grounds, continued to come in to bother HYMN FOR CARLOS
slightly, finished up along the inside to be clear of the others. BOBBY BOY restless in the gate then broke in the air, steadied to spot the field a couple of
lengths, continued to trail out of the turn, showed some belated interest to improve position the final furlong. DEAL WITH IT DADDY broke in to bother
JANET'S BROTHER, raced back, four wide into the lane, passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. JANET'S BROTHER bothered at the break,
recovered to race forwardly into the turn, vied between rivals into the stretch, was sawed off with just over a furlong remaining and fell back. HYMN FOR
CARLOS showed the way early along the inside, continued to race with the lead pack out of the turn, was tiring when put in a bit tight by CAJUN
CLYCLONE a furlong out, continued to weaken. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH AND A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF JANET'S BROTHER AGAINST CAJUN CYCLONE FOR INTERFERENCE PAST THE FURLONG MARKER, THE
LATER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
CHEAPSKATE DIVA moved up to race closest to the leader before a quarter, prompted that one through some legit fractions up the backstretch, moved to
engage that rival into the lane, dueled briefly in upper stretch then took over, steadily increased advantage to the wire while kept to pressure. A G'S
CHARLOTTE off a step slow, raced back, moved closer toward the inside second turn, steered out and came three wide for the drive, rallied to chase the
winner late, fully extended to gain the nod for the runner up position at the wire. WHOLELOTTAMO balked at loading, void of speed while racing off the
inside, asked for run while four wide far turn, advanced into the lane, late bid for the place spot, missed. EVE'S DELIGHT moved up to take control into the
first turn, clear onto the backstretch, set a solid set of fractions then began to weaken when headed by the winner entering the stretch while inside that one.
FORT POLK moved out to race four wide with the main group first turn, continued off the pace, failed to mount a rally. MISHPACHAH broke on top, raced
forwardly for a half then faltered. SCARLET STORM was finished after a half.

FREE LIKE A GIRL in some early traffic, moved closer four wide into the turn, continued to trim the margin of the leaders through the bend, saw that
progress stall in upper stretch, briskly roused, late surge to win going away at the end. BELEOUT in the second flight off the inside, advanced and
challenged the leader late in the turn, put a head in front when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. FIRST
I'VE SEEN in mid pack inside the winner early, fell back a bit turn, came three wide for the drive, rallied to be clear for the show. NONEYA popped stall
doors prior to the start when fractious, last to leave, came wide for the drive, staged a belated rally to improve position. FINAL QUEST back off the early
pace, moved closer along the inside turn, flattened out in the drive. WUPKAR broke sharp, cleared toward the inside in showing the way up the backstretch
and into the turn, briefly dueled with the runner up late in the bend then faltered. SNOWBALL remained back in failing to menace. FLASHY MEG forwardly
placed in the early going, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT close from the start outside, four wide through the first turn, continued to prompt the pace outside, four wide again second turn
when moving to challenge, dueled into the lane, long drive, fully extended in a determined effort. MANGUM also forwardly placed from the beginning, three
wide, bid between foes and inside the winner second turn, gained a narrow advantage, dueled the length of the stretch inside the winner, proved stubborn to
the end. THE BOSS SOSS leaned into the gate at the break, rider lost right iron, lacked speed, between foes into the lane, rallied to be clear for the show,
not a threat to the top two. CLEAR AS A BELE one paced off rail in lacking a closing response. REDDINGANDLEE fell back to trail, lagged for six furlongs,
passed some tiring rivals to improve position, never a serious threat. CALIBRACHOA KID broke alertly, clear the opening quarter, showed the way up the
backstretch and into the far turn while off the inside, faltered when headed by the top two midway on that bend. MACHO BEANIE closest to the early leader,
chased that one up the backstretch, lodged a brief bid along the inside second turn and gave way. KAJUN KARMA in mid pack early, had little for the drive.
Z'S GUITAR was finished early, back.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA LIBERTY lacked speed while four wide through the first turn, continued to lack speed while outside in the run up the backstretch, four wide
advance second bend, outside bid in upper stretch, wore down rivals to prove best. STAR MOMENT five wide into the first turn, moved closer before a half,
prompted the leader far turn, tried that one from the outside exiting that bend, vied between rivals past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the
winner late. HIGHLY WICKED took command after the start, clear onto the backstretch, set a moderate pace off the inside, responded when challenged
second turn, continued to battle on through upper stretch then gradually weakened the final furlong, remained well clear of the others. CRYSTAL D'ORO
lacked early speed, improved position three wide while not a threat to the top three. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE went one paced throughout in lacking a
closing response. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY within striking distance for five furlongs, had little left for the drive. NEW DESTINY chased the leader early then
gave way after five furlongs. I BEAR ARMS was finished after half.

Footnotes
WOODS N WATER forwardly placed out of the chute inside, continued to race forwardly while saving ground the middle half, tentatively ridden to move
closer second turn, hit a seam between foes turning for home, set down for the drive, dueled past the furlong marker, edged away late under steady
handling. BUDRO TALKING outrun in the early going, continued to lag into the far turn, fanned six wide turning into the straight, rallied willingly to annex the
place. DEER CROSSING bumped lightlyt with HIGHLAND CREEK just after the start, raced in mid pack off the inside, four wide turning for home, also
staged a late rally to be in time for the show. CARLEA'S DREAM broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, clear by a quarter, raced in hand up the
backstretch and into the far turn, responded when confronted by the winner into the lane, dueled with that one the next furlong then began to cave, lost a
couple of more positions late. WICKED ROSE devoid of speed, moved five wide and inside the runner up out of the final turn, finished up evenly in lacking a
closing punch. HIGHLAND CREEK light bump after break, settled off the pace and the inside, came up empty for the drive. CITY PARK tucked inside onto
the main course out of the chute, continued to save ground, some traffic into lane, lacked a closing bid as well. BLUE CHEESE a bit rank at the start, fell
back to trail, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while always outrun. SMARTY ALEX in mid pack most of the way, backed up stretch. DOUBLE ON THE RED
chased the leader for six furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
BLACK SWORD away in good order from the outside, moved closest to the leader late backstretch, continued to chase that one through most of the turn,
bid in the three path turning for home, slight drive, drove clear. BIG CHOPPER broke back, void of speed for a half outside, came five wide into the lane,
rallied for the place, not a threat to the winner. GRUNT broke sharp, soon sprinted clear, continued to show the way by daylight through most of the turn,
briefly responded when the winner came alongside into the lane then began to weaken, no match for the runner up late, narrowly gained the nod to save the
show. MIKE J within striking distance early, raced with the main body between horses turn, went evenly through the lane while just off the inside. BINDING
AGREEMENT back off the pace and the inside, three wide and between horses far turn, tight, steadied, fell back midway on the bend, displayed some mild
interest late after recovering. X CLOWN last away, trailed, made little impact. BERTIE'S GALAXY back off the early pace, moved closer along the inside
turn, flattened out in the drive. MY MAN LOUIE in mid pack pack outside, four wide through the turn, gave way in the drive.
