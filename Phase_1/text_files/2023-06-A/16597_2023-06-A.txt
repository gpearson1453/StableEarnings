off. JACKSON ROAD lacked speed, raced inside horses on the far turn and in upper stretch, was caught in tight quarters inside COSMICALITY in upper
stretch, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and rallied. FLIGHT OF BOURBON disputed the pace outside LANDON JACK and weakened the final
furlong. LANDON JACK showed speed near the inner rail, dueled to mid stretch and weakened. BY ITS ABSENCE showed some speed outside horses
leaving the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened. COSMICALITY , four deep on the turn, bore in near the three sixteenths pole and
weakened. EVENLY DIVIDED was taken up in tight quarters along the inner rail mid way on the turn. TWICE GOLD broke slowly and trailed.

Footnotes
HOT LOOKIN ROYAL tightened foes when guiding inward nearing the three quarter pole, clear and secured the rail soon after, set a rated pace around the
turn while shadowed by BAD TEMPER, came under strong asks nearing mid stretch, dueled head to head through the final sixteenth and narrowly
prevailed. BAD TEMPER steadied back off HOT LOOKIN ROYAL approaching the three quarter marker, regrouped and moved up to prompt outside that
one heading to the turn, drew alongside past mid stretch, battled gamely and just missed. PERFORMANCEANXIETY drifted out at the break, straightened
and settled well wide, circled the turn four wide but lacked a serious response. ILLUSION OF HOPE , saving ground while in range heading to the three
quarter pole, hit the rail when bumped and put in tight soon after, came under a hustling ride early turn, eased out with a bit of run into the lane, failed to kick
on nearing mid stretch and faded. HOLDING COURT , between foes early, was forced in by the winner and bumped with ILLUSION OF HOPE near the six
furlong marker, recovered to chase a contested pace past the three eighths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. Following a stewards' inquiry
and objections by the riders of ILLUSION OF HOPE, HOLDING COURT and BAD TEMPER, HOT LOOKIN ROYAL was disqualified from first and placed
last for causing interference through the backstretch run.

LIQUIDATOR showed speed in the two path between horses through the opening half mile then dueled through the stretch inside HAPPY CLOUDS
prevailing in a determined drive. HAPPY CLOUDS , three deep prompting the pace around the turn, dueled through the stretch in a game effort.
HIDEWRIGHT AWAY showed speed along the inner rail, failed to keep pace leaving the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and gained late.
CYNERGY'S ELECTRA , steadied in close quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path entering the stretch and
was not a factor. SPENCERIAN raced in the two path between horses on the turn and was no factor. SIDESWIPED gave way along the inner rail on the

Footnotes
GIFT OF GAB sped clear early, was nicely rated on the front end, came two wide into the lane, responded when put to firmer asks in mid stretch and held
sway. NEXT EPISODE had speed to the inside of the winner, eased back off that one nearing the turn, came out to about the four path in upper stretch and
closed nicely under steady handling. MONEY'S WORTH stalked the winner three wide, remained on her left lead through the final furlong and was out
finished. IN VAIN , taken to rate off the pace, raced behind a foe leaving the far turn, swung five wide and closed well to gain. BELLA BETTINA saved
ground off the early pace, continued inside for the drive, moved up past mid stretch then flattened out late. HITCH A RIDE lagged back off the pace and was
taken off the rail, shifted very wide for the drive and had belated interest. ISLAND PHILO , off the pace, was urged along saving ground leaving the far turn,
eased out three wide into the stretch but lacked a bid. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF chased two wide around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LEONIDS stalked the pace down the backstretch and on the turn, circled the turn three wide, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, took the lead outside
GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR near the eighth pole then drove clear. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR prompted the pace outside RUNNING RIVER, overtook
that one leaving the turn, failed to hole off the winner but finished gamely while well clear of the rest. GREAT HEAVENS saved ground around the turn while
stalking the pace, angled outside in mid stretch and weakened. R B'S THE BOSS raced in the two path on the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch
and passed a tired rival. RUNNING RIVER set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. CONTEMPT raced along the inner rail
throughout and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
GOLDEN HEART prompted to the inside of the leader early on, eased back off that one nearing the turn, was guided out for a clear run into the lane, closed
determinedly under left handed asks, took over in deep stretch and held firm. CIRCLE HOME secured the rail into the turn, tracked patiently, angled four
wide into the lane and closed nicely. LADY ENSIGN had speed outside the winner then went clear leaving the far turn, set a rated pace two wide, spurted
away a bit when set down in upper stretch, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, shifted in late and faded. FASHIONISTA , off the pace and outside a rival,
edged up between horses in mid stretch and continued with effort. SOUPER TROPICAL , taken in hand while saving ground, gained inside runners in mid
stretch then flattened out. CATCH THE KITTEN drafted back off the pace, raced two wide into the lane, shifted outward for the final furlong and churned on.
LOOKING FOR WATER broke a bit slowly, saved ground under asking mid turn but lacked a solid response. IRISH MIRAGE , three deep early, chased four
wide into the lane, exchanged a bump near mid stretch and gave way. QUARANTINI broke slowly and failed to menace. SPUN IN A MILLION gave pursuit
two to three wide, gave way in upper stretch, drifted out and bumped with a rival near mid stretch. MONTANA ROSE , three wide early, chased six wide in
upper stretch and weakened. GAZALANI , off the pace, raced three wide into the stretch and failed to kick on.

then drew off under urging. UTTERLY ENCHANTING hugged the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. ESPERANNNA sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the advantage in mid stretch and
faded. MOONBOOTS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and passed tired hores. SUMMER ODDS prompted the pace outside
ESPERANNNA and gave way in mid stretch. TAM CHAR , kept wide around the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
AWESOME MAN drafted back early then dropped in to secure the rail, gained along the rail when given his cue with less than five eighths to go, got within
range leaving the far turn then had his rider sit chilly approaching the quarter pole, gained as a seam opened towards the rail in upper stretch, altered out
leaving the furlong grounds, knife his way between rivals to take over with a sixteenth to go then held firm under steady hand encouragement. LORD
FLINTSHIRE , well placed saving ground in range of the embattled leaders, waited for room near the quarter pole, altered out past the three sixteenths,
ranged up to be on near even terms for command a sixteenth out then continued gamely to the wire. HIGH DEFF (FR) settled in the clear, quickly gained
four wide outside rivals past the five sixteenths, moved to command near the three sixteenths, battled past the eighth pole then weakened late. SHOOTIN
THE BREEZE settled in mid pack and towards the inside, raced between rivals leaving the three eighths, swung five wide for the drive and churned on.
CANDY FOR CARMEL was sent to the front, disputed the pace inside foes past the wire the first turn, sparred with NICKY BEAR through the backstretch
run and run around the final turn, stayed on past mid stretch then weakened late. NEVER COAST reared at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace,
was under pressure four wide nearing the quarter pole but came up empty. BOLD LICORICE , off the pace, swung well wide for the drive but lacked a
serious run. BEOWULF (IRE) broke slowly, settled well back, saved ground with some run near mid stretch then flattened out. KITTEN AROUND forced the
early pace between foes, gave chase into and around the final turn then weakened through the drive. NICKY BEAR , four wide to contention, vied three
wide outside foes into the second turn, dueled outside CANDY FOR CARMEL from the three quarter pole to the quarter pole then retreated.

WATCH ME DISAPPEAR set the pace outside WEST COAST WILDCAT, opened up in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and drifted out in the drive.
GOOD STORY , wide around the turn, rallied outside. POLICE WOMAN , fanned very wide turning for home, angled in near the sixteenth pole and closed.
WEST COAST WILDCAT , bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, showed speed inside the winner and weakened. TIPSY TOURIST , well off the
rail, chased the pace and weakened. WAVERLEY bumped WAVERLEY leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the turn and was not a factor. SNOOZE
BUTTON saved ground on the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch and failed to rlly. LILY MOR , checked after bumping WAVERLEY at the start,
steadied in traffic near the half mile pole. MIDSUMMER STORM raced between horses on the turn and was not a factor.
