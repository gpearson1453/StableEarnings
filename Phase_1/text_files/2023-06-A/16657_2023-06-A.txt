Footnotes
BOSS ANGEL broke sharply and was quickly clear to dictate terms, faced outside pressure briefly late up the backstretch while setting the pace from off the
rail, moved clear again early on the turn, drifted out turning into upper stretch, drew away and was geared down late. ONE PAIR OF HANDS moved forward
to apply pressure just off the flank of the eventual winner, could not keep pace with that one and chased two to three wide on the turn coming out further for
the drive, was no match for the winner but kept on to hold the place. SUZY Q THE QUEEN exchanged a bump then was in turn bumped again at the start,
lacked early speed but soon advanced outside foes four to five wide on the turn looming a threat coming nearer the top of the stretch, could not kick on and
was outfinished for second. BEARGREASE had forward position stalking outside early, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. MASKED
HEROINE bumped with a rival then was bumped into that foe at the start, was in a bit tight between runners early, dropped back racing several paths off the
rail, swung eight deep into the stretc, was not a threat. FINE ALEIGH bumped a rival after the start, chased in behind, saved ground inside through the turn,
was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
OROCOVIX switched outside the leader heading into the first turn and lightly bumped a rival, raced in behind two to three deep, advanced while coming out
further leaving the far turn, struck a narrow lead in mid-stretch, held while being kept busy to the wire. DELTA RIDGE angled in soon after the break and
tracked from inside, saved ground through both turns gaining steadily on the far turn, bid inside in mid-stretch, was guided out a bit but outkicked by the
winner. MAKOTO got away alertly, set the pace racing off the rail, faced outside pressure up the backstretch, moved clear heading into the far turn, came
out a bit further turning for home, was challenged in upper stretch, overtaken by mid-stretch while drifting out but kept on gamely in defeat. SIDNEY'S BID
was forced out three to four deep on the first turn while getting brushed lightly, moved forward to press the pace up the backstretch, lost ground on the
leader on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. GOD GIVEN RIGHTS raced two to three wide toward the back through the first turn, continued far back
near but just off the rail on the far turn, was not a threat. RUSHIN TOTHECIRCLE was forwardly-positioned five wide early, dropped back and faded.
BLACKWATER FALLS lacked early speed racing mostly three to four wide on the turns, was not a factor.

Footnotes
AMAZON QUEEN pressed the pacesetter from outside three to four wide, took over near the three-eighths marker, was clear into upper stretch, held safe
from a challenger and was geared down late. CLASSIC COLORS was caught four to five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace from outside, asked for
more outside the quarter pole still going four wide, could make no headway on the winner but was clearly second best. SAYYIDA AL HURRA tracked early
from inside just off the rail, lost ground on the leaders and came out a bit in upper stretch, got up for show honors over NIBBLES, who broke outwardly but
alertly, set a pressured pace racing in the two path, weakened once headed. INANNA'S QUEST was backed in riderless from the front of the gates and
reluctant to do so, broke just a hair slowly, trailed early while unhurried racing off the inside, swung five wide into the stretch, was not a threat.

THEA'S THEME angled in heading up the backstretch advancing on the leaders, tracked in behind two to three wide on the turn, bid inside the leader taking
over a sixteenth out and kicked clear. DAILY BRIEFING was brushed just lightly at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came off the
fence turning into upper stretch, finished strongly to get for place inside INSIGHTFUL, who dueled outside a rival in about the three path, took the lead at the
three-eighths, was clear turning for home while drifting out a couple paths, overtaken in late stretch and outfinished for second. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT
pursued the dueling leaders from outside, was within range four to five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MOON ME AGAIN brushed a rival
lightly at the start, raced at the back off the inside, swung eight wide for the drive, needed more. CALL THE PO PO chased briefly from off the inside part of
the track, dropped back and retreated. SNOOTY dueled inside, gave way.

FORTUNE'S FOOL settled outside mid-pack caught five wide early, advanced four to five deep on the far turn taking the lead past the quarter pole, drew off
in the stretch when roused and was eased up late. MY DANNY BOY bumped a rival at the start, sped clear and shifted in, set the pace racing just off the
rail, was overtaken turning for home, proved no match for the winner but held second. PRIVATE NETWORK tracked in behind the leader on or just off the
rail, came out at the top of the stretch, ran on. MY MAN VITO was bumped between runners at the start, reserved at the rear racing four to five wide, came
out further for the drive and improved position. CREATIVE CLOUD rated inside off the leaders, needed more. ANTE UP ALEX bumped with a rival at the
start, raced three wide between foes through the first turn, continued about three wide on the far turn, was never a threat. DAMIR pursued the pacesetter
from outside a foe three to four wide, dropped back and faded.

THREES OVER DEUCES switched outside foes early racing off the pace, began to advance five wide on the turn, was forced out wider turning for home
then in upper stretch by a drifting rival, bid in mid- to late-stretch, drifted in a bit brushing a foe late and just got up. CHIEF RON stalked the pace, went four
wide on the turn, was forced out turning for home and again in upper stretch by a drifting rival, continued to float out a bit appearing to make very light
contact with an outside foe, was crowded and lightly brushed in late stretch while contending for the top prize. CHICKS DIG SCARS pursued the leader
three wide into the turn, lugged out in upper stretch, bid in mid-stretch, was outfinished. BORRACHO got away alertly and set the pace racing off the inside,
drifted out several paths leaving the turn, fought on but was outkicked. AWESOME STRONG chased in behind the leaders off the fence, made no late bid.
FULL AUTHORITY raced at the back three to four wide through the turn, failed to threaten. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CHIEF RON
AGAINST THREES OVER DEUCES ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

HUGE BIGLY stumbled badly at the start but without losing any ground and recovering quickly, tracked from inside just off the pace, bid up the rail nearing
the five-sixteenths, shook clear of a rival in upper stretch, lugged out with each left-handed use of the crop through the lane and held. HELIUM moved out
from two to three wide on the first turn, was carried out a bit further stalking the pace up the backstretch, bid outside three wide coming to the
five-sixteenths, lost ground on the leader leaving the far turn and into upper stretch but kept on under urging and just missed. NONEEDTOWORRY raced at
the back off the inside early, saved some ground on the far turn and passed a tired rival. WOW WHATA SUMMER set the pace racing off the rail, was
guided wider up the backstretch, continued in about the two path into the far turn, was inhaled by inside and outside rivals approaching the five-sixteenths,
switched out further at that juncture and came up empty.

Footnotes
SHINELIKEADIAMOND got away alertly, attended the pace from between runners into the turn, went three wide on that bend taking command near the
three-eighths, drew off in the stretch and was geared down late. BETWEEN DREAMS was outpaced early, went three to four wide on the turn at the back,
swung nine wide into the stretch, rallied for place. LET'S BE HONEST was urged forward to prompt the pace inside foes but off the rail, moved to the rail
into the turn and was in a bit tight and bumped lightly with a rival at the three-eighths, lost ground on the leaders through the turn, drifted out turning into
upper stretch, kept on and lost place late. PROSPERA was forwardly-positioned outside, bid four wide past the three-eighths, could not kick on with the
winner, lost the crop past the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. PLAYERA was in tight after the start, raced at the back near the inside into the turn,
failed to threaten. ROSY APPLE had brief foot between runners, continued to track in behind the leaders three to four wide on the turn, was carried out six
wide leaving that bend, failed to menace. LIKING IT TWISTED moved forward from between runners for force the pace from between foes, was in tight
between and bumped lightly past the three-eighths, lost ground on the leaders, was forced out and in tight again between runners past the quarter pole,
faded.
