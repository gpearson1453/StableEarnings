Footnotes
BRONZE WARRIOR broke alertly and established the early pace, was well handled while setting prompted fractions through the backstretch run, carved out
a decent pace while pressured to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch, was confronted by LYING GHOST nearing the furlong marker, battled that
foe while maintaining a narrow advantage into deep stretch and dug in in the final stages to prevail. LYING GHOST settled off of the decent early pace, was
roused three wide along the second turn, confronted BRONZE WARRIOR nearing the furlong pole, gamely battled that rival while kept to steady urging,
could not get by the determined winner in the final stages and was gamely bested, while clear of the rest. WALKING BOSS came in a bit tight leaving the
start, took up and was off slowly, was unhurried through the early stages, was steered outside of rivals along the second turn, mounted a four wide rally into
the stretch, gained ground at the furlong pole, could not keep pace with the top pair in the late stages and held safely at the end for third. MASHHAD FLATS
was prominent into the first turn, prompted the decent fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to BRONZE WARRIOR to the quarter
marker, dropped back leaving the far turn and gave way in the drive. BROOKYS TAPIT settled off of the moderate early pace while saving ground, was well
positioned into the second turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid into the stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SWEET BLUSH stumbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was hustled to establish the early lead and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent
fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was confronted by PRANCIN N THE PARK at the quarter marker, shook free from that rival into
upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong grounds while kept to steady urging and drew clear in the final stages. PRANCIN N THE PARK broke out a
step leaving the start, was forwardly placed into the first turn and attended to the pace into the backstretch run, tracked the decent fractions to the far turn,
advanced to confront SWEET BLUSH nearing the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival into the drive, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch
and bested the rest. BIG GIFT broke in at the start, bothered DUST MAKER and was off slowly, settled while saving ground in the early stages, swung to
the three path into the backstretch run, advanced while two deep on the second turn, was steered three wide into the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch,
raced on the left lead into deep stretch, could not impact the top two in the final stages and kept on to secure third. DUST MAKER was bothered and took up
at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the decent early pace while saving ground, chased in pursuit through the backstretch run, saved ground to
the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, lacked a response in the stretch and gave way.

ASCENDANCY settled off of the decent early pace while never far back, inched closer along the backstretch run, was roused three wide into the second
turn, rallied four wide into the drive, responded to firm urging while four deep in the stretch, took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged clear in
the final stages. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be just off of the early pace into the first turn, stalked
three deep through the backstretch run, made a steady advance while outside of rivals into the far turn, raced three wide into the drive, vied for the lead at
the furlong grounds, could not match strides with ASCENDANCY in deep stretch and kept on in the late stages to secure the place. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL
was sent at the start and established the lead into the first turn, set solid fractions while pressured through the backstretch run, was confronted by TROJAN
CLUBHOUSE at the quarter marker, lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch, battled TROJAN CLUBHOUSE from the rail into mid-stretch, weakened in
the final furlong and was outfinished for second while just holding for third. TWILIGHT EMPIRE lacked early speed, maintained a two wide path to the
second turn, gained ground at the quarter marker, was steered three wide for the drive, continued to advance approaching the furlong marker, lacked a final
bid in deep stretch and just missed for third. TROJAN CLUBHOUSE was forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the solid fractions through the
backstretch run, pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch and held a narrow lead to the furlong pole, could not keep
pace in the late stages and gave way.

TOM'S PIC forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the pace then assumed command into the backstretch run when CHROME'S BEST COPY drifted out,
set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, showed the way to the quarter marker, opened to a clear lead into upper stretch, had the margin cut into in the
final sixteenth, slightly jumped a bare patch in deep stretch and held in a drive at the end to prevail. FRESNO CHILE stalked the decent early pace from the
inside, saved all of the ground to the second turn, was a bit green while chasing TOM'S PIC to the furlong pole, switched to the correct lead inside of the
furlong marker, closed well in deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and held for second. JACQUELINE COCHRAN settled just off of
the early pace while in the second flight, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch run, came two wide into the far turn, angled four wide into upper
stretch, lost ground in the run to the furlong marker, re-rallied in deep stretch, closed willingly in the final stages and just missed for second, while getting up
in time for third. I'M GONNA SHINE unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, came in a bit tight and steadied approaching the top of
the lane, rallied along the inside in the drive, finished well and just missed for the minor awards. CHROME'S BEST COPY broke alertly and showed good
early speed, set the pace into the first turn, drifted out nearing the six-furlong pole, recovered into the backstretch run and attended to the decent pace, kept
close attendance to TOM'S PIC to the second turn, lost position into the drive and tired. SILVER FLIRT settled just off of the early pace, raced four wide
along the first turn then moved to the three path for the backstretch run, tracked the pace while outside of rivals to the second turn, lost ground three wide on
the far turn, was outrun in the drive and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA was well placed into the first turn, saved ground while tracking the leaders through the backstretch run, inched closer along the second turn,
angled three wide into upper stretch, loomed at the furlong pole, responded to urging and took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, kicked clear in deep
stretch and won going away. PERSUASIVE LIPS was prominent into the first turn, attended to the pace into the backstretch run then pressed the decent
pace to the half-mile pole, confronted SHEZAGHOST at the quarter marker and took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was set down while battling
SHEZAGHOST to the furlong marker, was overtaken by STOIC LUNA nearing the sixteenth-pole, could not keep pace with the winner in the final stages
and held safely in the end for second. SHEZAGHOST was hustled leaving the break and led into the first turn, set a pressured pace through the backstretch
run, was confronted by PERSUASIVE LIPS nearing the quarter marker then was overtaken in upper stretch, battled with PERSUASIVE LIPS to the furlong
marker, could not match strides with the top pair in the final furlong and weakened, while holding safely for third. VRONSKY FEINT forwardly placed into the
first turn, chased the decent fractions from a three wide path through the backstretch run, improved position three wide on the far turn, could not sustain that
bid in the stretch and gave way. BANDEENA settled off of the decent early pace, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch run, slipped to the inside
heading to the second turn and did not threaten in the stretch. SHEZARUNAWAY lacked early speed, lagged through the backstretch run, was coaxed
along two wide into the far turn and did not factor in the drive.

FIVE O COCKTAIL forwardly placed in the early running, took back and was well placed while just off of the leaders into the turn, raced two wide to the
quarter marker, was roused three wide into the drive, was full of run nearing the furlong marker, assumed command approaching the sixteenth-pole and
drove clear in the final stages to prevail. DAWN AT LAST ducked in at the start and was off a bit slowly, was rushed up in the early stages and set the pace
into the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker while well handled, extended the lead into mid-stretch, was overtaken by FIVE O COCKTAIL nearing
the sixteenth-marker, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and held well in the end for second. BARBERA stalked the decent early pace
while outside of rivals, ran in pursuit of DAWN AT LAST while three then two wide into the turn, cut into the pacesetter's margin nearing the quarter pole,
lost ground to DAWN AT LAST into upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive by the top pair and was clear of the rest in the end for third. STANDFORGRIT
showed good early speed, lost the early lead to DAWN AT LAST and chased that rival to the turn, saved ground while chasing along the bend, lost position
into upper stretch and could not muster the needed late response. AUTISM SHINE prominent in the early running, rated off of the early pace and slipped to
the rail heading to the turn, saved ground to the top of the stretch and lacked a response in the drive. MO TOWN GAL chased the decent early pace, ran
two wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the drive and did not threaten in the stretch. TUDOR'S FOREST chased the decent early
pace while outside of rivals, came four wide into the drive, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and tired. PLEASANT WARNING bobbled at the start
and was off slowly, lacked early speed into the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
AZURE STAR (IRE) was sent after an alert beginning and dictated terms into the first turn, set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch
run, extended the lead along the second turn, was confronted by CHARBONNEAU in upper stretch, met that bid to the furlong marker, dueled to deep
stretch, dug in under steady urging in the final stages and lasted at the wire for a game win. CHARBONNEAU was forwardly placed in the early running,
stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground to AZURE STAR along the second turn, re-rallied and confronted AZURE STAR
in upper stretch, battled with that foe to the furlong pole, dueled with his stablemate to deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final
sixteenth and was denied for the win, while besting the rest. DRUIDIC tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, saved ground through the
backstretch run while well placed, lost ground along the second turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker, re-rallied in deep stretch, was not able to impact the
top two in the final stages and was clear for third in the end. LORD OF LIGHT unhurried in the early stages, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch
run, came two wide into the second turn, swung four wide into the drive, offered a mild late rally and improved position in the final stages. CHUCKANUT
BAY allowed to settle early on, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run and into the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and did not offer a
late response. FLY WICKED EAGLE prominent in the early stages, took back to track the decent pace into the first turn, ran in pursuit while outside of a rival
through the backstretch run, was outrun along the second turn, chased the leaders into the drive and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
GET'EM TIGER broke sharply and dueled for the early lead with O'NEILL'S LEGACY, backed off a bit past the five-furlong marker, re-engaged the leader
on the turn, dueled down the stretch, got the advantage passing the furlong pole and drew off under a strong hand ride and intermittent urging. LADY IN A
HURRY reserved early, stayed to the inside while making good forward progress through the turn, ran on well down the stretch despite racing mostly on the
wrong lead, vied between runners into deep stretch and just got up for second. REINA DE REYES was away well, tracked the leading pair down the
backstretch, waited until the quarter pole to launch a bid, came into the stretch three wide then ran on well to the finish, lost a bob for the place while no
threat to the winner. O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke well and was hustled to the front, opened up to a clear advantage heading into the turn, met the challenge of
GET'EM TIGER at the top of the stretch, dueled that one to the furlong grounds then weakened. SHOUT IT OUT outrun early, caught up to the pack on the
turn, was forced wide and steadied sharply to avoid the loose horse near the five-sixteenths marker, was outrun into the stretch and lacked a late response.
GARDEES WORLD broke in the air, hit the side of the starting gate and was separated from the rider at the break, ran loose during the race, was caught by
the outrider after the finish and walked off under her own power.
