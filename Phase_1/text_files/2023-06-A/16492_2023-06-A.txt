Footnotes
REACHING STRIDE was allowed to settle early, made a steady advance into far turn while racing four to five wide and finished strongly to edge clear under
steady handling. ANTRIM raced mid pack in the early stages, raced near the inside down the backstretch, angled to race wide through the stretch and
surged for the place position. PLANET FROLIC stalked the pace from the inside and kept on willingly to the wire while racing near the rail. HEART OF THE
BEAST raced mid pack early on, was five to six wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. CASTLE BORN raced six wide around the
first turn, raced from the outside of rivals down the backstretch under a hold, ridden along to take command near the three eighths pole, raced in a bit tight
nearing the eighth pole and weakened. WITCHING HOUR stalked the pace, hard ridden through the far turn, raced three to four wide into the lane and
weakened late. INSATIABLE EVA settled off the early pace, raced four to five wide in the lane and nevrer threatened. MS EXCUSE showed good early foot
to set the pace along the inside and gave way. NO MORE FIRE raced six wide around the first turn, raced with the second flight early and lacked a bid.
QUICKSTYLE prompt the pace from the outside of rivals and faded. LADY BOURBON broke in the air, void of early speed, shifted out to race from the far
outside in the stretch and never threatened. CRYPTONAIRE raced mid pack early, tired readily to race far back and was eased through the upper stretch.

GINGER SPARKLE stalked the early pace, ridden into the far turn, challenged three wide near the quarter pole, raced well off the inside in the stretch and
held well to prove best under strong pressure. GET A GRIP MARILYN stalked the early going, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and finished
well to be second best. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) settled off the early pace, advanced from the inside past the five sixteenths pole, angled to race from the

Footnotes
VACATION SUITE was off slowly, raced near the back early after the poor start, advanced towards the leaders through the far turn, angled five wide into the
upper stretch and finished well to get up under strong encouragement. THANK THE ACADEMY was bumped soundly at the start, moved up three to four
wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. UNIFIEDS PRINCESS was void of early speed, raced near the inside approaching the five
sixteenth pole, angled to race from the outside in the stretch run closed in belatedly. WILDCAT LUNITA settled off the early going, moved up from the inside
of rivals through the upper stretch to challenge and flattened out. HIDDEN ROAD was bumped at the start, settled mid pack early, raced from the outside in
the stretch and was even late. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER sprinted clear early on, raced off the inside throughout, met just past the quarter pole and faded.
HOW BOUT DAT broke awkwardly, bumped with rival, chased the leader from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
HEIRESSINDY rated under a firm hold racing from the outside of rivals, ridden along near the five sixteenths pole, four deep passing three sixteenths pole
and edged clear under steady pressure. PROVOCATIVA showed good early speed to set the early pace while racing just off the inside, dropped down into
the far turn while being challenged by Heiressindy and kept on in the drive to hold the place position. SWEET ACTRESS void of early speed, advanced
through the far turn, raced from the outside in the lane and moved up to improve position. TWIRLING GRACE stalked the pace off the inside, raced two to
three wide around the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no closing run. DISCO QUEEN settled off the early going, raced
six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a rally. LA BRODY coaxed along early from the inside and weakened in the drive. KATIESDREAMGIRL dropped
back early, raced five to six wide through the stretch and had no response. SHES A GIFT pressed the early pace between rivals and tired readily.

Footnotes
WEST COAST COWBOY rated along under firm hold outside of rivals racing five to six wide, took command through the far turn, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and edged clear late under strong pressure. BIG DATA bumped, squeezed at the break, moved up from the inside into the far turn, waited for
racing room nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled out through the upper stretch to race five wide, took aim at the eighth pole but couldn't get by in a game
effort. KNOX bumped soundly at the break, raced near the back early, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and closed in well to improve position.
MIDNIGHT TROUBLE prompt the pace from the inside of foes and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CENTRODELANTERO stalked the pace, raced four
to five wide around the far turn and had no late rally. WINE EMPIRE showed brief early foot and tired readily.

Footnotes
BUC N BEAUTY sprinted clear early on, drew off through the stretch drive and was kept to pressure. KILLARGUE'S GIRL was slow early on, moved up
through the far turn while racing near the inside past the quarter pole, drifted through the stretch run to race well off inside, kept on but was no match for the
winner. UPSTREET was off slow, angled off the inside soon after the break, shifted out widest through the stretch and moved up late to improve position.
STURDY GIRL stalked the pace, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no closing run. LAW MACHINE chased the early pace
while being ridden along, raced near the inside around the far turn and faded. DUDESFIRSTDARLING was coaxed along early and faded. C C'S
FREEDOM raced far back and trailed.

Footnotes
AMOR LEJANO (ARG) pressed the early pace three deep from the outside of foes and kicked on gamely in the drive to be clear under strong handling.
STRAIGHT SHOT pressed the early pace racing between rivals, dug in near the rail and narrowly held the place position. NO ANGEL bumped soundly at
the break, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and rallied gamely from the outside. LUNAR ROCKET raced mid pack early, hard ridden into the far
turn, raced five deep in the lane between rivals and kept on to the wire. LUCAGO stalked the pace near the inside, experienced traffic nearing the quarter
pole, raced four to three wide in the drive and raced even late with no closing run. GONE NUTS settled off the early going, raced four wide past the quarter
pole, raced from the outside in the lane and weakened a bit late. STRONG AGAIN was off slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced
three wide in the drive and never threatened. UNDALAY showed good early foot and tired readily. OVERTAXED was bumped soundly at the break, raced
far back and trailed.

CAJUN'S MAGIC prompt the pace the pace from the outside of foes and kicked on gamely in the drive under strong pressure. NOBLE DRAMA settled off
the early pace, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths, surged late and just missed in a game effort. CANDY TYCOON stalked the pace, ridden along
nearing the three eighths pole, raced three wide near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. LOGICO settled off the early going, raced from the far outside
in the stretch and had not enough in the drive. MORGAN POINT showed good early foot racing four deep down the backstretch, angled in near the three
eighths pole and weakened in the drive. LAUGHING BOY rated along early off the inside, angled to the inside, checked sharply near the three eighths pole
and lacked a bid. IRWANI (ARG) failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
DEAR DAD broke awkwardly, raced near the back of the pack after the poor start, advanced through the far turn, raced from the outside in the stretch and
surged clear late under steady pressure. ORGANIST raced mid pack early on, moved up three to four wide around the far turn, led near the eighth pole and
kept on gamely to the wire racing four wide. CACCIATORE settled off the early going, moved up five to six wide in the stretch and closed in belatedly. ONE
FAST DREAM pressed the early pace from the inside of rivals, challenged for the lead near the eighth pole and was outkicked late. ARAK stalked the pace
from the inside, continued an inside bid around the far turn under strong ride and had no final winning bid. IMMENSE FAITH showed good early foot racing
three deep and weakened in the drive. AARON dropped back early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. FIFTY ONE FIFTY
drifted around the first turn, tired readily to race far back and was eased up through the stretch. MO TOWN BLUES prompt the pace from the outside, tired
readily and was eased up on through the upper stretch.
