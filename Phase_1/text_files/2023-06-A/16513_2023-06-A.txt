DOT COM DREAMIN settled in stalking position along the inside up the backstretch, cut the corner and launched an inside bid heading into the lane, roused
forward to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged ahead to a clear lead and held firm. PRIDEOFDIXIECREED got bumped between rivals at the start
and raced in the back, picked up the tempo and edged up closer three wide late on the turn, launched a four wide bid heading into the stretch run, steadily
advanced down the lane and had to settle for second best. STAR OF MINE sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, held firm over pursuers
around the turn then hustled up two wide into the lane, got collared by the eventual winner approaching the eighth pole and weakened to show. MIDNIGHT
RULES was unhurried and settled in the back, saved ground on the rail around the turn, hustled up along the inside through the lane and improved position.
COLORFUL NATIVE was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, continued in strong contention near the quarter pole, came three wide into the
lane and steadily weakened. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE raced in range up the backstretch, failed to advance when called upon around the turn, came three wide

HOPING FOR A RING raced four wide heading into the first turn and edged closer entering the backstretch, pressed the pace three wide up the
backstretch, remained up close still unleashed late on the far turn, given cue turning for home, dueled for command with UNDECODED down the lane,
fought on determinedly under firm handling and edged by in final strides. UNDECODED saved ground and grabbed the lead heading into the first turn, set a
pressured pace on the inside up the backstretch, held a slim lead around the far turn, took on the challenge from HOPING FOR A RING entering the lane,
dueled from the inside position and held a slight edge, fought back gamely but could not hold off the winner approaching the wire. SIMONA'S CHOICE was
away in good order and raced three wide entering the first turn, settled in good position stalking the close knit top trio up the backstretch, roused for more
mid-way around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane then angled to the inside and stayed on for a share. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE was forwardly placed
racing two wide around the first turn, pressed the pace up the backstretch, came up empty entering the far turn, retreated and jogged in.

Footnotes
XCARET led the way around the first turn and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held clear still unleashed around the far turn, hustled along
three wide into the lane, turned back bids in the final furlong and held firm. CHARMING CHARLIE rated off the front runners up the backstretch, picked up
the tempo entering the far turn, swung three wide into the lane, advanced into close contention but lacked the needed surge to get by. UNCLE CHAD
bobbled at the start, quickly recovered and saved ground around the first turn, raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane, accelerated down the
lane and just missed place. HIGHTAIL COWBOY rated off the top pair through early stages, picked up the tempo heading into the far turn, angled to the
inside in upper stretch, advanced into close contention a furlong out then gave way. GRAZEN IN THE PARK raced four wide into the first turn and was
reserved racing in the back, coaxed three wide entering the lane and failed to rally. OPTIMISTIC VALOR came up empty late on the backstretch.

APRETTYLULABY was forwardly placed and tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch, moved up closer two wide around the turn, given cue three wide
entering the lane, dug in trying to reach the game leader, stayed on determinedly and inched by late. SONG OF PRAISE broke out and bumped with rival at
the start, sped to the lead and led the way leaving the backstretch, held firm over oncoming pursuers around the turn, swung two wide into the lane, dug in
gamely on top, turned back bids into final stages then got edged out in final strides. FIREBAUGH raced two wide in range through early stages, hustled
along three wide around the turn, shifted a path wider at the head of the lane, responded when called upon and finished with good response. HAPPY
STROLL raced off the early leaders, picked up the pace late on the backstretch, advanced three wide late on the turn, continued in contention into the final
furlong then evened out late. UNGLUED lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and failed to rally. GOOD TIME GIRL was
forwardly placed in early stages, weakened around the turn and had no late response.

STAY FABULOUS held a slim lead in opening stages then vied for command with MARSHSIDE MAMA, battled on around the turn, shook free entering the
lane, repelled bids down the lane, stayed on gamely and finished clear. DELTA MOON raced in contention and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner
and given cue entering the lane, roused forward into striking distance but could not reach the winner. MARSHSIDE MAMA vied outside of the winner
through early stages and continued to battle around the turn, could not move on with eventual winner at the head of the lane but stayed on with response
and held show. FREE WILL raced in early contention and tracked the top pair, loomed three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane,
continued in contention but lacked the needed kick to get by. CZECHITOUT was not far back in early stages, flattened around the turn and continued to
falter in the lane. I BILEVE raced in the back, swung four to five wide into the lane and had no response.

CHOOS UR ADVENTURE was well placed racing just off the embattled trio, moved up four wide to engage rivals at the quarter pole, shook free turning for
home, quickly widened to a clear advantage and finished going away. SNAP'N TAP raced off the top flight leaving the backstretch, coaxed three wide
entering the lane, responded under a drive and roused forward to capture place. COWBOY CASANOVA vied three deep for the lead in opening stages and
battled on around the turn, was no match when the winner took over entering the head of the lane but stayed on and held a share. YEARS FLY BY was
unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, angled three wide for a clear path in upper stretch, finished with late response and just
missed show. TOSKA'S RULER dueled between rivals for the lead in opening stages, continued to battle for command around the turn, got overtaken by
the winner turning for home, ran into the final furlong then gave way. TIN BADGE dueled inside of a duo in opening stages, continued to match strides
around the turn, got overtaken by the winner turning for home and tired in the drive.

ONE LAST CHANT was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained off the early pace, picked up the tempo mid-way around the far turn, swung into
action five wide entering the lane, responded willingly when called upon, rallied determinedly along the outside and got up in time. TEMPLE CITY RUN was
not too far back in early stages, coaxed two to three wide around the turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, kicked in gear, accelerated down the lane
and got up late to capture place. MACH SWEDE broke sharp from the outside then conceded position to a duo, sat well placed tracking just off the
embattled pair in early stages, let out a notch leaving the backstretch, engaged HIGGAM for the lead, dueled around the turn, continued to battle for
command into deep stretch then got outkicked when a duo surged by late. HIGGAM dueled outside of BABYS TIME TO SING in opening stages then took
on the challenge of MACH SWEDE leaving the backstretch, battled for command around the turn, continued to battle back into deep stretch then got
outfinished in final stages. COUNTY JAIL raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. ESPE'S GUY was not too
far back in early stages along the inside, chased two wide around the turn and failed to move on in the lane. SARAH'S BOY BLUE raced off the early front
runners, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally in the lane. BABYS TIME TO SING dueled long the inside of HIGGAM for the lead in opening
stages, could not match strides past the three eighths pole but remained in contention, ran on into the upper stretch then came up empty in the final furlong.
GLOME raced in the back throughout.
