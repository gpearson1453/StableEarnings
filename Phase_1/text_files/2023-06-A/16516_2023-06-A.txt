META J forced pace three-wide, finished evenly. CARPIQUET dropped well back early, rallied to pass a tired rival late. PARTYATMYPLACE pressed wide
early, stalked forced pace into turn, faded. The rider aboard FORITTABLE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of PIONEER TOWN for moving out into
him in early turn. The rider aboard META J lodged a claim of foul against the rider of FORITTABLE for coming out into him in early turn. It was unclear from
both the head on and the regular replay that any interference occured. There was no change.
