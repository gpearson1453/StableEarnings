Footnotes
IKIGAI set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused at the top of the lane, drew off and was ridden out. BIZ BIZ BUZZ was in tight on the
rail leaving the chute, then tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, dug in gamely in the lane and earned the place spot. TWO STEPPIN KLUKI raced off
the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, rallied inside and finished well. TIZ A PRINCE was fractious and reluctant to load, raced off the pace, two wide
on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. SOUPER ENERGIZER raced four wide in the chute, stalked three wide, chased on the
turn and weakened. TRAINER PLEASE raced three wide in the chute, stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and weakened. TAPIO steadied between
rivals in the chute, raced off the pace and did not factor.
