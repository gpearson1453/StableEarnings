Footnotes
RHODIUMS PRIDE soon took the lead from between horses, stayed just off the inside and maintained control under urging. ZEE FIRE was away somewhat
slowly, lost ground four wide taking the bend but proved clearly best of the rest. COOGAN was checked along the rail nearing the turn when his path was
taken, angled out some on the bend, lost ground fanning widest entering the stretch and passed tired ones the final furlong to gain third near the wire.
MOCOWBELL moved to the rail near the seven-sixteenths marker then flattened out the last eighth. SOLICITOR helped prompt the pace from between
horses, was three wide taking the bend then gave way for the drive. SUNDAY SPEIGHT bore out on the turn and was allowed to coast in the stretch. Due to
a photo finish malfunction, the final beaten lengths were estimated by the Equibase chartcaller.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD boxed in early, split rivals two wide into the bend, took the lead, began to drift out under hand urging midstretch, was corrected with
right-handed pressure nearing the final sixteenth and kept a straight path after that with mild urging. PERFECT WAGER bumped with JACK VAN BERG at
the break, raced in contention early, saved ground taking the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader but proved
easily second best. KARAYEL settled well off the inside early, lost ground taking the bend and passed tired ones from the middle of the track the last furlong
to catch SHANGHAI POINT for third late. SHANGHAI POINT prominent from inside, lost his path into the turn, gradually angled out taking the bend, came
four wide into the stretch, was no match for the top pair and slowly yielded late. TIZRIK broke on top, was soon chasing JACK VAN BERG from outside,
began to retreat on the turn and continued to steadily fade in the lane. JACK VAN BERG bumped with PERFECT WAGER at the start, displayed early
speed between horses, gained the rail on the bend, was overtaken shortly after that, fanned out three wide for the stretch run and gave way.

CAMARGO bumped with SOME DUDE then AMERICAN SUCCESS at the start, soon had the advantage, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was
roused at the quarter pole, floated out some into the stretch and maintained control under steady handling. IRISH DECLARATION settled outside, picked up
his pace after a half mile, lost ground four then five wide taking the second turn, surged deep stretch and drew off for second the final seventy yards.
SHOBIZ STAR was kept close outside CAMARGO, came into the lane from path four, drifted out some midstretch, weakened the last furlong but lasted for
the show. READY REDDING was away somewhat slowly, advanced four wide on the first bend, gradually angled in with a half mile to go, moved clear for
third on the second turn, had the rail entering the lane and also flattened out late. SOME DUDE bumped with CAMARGO at the break, chased from
between horses and ran evenly the last quarter mile. AMERICAN SUCCESS bumped shortly after the start, failed to menace. JOHNNY LONGBOAT
showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SHINE DOWN stalked the early speed from outside, was two wide on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, took the lead when put to urging upper
stretch, moved clear and was kept to task to the wire. MISS KITTY PIE raced evenly from outside in the early going, came four wide into the stretch, rallied
belatedly the last furlong but caught CANTOO for second nearing the wire. CANTOO prominent from inside, found herself boxed in while just off the rail on
the bend, gained a clear path outside TENSE into the stretch, gained second inside the final sixteenth, lacked the needed late kick and was outfinished.
MOON PIES IMAGE chased from along the rail, commenced her bid into the stretch, waited for room behind TENSE, squeezed through just outside that
one after entering the last furlong and leveled off in the waning yards. GHAALEB'S RANGER soon trailed, lost ground three to five wide through the turn
and only made up minor ground late. TENSE was sent to get the early lead, gained the rail on the bend then wore down for the stretch run.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL KING shared the early lead from outside, was three wide on the bend, roused leaving the quarter pole, all out the last furlong and caught
FUTURE VISION near the wire. FUTURE VISION vied for the lead in close quarters between rivals, was put to urging on the turn, moved clear and took the
rail upper stretch, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly second best. SAFE chased from inside on the backstretch, angled out
through the bend, came four wide into the lane, drifted out some upper stretch, held a straight path inside the last eighth and caught WARNING LABEL for
third. WARNING LABEL disputed the early pace inside rivals, did not keep up leaving the turn, came off the rail some for a clear path upper stretch and
continued to gradually yield. BRASKA was altered out early for a clear path, stayed widest through the turn and failed to have a significant stretch response.
HIGH LIFE AGAIN failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. WINDIGO SPIRIT displayed early speed in tight quarters two wide between horses on the
backstretch, began to yield some on the turn, was steadied briefly midway on the bend then continued to give way.

Footnotes
COMFORT ME NOW was kept close just outside the early leader, in path three through the bend, roused leaving the turn, took the lead upper stretch,
gradually drifted out after entering the last furlong, was challenged from outside approaching the sixteenth marker but held sway in a game effort. PAPA
ROCKET hesitated at the start, chased while toward the outside, commenced his bid four wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning outside CHICKS FOR
FREE entering the stretch, engaged COMFORT ME NOW from outside with a sixteenth left and leveled off in the waning yards. FULL MAGAZINE broke
outward, bumping CHICKS FOR FREE, soon had the lead, showed the way just off the inside but slowly wore down in the stretch. CHICKS FOR FREE
bumped at the break, was hustled up to help prompt the early pace from outside, lost ground four wide through the turn and rallied belatedly deep stretch to
narrowly miss for third. TONYS MORNING LINE raced in contention from inside, did not keep up on the bend, came along the rail to threaten midstretch but
could not sustain his bid late. MAC PANDOWDY was an early factor, did not keep up five wide on the turn, angled in behind COMFORT ME NOW entering
the lane and failed to have a significant response. MKAR THE FAST hesitated then checked behind traffic at the break and was never a factor.
