Footnotes
MY BOY COLTON stalked the pace while racing along the inside, angled out on the second turn, closed willingly, drew off and won going away. SAGE
RUNNER broke out, raced close to the pace, fell back on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, came again and got up for place while no threat to the
winner. CALL ME A DREAMER pressed the pace, challenged along the backstretch, dueled for the lead, weakened in the drive and settled for show. POP
SOCKS led early, vied inside, came in a bit at the gap and faltered to lose position. THE FIRE WITHIN raced close to the pace, saved ground, bid inside
and had little left for the drive. FROG PRINCE was unhurried early, put in a steady effort and improved position. KERANOS dropped back along the
backstretch, advanced along the rail around the turn and came up empty in the drive. EL BUFFALO broke in, was never far back, advanced to the second
turn and flattened out. SEAX was not a factor. BUSHWICK BRUISER was crowded at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. CAPE COD
SUMMER was crowded at the start, raced outside and tired into the turn. FAZZANI was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
MS. BUCCHERO was away alertly, set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead under mild urging. TAP THE TITTLES raced close to the pace,
lacked room on the turn, was taken back, angled out for the drive and closed to get up for place. TALK TO THE JUDGE held a good position, bid, came up
empty and held safely for show. AWESOME PIC chased the pace, lacked a stretch response and gave way. CHICKIENESS was outrun in an even effort.
