Footnotes
JULIUS THE GREAT broke sharply to set the early pace, responded to a looming threat from PRESS GANG, and just held after a long hard drive. PRESS
GANG sat just off the leader in the four path, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole, was all out under heavy urging but was unable to get by after
determined effort. YORKTOWN sat in the three path in striking position, chased inside but was no threat to the top two leaders and held show. PERDITION
went wide through the backstretch, and was unable to improve position through the stretch. FROBISHER BAY lagged early and offered little.
DREADNAUGHT saved inside and lacked a stretch response.

DRINKING AGAIN chased four to five wide, steadied midstretch and drove clear. LINCHPIN STORM sped to the front to secure a rail position, drifted out
midstretch bothering IMPACTO and finished evenly. DANCING WILLIE raced in close quarters early, circled the field into the lane, and closed gradually
outside. IMPACTO rated wide off the pace, fanned four-wide leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader, moved up menacingly in the final furlong
then was squeezed out and finished well. BACKSTREET BOBBY chased inside, and improved position late. AWHITESPORTSCOAT trailed the field, and
rallied belatedly. SMARTY RIVER PANTS vied between and lacked a closing response. ISLE OF SKYE sat in striking distance while five wide, and gave
way in stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY and JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection was lodged by the rider of IMPACTO against the riders of LINCHPIN
STORM and DRINKING AGAIN alleging interference in the stretch run. After review by the Board of Stewards LINCHPIN STORM was disqualified and
placed fourth for interference with IMPACTO. The objection against DRINKING AGAIN was disallowed.

AFTER A FEW allowed to settle early, swept the lead, rallied inside, and held under a drive. BEAUTIFUL MESS shifted out to the four path leaving the
backstretch, rallied wide through the stretch and missed after a determined effort. KEEPMEINPOWER saved inside, advanced quickly in the final turn, and
rallied belatedly. ROSE ROSE ROSE raced wide into the lane, and finished well. TENDER LOVE trailed the field, and lodged a rail bid improving her
position. BUNNY NOREEN failed to threaten. JIG'S DESTINY flashed some early speed and tired. MILITARY SASS zipped to the front, and faltered.

GRIGORO saved ground while three wide, advanced outside in the final turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, and edged away. EL NOBLE raced in
closest pursuit from the four path, pressed the issue inside of LANNY MAC, inched clear of the aforementioned but was unable to hold off the late challenge
put forward by GRIGORO. LANNY MAC rated in the three path, dueled outside of EL NOBLE, was unable to continue on with the battle late stretch and
weakened. WYE CROSS rallied belatedly. WANDERING WEST settled outside early, hustled in the final turn, and was able to improve his position late.
LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR trailed early, lodged a mild bid, and faded. RYANWATER unhurried early, and lacked a serious bid. BIG AL'S VISION lead the
way under a snug hold, was overtaken leaving the backstretch and stopped. FINAL SAY pulled up in the backstretch, did not finish, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DECOY unhurried early, shifted outside near the five-sixteenth pole, was brushed at the head of the lane, swept the lead and won going away. MIDNITE
CHILL assumed the lead while five wide, moved clear nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken midstretch while showing signs of tiring, and finished up
second best. SILVERFOOT hurried away, fanned four-wide leaving the backstretch, drifted out brushing DECOY, shifted outside entering the stretch and
closed under encouragement to secure a show placing. NORTHERN JEWEL dropped back through the backstretch, found clear running inside, in the final
turn and missed. LAHUN broke well, saved inside, made a run into the stretch and faded. ANOTHERFORBROOKS sat midpack, experience traffic in the
stretch, and came up empty in the drive. CALI CONQUEST lagged early, and passed tiring. ALL THAT GOLD stalked from the rail, chased into the stretch,
and wilted. H K MELODY stalked four-wide, and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
NO MORE JO KING broke into SHES A COOL CAT, rated off the pace while three to four wide, dueled outside of MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA into the stretch,
and drove clear late stretch. MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA set a pressed pace inside of LADY KALIPA, moved clear of that one then was tested entering the
stretch inside of NO MORE JO KING, and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. BRYNN'S DREAM chased inside but lacked the kick that was needed.
GOLDIE SOCKS allowed to settle early, advanced inside into the final turn, and went evenly through the stretch. SHES A COOL CAT bumped leaving,
chased three to four wide, and rallied late. TAPULOUS squeezed out leaving and was able to gain closer order into the stretch. SASSY MISS ELLIOTT
broke outward leaving, angled inside leaving the backstretch, and lacked a rally. VIOLET CITY broke outward into ARANY, was reserved off the early
pacesetters, and faded gradually. LADY KALIPA contested the early pace, was unable to move on with rival with two furlongs remaining then retreated.
CINNAMON SAINT was not a factor. ARANY broke awkwardly, and was outrun.

Footnotes
BABS DELIGHT settled in a stalking position while three-wide then was roused in the final turn, angled to the rail, and won driving. CHATTY GAL broke
alertly, contested the pace outside of SVYSKYE, repelled a bid lodged by COUNT ON IT and held on after a long drive for place. COUNT ON IT stalked
five-wide, rallied between foes entering the lane, dueled outside of CHATTY GAL but was unable to muster the bid that was needed late. TAKE CHARGE
GWEN chased three-wide into the far turn, went five wide entering the lane, and lacked the rally needed. FLASHY BIZ lodged a bid nearing the quarter pole
and flattened late stretch. KERIK chased from the rail, gained closer order, and came up empty in the drive. LETS GO ALL THEWAY shifted outside in the
backstretch, and closed late under urging. FLASHY SISTER lagged early, and bid belatedly. AMBER PRINCESS offered little. ENTITLED STAR was not a
factor. SAVYSKYE contended the pace inside of CHATTY GAL, was unable to move on with rivals and tired. TALA was outrun.
