Footnotes
BABY SOX angled in while going to the front, controlled the tempo in the two path through the turn, responded well when set down after turning into the
stretch, drew off under a strong hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. BALENTINA settled just off the pace on the
inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then turned into the stretch in the two path and safely secured the place while
no match for the winner. MAGNOLIA WIND established good position just off the pace, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into
the stretch and tired while clear for the show. JERSEY COAST chased the early pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn
and came up empty. TOOSHAY was hard ridden on the outside near the back, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. IRISH EMPRESS
chased the pace, went four then three wide on the turn, came under the crop at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and faltered. AKIVA went
three wide on the turn and showed little. HAIL BRITANNIA dropped back after the start, saved ground on the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND GRACE just off the inside through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, began to advanced midway on the far turn,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three then two wide into upper stretch, rallied to take over nearing the eighth pole, then edged away
under a drive getting geared down in the final strides to the finish. SHE'S MO BUBBLY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to get on track inside the final furlong closing well on the outside to secure the place honors.
LIBRETTO (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to secure
the show honors. SETTLING STORM established the front after the start and showed the way under a rating hold along the inside through the first turn and
down the backstretch, tipped to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths when under challenge for the initial time to
the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and took to the inside straightened away, dug in and was collared just outside the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. GEOMETRIQUE three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path with one mile to run forcing PRET A TOUCHER to steady
off her heels at that station, chased four wide in the clear into the backstretch before tucking three wide into cover of a rival, went four wide through the far
turn getting placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. KEEP IT SEXY tracked the pace along
the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. PRET A TOUCHER four then three
wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path nearing one mile to run and was forced to steady off the heels of GEOMETRIQUE who tucked directly in front
of her, chased three then two wide from near the rear of the field, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. MACHIAVELLIQUE forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came
under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, faded and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

COOL QUARTET settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was roused while shifting from the rail to the three path on the turn, rallied to
the lead at the quarter-pole then kicked clear under a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, drifted out outside the
sixteenth-pole then was straightened by the rider and just held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS settled off the
pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was asked while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied outside into the final furlong,
moved in while gaining on the winner coming to the sixteenth-pole and closed well but missed while well clear for the place. JUMPSTER bumped with a rival
at the start, was pinched back between foes early, settled off the pace, was urged four then five wide on the turn and narrowly earned the show while no
match for the top two. CARIBBEAN (AUS) was carried in while showing early speed then switched out near the seven-eighths pole, tracked outside from
that juncture, made a bid in the three path with a half-mile to run then took the lead in the two path at the seven-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner
at the quarter-pole and tired then just lost the show. MUSICAL HEART broke in and bumped with a rival while off a step slow, rushed up on the outside to
get the lead then was taken under a strong hold, showed the way under tight restraint, was placed under stronger restraint late on the backstretch, lost the
lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied inside into the stretch and capitulated. AMERICAN LINCOLN settled off the early pace then dropped back near the
seven-eighths, was urged along passing the three-quarter pole, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond.

for command before taking over straightened away, dug in head to head with SPPOKY LADY and was caught with seventy yards to the finish while running
on to preserve the place honors. SPOOKY LADY dueled from the two path with ACE UP HER SLEEVE her inside, floated briefly three wide at the
three-eighths taking over the front then came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got carried out four to five wide into upper stretch by the aforementioned
foe and was headed for the front straightened away, dug in running on to the finish and held for the show honors on the wire. SHORT SHIFT four then three

to run, took over into upper stretch then was roused for more, shook clear into the final furlong, remained clear under a right-handed crop into the final
sixteenth and held under strong urging. FIRST DEPUTY was ridden along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly but missed while well clear for the place. HEIR PORT tracked the pace on the outside, made
a bid while three then two wide on the turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, dropped back into the
final furlong and weakened but held the show. BRONX BOMBER chased the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the
stretch and tired. LOHENGRIN TWO went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, lost the

Footnotes
REDISTRICTING (GB) settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused with three furlongs to run, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed
strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker and powered away under steady handling. FLY RIGHT settled on the outside in third position, traveled
three wide on the turn, was given his cue at the three-eighths, gained four wide into the stretch then made a bid near the three-sixteenths, lost touch with the
winner inside the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place. CERTIFIED LOVERBOY showed speed then was eased back off the pace,
moved to the outside then tracked the leader, issued a challenge in the three then two path on the turn, took a short lead in the four path into upper stretch,
lost the advantage to the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened but held the show. OHANA HONOR was reserved towards the rear between
foes, came under urging around the five-eighths, rounded the turn in the two path, came four wide into the stretch and improved position without
threatening. BALTHAZAR was hustled to the front then moved clear outside the seven-eighths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked
near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch then lost the advantage before the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.
CUMBERLAND settled towards the rear while inside of foes, saved ground while roused on the turn, shifted three wide inside the five-sixteenths, floated five
wide into the stretch and failed to respond then was vanned off after the race. WHENLOVETAKESOVER bobbled slightly at the start, settled off the pace,
saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. PAVON was last to commence, settled towards the rear, went three wide on the turn and failed
to threaten. ARROW OF TIME was reserved on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
SHADOW DRAGON six paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, tussled with the runner up to the finish gamely shaking away at the end.
ORMSTOWN chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, advanced on the front to take command at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, battled on inside to the finish. SAFALOW'S
MISSION chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. UNION FLEET five to six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four then
three wide nearing the nine-sixteenths, went just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, angled out six wide into
upper stretch and improved position. FORTY TWO ACE coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside in aim of the early leader before advancing to take
command six and a half furlongs from home, showed the way safely in front before coming under threat to the outside when placed to coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths, got headed at that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. KAZ PALACE coaxed from the start, led early on before
being displaced by the aforementioned foe and chased four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn placed to coaxing with
three furlongs to run, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. INSPECTOR struck the near side stall at the start and was away last, raced five to six
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HURRICANE
ANDREW chased three then two wide coming under coaxing half a mile from home, was being eased along three wide into upper stretch when the rider lost
the handle on the crop to the left side and continued on eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
KALIK strolled to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, was well rated on an uncontested lead, controlled the action while inside to the two
path on the far turn, responded well when asked inside the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, remained clear into the
final sixteenth and held under strong urging. FAR BRIDGE traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back, came under
coaxing near the nine-sixteenths, dropped to the rear under urging while two then three wide on the far turn, steadied while blocked behind horses in upper
stretch, altered in for room outside the furlong marker, gained on the winner into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy but was too late while just
able to get the place. SILVER KNOTT (GB) was last to commence then dropped to the inside, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was asked near
the five-sixteenths then moved to the two path, shifted four wide at the top of the stretch, pursued the winner while outside into the final furlong, gained into
the final sixteenth and just missed the place while clear for the show. LACHAISE was rated on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was asked at
the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. FREEDOM TRAIL raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, issued a challenge in the two to three path on the far turn, lost touch with the winner under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final
furlong and also weakened. CONGRUENT checked while tossing his head rankly off heels nearing the first turn, tossed his head again while three then four
wide going around that bend, threw his head yet again while dragging his way forward leaving the backstretch, was rated on the outside, went three to four
wide while roused on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. BELOUNI (FR) was taken under a tight hold early, tugged
eagerly on the bit while two then three wide on the first turn, remained under stout restraint onto the backstretch then settled more kindly at the rear, went
three wide for most of the far turn then shifted five wide, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
THETHRILLOFVICTORY broke out at the start bumping SEA CRUISE, chased just off the inside from near the rear of the field early on, advanced into the
far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, then drew clear through to
the finish kept to task. JUST FOR LUCK three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to secure the place honors. ATLANTA'S ACUNA forwardly placed from the start, got eased off when
pulling on the bit into the backstretch to settle three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four
wide into upper stretch and took over the front straightened away, dug in and was collared a furlong out, kept on to preserve the show honors by a nostril on
the wire. BAD LARRY three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
offered up a bid a furlong out, kept on to just miss for the show honors. BARRY THE BUILDER just off the inside tracking from just off the pace, tucked
inside through the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
FLUORESCENT BAY chased three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the far turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, went
seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. HARI chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out then flattened out through to the end. WAR PRINCE four
then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SILENT RUNNING chased
three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened. SOMAMA BEACH pulled early on against the
restraint of the rider taking command and forcing ATLANTA'S ACUNA to ease off into the backstretch, settled to cut the pace from the two path through
swift splits, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, came under challenge and took the inside route into upper
stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired. HOLDING AU PAIR sluggish early on, grew detached at the tail of the field and gave chase along the
inside, continued into upper stretch along the inside and was lightly ridden along and tapped a few times while making no impact. SEA CRUISE got bumped
at the start by THETHRILLOFVICTORY, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, retreated and went four wide into upper stretch
having gave way, then got eased home to the finish.
