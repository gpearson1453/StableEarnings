steadily handled in the lane. KNOBIESMAGICSONDE had a brief early lead then pressured the winner nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage off the rail through the turn but dropped back into the lane and settled for second best. GHOST OF ALCINA gave distant early chase toward
mid track, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. LUZIA gave chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished
evenly to pass rivals. OPPO TACO chased toward mid track, raced in the five path of the turn and showed little in the lane. WORM gave chase outside and
rounded the turn about the seven path. XTENDED STREAK came away awkwardly then angled in to give chase, raced near the rail on the turn and

leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved two deep on the far turn and came along for second later yards. LAUGHINTOTHEBANK rated close in the three

yards. FRENCHIES GOLD saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane.

in the lane. SNEAKY LYNK rated close off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. LIVANA stalked from the two

ROCKET APPEAL raced with the pace three wide through the front stretch then stalked, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dug in leaving the turn and got up the final yards. ICING rated a slim lead inside, was met by Nichiren at the nine
sixteenths pole, put that one away passing the five sixteenths and contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but was caught
in the final yards. CANDY INVASION raced well off the pace and off the rail on the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path, dueled through the stretch and just lasted for third. LATE IN THE GAME raced well off the pace about the four path, left the first turn
outside and bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail, finished well and just missed taking third. FREEDOM RIDER raced off
the rail early, chased leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. STEAL THE CASH saved ground, gave chase
from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and finished well outside. NICHIREN raced with the early pace two deep while between

Footnotes
GEORGE hustled to the front nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, rounded the turn at the rail, drew off through the upper stretch then
coasted the final sixteenth. HARLEY SIOUX raced in tight on the chute then chased outside, rounded the turn about the six path, dug in leaving the turn and
took the nod for second. SCARE DEM was bumped and steadied in the vicinity of the half mile pole, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail
on the turn, angled to the four path into the lane and just missed the nod for second. GAMBLING FEVER became anxious in the gate, broke in and made
contact with All Roads To Denis, gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. IT'S ONLY MONEY came away
awkwardly and was pinched back on the chute, settled off the early pace outside, angled in with a bid at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the
four path and flattened the final sixteenth. SMALL PAW became anxious in the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five
path and flattened in the lane. ALL ROADS TO DENIS was bumped at the break and never factored. RAISE A RUCKUS engaged in close chase through
the backstretch but weakened off the rail on the turn.

disadvantage in the three path on the far turn, dueled at even terms in the upper stretch and drew clear in later yards. COUSIN WINNIE stalked three wide,
took the lead at the half mile pole and came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met approaching the five sixteenths, raced close at the rail
on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final strides. HESSICA ducked in leaving the gate but showed the way through the
front stretch, stalked into the first turn then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide nearing the five sixteenths,
contested the edge off the rail on the far turn, dug in at even terms in the upper stretch but relented toward the sixteenth pole and was nipped from second
the final strides. LADRO DI FICHI saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in the
lane. BAYS CASTLE rounded the first turn about the six path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and
flattened in the lane. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD was forced out at the break and rounded the first turn about the seven path and showed little response
through the backstretch. HAPPY RIDE veered out leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but
weakened off the rail on the far turn. LADY CINCO DE MAYO took the lead at the rail into the first turn, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from
that point, but faded past the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
LACE REVOLUTION saved ground well off the early pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed the gap at the rail on the far turn, came
around COMPLETE SURPRISE leaving the eighth pole, took over from that one nearing mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. The latter was
hustled to the front and moved to the inside past the five eighths pole, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn
and dug in from the head of the lane, but was met toward mid-stretch and relented the final sixteenth. MYGIDGETMARIE steadied at the rail into the first
turn then stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened stride inside the eighth pole.
DULCIMER DAME rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the four
path and flattened in the lane. SOMEDAY IS TODAY settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole, raced in the
four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. BABA bobbled at the break and rounded the opening turn in the five path, gave chase past the half
mile pole but showed little response. BABY MAN settled close in the three path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded approaching the far turn.
The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul for alleged interference into the first turn, lodged by the rider of Mygidgetmarie, against the rider of
Complete Surprise.

Footnotes
SOMMER VELVET took over nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at the rail midway on the far
turn and opened up with only mild urging. CENTERFOLD ANGEL bobbled after the start and rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase toward the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, flattened stride late and just lasted for second. SOCIAL EXCLUSION saved ground off the pace, picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in through the stretch and held on for third. EMMA AND I saved
ground off the pace, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, finished well and just missed third.
SHERIFF'S KID raced boxed at the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
flattened stride. MISS WILD tapered in and stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. SO RED
THE ROSE lunged from the gate, raced in the four path on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
