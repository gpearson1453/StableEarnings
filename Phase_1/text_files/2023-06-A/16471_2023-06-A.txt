LIBERTY LIBERTY away cleanly, battled for lead early in between rivals, obtained lead approaching the turn, maintained lead through the turn, entered
stretch clear, dug in gamely to hold on at the wire. FOR MY BROTHER pressed pace two wide entering the turn, continued two wide on the turn, entered
lane three wide, responded gamely to urging and just missed. RAVENCLAW tracked pace two wide on the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn,
launched bid four wide and was outkicked. SOME ROYALTY stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, responded mildly
to urging while gaining to the wire. COUSIN NIECEY sent for lead after a good start, settled for a inside chasing position, continued along the inside on the
turn, in range entering the lane and flattened out the final sixteenth.
