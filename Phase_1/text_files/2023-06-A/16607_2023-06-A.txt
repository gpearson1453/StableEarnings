Footnotes
LUMINIFEROUS stalked the pace on the rail, tipped out on the far turn and took aim from the two path, drew alongside IRISH ROSE in deep stretch and
drove past to prove best. IRISH ROSE cleared and steered across to control the pace from inside, showed the way to the top of the lane, drifted out in the
stretch, challenged in the final sixteenth and yielded to the winner late. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) tracked from the two path, angled out on the far turn and
was fanned four deep at the quarter pole, chased three wide into the lane and finished evenly late. ANKYRAH broke well, got crowded between rivals early
then began to pull first time through the stretch and first turn, settled along the inside, saved ground while inching closer on the far turn but lacked a late bid
in the final furlong. HAPPY HAPPY hopped then got bumped and lost path at the start, trailed on the inside early, went two wide into the far turn, had to alter
from behind rivals and bumped foe past the quarter pole and could not threaten in the drive. HERON BAY broke out and bumped rival, sat off the pace two
wide, moved out and was fanned five deep at the quarter pole, got bumped late on the bend and came up empty. NICELY CURVED broke out and was
quickly corrected, was closest in pursuit in the two path early, chased three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG SPLASH was off a bit slow to begin, trailed then raced near the back early, went two wide into the turn, swung out and raced five to six wide outside a
pair of rivals into the lane, closed in under right-handed and drove clear late. ARREST stumbled leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit of the top pair early
on, drew closer and loomed three wide at the quarter pole, drew alongside the leader into the stretch, put away that rival outside the outside the eighth pole
but was outkicked by the winner late. SIR FLATTER chased along the inside into the turn, tipped out and came three to four wide into the stretch, finished
willingly but could not reach the top pair. RUN SNAPPY had good early speed then dueled for command outside BLACK MAGICIAN, inched ahead past the
five-sixteenths pole, disposed of that rival leaving the bend while being challenged by ARREST at the same time, lost command in upper stretch and
weakened through the final furlong. BLACK MAGICIAN brushed the gate to lose a step then was sent to duel from inside, fought into and around the turn,
failed to keep up with outer rivals into the lane and gave way. CITY OF CHAMPIONS chased outside a rival off the pace early, went four to five wide into the
lane and lacked a rally. HARBOR THUNDER broke a step slow and dropped back early, trailed three wide into the drive and failed to menace. SMILING AT
VAL was off slow to start, traveled four wide into the turn, moved out to the five path before angling to the three path leaving the bend and had little left for
the stretch run. PER RULING FROM HIWU, BIG SPLASH WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR bumped with DESERT DAWN twice leaving the gate, went up to take control and then cleared in the two path, drew away along the inside
then a bit off the rail on the far turn, opened up under light coaxing in upper stretch and coasted in late. KIRSTENBOSCH stalked in the three path early,
asked three wide around the far turn, overtook DESERT DAWN for second place honors but was no match for the winner. DESERT DAWN bumped twice
with ADARE MANOR in the beginning, raced alongside that rival then chased from the rail into the first turn, tipped out around the bend, remained close in
the two path into the far turn, asked right-handed around the bend, failed to find the needed response and flattened to third. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH broke
well then settled off the pace on the inside, continued to save ground around the far turn and never threatened. TIZ A MACHO GIRL was moving around just
before the start then broke in the air, raced at the back in the two path early, went outside a rival on the backstretch, started to weaken around the far turn
while moving further off the rail and had nothing left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
MCGREGOR LAKE broke slow and shifted in at the start, trailed on the inside into the turn, swung out and came five wide into the lane, flew late while
drifting in and inhaled the runner-up. GRAZED dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch but got run
down in the late stages. HIGHPLAINSDRIFTER tracked three deep into the turn, chased two wide into the lane, altered out into the clear to commence a
rally but lost his path at the sixteenth pole, kept to task after and gained the show. TOUCHDOWN KITTLE broke inward, chased between foes into the turn,
spun three wide into the lane, put in a mild bid in the final furlong but failed to find the needed late kick. BLACK AS MY HEART stalked outside rivals into the
turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. MOON ICE stalked the pace on the inside, cut the corner
into the lane, tried to get out but was boxed in along the fence and never could get a clear path to run at. MAXVILLE rated outside rivals, went three deep
into the turn, four wide into the lane, drifted and brushed inner rival midstretch and churned on late. PANTHERA'S FATE threw his head and spotted the
field several lengths, pulled hard fighting the rider while moving closer up the backstretch which concluded with running up on the heels of rivals nearing the
turn, saved ground through the bend, steered off the inside in the lane and kept trying but lacked room in deep stretch. INFINITEEXPERIENCE tracked
between foes into the turn, rounded the bend two wide, tipped out in upper stretch, got brushed midstretch then crowded between rivals with a sixteenth
remaining and was not persevered with late. CENTRE CIRCLE chased out of range to the turn, coaxed along the rail around the bend, lacked room in upper
stretch and never found room through the final furlong. EDDIE'S LAST broke well then dueled outside a rival, fought through the turn two wide, lost touch in
upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. COMMISSIONER H dropped back off the pace despite early coaxing, trailed three wide into the drive and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
JIMMY THE BOOT forwardly placed three deep into the turn, bumped with inner rival four wide into the lane, rallied three deep in the final sixteenth,
absorbed bumps late and got up. IRONDALE pressed the pace from outside to the turn, moved up to duel for command, took over from inner rival then
cleared past the quarter pole, showed the way into deep stretch, then drifted out and bumped PARS AND BIRDIES late and was overtaken by the winner.
PARS AND BIRDIES stalked outside a rival early, bumped with JIMMY THE BOOT three wide entering the stretch, rallied between in a tight spot in deep
stretch, then got pinballed and had to take up late. CARPE BELLUM settled in mid-pack off the inside, went three, four, then five wide on the turn, closed
well late and rounded out the superfecta. TWICE FOOLED brushed with outer rival then shifted in at the start, stalked along the rail then two wide into the
lane, lacked room exiting the bend and altered to the inside at the top of the lane but could not summon the needed rally after. SIPPIN WHISKEY bumped
leaving the gate, climbed up the backstretch then was taken out wide, went four to five wide around the bend and failed to find the needed response. SAN
JAC stumbled in the beginning, sat off the pace up the backstretch, went two wide early on the turn, eased out and exited the bend four wide and lacked
further response. GOTCHA LOOKIN dwelt in the beginning spotting the field several lengths, trailed on the inside through the turn and passed tired rivals.
CHIEF COUNCIL brushed leaving the gate, set the pace under pressure, dueled on the turn then lost touch with the leader past the quarter pole and
retreated in the drive. SUBMISSION bumped with inner rival at the start, chased four deep early, moved in on the turn and weakened. MAFIA MAN was off
a bit slow and floated in at the start, climbed on the backstretch then chased inside and was not a factor. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED IRONDALE FROM SECOND TO THIRD FOR COMING OUT INTO THE PATH OF PARS AND BIRDIES, CAUSING THAT RIVAL TO
CHECK HARD AND COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
SELENAIA (IRE) was keen early while bumping with inner rival first time through the stretch, tracked out of range while in hand, started to move three deep
into the far turn, drew alongside the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, took over and put away FAST AND SHINY exiting the bend, opened up under strong
handling and remained well clear to the wire. BROADWAY GIRLS stalked the leader along the inside, tipped to the two path on the far turn, kept on through
the lane but was no match for the winner. PARIS SECRET (IRE) brushed with inner rival at the start, sat off the pace two wide or outside a rival, tipped three
wide at the five-sixteenths pole, showed a mild response when asked left-handed in the lane and was along for the show. FAST AND SHINY stepped the
front and cleared while keen early on, controlled the pace up the backstretch, challenged by the winner midway around the turn, lost command at the
quarter pole, chased along the rail into the lane and flattened to fourth. PLEASANT WAVE bumped with the winner then started to pull first time in the
stretch, steadied when losing path to that rival on the clubhouse turn, traveled along the inside into the second bend, moved off the inside and could not
rally. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) traveled outside a rival at the back early, went four wide into the second turn, angled down to the two path and failed to
menace. TEA N CONVERSATION brushed with outer rival in the beginning, traveled on the inside near the back, came out on the far turn and entered the
lane four wide and failed to threaten. UNA PALABRA stalked the pacesetter two wide, got shuffled early on the far turn then again between rivals shortly
after, trailed into the lane and came up empty.

into the lane, rallied widest in the lane and got up at the wire. TIZZY TWISTER steadied three deep early, moved closer three to four wide on the far turn,
bumped with inner rival at the top of the lane, reached the front in the final sixteenth but got nailed on the line. RACE JUDICATA forwardly placed outside
rivals early, vied three deep past the quarter pole, led into the final furlong but yielded late. STARSHIP DEFIANT raced up close in the two path then applied
pressure from outside, vied between rivals while taking over late on the far turn, lost command at the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. ISSA COURT
stalked along the inside, driven two wide into the lane, bumped outer rival at the top of the stretch, lacked room in midstretch and leveled off late. LA
DEUXIEME ETOILE tugged along the inside early, saved ground into the lane, tipped out in the drive and could not rally. SHE'S A BIT SASSY was off a bit
slow, sat off the pace between foes early, got boxed in on the far turn and had to tip out four wide into the lane and was not a factor. KO OLINA took control
from inside, led under pressure in the middle stages, vied inside a pair of rivals and relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, then weakened in the furlong
grounds. DANZING CAT was off slow from outside, tracked between foes on the backstretch, lost ground two to three wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) broke a step slow, trailed early then went outside a rival into the turn, angled out across the dirt and into the lane, responded
when asked right-handed and reeled in the runner-up. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) sat off the pace two wide, angled seven wide across the dirt, rallied to the front at
the eight pole while drifting in, cleared inner rivals but got run down by the winner late. JOHNNY PODRES settled near the back early, saved ground
through the turn, trailed into the stretch, steered out in the lane, summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. TIZ PLUS raced near the off the inside, angled
in on the turn, chased between foes into the final furlong and earned a minor award. DON'T SWEAR DAVE vied inside rivals early then ceded command
and stalked in-hand, went two wide into the turn, angled crossing surfaces and came six wide into the stretch but faltered in the late stages. HARBORED
MEMORIES stalked four wide into the turn, traveled three wide then bid outside the leader on the turn, got forced out by that rival crossing the dirt, fought
back into the final furlong but flattened in deep stretch. UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) showed keen early foot vying for command then took control,
angled to the rail on the turn, drifted out and bumped rival crossing onto the dirt, led through upper stretch, then lost command at the eight pole and
weakened. GOLIAD forwardly placed from inside early, boxed in behind the leader at the quarter pole, remained inside into the lane and never found room
through the stretch run. ATOMIC DROP raced up close in the three path, remained off the rail to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
NINEELEVENTURBO tracked outside a rival early, eased out on the far turn and came four wide into the lane, bid five deep entering the final furlong,
dueled with HUDSON RIDGE late and drove clear. HUDSON RIDGE stalked in the two path, tipped out and bid three deep into the lane, took over in upper
stretch, dueled with the winner into deep stretch and got outkicked. SEVEN CHARMS raced in range on the inside, chased two wide into the lane, split foes
in upper stretch and got outkicked. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT tracked between foes then raced a bit off the rail, angled four wide leaving the far turn and
summoned a mild response to round out the superfecta. ONCOMING lagged behind early, inched closer leaving the backstretch, traveled along the rail then
two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and improved position. GHAZAALY raced three deep then outside a rival in the two path, got floated five wide
into the lane and needed to find more late. DURANTE dueled for command from outside to the top of the stretch, could not stay on with the leader past the
eight pole and weakened in the late stages. FLINT STROLL fractious in the gate, raced on the inside towards the rear inched closer two wide nearing the far
turn, had to pause briefly at three-eighths pole, chased three deep at the quarter pole and failed to menace. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) settled inside,
coaxed along while continuing to save ground on the far turn, asked right-handed into the drive and could not respond. MO THEM DOWN stumbled slightly
at the start but was still away quickly and went up to duel from inside, fought to the top of the stretch, then gave way in the final furlong. SWEET SAVANT
raced outside a rival near the back, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.
