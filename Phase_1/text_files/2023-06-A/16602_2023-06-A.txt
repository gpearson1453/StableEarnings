POWERFULLY BUILT bobbled at the break, dueled three wide early, then stalked the leaders, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took over, drew clear
under urging and coasted the final yards. SWOT ANALYSIS broke inward, dueled between rivals early, dueled two wide on the turn, dug in gamely inside in
the stretch run and held second. CHOCOLATE SHAKE broke open the gate prior, raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, came two wide into the
lane and rallied in the two path. PRISONER raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came five wide into the lane and gained mildly outside. SENATE
CHAMBER raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, moved up between rivals entering the stretch and finished evenly. SAINT SELBY dueled inside for the
lead and gave way midway on the turn. MAGICAL WARRIOR was off slowly and steadied, dropped back early, was pulled up on the backstretch and
vanned off. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, along with a Jockey Objection by the rider of MAGICAL WARRIOR against SWOT ANALYSIS, after
which the race was declared official.
