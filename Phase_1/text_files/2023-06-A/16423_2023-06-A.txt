Footnotes
SPECTACULO stalked off the rail then took the nod two deep approaching the five sixteenths pole, drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily
handled in the lane. AIR MEDAL saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path and finished well to clear second later yards. CHASE LIL ME saved ground off the pace on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to about the five path leaving the turn and finished evenly to take third later yards. CHIPPEWA'S
CASTLE veered in at the break and set the early pace inside, was met toward the five sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point but dropped back at the
rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride in the lane. MADDEYE MOODY rated close to the early pace off the rail, gave chase approaching the three
eighths pole but weakened in the four path on the far turn. MASTER YOO was shut off at the break and rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. PONTICELLO was shuffled back early, raced in the three path on the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. The Stewards reviewed then dis-allowed a claim of foul against the rider of Spectaculo for alleged
interference on the far turn, lodged by the rider of Chippewa's Castle. In addition, this race was hand timed.

deep midway on the far turn, edged clear approaching the head of the lane and held well under steady handling. ZIGGY STARDUST raced with the early
pace two deep but drew clear nearing the half mile pole, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn, dropped
back toward the head of the lane and settled for second best. MOON FALL stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole and raced two deep on the far turn, then dueled through the stretch for third. BAD LINEAGE veered out at the break then saved ground, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. KING OF LUCK was shuffled back at the
start then saved ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. COURT TUDOR showed
little response through the backstretch. TO THE TOP hit the gate and made contact with. SENZA STRIKE leaving the gate, rounded the turn about the three

Footnotes
MAGGIE'S GIRL took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and rated a clear pace, was urged away at the rail on the turn then kept alert through the
stretch. LIL BOUGIE ran loose in the post parade then gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and settled for second best.
CARMELIZED exchanged contact with Wooden Ships leaving the gate, gave chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn, then relented in the stretch duel
for second. POLISH THE DIAMOND chased the early pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
JUBA'S PARADE broke inward and hit the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn about the six path and passed rivals outside. CANDY LOVES HONEY
was bumped inward and into Wooden Ships leaving the gate then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased outward leaving the turn but
showed little further. SMOKIN LADY had a brief early lead then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the turn and
weakened in the lane. WOODEN SHIPS was bumped then jostled at the break, gave chase through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn and
weakened in the stretch. FLATTERING WAY saved ground. UNALTERED gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path.
