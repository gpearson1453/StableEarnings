Footnotes
SWEETLOU'SGOTACES four wide in pursuit down the backstretch settled in mid pack, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and closed well to just get up in the final strides to the wire. CADENCIA prompted early and then dueled
in hand along the inside of FREDDYMO FACTOR, shook off her main rival near the quarter pole and got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and was nailed on the wire. WINGS LIKE EAGLES settled just off the
inside near the rear of the field and pulled against the bit early on while under reserve, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and altered out around a
injured rival nearing that station, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. FORTINENO (IRE) just off the
inside just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up mild bid. FREDDYMO
FACTOR broke out at the start bumping PARTY ON GIRL, showed the way under some pressure and then dueled three then two wide with CADENCIA to
her inside, got shaken off just outside the quarter pole and went four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) just off
the inside tracking the front from mid pack, tucked inside at the half mile pole, got given a notch with five-sixteenths to go, then got checked just after
bobbling over a fallen rival near the quarter pole, altered four wide into upper stretch and was not persevered with to the finish. PARTY ON GIRL (IRE)
bumped at the start by FREDDYMO FACTOR, who broke outwards, saved ground near the rear of the field, was in the midst of tipping out to the two path
when forced to check and alter course around a fallen foe near the quarter pole, went six to seven wide for home and was not persevered with to the end.
MASHNEE GIRL three then two wide just off the duel up front, suffered an injury and fell near the quarter pole forcing a trio of rivals to alter course and was
subsequently euthanized on track.

the quarter-pole, took over the lead in upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. UNION
SUIT was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure from her outside, vied inside on the turn, shook clear at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost the
advantage to the winner under urging in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong then moved out and proved no match for the winner while clear for
the place. LIVING MAGIC brushed with a rival just after the break, was squeezed back between horses early, went two then three wide on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, gained while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and secured the show. GOLDEN GHOST (GB) pressed the pace on the
outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths, chased into the stretch and tired. DONATE LIFE chased the
pace, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, climbed into the kickback in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
PARNAC (FR) just off the inside tracking from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and was up in the final jumps to prevail. STRIKINGLY SPUN broke out at the start bumping SHAD NATION, attended that foe in closest aim just off the
inside patiently handled until set down taking the two path into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out drifting in very slightly, dug in under
threat and was caught in the final strides to the wire. FEDERALIST PAPERS saved ground at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until set down
taking the inside route into upper stretch, had a clear lane just off the fence initially between foes and then went on through a tighter seam a furlong out as
STRIKINGLY SPUN came in very slightly as SHAD NATION came out very slightly, had the rider release the right handed rein to go to a right handed crop
and came in impeding SHAD NATION on the fence forcing that rival to check sharply, the rider pausing himself to look back to assess the damage done,
then kept on to secure the show honors at the end. BE UP tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes, then got outfinished in the late stages. PEACE SEEKER two to three wide in pursuit from near the
rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home and offered no response. SHAD NATION got bumped at the
start by STRIKINGLY SPUN, who broke outwards, established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was headed near
the eighth pole, then had FEDERALIST PAPERS come inwards under a right handed crop and was forced to check sharply when impeded inside the eighth
pole, couldn't recover thereafter. ENSEMBLE (IRE) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run. After review, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
DADDY KNOWS prompted the pace on the outside, dropped back under extra left-rein guidance with three furlongs to run, was coaxed in the three path
under a snug left-handed grip navigating the turn, chased in the four path into upper stretch, gained to make an outside bid near the furlong marker, took the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead at the that pole and prevailed under good handling. SUNDAESWITHSANDY showed
speed then set the pace, vied inside on the turn, shook clear with three furlongs to run, was put to a drive into upper stretch, came under a right-handed
crop outside the furlong marker, lost the lead to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought with that foe to the wire and missed while clear for the place.
SIX PERCENT broke a step slow, moved in near the three-quarter pole, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, moved out in
upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. WILD BANKER bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up with a tug of the left
rein, showed speed then settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up empty. MASON MANIA bumped
with a rival at the start then was squeezed back between foes, settled on the inside, was roused while saving ground on the turn and failed to respond.
GANDY DANCING was forwardly placed on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn and capitulated. LATE NIGHT LARRY broke a step slow, was
urged along at the rear, fell well behind before the half-mile pole and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
L STREET LADY chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths and tipped out two then three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then inched away in the late stages. UNIFIED ALLIANCE six paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked five then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to spin three wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was collared with seventy yards to go while clear for the place honors. WILDHAWK
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three paths off the rail, remained three wide into the turn keeping both AUNT BECCA and UNIFIED
ALLIANCE four and five wide respectively, had the rider sneak a peek over his left shoulder and tucked to the two path at the three-eighths, came under
pressure and was placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened
in the late stages. CHOCOLATE GELATO brushed the off side stall at the start, came under coaxing briefly and chased five paths off the inside, tucked to
the two path into the turn before making her way to the rail three furlongs from home, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, took the inside route
into upper stretch with a clear path down inside and tipped out three then four wide at the three-sixteenths forcing AUNT BECCA to steady and paused off
her heels, then weakened to the finish. AUNT BECCA four wide in aim of the front, remained four wide into the turn before tucking three wide at the
three-eighths when placed to coaxing, swung three wide into upper stretch and got forced to pause and steady off the heels of CHOCLATE GELATO as that
rival tipped out directly in front, then weakened through to the wire.

NOLO CONTESTO pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the five path on the turn, pursued the pacesetter under a left-handed crop while still on his
inside lead in upper stretch, made a bid outside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole then reached even terms with the
leader, fought with two foes to the finish and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. TENEBRIS broke out and bumped with a foe then was taken up while
pulled off that foe with the left-rein, settled off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted to the three path, was roused near the
quarter-pole, paused behind the leader from the three-sixteenths to the eighth-pole, altered in for clear room at that juncture then rallied inside of the top
two, closed well into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the show. WIN FOR GOLD went straight to the front, showed the way under some
pressure while well off the rail, vied in the four path on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, led under a drive to the
sixteenth-pole, battled with two opponents to the finish and just missed while clear for the show. INEVTABL CONECTION lost his footing some at the start
then was bumped on both sides, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into the final
furlong and weakened. CHARGER bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. TURNSANDCONDITIONS was bumped on both sides at the start then stumbled and dropped back, went three wide on the turn
and was no factor. BUILT TO LAST settled on the outside, dropped back while moving from the six path to the four path on the turn, floated six wide into
upper stretch and had nothing left. DADS GOOD RUNNER was well placed just off the pace, made a bid along the rail on the turn, dropped back near the
five-sixteenths and capitulated.

to duel from the three-eighths, took over narrow command with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat, was displaced
from the front straightened away in the two path into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on safe for the place honors. YO YO

stretch, kept on under a drive through the stretch to be along for the show honors well clear of the rest. FROSTY THE GIANT coaxed from the gate, chased

Footnotes
PREREQUISITE was hustled to the front, dropped to the hedge entering the first turn, showed the way on the inside through solid fractions, shook clear
when set down into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop under threat from the runner-up
late and just held under strong urging. BE YOUR BEST (IRE) tucked into the three path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace while on her own, moved
closer while shifting from the two path to the four path on the final turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to make a
bid coming to the sixteenth-pole, fought with the winner to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. REVALITA (FR) leaned out at the start,
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused late on that bend, swung five wide into
the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. SPANSIVE dropped to the two path into the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was given her cue just inside the five-sixteenths, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and was
outfinished. ALLAMERICANBEAUTY was hustled from the gate then taken up under tight restraint nearing the first turn while beaten to the lead, saved
ground while rated just off the pace in the second flight, came under urging on the far turn and lacked the needed response. THIRTY THOU KELVIN went
three wide on the first turn, was rated outside in the second flight, traveled three wide around the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. VENENCIA (FR) was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground at the rear of the field, spun three wide into the stretch,
was guided out outside the furlong marker then lugged in some under a left-handed crop and was no factor.

Footnotes
WILLINTORISKITALL just off the inside off an early pace dispute, advanced to emerge from that quartet head to head with THE GOLDEN ONE five furlongs
from home, knocked heads tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, shook off his early pace rival and took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in bracing for the challenge of LAUREL VALLEY to the outside, got headed for command a furlong from home, fought on inside
gamely to get the nod on the wire by a nostril. LAUREL VALLEY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at near the quarter pole, swung three
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command a furlong from home, dug in dueling through to the finish battling on gamely to the end but was
ultimately bested on the wire. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF got bumped at the start by CONTROL ALT DELETE due to pressure from SIR LANCE, who broke
outwards, advanced and vied briefly five wide outside a pair before being shaken off with five furlongs to go, tucked inside through the turn coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. BANKINGONACHANCE chased three to
four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing with three furlongs to run, angled four wide into
upper stretch and kept on to the finish. WAYWARD GHOST chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, improved position to the finish. SHARP PLAY BOY four to five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CONTROL ALT DELETE got bumped at the start by
SIR LANCE and in turn bumped RIPE FOR MISCHIEF, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home
and offered no response. SIR LANCE broke out at the start bumping CONTROL ALT DELETE into RIPE FOR MISCHIEF, vied briefly four wide until shaken
off five furlongs from home, tucked inside through the turn getting put to coaxing midway, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and tired. THE
GOLDEN ONE vied early on three wide among a trio and then emerged to duel with WILLINTORISKITALL to his inside, tucked to the two path through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and tired in the drive.
FORWARD CAST chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into
upper stretch and tired. MR. MARLIN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, made no
impact. VOLCKER RULES chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home and never got involved.
