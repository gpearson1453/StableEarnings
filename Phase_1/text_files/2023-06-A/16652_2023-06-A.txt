DOUGS MORNING PICK unhurried for five furlongs, rallied inside rivals to engage the leader in upper stretch, dug in under left handed urging and proved
best in a stiff drive by a narrow margin. HENRY MAC drifted out at the start, prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, set the balance of
the pace and just missed hanging on. VISUAL MISSION offered a mild bid three wide on the far turn and into the stretch then leveled off. YOU'RE MY BOY
BLUE vied for the lead three wide into the stretch and weakened. SPEEDY MOBILE allowed to settle, drew closer two wide before a half then came up
empty. NEBULOSA away alertly, set the pace into the far turn, had speed into the stretch and gave way late. JUST TAPIT IN was in tight at the start and
trailed.

Footnotes
CLIFTONS BALLERINA prompted the early pace, rallied two wide to make the lead midway on the turn, set the balance of the pace and drew clear under
right handed urging. HOSANNA set the early pace, chased the winner the balance of the trip, drifted from the five path to the seven path late despite right
handed urging bumping MISS ELLIE and held on for second. CAN I GO TOO allowed to settle, swung wide, rallied outside rivals, steadied nearing the wire
and just missed getting up for second. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS never far back, finished with good courage two wide. MISS ELLIE forwardly place along the
inside, angled out on the turn, closed determinedly in the six path through upper stretch, was bumped and put in tight late causing her rider to check nearing
the turn and lost momentum. EASTER PRIDE inside, went evenly. DANCING GRACE hopped at the start and had brief speed. SWEET CHELSEA trailed.
THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF MISS ELLIE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF HOSANNA
FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETECH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED HOSANNA AND PLACED HER FIFTH.

Footnotes
RONNI'S STORM away alertly, opened a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace unchallenged and won as much the best while drifting out to the six
path under right handed urging. TIGER TRAIL settled, moved up three wide into the stretch, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and finished second
best. ACCURATE was bumped and squeezed at the start, saved ground and finished with good courage. THE MAN CAN was bumped at the start, swung
wide and lacked the needed response. FOREIGN bore out at the start bumping rivals, chased the winner through the turn then weakened.
