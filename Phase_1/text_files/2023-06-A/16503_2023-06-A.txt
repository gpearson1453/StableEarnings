Footnotes
ANCHORS AND SPURS was well placed racing just off the top trio entering the turn, hustled up along the rail at the quarter pole then shifted three wide
entering the stretch run, steadily advanced down the lane and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. CEL'S STAR hustled up along the rail out of the gate and
engaged DAWSON'S STORM for the lead, remained inside and battled on around the turn, gained a slight edge entering the lane then edged away on top
leaving the eighth pole, continued to dig in determinedly under firm handling but could not hold off the late gaining winner. DAWSON'S STORM vied outside
of CELS STAR for the lead in early stages, battled on two wide around the turn, could not maintain equal terms approaching the furlong marker but
remained in striking distance then evened out in late stages. CUPIDS SWEETY vied for the lead racing between foes in opening stages, could not move on
with the top pair leaving the backstretch, ran on two wide around the turn, flattened out and ran on evenly in the final furlong. STROLLER BOY raced in the
back although never terribly far back in the early going, hustled along three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the lane and ran on one paced.

Footnotes
BRICKBAT was away in good order and settled into tracking position just off the top pair around the first turn, remained well placed sitting just off the top
duo up the backstretch, given cue to pick up the pace late on the far turn, roused forward three wide in upper stretch, engaged the top pair for the lead
approaching the eighth pole, responded under a drive, gained a narrow advantage over HUNKA BURNIN LOVE then dug in gamely under a drive and drew
clear. HUNKA BURNING LOVE sped to the lead in opening stages and led the way around the first turn, quickly came under pressure from SAVAGE
entering the backstretch, vied for the lead with rival with a half mile left to run, continued to battle along the inside around the turn, took on the added
challenge of BRICKBAIT approaching the eighth pole, fought back gamely into the final furlong then gave way grudgingly. SAVAGE was forwardly placed
racing two wide around the first turn, pressed the pace racing under slight restraint into the backstretch, moved up to engage HUNKA BURNIN LOVE for the
lead near the half mile marker, battled for command into upper stretch, could not move on past the eighth pole and flattened out. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT
raced three wide into the first turn and settled in the back, came four wide into the lane and had no response when called upon.

CHAI TEA was well placed tracking the embattled pair in the opening quarter, moved up closer late on the turn, swung into action three to four wide entering
the lane, roused forward and engaged SLUSHY for the lead mid-stretch, got brushed when rival drifted out approaching the sixteenth pole, dug in gamely
under firm handling and drew clear. SLUSHY vied inside of HAIL COLUMBIA for the lead up the backstretch then shook free entering the turn, continued
lead the way into upper stretch, dug in under left handed pressure, came out a couple paths and brushed CHAI TEA when rival moved up approaching the
sixteenth pole, fought back then got outfinsihed. JAVISTHA raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane, churned on and gained a share. BREW
CASA lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. HAIL COLUMBIA broke on top and quickly came under
pressure from SLUSHY, dueled with rival up the backstretch, could not maintain equal terms entering the turn, weakened and continued to falter in the drive.

Footnotes
CANDENZA tracked the pace on the inside through early stages, edged closer and waited patiently along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner and got
clear, advanced into striking distance, dug in gamely along the rail and got up in time. CRIMSON ZIP raced near midpack in early stages, circled up three
wide to engage rivals for the lead at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, angled in a couple paths and roused forward to the lead, stayed on
determinedly two wide and got denied in final strides. JONATHAN WHO was allowed to settle in opening stages, picked up the tempo entering the turn,
loomed boldly four wide near the quarter pole, swung five wide into the lane, continued in close contention and sustained bid to the wire. LOVER BOY
dueled up the backstretch and battled on around the turn, weakened out of the top flight at the head of the lane and steadily weakened. NORTH SIDE vied
inside of LOVER BOY in opening stages and fought back around the turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then came up empty near the eighth pole. ACE
GILFORD raced up close in early stages, weakened around the turn and faded through the lane. POKER PLAY raced in the back and failed to move into
contention.

Footnotes
MAHOMES sped to the lead in opening strides and led the way around the first turn, set the pace and saved ground up the backstretch, held firm over
pursuers around the far turn, roused for m ore in upper stretch, responded willingly and pulled away. GREEDY CREEDY stalked the leader two wide up the
backstretch, launched a bid for MAHOMES around the turn, sustained bid into the lane but was no match for the winner. SMART N INTUITIVE tracked the
pace just off the inside up the backstretch, launched a bid heading into lane and ran on for a share. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced in the back, hustled up
entering the far turn, hustled along into the lane and needed more for late impact. JOHN R raced four to five wide off the early pace, edged a bit closer
around the far turn then gave way in the lane. KWAI CHANG showed response up the backstretch then retreated around the final turn.
