Footnotes
NEWPORT BRIDGE pressed the pace of FLYING IN STYLE from the outside two then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and taking
over command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. TWIRLING VINE
bobbled at the start and came inwards taking over the lane of THANK YOU JON forcing that rival to steady, chased along the inside until tipped briefly two
before going three wide at the three-eighths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun three wide for home, offered up a mild kick running
through the stretch greenly on the wrong lead until the late stages. FLYING IN STYLE broke out at the start bumping SPOOFY in tandem with THANK YOU
JON, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from the eventual winner to the outside, took to the two path through the
turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front taking the inside route into upper stretch, ran on to preserve the show honors. THANK
YOU JON broke in at the start bumping SPOOFY in concert with FLYING IN STYLE, then got forced to steady off the heels of TWIRLING VINE conceding
four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two then three wide, angled five wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, kept on to the finish
but was out-finished in the late stages. FAST BUCK FREDDY chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. LEFTEMBEHIND lost his rear footing at the
start conceding three lengths to the front, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from three
furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SPOOFY got bumped between foes at the start and conceded two lengths to the
leader, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
BOLD JOURNEY came away in front then quickly dropped to the rear, settled comfortably at the back, was roused in the two path on the turn, commenced
a rally in upper stretch, moved in while gaining inside the furlong marker, closed strongly along the rail to make a bid at the sixteenth-pole and got up under
good handling to prevail. SOSUA SUMMER was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the hedge on the turn, shifted to the two path at the
quarter-pole, tipped out a path while asked for his best inside the three-sixteenths, chased the leading duo into the final furlong, reached even terms for the
lead into the final sixteenth, fought with his stablemate to the finish and missed while able to get the place. ELUSIVE EDGE went to the front, set a joint
pace while inside of a foe, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked at the three-sixteenths, fought on well into the final furlong, led to the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the show. FAMOUS GENT was rated just off the pace between horses, traveled around the turn in the
three path, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out outside the furlong marker and finished willingly
to just miss the show. THREE ZERO showed good speed, set a joint pace on the outside of a foe while loosely between horses, vied in the three then two
path on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, battled on even terms for the lead into the final sixteenth but was out-kicked and missed the
superfecta. CARPE'S DREAM broke out at the start, was reserved towards the rear, went around most of the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail near
the quarter-pole, raced under a drive into the final furlong, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. FREDO settled on the outside,
was roused four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. GIANT'S FIRE settled near the back, saved ground on the turn, came three wide into the
stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. WINTER SON raced just off the pace between rivals, went two then three wide on the turn, chased
under a drive into the final furlong and also lacked the needed response. CAMM' DUKE stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the
turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CICCIOBELLO chased along the inside briefly before tipping to the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, rallied and spun two to three wide
into upper stretch taking command straightened away, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat to the outside and gamely held safe
to prevail. METEORITE led briefly early on before settling in pursuit four wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the leader
slipped away, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish while well clear of the rest
and along second best. BATTLEOFLEXINGTON coaxed from the gate, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. REFUAH broke in at the start, came under hustling and
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL broke
in at the start brushing the near side stall and filling the space left vacant by MUGSY FURY, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. WOODSIDE WARRIOR coaxed from the start, established the front with seven and half furlongs to run
and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing and widened away tucked to the inside through the turn, had the field take closer order
nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded command straightened away, then folded in the stretch. MUGSY FURY dwelt at
the start and then shied from the assistant starter's leg kicking motion and conceded at minimum ten lengths to the front before chasing unsettled and
green, detached at the tail of field from the rest of his rivals, tucked to the two path through the turn and was under coaxing midway, went three wide into
upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
IN ITALIAN (GB) came away in good order and went straight to the front, was well rated under a snug hold while setting an uncontested pace well off the
inside, moved in late on the backstretch, controlled the action while two path to the hedge on the turn, responded well when asked into upper stretch then
kicked clear under a drive, was given one pop of a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop and was given one pop
outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong hand-ride while best. SPENDARELLA stumbled while off a bit slow then was forced out, moved
up after recovering to track the pace inside of an opponent to the three-quarter pole, followed the leader on her own from that point, moved out near the
nine-sixteenths, stalked outside in the three then two path going around the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner in upper
stretch, kept on in pursuit in the final furlong and earned the place. WAKANAKA (IRE) came away in good order, was reserved on the outside, came under
urging while three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. NEW YEAR'S
EVE hit the inside of the gate and was off a bit slow then forced in, raced off the pace under reserve, moved closer around the nine-sixteenths, was roused
while inside on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path under the crop and lacked the needed response then missed the show. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL
(FR) broke a bit slow then came inward, was reserved off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide on the turn, was
roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and also lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
FROMANOTHAMUTHA broke out at the start bumping ARREBATO in tandem with ICE ROAD, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside from just off
the pace, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, took over command with
three-sixteenths to go and inched away under a drive and held sway kept to task. ICE ROAD broke in at the start bumping ARREBATO in concert with the
aforementioned foe, chased briefly three wide before taking to the four path around some debris just inside seven furlongs to run, advanced to prompt the
pace tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch taking over brief and narrow
command, got collared with three-sixteenths to run and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. SKYLANDER chased along the inside under a
rating hold down the backstretch and into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the
show honors. ARREBATO got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. ENDOWED five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAKAR coaxed from the gate, showed
the way in hand from the three path, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxed under pressure three furlongs from home, yielded the front
spinning two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. THUNDERIAN chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled in to take the inside
route into upper stretch, tired. LONG TERM coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three

Footnotes
ROTKNEE was restless and charged the front of the gate prior to the start, went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms while
inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under the crop near the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging.
COLLABORATE broke near the rear of the field then dropped back, was hard held at the rear, came under stronger restraint while keen from the
nine-sixteenths to near the three-eighths, was let out while dropping from three to two wide at that point, found his best stride in the final furlong and finished
with good energy to just get the place. DOT'S DOLLAR bumped with opponents on both sides at the start, was well placed just off the pace while inside of a
rival, came under urging in the two path on the turn, chased into the final furlong and tired then just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
SCOCCIATORE bumped lightly with a foe at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue while three wide on the turn, chased under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened then missed the trifecta. SAFFA'S DAY broke a bit awkwardly, was reserved under a tight hold towards the rear,
steadied some behind a foe near the nine-sixteenths, shifted from four to five wide early on the turn, continued five wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. LISTENTOYOURHEART bumped with foes on both sides at the start, settled under some urging, came under stronger encouragement in the
three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HIGH OAK settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. AMUNDSON bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path
on the turn then driven three wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. HIGH CONNECTION was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on
the turn and failed to respond then also faltered. DREAM SHAKE was very hard held between foes then checked outside the nine-sixteenths, went two then
three wide while let out on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered.

CONMAN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under pressure from BE THE BOSS to the outside, remained
patiently handled and was set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and held gamely to prevail. BE OF COURAGE four wide in
pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered
up a mild kick to close in late and shied in under an off sided stick forcing both BLAME IT ON DADDY and NOBLE HUNTSMAN to take hold in the final
steps to the finish while getting up for the place honors in the last jump. ORTUS four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. NOBLE
HUNTSMAN seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, got eased off to tuck four wide half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid being taken in hand late with steps to the finish as BE OF COURAGE shied
inwards. BLAME IT ON DADDY got bumped between foes at the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid and was briefly taken in hand in the final strides to the finish as BE OF COURAGE crossed in front shying
in. FEATHERS ROAD chased just off the inside from just off the pace, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, wakened in the late stages. BE
THE BOSS broke out at the start bumping a pair of rivals in tandem with ATHENRY, pressed the pace three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued three wide for home, shied in under a right handed crop a furlong out and weakened in the late going. KREESA three wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MR. KRINGLE chased five then four wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, cornered five wide for home, weakened in the late going. WAR TERMINATOR coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, faded
near the five-sixteenths and spun two to three wide for home and weakened. ATHENRY broke in at the start bumping a pair of rivals in concert with BE THE

Footnotes
MARKETSEGMENTATION went to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace in the two path, responded well when set down after turning
into the stretch, extended the advantage under a pop of a right-handed crop into the final furlong, remained clear under the crop into the final sixteenth and
held under strong urging. DIDIA (ARG) was fractious in the gate then taken in hand early, went two then three wide on the first turn, was rated in third
position, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, gained on that
foe late and finished with good courage to garner the place. MCKULICK (GB) was taken under a tight hold early then reserved near the back in the two
path, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, gained willingly on the winner late and just earned the show.
FLIRTING BRIDGE (IRE) was reserved under snug restraint on the inside, came under encouragement outside the quarter-pole, moved off the rail under a
drige in upper stretch, gained some in the final furlong and just missed the show. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) was taken in hand early, traveled three wide around
the first turn, was reserved on the outside without the benefit of cover, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths,
came four wide into the stretch and gained some but missed the superfecta. WAR LIKE GODDESS was taken under a hold early, rounded the first turn in
the three path, was reserved while unhurried at the rear, went four wide on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under
a drive and gained some ground but failed to impact. SHANTISARA (IRE) was hustled from the gate, went around the opening bend in the two path, stalked
behind the leader, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened.

PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung five wide for home, rallied to take command just outside the eighth pole outside a pair, dug in gamely to fend off the runner up and prevail by a head
at the finish. DORTH VADER chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, tipped out to the two path at the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, was loosely between foes with three-sixteenths to go, dug in and fought on to the finish in game fashion
but was ultimately denied at the end. OCCULT steadied at the start when MUNNYS GOLD came inwards, chased four to five wide down the backstretch
trading lanes with FROSTY O TOOLE in a private spat separate from the rest of the field, tucked just off the inside through the turn, went five wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick closing belatedly outside. MUNNYS GOLD broke in at the start forcing OCCULT to steady off her heels, showed the
way in hand five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn while under some pressure from a pair, continued just
off the inside for home under threat from a pair of rivals, got collared near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. ACCEDE broke in at the start
bumping GOODGIRL BADHABITS, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, took the inside route
into upper stretch and weakened. RANDOMIZED chased five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went six wide for home and
weakened. FROSTY O TOOLE chased four then three wide trading lanes briefly down the backstretch with OCCULT, came under coaxing with
seven-sixteenths remaining, went five to six wide for home, made no impact. GOODGIRL BADHABITS stumbled at the start and was bumped by ACCEDE,
chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went two to three wide into upper stretch and folded.

quarter-pole then took the lead in upper stretch, fought outside of a foe into the final furlong, shook clear near the sixteenth-pole and proved best under
strong urging. THE GREY WIZARD (IRE) angled in early, was reserved near the back on the outside while three to four wide, moved closer on the final turn,
chased under a drive in the stretch and just got up for the place. BRITISH ROYALTY settled on the inside, hugged the hedge while reserved off the pace,
came under some urging on the final turn, squeezed through against the rail in the stretch and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the
show. AMAZING GRACE (GER) was reserved on the inside, came under urging on the final turn, squeezed through to make a bid along the hedge into the
stretch, battled with the winner under a drive until inside the furlong marker then was outfinished. CIBOLIAN was reserved towards the rear while two path to
the inside, came under urging on the third turn and improved position. HIGH DEFINITION (IRE) was reserved on the outside, went four wide on the turns,
was asked on the final bend, chased into the final furlong and came up empty. TIDE OF THE SEA went to the front, showed the way while two path to the
inside, lost the lead near the seven-eighths then regained the advantage outside the five-eighths, was headed by the winner into upper stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and gave way. BARBADOS (IRE) was hard held while saving ground early, rounded the second turn in the two path, was reserved
towards the back, went three then four wide on the final turn and failed to threaten. STRONG TIDE was reserved while two path to the inside, came under
encouragement going around the final turn and also failed to rally. CHANNEL MAKER tracked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was asked
on the final turn, chased into the final furlong and weakened. TARTINI was reserved while in the three path, came under urging in the two path on the final
turn and lacked the needed response. L'IMPERATOR (FR) was last to commence, tugged hard on the bit in the two path under a vigorous hold, moved out
five wide midway through the second turn, rushed up on the outside to get the lead nearing the seven-eighths, lost the advantage outside the five-eighths,
came up empty on the final turn and capitulated. CROSS BORDER settled towards the front on the outside while three to four wide, came up empty near
the half-mile pole and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

outside to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and was just up in the last jump to the wire. BUBBLE ROCK established the front from the start and was
under a firm hold three to four paths off the hedge down the backstretch through swift splits despite the rating, went three then two wide through the turn
under wraps, took the inside route into upper stretch and had the field get busy when given a notch to work with near the eighth pole, got roused inside that
station, dug in under a light drive and was nailed at the finish. AMY C (GB) three wide in pursuit, got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive running on willingly to secure the show honors. BAY STORM just off the inside in pursuit, tucked inside through the turn and remained on hold

set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. CLITHEROE (GB) stumbled at the start and was bumped by SARAH
HARPER, who broke outwards, then got forced to steady briefly conceding four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the two path straightened away, stayed on one paced to the finish but was outfinished. MESSIDOR
(IRE) chased four wide under reserve until let out angled seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, got outkicked to the finish. SARAH HARPER
