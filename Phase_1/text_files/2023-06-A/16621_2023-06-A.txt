TAPITS CHOICE stalked the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the
final turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn and closed willingly to be up in the closing strides. WICKED NIGHT away well and vied for the lead from along
the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, held the narrowest of advantages into the lane,
and just failed to last. LICORICE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of WICKED NIGHT entering the backstretch, continued to force the
issue from the outside of that rival through the final turn and into the stretch, and gave way grudgingly late. CAIRO CRUSADER broke sharply and stalked
the leaders into the backstretch at the back of a compact field, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the
drive but was unable to mount a serious late bid. ROAD CLOSURE was off a step slow, but rushed up three wide through the first turn to force the pace
three wide entering the backstretch, continued to chase the leaders three wide to the final turn, before weakening.

MISS THE HYPE away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backside, opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn, and widened her margin late under confident handling. TEXAS HUMOR broke
sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, pressed the leader through the stretch the first time, held a tracking trip
one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on the pacesetter entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to
prove clearly second best. PERFECT PENNY away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down
the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. SILVER ARROW unhurried early while
trailing the field into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied three wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished
four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. ISLAND LIVING tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at
the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, continued to save ground into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backstretch, held a clear advantage into the final turn, and continued to widen her margin through the lane while being kept to task and drifting out
under left handed urging. PADDY D'ORO away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, commenced his
bid two wide entering the final turn and closed two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. GORKY PARK broke sharply and tracked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and
finished from along the inside in the drive. MCMURPHY tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing between rivals, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER steadied sharply when put in tight quarters at the rail leaving the
first turn, and trailed the field throughout. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul, as well as a stewards inquiry into a incident
entering leaving the first turn. The rider of VANCOUVER'S HUNTER lodged a claim of foul against the riders of both PADDY D'ORO and MCMURPHY.
After review the stewards disqualified PADDY D'ORO from second and placed this horse fifth for causing interference to VANCOUVER'S HUNTER leaving
the first turn.

PINEAPPLE TIDBITS tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, battled for the lead from along the rail midway down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and held WALKINTHEWALK safely at bay late to prove

NINE OCLOCK CEASER away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn, and widened her margin over the final furlong while under confident handling. TEXAS LEGACY broke
sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and
finished willingly four wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. LENT ME TWENTY away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was needed more when called upon while finishing evenly for a share. STOLO
SPIRIT unhurried early while dropping back to trailed, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to mount a
serious late bid. SWEET AS HONEY tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but

to gain a tracking trip entering the final turn, raced just out from the rail through the turn, shifted two wide in mid stretch and was up in time to run down a

in the run down the backside and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, and just failed to last. ICE BREAKER away well and dueled
for the lead from the outside of LASTING LIGHT in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide entering the final turn, and finished
willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. ARTISTIC JEWLER stalked the early pace from the back of a compact field entering the backstretch,
launched her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four wide in the drive. LIZZIES GIRL broke sharply and tracked the
leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. KICK UP THE DUST tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but
