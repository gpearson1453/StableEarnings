Footnotes
NIGHTTIME JUSTICE chased the pace from the four path into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn to be a serious contender, took aim on the leader into
the lane then wore that one down through the final seventy yards. LASHES pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane , gained the lead
when straightening, dueled with the winner through the final eighth and could not hold. SMOOTH JUSTICE was two wide and in the three path through the
turn, came into the lane from the five path with aim on the top ones and could not sustain the bid. AZURITA was last away, lost her path and was steadied
soon after the start, trailed through the turn and into the lane, shifted into the four path and offered a mild gain. MI ESTRELLA chased the pace along the
inside through the turn then faded through the lane. KANFU set the pace from the two path into late turn then gave way. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE broke
alertly then settled to the back after the first call and trailed.

Footnotes
SINGLE HER broke alertly to gain the lead at once, set the pace from the two path through the turn and into the backstretch, remained clear through the far
turn and into the lane then widened to the wire while being kept to the task. EMERSON'S DREAM saved ground through the turns and into the lane then
chased the winner through the final eighth while coming off the rail a couple paths. LITTLE GRAY FLOWER raced near the rail through the far turn, came
into the lane under a drive from the two path, could not gain on the winner while making up some ground on the place rival. BIRDSOFAFEATHER raced
along the rail through the far turn and into the lane and was never a serious threat. GOLDEN HEIST was in the three path when near the back, came into
the lane five wide and moved up while in the seven path. SHARON'S GREY HOPE was in the four path through the turns, swung into the lane from the
eight path and never menaced. EXPLOSIVE SKIES raced in the three path through the turns when never far back, came into the lane five wide and tired.
PRETTY HEART chased the pace from the two path through the far turn then was empty through the lane. PADDI'S WISH chased the pace from the three
path into the far turn and was done in late turn.

faltered late. CHISEL raced in the four path and gained the show spot late. HE B READY raced evenly while five wide. BLAZEN JUSTICE saved ground
and had a mild late bid. INDIGO RICH improved position late outside to finish on even terms with DEALER who dueled outside of the winner before giving
way. ALMIGHTYJUSTICE was not a factor. MISTER MACHO stalked the pace in the three path for a half mile and faltered.

Footnotes
WE STORM was reserved through the turn when in the three path, came into the lane from the seven path when still well behind, asked for more inside the
eighth pole and had another gear while quickly passing several and won going away. WASHINGTON'S UNION vied for the lead near the rail, cleared on the
backstretch, was joined by another through the far turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on well through the final eighth from between rivals to inch
back up for the place spot. STORMIN MIDNIGHT vied early then settled back to chase the pace through the turn, continued along the inside into the lane
and just missed the place spot. QAADER was bumped at the start, raced along the inside through the turns when never far back, angled into the eight path
for the drive and moved up late. THE MOTTO vied for the lead from the three path through the far turn while two wide, continued in the three or four path
into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then faltered. PITAGORE chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, was well placed
into the lane then weakened. FAITH RUNNER was in the four to the three path through the first turn, continued off the inside through the far turn and never
factored. SIMPLY JACK was in the two or three path into the far turn, bid three wide in mid-turn and into the lane then tired. TAPTHEDRUM was four wide
through the far turn, swung into the lane from off the rail, was in the nine path in mid-stretch and never factored. TROY BOY trailed throughout while along
the inside.

unrushed early, then improved position late outside. BIZERK was unrushed while in second, bid inside at the three-eighths pole, then faded in the stretch.
STEWARDS RULES saved ground to no avail. EVIL EYE bid three wide at the three-eighths pole before faltering . TAKAFUMI (BRZ) faded. TROUBLED

Footnotes
BOTOX KATIE trailed at the first call while in the two path, moved to the three path through the turn, gained momentum in late turn, guided into the six path
for the drive and rallied from mid-track to be clear at the wire. BELLA BOLLE stalked the pace from the three path into the turn, bid three wide in late turn,
got clear with an eighth to go then could not hold off the winner while finishing clear for the place spot. LIL EVIE chased four wide through the turn, had aim
on the leaders from mid-track then needed more late. COMPRESSED ENERGY saved ground through the turn when near the back, shifted into the three or
four path and was gaining to the end. FOREVER NOTED vied for the lead two wide through the turn, continued a serious contender with an eighth left then
gave way. EVERYTHING'S ROSY chased the pace from the two path into the turn, checked behind rivals, stayed on and never was a serious threat
thereafter. EXPRESS LADY saved ground into the lane, moved up and was not a factor. NO TRUST never a factor while in the four path through the turn.
BETCHA set the early pace before the first call, was joined by another into the turn, vied with that one into the lane then faded. HUNGARIAN PRINCESS
bid five wide through late turn when appearing to loom a threat then was empty after turning into the lane. HOOSIER PREMIUM was done early while off the
inside.
