UNIFIED POINT dueled for the lead two wide and between horses around the turn, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch before changing leads at the
three sixteenths marker, maintained a margin from his inner game counterpart into deep stretch and inched away in the final sixteenth. WEST SARATOGA
dueled for the lead inside of a trio of foes around the turn, fought on gamely after headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, but yielded in the closing
stages and lasted for place. BAYTOWN PARFAIT tracked the embattled quartet from the two path, came under coaxing at the three furlong pole while in
pursuit, shifted out to the six path in midstretch and rallied with a late kick to miss reaching place. ASTRONOMICO prompted the pace four wide, dueled
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with a pair of inner rivals at the three sixteenths pole and lost show to an outer rival in the late stages. TIZ MY
HERO lacked speed in the four path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch before being floated to the seven path at the furlong grounds, then ran on
willingly. POTENTIAL SPAM was slow into stride after leaning inwardly at the start, lagged behind in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch
and moved up while greenly flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole. YAQUI VALLEY chased in the four to three path around the turn, but gave
way between horses turning for home. DUNPHY sparred for the lead three wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and
weakened on his left lead. SHOTGUN PRO saved ground off of the pace but tired through the lane.

Footnotes
EMPERADOR was floated outwardly by an inner rival at the start, comfortably lagged behind the rest of the field as fast fractions were being set into and
around the turn, cut the gap on the rest turning for home, shifted outwardly while gaining entering the lane, then rallied outside of rivals to drive past the
leaders at the furlong grounds and kicked clear. BADGEBALL broke outwardly, tracked in the three path, bid three wide turning for home, led briefly in upper
stretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds. TROPIC STORM took contact from an outer rival at the start, chased the embattled
leading trio from the inside into the turn, but failed to offer a bid along with an outer rival while encountering traffic behind the top pair turning for home,
tipped outside of them to take aim between horses in upper stretch, but flattened out after gaining show at the furlong grounds. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS
sparred for the lead two wide and between horses, then only outside of his inner counterpart after their outer rival faltered entering the turn, dug in to resist
an outer bidder's challenge turning for home, but was headed by that one in upper stretch and yielded through the final furlong. CLASSY SOCKS leaned in
and bumped a rival at the start, dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes into the turn, then only inside of a single rival leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
but was headed by that one and an outer bidder turning for home, then weakened entering the final furlong. GOT THE BOB dueled for the lead three wide,
but bore outwardly and failed to sustain the battle entering the turn and faltered around the bend.

Footnotes
KITTANSETT stalked along the inside around both turns, took aim outside of the clear leader entering the final furlong, offered a bid at the sixteenth pole
while shifting ground outwardly along the leader, sustained the battle while continuing to be herded out through the late stages and forged an advantage in
the shadow of the wire. DOMINICAN PIONEER set the pace inside of a pressing rival while remaining a bit off of the inner rail, inched clear entering the
lane, but drifted out while embracing KITTANSETT's challenge at the sixteenth pole, continued to lug while dueling late and got nailed at the wire. GOOD
GOVERNANCE (GB) tracked two wide, spun four wide into upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid. STARTING OVER pressed outside of
the pace setter, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch and gave way while hanging on his left lead.

Footnotes
ROMAN CENTURIAN dropped back soon after the start, lacked speed in the three path around the turn, then rallied between horses while tucking down two
wide in midstretch, sustained a charge to bid inside of the leading dueling pair entering the final sixteenth and edged away late. GREENER PASTURES vied
for the lead two wide and between horses, clung to an advantage from his outer counterpart in the three path entering the lane, gamely held through
midstretch while hanging on his left lead. BACKGROUND pressed three wide, bid turning for home, dueled in the four path through upper stretch, but hung
and was outkicked by an inner bidder late. EASTSIDE COOL stalked along the inside, tracked around the turn, then chased evenly through the lane.
OUTLIER tracked two wide and between horses, took aim on the leading pair from the five path straightening for home, but lacked a bid. PIPES AND
DRUMS broke outwardly at the start, raced forwardly four wide, backed off to track the main group approaching the turn, came under urging turning for
home before being floated to the six path entering the lane, then subtly yielded. DIGITAL broke slowly, trailed in the two path, shifted out to the vie path in
upper stretch and made little impact. DREAM KEEPER set the pace inside of a pair of rivals into the turn but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
WHAT'S UP DOC tracked two wide and between horses, ranged up outside of the leading pair around the turn to bid turning for home, then gained an
advantage in upper stretch and drew clear. DREAMWITHINADREAM set the pace outside of a prompting foe, dug in to resist an outer rival's challenge
turning for home, but proved no match to that one in upper stretch and was second best. PLENTY OF TIME lacked speed in the two path, split foes at the
three furlong pole, sustained progress to gain show in the four path nearing the lane and was best of the rest. MERLOTTI lacked speed in the three path,
swung to the six path entering the lane and moved up. GUNNER BAY chased along the inside, shifted out turning for home before spinning into the lane
four wide and failed to threaten. PATROLMAN saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. TIZ TWENTY TWENTY vied along the inside but weakened
turning for home. KANSAS COMET chased three wide, yielded turning for home before being floated to the seven path by an inner rival while between
horses entering the lane and weakened. MAGIC CITY bumped with an inner rival at the eleven sixteenths pole, tracked four wide, but gave way before
getting forced to the eight path entering the lane and continued to fade. SON OF THUNDER bumped with an outer rival before clipping that one's heels and
losing his rider at the eleven sixteenths pole, then was caught by an out rider in the gallop out and walked off. WINGER got bumped between horses before
clipping heels with his inner counterpart and losing his rider at the eleven sixteenths pole, then was simultaneously caught by the same out rider as his loose
comrade in the gallop out and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE INCIDENT AT THE ELEVEN SIXTEENTHS POLE, NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TUMBARUMBA pressed four wide, vied around the turn, led entering the lane, dug in to resist an outer challenge from DAMON'S MOUND in upper stretch,
pulled away from the rest while gamely clinging to an advantage in the final furlong and prevailed tenaciously. DAMON'S MOUND stalked behind the
embattled leading quartet from the three path, took aim outside of them entering the lane as TUMBARUMBA wrestled an advantage, bid outside of that one
in upper stretch, sparred with him through the final furlong while almost gaining even terms, but was fended off late. DETERMINEDLY laid off of the pace
along the inside, shifted ground outwardly while searching for racing room behind the leading group in upper stretch, tipped four wide at the furlong grounds
and ran on to gain show in the final sixteenth. LUGAN KNIGHT bumped with an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead inside of a trio of rivals around the
turn, fought on through upper stretch while headed, but weakened in the final furlong. TOP RECRUIT leaned outwardly while breaking slowly, laid off of the
pace in the three path, fanned six wide entering the lane and moved up. TWO EAGLES RIVER bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied two wide and
between horses, dueled among foes around the turn, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole. MO STRIKE prompted the pace three wide and between
horses, sparred around the turn, but caved entering the final furlong.

Footnotes
WARRIOR JOHNY bobbled at the start and spotted the leaders multiple lengths in the aftermath, shifted out and pulled forward outside of rivals soon after
to vie for the lead three wide leaving the chute, inched an advantage from his inner counterparts turning for home, drew off in upper stretch under driving
pressure and was put to wraps late. KING OTTOMAN vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart
turning for home, maintained place well through midstretch, then lasted from an outer bidder for that position late. TARTUFO chased along the inside,
searched for racing room behind a group of foes while off the rail in upper stretch, split rivals three wide at the sixteenth pole to offer a late kick, but ran out
of ground to reach place. READY TO POUNCE tracked in the four path, spun into the lane in the five path and chased evenly. GREYS THE BOY tracked
from the three to four path and between horses, but lacked a bid before yielding late. CALL ME MIDNIGHT trailed in the four path around the turn, fanned
six wide entering the land and failed to factor. MAILMAN MONEY sparred for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but failed to keep pace with his outermost foe
turning for home and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
HENRIETTA TOPHAM moved about just before the gates sprung and broke slow as a result, tracked from off of the pace two wide, chased around the far
turn, lacked progress while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, but changed over after taking aim outside of the new leaders entering the final furlong,
sustained a charge to bid entering the final sixteenth, dueled through the late stages and prevailed. WHITE FROST pressed two wide, bid entering the lane,
sparred before wrestling an advantage at the furlong grounds, dug in to resist HENRIETTA TOPHAM's challenge soon after, battled inside of that one
through the late stages but was bested. SWEET DANI GIRL set the pace along the inside while well-rated, met an outer challenge entering the lane, dueled
before getting headed in midstretch, then gave way through the final furlong yet held show. LADY HIDEAWAY tracked along the inside, chased under
urging around the far turn, then continued pursuit while tipping off of the rail in midstretch, but did not have enough to reach show late. KATE'S KINGDOM
snagged the outer half of the starting gate at the start, trailed along the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
OSCAR ECLIPSE prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds as an outer NORTHERN
INVADER menaced, then held firm from that bidder late. NORTHERN INVADER tracked in the five path around the turn, ranged up turning for home,
sustained a grinding charge in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, closed in to offer a late bid but was kept at bay. CONCERTED stalked outside
of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, but gave way between horses entering the lane, yet sustained stride in the final furlong to surpass
tiring rivals and gain show late. CITIZEN chased from midpack in the three path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. FOREVER COOL
rushed forward after a flat-footed beginning to track the leader from the two path, but only managed to chase through the lane while lacking a bid. BILLY
JACK set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed by that one in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. MACHO VILLA trailed,
improved in the three to four path around the turn, then stayed on in the six path. CHIRON laid off of the pace off of the rail, tucked to the fence turning for
home, but made little impact. CATEGORY TEN lacked speed in the six path and never got involved. ZAPHOD raced towards the back in the five path and
got outrun.
