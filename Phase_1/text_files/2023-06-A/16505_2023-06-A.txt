Footnotes
ANMER HALL stalked the pace from inside, bumped with outer rival at the five-sixteenths pole, shifted to the two path to take aim leaving the turn, headed
the leader at the eighth pole, took over shortly after and drove clear. LANSDOWNE (GB) chased the top pair three deep, remained outside rivals on the turn
and bumped twice with WHO'S CANDY near the five-sixteenths pole, took aim three wide into the lane, bid three deep with a furlong remaining and got
outkicked by the winner. FRANKLIN ONE STAR set the pace from inside under pressure, cleared on the turn, cut the corner into the lane, clung to narrow
lead at the eighth pole and yielded to the top pair. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) chased between early in-hand, went two wide into the turn then angled over
to the rail, roused past the quarter pole and kept on through the lane for a minor award. REALLY BIG NEWS stalked four deep to the stretch and flattened in
the lane. WHO'S CANDY pressed the pace from outside, could not keep up on the turn and had to chase in the two path then got pinballed between foes at
the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened in the stretch. BRAVESTONE broke slow, tracked widest up the backstretch, went five deep into the turn, trailed
three wide into the lane and weakened. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, ANMER HALL HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
MANGO MOON set the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail through the turn, met the bid from ICY BREEZE then turned that foe away entering the
stretch, asked right-handed at the three-sixteenths pole and responded by drawing off in the furlong grounds. TWIN SOUL stalked the pace from inside,
inched closer from the rail but was boxed in behind the leader around the bend, tipped into the clear in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the
final furlong and bested the rest. ICY BREEZE forwardly placed three deep early, bid three then four wide past the quarter pole, was turned away into the
lane and got outkicked for second. SHAMBALA GIRL took back at the start, chased off the rail then between rivals at the back into the turn, spun three wide
into the lane and improved position. DORINE'S WILD CAT broke slow on the inside, climbed at the back on the backstretch, raced inside a pair of rivals into
the turn, saved ground to the stretch and never threatened. BIG UPDATE raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter early, chased between foes then
two wide into the lane and weakened. BOGINSKAYA raced three deep at the back into the turn, trailed three wide into the drive and had little left for the
stretch run.

Footnotes
TAMING THE TIGRESS was off slow from outside, unhurried off the pace, gained two wide through the turn, drew alongside the leader inside the eighth
pole, took over midstretch and held READY JET GO at bay in the final sixteenth. READY JET GO brushed the gate, settled at the back, raced along the rail
into the turn, eased out while closing in around the bend, spun three wide into the lane, rallied three deep in the final furlong, drifted in a bit past the
sixteenth pole and could not get by the winner. KISS MY KAT dueled briefly inside TOO MUCH HEAVEN then cleared that rival and showed the way up the
backstretch, inched away on the turn then held a diminished lead into the lane, remained clear into the final furlong, then was challenged by a pair of rivals
and relinquished the lead midstretch and yielded late. TOO MUCH HEAVEN dueled briefly from outside then ceded command and stalked KISS MY KAT up
the backstretch, chased along the rail through the turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
I HAD THAT ONE TOO bumped inner rival at the start, rated in the two path outside a rival, took aim at the top pair leaving the far turn, rallied under
right-handed urging and reached the front midstretch and drove clear. ANNIE'S HOPE was off slow to begin, pulled the rider to a forward position and
stalked three then two wide around the clubhouse turn, bid two wide midway around the far turn, took over into the lane, cleared while lugging in to bother
rival in upper stretch and got outkicked by the winner in the furlong grounds. WARRIOR LADY settled inside, went between rivals on the far turn then two
wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and gained the show. CHERRY CHAOS stepped to the front and moved inside, showed the way to the second
bend, challenged around the turn, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole, got forced in by ANNIE'S HOPE and steadied in upper stretch, then flattened
to fourth. CHEVY GIRL stalked four then three wide around the first turn, went three wide into the second bend, came four wide into the stretch and also
flattened out. BETSY IS THE CODE rated on the inside, continued along the rail through the far turn, cut he corner into the lane and weakened. ASHLEYS
SANDCASTLE got bumped and crowded leaving the gate, raced two wide outside a rival at the back, chased three deep at the quarter pole and failed to
menace. THE TRAINER OF CHERRY CHAOS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST ANNIE'S HOPE IN UPPER STRETCH AND THERE WAS A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH ANNIE'S HOPE DID LUG IN AND
CAUSE CHERRY CHAOS TO STEADY IN UPPER STRETCH, IT DID NOT COST CHERRY CHAOS A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND NO
CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.

to the winner entering the final furlong but stayed on for a clear second. TAHOE SUNRISE got bumped from inside at the start, chased two wide then
moved to the rail on the bend, lacked room past the quarter pole, gained a clear path and was along for the show. GIVER NOT A TAKER traveled in
mid-pack up the backstretch, raced along the rail then shifted out at the five-sixteenths pole, entered the lane two to three wide and lacked a bid. SPEIGHT

Footnotes
GEAUX ROCKET RIDE stalked three to four wide around the first turn, drew closer and challenged the top pair from outside at the quarter pole, took over
leaving the bend, kicked clear from HARD TO FIGURE at the top of the stretch, drifted to the rail and held safely under a drive. MR FISK chased in the two
path then along the rail early, eased out on the far turn and chased three wide into the lane, finished willingly through the drive and whittle the gap on the
winner late. HARD TO FIGURE dueled for command outside DEL MAR JERRY, inched ahead at the quarter pole, was overtaken by the winner shortly after,
could not keep pace with that rival at the top of the stretch, weakened in the furlong grounds, bled following the race and walked off. ZE'BUL stumbled badly
at the start, trailed on the inside to the stretch, kept on through the lane while being floated out by DEL MAR JERRY and earned a minor award. DEL MAR
JERRY lifted at the start then went up to duel for the lead inside HARD TO FIGURE, fought with that rival to the far turn, vied inside rivals with a quarter mile
left to run, lost touch with the leaders exiting the bend and tired while drifting out in the stretch.

Footnotes
GIOVINAZZO bumped rival at the start, chased four wide into the first turn then angled down to the two path, gained through the far turn and loomed two
wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader in upper stretch, took over while drifting out at the eighth pole, kicked clear from inner rival and held safely.
KAWAZAKI (IRE) got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, tracked two wide near the back early, raced between foes into the far turn, moved out to travel
three deep around the bend, rallied under the left-hand and gained second. THE KEY IS UNITY broke a step slow, angled four wide into the first turn then
steered back into the two path, chased two wide into the second bend, steered out to the five path on that turn, came four wide into the lane, finished
willingly and held the show. RUSSELLS HUSTLE pulled along the inside early then settled off the pace, lacked room through the far turn and into the
stretch, gained an opening along the fence and rallied to miss the show. HABEAS led from the two path around the first turn then opened up a big lead,
remained comfortably in front into the far turn, showed the way along the inside to the stretch, was collared by the winner approaching the eighth pole,
relinquished the lead without resistance and weakened in deep stretch. CRYPTOHOLIC pulled and became rank early before drifting into the first turn,
moved back inside around the clubhouse turn, split foes at the quarter pole, tipped out in the lane and improved position. UPRIGHT broke out and bumped
rival, settled inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response. AMERICAN LIVIN bumped at the start, pulled early then chased three
wide early, traveled outside rivals into the far turn, moved out to the four path around the bend then got put in a bit tight at the quarter pole and weakened
down the lane. CIRCLE THE MOON bumped in the beginning, sat off the pace outside a rival, chased two wide into the drive and came up empty. RIPPIN'
RUIS (AUS) broke a step slow, trailed throughout and was never a factor.
