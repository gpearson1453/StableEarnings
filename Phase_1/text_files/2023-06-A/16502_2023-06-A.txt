Footnotes
MOON SIGN stalked the pace outside STEP AHEAD down the backstretch, overtook that one near the three eighths pole, quickly opened up, remained well
clear through the stretch under steady handling. STEP AHEAD set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead entering the far turn, swung off the rail entering
the stretch then willingly chased the winner through the lane. I AM THE MIKE lightly bumped with ASK HIM OAKEY leaving the starting gate, stalked the
pace well off the rail down the backstretch, was well positioned in the three path turning for home, raced on his left lead and flattened out. ASK HIM OAKEY
broke awkwardly, was four deep entering the stretch and gave way. DA BEERS ON ICE , outrun, moved to the three path leaving the far turn. LUNAR
GHOST raced along the inner rail most of the trip and dropped back.

Footnotes
O SHAUGHESEY vied inside early then steadied back off foes nearing the turn, angled out and sat patiently tracking mid turn, shifted three wide into the
lane, closed in under left handed asks, took a short lead nearing the sixteenth pole, edged away slightly then dug in to fend off BETTER CALL MAMA.
BETTER CALL MAMA steadied early, rated behind rivals around the turn, altered out past mid stretch, worked through a seam in deep stretch, finished
gamely and just failed to get up. IMAGINE VICTORY broke slowly, raced well off the early duel, came five to six wide for the drive and rallied. FANCY
PRINCESS , four wide chasing the embattled leaders, edged up nearing mid stretch then was out finished between foes. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN
steadied soon after the break, raced off the pace and between rivals leaving the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch then rallied through a tight spot in
deep stretch. AWAY TO RETURN moved up outside rivals early to entertain the pace, sparred outside SHE'LL MAKE WAVES around the turn, drifted in
nearing the sixteenth marker and faded. IRISH LACE steadied early, saved ground off the pace, eased out for the drive then was forced out late. SASSY
BABE had speed then was out paced into the turn, saved ground chasing then checked near the sixteenth pole. SHE'LL MAKE WAVES , between foes
early with the pace, dueled inside a rival around the turn then checked when in tight near the sixteenth pole. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by
the rider of SHE'LL MAKE WAVES, AWAY TO RETURN was disqualified from sixth and placed last.

NORTHERN THUNDER broke a beat slow, angled out some and rushed up behind foes nearing the first turn and stalked, lost ground three to four wide
near the half, was sent up to engage the leader soon after, dueled outside BAHAMA CHANNEL from the three eighths, held a slim advantage in mid stretch,
switched over to his left lead late and drew clear. ERAWAN vied inside early then eased back off the leaders nearing the backstretch, edged up inside
nearing the half mile pole, came out four wide for the drive, closed steadily and just nabbed the place. BAHAMA CHANNEL vied between runners around
the first turn, edged clear through the backstretch run, was joined from his outside near the three furlong pole, went head to head leaving the furlong
grounds, kept on valiantly and was nipped for the place. SASSY KING , off the pace, saved ground into the lane, made a bit of a run in mid stretch then
flattened out. HAYNE'S FEVER , four wide early, stalked off the rail into the far turn then faltered.

the first turn, advanced three deep the far turn, was fanned four wide by VELVET GHOST in upper stretch and rallied. GALATIANS lacked speed, raced in
the two path in the stretch and rallied inside rivals. VELVET GHOST , three wide the first turn, chased the pace, drifted three wide in upper stretch and
flattened out. CLOSER LOOK set the pace along the inner rail and gave way.

CUT FROM CLASS sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, handled pressure from mid turn into the lane, kicked clear two wide after being set down
in upper stretch and held firm while kept to task. GOLDEN CHARM broke a step slow, was sent up between rivals soon after, reached a forward spot into
the turn, circled four wide with pursuit into the stretch, drifted in towards the rail leaving mid stretch and finished with good energy to nab the place. TEA
ROSE prompted the pace outside the winner, moved to threaten mid turn, pressed into the lane while three wide, failed to match strides in mid stretch but
stayed on well between rivals. IN HER CUPS broke inward when rank at the break and bumped a rival, corrected and edged up to contention, was firmly
rated to the inside of a rival into the turn, worked outward to stalked around the turn, loomed four wide then hung late. LITTLE JOSIE WALES eased back
from between runners heading to the half, raced two wide past the five sixteenths, wandered inward when green in upper stretch, altered out in the final
furlong and finished with interest. BIZZY BIZZY , bumped at the break, raced between foes near the half, saved ground pursuing mid turn, stayed towards
the inside and lacked a bid. NO SHARING , bumped at the break, raced off the pace, swung wide and failed to menace. TEMPTRESS CALLING saved
ground leaving the far turn and failed to menace. LENAMAGNETTA , roughed up when IN HER CUPS broke inward into her, raced well back into the turn
then was eased late.

SWEET GRACIE saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, found ample room along the rail to take command approaching the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. DULCE KIARA set the pace along the inner rail, drifted to the two path turning for home and gave way grudgingly. I'M GITTIN THERE stalked the
pace behind horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. COMBAT QUEEN circled horses around the turn, chased the
pace to upper stretch then weakened. CANOODLE prompted the pace between horses and faded. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , fractious in the starting gate,
was rank at the break, trained and raced five wide on the turn.

Footnotes
CHELONIAN taken to rate inside while in range, eased out brushing with a foe near the half, bid between foes near the far turn and engaged WISH ME
HOME, dueled outside that rival from the five sixteenths, drifted in slightly bumping with that rival in deep stretch and got the bob. WISH ME HOME cleared
early, dropped in and set a rated pace, was joined by CHELONIAN leaving the far turn, sparred with that one from there, was bumped in deep stretch and
fought gamely to just miss. TRASH TALKIN LARRY , three wide into the first turn, settled off the pace, angled in for the drive and rallied mildly.
NEVERFOLD settled off the pace, swung wide for the drive and had belated action. BONDED stalked off the rail, brushed with CHELONIAN near the half,
pursued three wide leaving the far turn and came up empty. INVECTIVE broke a bit slow, saved ground under asking and took closer order past the five
sixteenths, eased out a bit and faded. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the rider of WISH ME HOME, CHELONIAN was disqualified from first
and placed second for causing interference in deep stretch.
