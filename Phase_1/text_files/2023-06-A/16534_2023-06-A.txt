Footnotes
CAIRO SUMMER tracked the leader through the final turn then moved up holding off outside rival and wore down the leader to draw clear late. HARD LIKE
HOLLY roused to the front to set the pace held that position to mid stretch and tired late. WEEKEND PASS was unhurried through the final turn, showed
late interest and passed tiring rivals. KITTEN ROCKS stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the final turn then tipped out
to three wide in upper stretch but lacked a response in the stretch. ZENCHUA SKY saved ground to no avail.

R KATIEBUG was hustled to share the command from the inside, inched away in the early stretch and just lasted. MADELYN BELLE raced near the back
between horse through the turn then angled out to four wide at the top of the stretch for a late rally, having her best strides late and just missed.
LOVEYOULIKECRAZY stumbled slightly at the start, rushed up to share command to early stretch and weakened but was a clear third. TOUR DE' PORT
chased the leaders to the top of the stretch and tired. FREEDOM ATTACK saved ground down the backstretch, floated out entering the stretch but was not
a factor. THAT'S A BIRD was hard to load before the start, trailed throughout.

of the stretch and took the lead but was out kicked late. DASH TO THE CASH lacked early speed through the turn then made a three wide rally to be a clear
third. GALLANT BUCK was hustled to a clear lead to the top of the stretch and yielded. DON'T BOX ME IN chased the leaders from the inside but was not a

Footnotes
BRUCE BANNER went to the front to set the unchallenged pace and was kept to task in the drive. STORM'S REFLECTION raced near the back around the
first turn then steadily advanced from the inside on the backstretch then moved out to two wide in the stretch for a run at the leader but couldn't catch and
proved to be second best. KINGSBURRY ATTACK went five wide into the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack from the three path down the
backstretch, saved ground around the final turn, slipped up the rail in the stretch and was a clear third. STRIKE PRICE was unhurried to the final turn then
moved up from two wide and improved position. MODAZZLE tracked the leaders from the inside around the first turn then advanced from the two path on
the backstretch, tipped out to three wide in the stretch and faltered. KITTEN'S CLOWN settled off the pace in the middle of the pack but never made a bid.
WHERE'S LUCKY was allowed to settled through the final turn then made a late run to pass tiring rivals. AMBASSADOR MIKE floated out on the first turn
then was placed off the pace for a half and gave way. MEATLOAF'S CHANCE was in tight, clipped heels and bobbled going into the first turn, was forwardly
placed on the backstretch from the three or four path but lacked a late response. MASQUERADE BALL was five wide into the first turn then stalked the pace
for a half and gave way.

LAWMAKER was restless in the gate, was off the pace through the final turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch to make a late run on the leader
and was up in the final jumps. MO TIME AT ALL was rushed to the clear lead and set all the pace but couldn't fend of the late closer and was nailed in the
final jumps. MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY was reluctant to load, then raced in the middle of the pack on the inside, moved out to four wide in upper stretch for
a late rally and was up for the show. AQUACAT tracked the leaders from the inside throughout and was out finished. NOBLE CREEKER raced near the
back around the first turn then moved up from three wide and flattened out in the stretch. HANDSOFFTHEGOODS raced in the middle of the pack and was
never a factor. ICE VORTEX was allowed to settle through the final turn then made a four wide run in the stretch to improve position. MISSOURI GENT
stalked the pace through the final turn and weakened. CRUISING ALTITUDE was reluctant to load, raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch
and gave way. ADDIE'S PEACHES raced in the middle of the pack while racing wide on the backstretch and failed to menace. ANCIENT MAN was
unhurried and never a threat. PONCHO ATTACK was unhurried and was distanced.

Footnotes
LAMELO was rouse to vie for the lead to the middle of the turn then took the lead at the five sixteenths, drifted in at the three sixteenths pole and held on for
the win. UNCAPTURED DREAM was hustled to the lead from the inside to the five sixteenths pole, then altered path near the three sixteenths pole, made a
rebid and just missed. BLACK RUSSIAN raced near the back on the backstretch then moved up from two wide on the turn and angled out nearing the
eighth pole and was up for the show. CHERRY ORCHARD stalked the pace from between horses in the second flight, showed late interest in the stretch but
was out kicked by late closer. PROCHARGER tracked the leaders from second flight on the inside while racing evenly. ONE ACE chased the leaders from
the three path but never made a bid. JACKPOT BOY trailed. FLYING CRICKET had no early speed and remained back. STAN THE CAMERAMAN vied for
the lead from between horses to the top of the stretch and tired. AN OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE JOCKEY OF UNCAPTURED DREAM CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF LAMELO FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL
WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
