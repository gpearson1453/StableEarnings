Footnotes
BOURBON DELIGHT sprinted to an unchallenged lead to the final turn then was headed at the five sixteenths pole, dug in late to come again for a
determined win. FIRST MASAMUNE raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then advanced from four wide on the backstretch and engaged the
leader at the five sixteenths pole, took the lead entering the stretch while floating out slightly but was denied the win. SEMINOLE BEACH broke inward at
the start then was hustled to be off the pace around the first turn, moved up on the backstretch to challenge the leader into the final turn but couldn't match
strides on the turn, drifted out in late stretch and wasn't a match for the top two. PINEDALE was forwardly place around the first turn then fell back, moved
out to mid track for the stretch drive and passed tired one. GOLD BUCKLE raced in the middle of the pace around the first turn then advanced from three
wide down the backstretch, shuffled back entering the final turn and didn't make a rally. BEEALEA was steadied at the start, allowed to settle at the back but
was never a threat.

GHAALEB'S MAGIC chased the leaders around the turn then move out to three wide in upper stretch for the late gain on the leaders and drew clear in the
final yards. ALMAFUERTE raced in the middle of the pack from three to four wide through the turn then started a four wide rally in the stretch, had to move
back to the inside late and was up for the place. KIANA'S LOVE was off the pace on the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the turn to engage the
leader and briefly took the lead at the top of the stretch but was out kicked by late closer. HER GOLD MINE saved ground through the turn, drifted out at the
three sixteenths pole and kept on to be the best of the rest. APOLLO U ANYWHERE sprinted to the early lead, challenged around the turn and collared at
the end of the bend and tired. MORNING LINE NEWS remained back. HOPPESTRY was slightly fractious in the gate, lacked early speed and was not a
threat while racing the widest of all.

Footnotes
WILMA MANKILLER went to a pressured lead down the backstretch then inched away going into the turn and won going away. STYLE had no early speed
then gained momentum from two wide on the turn, tipped out to four wide in the stretch and proved second best. RAINY MOUNTAIN vied for the lead in the
early stages from the inside then dropped back, made a rebid but tired and held the show. BEG BORROW N STEAL was forwardly placed on the
backstretch then made a two wide bid on the turn but couldn't gain on the leader and weakened in the stretch. IT'S GREEK TO ME was near the back while
saving ground through the turn then moved out to the three path in upper stretch and split horses in late stretch to improve position. PALACE MAGIC raced
near the back, made a mild bid on the turn but lacked the late response. STORMY EMPIRE was off the pace from three wide to the top of the stretch and
gave way.
