CANT BEAT THE KATZ set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. SNEAKY REBEL
forced the pace, was a factor on the turn and held place. MAKES SENSE TO ME was off the pace and trailed the field on the turn but from the four path at
the top of the stretch was up for show. TOOSWEETFORME tracked the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch needed more. LOVE MY CHERYL was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. DEVIL IN
HER HEART was in range but chased on the turn and failed to fire.

BAJAN BULLET was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY set the
pace but drifted out on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. VERY DEBONAIRE was off slow and roused on the turn
but had no late kick. WITCH'S NAUGHT was off slow and closed the gap on the turn but was not a factor. GREY DECEPTION was unhurried early and
saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. TIPA FROST was up close but was in tight on the turn and was empty. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO
THE RUN INTO THE TURN RESULTED IN AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACE SIXTH.

Footnotes
DETERMINED LOVE was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. JARA was unhurried early,
hustled along on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. FOREST B was in range and a factor on the turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch was all out. PLUIE D'AVRIL was off the pace, moved up on the turn and was up for a share. GIMBALA stumbled at the start
and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. EASY ACCESS was in mid pack and roused on the turn but had
no response. MY FINAL TRICK was hustled early and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened. SUBZERO
PLUS was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.
