CATALENA led throughout, steadily increased the margin and was much the best. HEARTSANDDIAMONDS settled off the pace, lacked a rally and was no
match for the winner. SARATOGA DREAM stumbled badly at the start, raced in close early while saving ground, was through after a half and earned show.
KIRRABON was outrun in an even effort. LOOKIN AT KISSES stumbled badly at the start, raced far back and was outrun.

Footnotes
AMOUNT was crowded at the start, unhurried early and trailed the field, rallied around the second turn, swung wide entering the stretch, closed to wear
down his rivals and got up in the final strides. WHATA GUY raced close to the pace along the inside, bid along the rail, assumed command past the eighth
pole and was caught near the wire. MINECRAFTER broke out, raced towards the back along the inside, shifted out and rallied into the turn, challenged
three across, dueled to mid stretch, was outclosed and settled for show. LORD DARNLEY stalked the pace along the inside, challenged between horses on
the turn, dueled to mid stretch, hung late and lost position. ILLUSTRIOUS went five wide on the first turn, drew clear into the backstretch to set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel for the lead and faltered in late stretch. TAPPIN FOR GLORY was never far back, angled out on the turn, bid five wide
to loom a threat and didn't have enough late. SHIMMERING LIGHT stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way.

FIRST JOKE lacked room entering the turn, was taken back, angled out, challenged three across, dueled to deep stretch and inched clear. AMIRATI dueled
to deep stretch, was outfinished and all out for place. TROUBLED DREAMS dueled to deep stretch, was outfinished in a game effort and clearly best of the
rest. FEATHER WISH bumped lightly at the start, raced close to the pace, bid, came up empty and failed to menace. RITZ ON BROADWAY flashed speed,
dropped back to trail and improved position in a steady effort. EASTER SUNDAY GIRL put in an even effort in an outside trip and lacked a bid. PRINCESS
PEANUT bumped lightly at the start and was not a factor.

SLIME QUEEN set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn, veered in at the gap and just lasted. BRAMBLE BUSH was rated back at the start, saved
ground, got through inside on the turn, surged late between horses and was outnodded to just miss. MS MERRABEL was never far off the pace, went six
wide entering the stretch, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. ONE NIGHT STAND was unhurried early, raced outside, finished well and
gained late. BECKON got away well, raced close to the pace along the inside, bid, hung late and lost position. UNA LUNA pressed the pace to the second
turn, dropped back and leveled off. SALAGADOOLA fell far back early, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. HIPNOTIZADA pressed three across, was
through after a half and stopped.

NO SABE NADA dueled three across, inched away into the turn, was under pressure late and held on gamely. ROB THE RICH was a bit crowded at the
start, pressed the pace along the inside, lacked room entering the turn, fell back, shifted out, closed inside and was gaining fast late. A DANGEROUS GUY
dueled between horses, fell back on the turn, shifted out, closed steadily and didn't have enough late. WHERE PARADISE LAY was never far off the pace,
advanced to the turn, went widest in the drive and lacked the needed rally. GALAXY MUSIC broke out, saved ground, angled out into the turn and gave
way.

GHOSTINYOU saved ground while racing mid pack, steadily advanced along the rail, wore down his rivals, got up late and won going away. COSMIC
TREASURE set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, was outclosed and no match late. UNCOMMON VALOR was steadied at the start, raced
wide along the backstretch, dropped in, bid between horses on the turn and prevailed for show while no threat to the top two. MELINA'S DREAM was
roused into the turn, advanced outside, bid, hung and was outfinished for third. MY FRIEND LINUS raced in the back, put in an even effort and lacked a bid.
ANTE UP ALEX pressed the pace to the second turn and flattened out.
