Footnotes
YLANG YLANG was shuffled back early, moved up three wide between foes around the turn, tipped out for clear sailing in upper stretch, closed outside and
was up late. BEER BALI stalked the pace in the four path, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. BLUE
TWIRLIN pressed the pace three wide, could not match strides with BEER BALI in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the show. MO RISSA had her head
turned at the start, raced four wide in midpack and had a mild rally. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT broke a bit awkwardly, raced well back four wide and rallied
belatedly. SARA KALI was bumped near the five-eighths marker, chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. HYDRIA saved ground and failed
to menace. ALWAYS CONNECTED raced in range in the two path and lacked a closing bid. EXAGERADORA bumped near the five-sixteenth pole,
checked nearing the seven-sixteenths, raced two wide around the turn and never threatened. SONGTELLER set the pace in the two path and gave way
near the quarter pole. SECRET TO SUCCESS played no factor while racing five wide. BRITNEY SPURS trailed inside.

Footnotes
DICKENS pressed in the three path, bid around the turn and stuck a head in front entering the final quarter, tipped out to the four path into the lane, and
drew clear. CATCH A TIGER stalked in the three path, was under left handed encouragement from the five path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for
place. SHARDS led along the inside and was challenged by the outer eventual winner into the turn, lost the lead going into the final quarter and evened out
from the two path in the stretch to show. DEWY'S BEAST was hustled along in midpack from the four path, under urging from the five path into the lane,
drifted out under left handed cues down the stretch, and was one paced. DOWN IN THE VALLEY raced off the pace in the five path, dropped back to last
early around the turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but was no factor. PLAYING WITH FIRE chased from the four path into the turn, floated out
around the turn and was in the eight path at the top of the lane, but did not threaten. MAGICSHADOW rated along the inside but was tired in the three path
entering the stretch. DUDEWITHANAME hesitated and veered in at the start, raced wellback in the three path and failed to no menace.

Footnotes
OCEAN CLUB set the pace in the two path, was cued right handed early into the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the lane, stayed on, and held sway.
ALTERNATE ROCK stalked along the inside, tipped out to the three path and was roused into the far turn, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and
chased home the winner for place. HONOR D LADY was unhurried in the two path, driven between foes early around the far turn, fanned out to the eight
path into the lane, and kept on for show. TYPEY chased in the three path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, tipped out to the seven path into
the lane, but was one paced. STARSHIP AURORA tracked in the three path but faded into the stretch. EVIE DOES IT settled in midpack along the inside
but was empty turning into the lane. ARTIFACT (GB) rated in the four path early but was no menace.

Footnotes
ROCK THE WEEKEND tracked the pace in the two path, split rivals turning for home, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear.
FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch but could not withstand the winner in the final sixteenth. NO MORE DEBT
broke awkwardly and outwardly, advanced four wide around the turn but was no match for the top two in the lane. CHIEF ROCKA stalked the pace three
wide, bid between foes nearing the three-eighths pole, was in bit tight near the quarter pole and faltered in the lane. ADIOS YOUR HONOR had brief speed
inside. MAJESTIC DRAMA was off a step slow, raced three wide and never threatened. HEAVY WEIGHT had speed three wide and was through after a
half.

Footnotes
BELLA MIURA bumped with an outer foe after the start, laid off the pace in the four path, advanced under a drive in the six path around the far turn, was in
the seven path entering the stretch, rallied between foes passing the eighth pole, and got up on the wire. ONE TRACK MINE stalked in the four path, took
the lead while in the three path early around the far turn, opened up into the lane, but was nailed by an outer foe to place. KATZ THAT GAL rated in the
three path, tipped out and circled inner foes from the seven path around the turn, was in the nine path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. BLACK
ICE bumped with an inner foe just after the start, raced wellback in the three path, was under coaxing in the six path midway around the far turn, tipped out
the seven path into the stretch, and stayed on. SHEA D SECRET chased in the five path, ranged up under a ride rounding the far turn, was urged into the
lane, but evened out passing the eighth pole. ARMONIA tracked in the two path early but flattened from the five path down the stretch. LOVE UNLIMITED
pulled while in range around the five path, bid from the four path into the far turn, but weakened down the lane. FUNTASTICA steadied at the start but was
unhurried inside, was ridden between foes from the two path into the far turn, but was no menace. RISING HEAT set the pace in the three path but yielded
early around the far turn.

Footnotes
SUGAR TREAT was up close inside down the backstretch, steadied entering the turn, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed determinedly
and was up in the final strides. ESCAPE ROOM set a clear pace in the two path and led until the final strides. MY SWEETHEART DANI broke sharply, led
at the rail early, chased inside around the turn and kept on inside to hold the show. PEACEFUL KINGDOM was off slowly, saved ground well back, tipped
out in upper stretch and rallied between foes. IRON SHIELD chased the pace four wide, was bumped near the five-sixteenths pole and was one-paced
through the lane. CORINTH chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. QUEEN BERKELEY raced five wide in midpack, was bumped near the
five-sixteenths pole, lugged in through the stretch and dropped back. MISS PIXY STIX was reluctant to load, was fractious in the gate and was outrun while
racing mostly two wide.

Footnotes
NOBLE DREAMER rated in the three path, ranged up in the five path around the turn, swept to the lead while tipping inwards in upper stretch, and was
driven clear. LADY PETAL was behind in the two path into the turn, angled out around the turn and was in the nine path entering the stretch, and rallied
down the center for place. SPONGER set the pace in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter shifted inside while losing the lead in upper stretch, but
held on to show. RIGBY stalked in the five path, bid in the four path around the turn, but had to steady in the five path at the top of the lane, and finished
evenly. DIVINE ENCOUNTER prompted the pace in the three path, was pushed along between foes around the turn, but was one paced from the two path
down the lane. MISS ARIA bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased inside, was under coaxing rounding the turn, remained inside entering the stretch,
but was stymied passing the eighth pole, and unable to factor. FIND YOUR PASSION bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path but
faded in the stretch. WILDCAT STAR had her head turned at the start and hopped, raced off the pace inside early and did not threaten.

SADIE BEAR stalked the pace in the three path, seized command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear soon after and held clear under a drive.
ATALANTA ALEXANDRA raced off the pace in the two path, gained inside of the winner in upper stretch, switched out in midstretch and was unable to
serious gain on that foe while moving well clear of the rest. A KISS FOR KHOZAN set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and kept trying inside to hold the show. UNCAPTURED DOVE went evenly while racing four and five wide. MY CHUTZPAH raced in
range four wide, bid near the five-sixteenths pole but faded through the lane. LTE STARK WINTER played no factor while racing four wide. RATIONAL
KATE was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
AMSTRONG tracked in the five path, ranged up around the far turn, bid while floating out to the seven path into the stretch, took the just before the eighth
pole, and drew clear. SMART STRIKER bumped with an inner foe then an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, was put to a ride from the four path
into the far turn, tipped out to the five path into the lane, and ran on for place. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY prompted the pace in the four path, bid between
foes from the three path around the far turn, and finished evenly from the four path in the stretch to show. TICKING bumped with an outer foe at the start,
set the pace in the three path, was challenged by an outer duo while in the two path midway around the far turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, and faded.
ORDINARY raced wellback in the two path, was driven between foes around the far turn, but did not factor. UNIFIED WEEKEND laid off the pace in the four
path early but did not threaten. CALYCANTHUS stalked in the two path, was pushed along while losing ground into the turn, and was no menace. TIGRE
brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the six path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, but was empty entering the lane.
