antsy in the gate, stalked the early pace, rallied three wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace while drifting out to the six
path and finished second best. NAPA DUDE unhurried early, swung wide and was steadily gaining ground late in the eight path. INSACIABLE PRINCE
found his best stride late past mid track. WHEN IN ROME pressed the pace two wide for a half then faded. ACESKINGSANQUEENS failed to menace.
WILDERZAR was outrun. MISTERCHILLIWILLI away alertly, set the pace along the inside for nearly a half then faltered.
