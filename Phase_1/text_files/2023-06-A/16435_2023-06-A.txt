BRANCO MARIA raced between horses early, pressed the pace, dropped back on the turn, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in the final
strides. ONLY CHILD pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled to mid stretch, inched clear and was caught near the wire.
ZIPPER ZAPPER was away alertly and hustled along to set the pace, responded when challenged the turn, dueled to mid stretch, faltered and settled for
show. CASTAGNO pressed the pace five wide, fell back on the turn, made a bid, had little left for the drive and dropped further behind. GABBYS BIG
NOTION raced close to the pace, saved ground, tired into the turn and gave way.

BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES pressed the pace, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended the lead while ridden out. RITABOOK set the pace to
the turn, fell back and was no match for the winner. BOSSYNESS was void of early speed, raced inside, angled out on the turn and closed to get up for
show. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD bumped at the start, raced mid pack, bid and came up empty. MY TRUE PASSION was never far back, lacked a stretch
response and did not threaten. LIZZIES RED VELVET saved ground in an even effort and was outrun. COCO PUFF showed speed to the turn, gave way
and dropped back. CREATIVE CADENCE bumped at the start and trailed the field.

BOX OFFICE WARRIOR broke out, raced close to the pace inside, rallied around the turn, bid willingly to contend and inched clear late to prove best.
VANHOOFER set the pace, drew clear on the turn, led to late stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. SUMMER ANTHEM came in at the start, pressed
the pace, lacked the needed late response and settled for show. BETWEEN THE COVERS held a good position, lacked a rally and failed to gain. JOE
BRAINS bumped at the start, was unhurried early, bid inside on the turn, altered course near the gap and finished well. LYING JEFF lagged early, angled
out for the drive, swung wide and finished well. SHARP RED EAGLE bumped at the start, raced inside, bid and hung. BUNKER HILL broke slowly and was
crowded at the start, raced in the back, swung wide into the stretch and offered a mild bid only. DELTA RIDGE was slow early, raced outside, lacked a bid
and was outrun. CELTIC SEA pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way.

Footnotes
SUIKO broke out, pressed the pace two across, assumed command on the turn and drew off under mild urging. BLIND SIGHT raced in the second flight
between horses, angled out on the turn, bid and was no match for the winner. MANI PEDI raced close to the pace along the rail, angled out for the drive and
offered a mild bid to earn show while no threat to the top two. OUI MADAME broke slowly and was crowded at the start, trailed the field and improved
position. SHEZ A DOUBLETAKE raced in the second flight three across, tired into the turn and gave way. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL set a pressured pace to
the second turn, tired and stopped.
