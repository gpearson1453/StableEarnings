Footnotes
GREENPOINT vied for the lead in the two path, took a narrow lead approaching the quarter, was challenged by an inner foe while floating out to the six path
into the lane, but dug in gamely to hold on. WARP SPEED BEAST stalked along the inside, bid from the rail passing the quarter pole, tipped out to the five
path into the stretch, headed the outer eventual winner passing the eighth pole, but was repelled to place. LUSCIOUS DANCER chased in the six path, was
under a ride in the five path around the turn, took aim from the seven path entering the lane, but finished evenly for show. MIRO trailed in the three path,
was under right handed urging while angling out into the stretch, but did not factor. BUCKMASTER brushed with an inner foe at the start, prompted the
leading duo in the five path but faded in the stretch. SECRET SOLDIER brushed with an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead in the four path but
yielded between rivals passing the quarter.

Footnotes
COPPERMASTER raced off the pace in the four path, was under coaxing around the turn and in the five path entering the stretch, angled out to center
passing the eighth pole, and rallied past an inner quartet to win. LIGHTNING TONES chased inside, was driven in the two path around the turn, under left
handed urging from the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on between rivals for place. QUINCY CAFE stalked between foes in the three path, bid
between foes in the two path around the turn, brushed with an inner foe at the top of the stretch, took a narrow lead into the final furlong, but evened out for
show. AWESOME FLAY prompted the pace in the two path, cut the corner, brushed with an outer foe, and bid from the two path at the top of the lane, but
flattened out late. ENGLISH BOB set the pace from the five path into the turn, shifted in to the three path under rousing early around the turn, was under
right handed urging from the six path into the stretch, but faded. BIG JOHN tracked in the four path, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and did
not threaten. HUASTECO was coaxed along while up close in the seven path but was done early.

MISH set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled around the turn, cued passing the quarter, opened up from the three path into the lane, began to
shorten stride inside the final sixteenth, but held safe. DOC AMSTER prompted the pace in the five path, tipped in and was roused form the three path
around the turn, went back out to the five path into the stretch, and chased on for place. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed
in the three path, was coaxed along early around the turn, fanned out to the ten path into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. SLIM SLOW
SLIDER tracked in the six path, was under right handed urging between foes in the four path rounding the turn, but finished evenly from out in the six path
down the stretch. CELESTIAL GLAZE bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated out in the seven path, was under a drive in the five path around the turn,
but did not threaten from the seven path down the lane. WALL STREET TRADER stalked in the three path, lost the right iron passing the half mile pole,
regained that iron while along the rail midway around the turn, but was empty in the stretch.

ETERNAL FLAME raced off the pace five wide, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. WHEATSHEAF was bumped
between at the start, dueled inside of foes in the two path, drifted out turning for home, led to the sixteenth pole, could not withstand the winner late but held
well clear of the rest. ON JET HEIR raced off the pace three wide and rallied between foes to gain the show late. GLORIOUS BUSINESS disputed the pace
four wide and weakened in the drive. SEBARAY failed to menace while racing three wide. JOYFUL SURPRISE raced up close three wide, angled in in
upper stretch and weakened. BLUE LIEUTENANT was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. EVENTFUL played no
factor while racing two wide. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR was bumped at the start, dueled between rivals in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane

inside, came through an opening along the rail to take over near the quarter pole, quickly cleared, drifted out leaving the sixteenth pole and could not resist
the winner late. STORM chased the pace five wide, could not match strides with BEACHLAND from the quarter pole but churned on outside to gain the
show late. PRINCESS TENKO was bumped at the start, raced four wide and had a mild stretch gain. TO THYSELF B TRUE failed to menace while racing
two wide. OAK STREET BEACH set the pace in the two path and weakened through the stretch. BURNAWAY bumped at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. MAERDAMA prompted the pace in the three path and had no response.

Footnotes
GRANDE SOIREE settled off the pace while racing three wide between foes, edged closer two wide between rounding the far turn, tipped out turning for
home, bid nearing the eighth pole, dueled outside of a stubborn HARD TO FATHOM and narrowly prevailed. HARD TO FATHOM stalked the pace two
wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, dug in inside of the winner in midstretch, battled to to the wire and just missed in a game try. PAPA KATZ
saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. TEPPER chased the pace five wide around the first turn, went in the three path around the far turn
and passed tiring rivals. SHA TIN played no factor while racing four wide. SOLAR TAP set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths
marker. NORTH CAROLINA tracked the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. THIRD MOON prompted the pace three wide and retreated through
the stretch.
