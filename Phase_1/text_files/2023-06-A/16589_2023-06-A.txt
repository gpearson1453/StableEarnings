Footnotes
ABSOLUTELY stalked the pace inside for five furlongs in traffic midway on the final bend, split foes into the lane, took over, clear a furlong out, maintained
daylight to the wire under steady handling. ROSIE'S ANGUS in mid pack, also encountered some traffic in the second turn, angled out three wide for room
into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one, clearly second best. SARATOGA PASODOBLE five wide into the first
turn when off the pace, four wide onto the backstretch, was three wide and behind the winner out of the final bend, proved no match for the top two in the
run to the wire. VIEWING TRAIL pressed the pace off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. RIPTIDE ROSE four wide into the first turn, remained in
mid pack off the inside, fanned six wide into the stretch, improved slightly while not a serious threat. DIXIE FARMER broke through gate prestart, balked at
reloading, lacked early foot, improved inside of several rivals then lacked a further advance to finish up flat the final furlong. ANGEL AND ME last away,
continued to lack speed, two path into the lane, traffic nearing the furlong marker, angled in to improve a bit. R T'S GEM popped stall doors prior to the start,
raced forward early, fell back a fit after half, five wide into the lane, had little left. VANCOUVER SNOW remained back in failing to threaten. WHO DAT
GINGER bobbled slightly but broke alertly, set the pace for six furlongs then stopped down the lane.

Footnotes
CHEATIN CHARLIE dueled early along the inside, continued to hold a slight advantage early turn along the rail, disposed of the other speed by late in the
bend, pulled away through the lane under steady handling. JAMAICAN ME fell back to trail after the start, began to move far turn, rallied four wide into the
stretch and finished willingly to earn the place, not a threat to the winner. MIZSPELT in the second flight well out in the strip, four wide into the turn, proved
no match for the winner the final furlong, caught for the place. QUARTER RAT last away, raced well back for five furlongs, improved with some belated
interest out in the strip. SARAH'S VISION raced back off the pace, lacked a serious response in the drive. JANET'S DEVIL dueled up front outside the
winner for over a half and caved. SMART ANALYSIS popped stall doors,forwardly placed three wide, faded through the lane.

Footnotes
RIVER RAFT in the second flight three wide, asked into the stretch, challenged outside the two leaders past the furlong marker, gained command, drifted
out past the sixteenth marker, enough left to hold off the runner up. NO YIELD bothered to be last away, void of speed, continued back far turn, came three
wide for the drive, late run with good energy to just miss. FIRST CLASS HARLOW vied up front closest to the inside, alternated the middle half, shook clear
briefly late in the final turn, could not contain the top two. CHENTI broke out, raced back off the pace, saved ground second turn, improved along the rail into
the stretch, continued with mild interest to the end. BOLT FROM ABOVE broke back, raced in mid pack along the inside, evenly late in lacking a closing
punch. STEP ON IT vied up between horses, weakened drive. MOTANAAFER fell back after the start and was not involved. NEPHI set or forced the pace
three wide, began to give way second turn.

Footnotes
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL within striking distance in some traffic up the backstretch, outside turn, steered out into the five path and widest into the lane, set
down, challenged past the furlong marker while drifting in to bother B W P Special, kicked well clear of that one while finishing up along the rail. B W P
SPECIAL forwardly placed out in the strip, pressed the issue three wide through the turn, challenged when straightened for home, between horses a furlong
out, bothered when the winner drifted in soon after, proved no match for that one, held sway for the runner up position. DRAFT CHOICE away well, showed
the way up the backstretch, vied along the inside turn, weakened the final furlong,saved the show. FOOLISH STEVE back off the pace inside, shuffled back
into the turn, moved off the inside, roused three wide into the stretch, improved position, not a serious threat to the top three. BIG BELLA BROWN closest to
the early leader, contest the issue between foes through the turn, weakened the final furlong. LODE OF BLARNEY back off the early leader in some traffic
in the two path, lacked the needed response in the drive. LIKEN IT back off the pace while in some traffic up the backstretch, failed to menace.
FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF B W P SPECIAL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH,
THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER broke well, pressed the issue from along the inside in the run up the backstretch, shook clear midway on the turn, continued to
hold a daylight advantage past the furlong pole, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MISTS OF TIME in the second flight early,moved closest to the
winner turning for home, chased that one past the furlong marker, not enough late to be in time. CRUSADER EXPRESS away in good order, in the second
flight toward the inside, had little for the top two through the lane to finish up best of the rest. BUNKIE'S SONG off the pace and the inside up the
backstretch, dropped inside turn, saved ground into the lane and went evenly to the wire. QUANA DUDE in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide
for the drive, went one paced down the lane in lacking a closing kick. LT. BONURA in the main body out in the strip, also was four wide through the turn,
lacked a closing response as well. TAPPED OUT popped stall doors, lacked speed in racing back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. MOVE IT lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. BROAD DECISION off step slow, fell far back, was never a factor. MY BOY GUS broke
sharp, set the early pace off the inside, stopped when headed in the turn.

Footnotes
COUNT ON RAIN within striking distance while under some encouragement early, encountered some traffic through the turn, moved out a bit, bid inside the
furlong marker, wore than rival down to prevail. HALF CRAZY took control just after the start, set the pace along the inside, held the winner at bay when that
one moved closer upper stretch, proved stubborn before relenting in the final strides. RISKY PRIORITY reluctant to load, off a step slow then came in to
steady falling far back, continued to trail by a wide margin turn, came four wide for the drive, late run well wide to finish up willingly and be up for the show.
UNCLE CHAN in mid pack while racing outside, came five wide of the turn, moved closest to the top two with a furlong to run, lacked a closing punch to be
nipped for the show spot. GOLDEN CONFUSION back off the pace, moved a bit closer four wide by late in the turn, failed to sustain that modest advance
through the stretch. BLUE LEG JOHN prompted the pace while racing three wide, weakened. WAR KING broke alertly, pressed the issue for a half and
stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG BOSS MAN broke alertly, four wide into the first turn, prompted the two leaders three wide onto the backstretch, continued to the closest pursuer to that
pair into the far turn, made a nice move on the outside to take command soon after, pulled away steadily through the lane while being kept to task.
APPLEWOOD void of speed, saved ground far turn, raced in traffic midway on that bend,slipped through along the rail with a quarter to run under clever
handling. MY BOOK settled off the pace while racing outside, moved closer to the outside of the winner far turn, chased that one into the lane, weakened a
bit and was caught for the second spot. FOOLISH DREAMS away in good order, fell back to mid pack, came four wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire.
MATH MAN broke toward the front, settled back off the pace, came five wide for the drive, improved position slightly with some mild late down the middle
part of the strip. ADIEU LE CHAT bumped start, in mid pack while racing three wide, lacked a response. J C'S IN TOWN dueled up front along the inside,
continued to alternate up the backstretch, began to falter midway on the final turn, continued to tire. BASSETT trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BODE'S LIGHT remained back and never threatened. CAEUS IN PASADENA moved up to duel into the first
turn, continued to duel backstretch in the two path, stopped into the far turn.

Footnotes
HALF PAGE broke out to help tighten up GALAXY THIRTYSIX, was straightened to be forwardly placed early inside, fell back into the turn, moved out four
wide, rebid past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, proved best in a determined effort. SIENNA BREEZE in the second group early outside, crept up
closer three wide turn, put a head in front approaching the furlong grounds, dueled to the line inside the winner, outkicked by that one, held the place.
CATCAKE broke in, to help tighten up GALAXY THIRTYSIX, raced well back early, four wide wide exiting the turn, rallied through upper stretch, getting to
runner up late. GALAXY THIRTYSIX squeezed back at the break, trailed for a half, angled out to be five wide exiting the turn, displayed some mild interest
down the middle of the strip to better her position. SOPHIE'S PRAYER pressured the leader for a half in the two path and faltered. TUGBOAT off a step
slow, saved ground to no avail,. BRAVE CITY GIRL broke on top, showed the way for almost a half inside, gave way at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
A P HUMOR void of early foot, began to advance in the turn, fanned five wide into the lane, closed with good resolve down the middle of the strip to be in
time. TALENTS HOT DEAL broke on top despite bobbling, soon clear, continued to show the way by daylight through the turn and into the lane, still held a
daylight advantage a furlong out, run down by the winner. STOP SHOP N DROP back off the pace and the inside, in some traffic into the lane, staged a rally
from between horses to annex the show. ROSIE SPRIT in mid pack and inside, continued to save ground turn, improved a bit through the lane while
continuing along the rail. SABERFIGHT forwardly placed off the inside, continued within striking distance turning for home, came up empty for the drive.
DARING DARIAN broke back, trailed early, two path into the lane,improved position without posing a serious threat. DIATONIC within striking distance up
the backstretch, four wide turn, tired through the stretch. KATIE'S C pressed the runner up for over a half off the inside, gave way. MISS E. FU off a step
slow, moved up to mid pack, gave way in the drive. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE was finished early, well beaten.
