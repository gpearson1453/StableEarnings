Footnotes
SEEKING SPLENDOR raced in the three path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and held clear
to the wire. BLACK LIMO raced into traffic in the two path headed into the first turn, bumping several times with TIGER HUNTER and being forced to check
in the process, settled in to track the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the three path and kept on in the lane.
UNIQUE PATH raced in the two path early, stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the three path,
switched to the inside in upper stretch and chased the leader home from there. TIGER HUNTER raced in tight quarters while saving ground around the first
turn, bumping with BLACK LIMO several times and checking as a result, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the
far bend from the three and four path and was outkicked in the stretch. EYE ON DESSERT trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two
path throughout and was never a factor. THE RIDER OF HORSE FOUR, UNIQUE PATH, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE FIVE, SEEKING
SPLENDOR, CITING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DIPLOMATICA led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and dug in in the
lane to gamely hold his margin to the wire. FAST TO FORTUNE saved ground around the first bend, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the second bend from the two path, challenged the leader in upper stretch and could not go by that rival, chasing her home from there. RENTAL
POOL raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position while saving
ground around the second turn and kept on in the lane. LILA'S LUCKY LADY hopped up leaving the gate, bumping with the horse to her inside in the
process, saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far bend and made no bid. RABBIT
TWENTY TWO bumped mildly with the horse to her outside at the start, saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch and around the second bend and never threatened. WEST SIDE GIRL bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, pulled up headed
into the first turn and was vanned off after walking soundly onto the van.

JERUSALEMA (IRE) chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole,
dueled in tight quarters, brushing with GRANDIOSE SUMMER in upper stretch and continued to battle to the wire to just get the win. GRANDIOSE
SUMMER raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the two path coming around the bend, brushed lightly with
JERUSALEMA in upper stretch and dueled with that rival to the finish, just missing. PAT'S GAL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early,
navigated the turn from the three path and chased the top two home from there. DIXIE GIRL TO tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the bend in the four path and faded in the lane. MIZZEN GEE MA led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired
in the stretch. DR Z'S ELSA trailed the field throughout, came around the turn in the two and three path and was never a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY
WAS MADE INTO THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SAINT SARENA led the way on the inside up the backstretch, opened up while racing in the two path around the turn and held clear to the wire. BAILOUT
KELA chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch. PICAFLOR
raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend improved position in late stretch. JOMAMA SASSY stalked the leaders on the outside
early, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked in the lane. ELLE'S LIL DIVA pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the bend in the four path and faded in the stretch. BARBARA ROHLOFF tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the
three path around the bend and tired in the stretch. ICYWILBURNYEH lost his rider leaving the gate, chased the field for a spell, was caught and walked off.
A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START OF THE RACE. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE TWO,
ICYWILBURNYEH, HAD A FAIR BEGINNING AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
