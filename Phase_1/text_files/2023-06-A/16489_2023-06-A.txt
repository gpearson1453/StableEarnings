MY MOONDANCER vied for the early lead with MISS MENSA, shook that one off before going three furlongs and increased her advantage. MISS MENSA
vied for the early lead from along the inside, was unable to stay with the winner late but held on well for the place. LILY PAD LAKE hopped in the air at the
start, then saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. R HAPPY PLACE showed brief speed
from between horses early and gave way.

Footnotes
ZACCHEUS quickly opened a clear lead, saved ground setting the pace and was not seriously threatened. DIRT ROAD DOLLARS saved ground while
being reserved off the pace, lacked room from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths pole. angled out to be five-wide nearing the quarter pole and
finished strongly. LAGO DE ORO was prominently placed while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and finished well in a steady effort.
ATTORNEY LOUIS saved ground chasing the early pace, drifted out to be three-wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally. OAKDALE ROAD was
unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

YOUR ROYAL COIL was prominent from the start while racing four-wide, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and was all out to prevail. FRISCO FRILLS
saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. IN THE VAULT was unhurried early, swung out
to he five-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished fast. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and gained her
best stride too late. REIGN OF FIRE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide but lacked the needed late response. FEATHER INTHE WIND saved
ground setting the early pace, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole and weakened. FIRE ESCAPE prompted the issue to the stretch and tired.

ANNA'S IRON MAN broke sharply to clear the field early, then saved ground dueling for the lead in the turn, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole and
was all out to prevail. EXECUTIVE ACTION was never far back, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly. ABRAAJ MIRAGE
saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, slipped through during the drive and finished well for the show in a steady effort. WESTERN RULE
bumped with DEVILS WORKSHOP at the start, then was reserved off the pace, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter to offer a bid and then flattened out
during the drive. DEVILS WORKSHOP bumped at the start, then was unhurried, came four-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. PARTY FOUL
dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the outside to the stretch and tired. BESAME MUCHO prompted the issue for three furlongs while three-wide

Footnotes
MO CONNELLY saved ground setting the pace, opened clear entering the stretch and increased her advantage. MEAN SHARON prompted the issue while
racing two-wide, could not stay with the winner during the drive but held on well for the placed. BRITE TAN saved ground while being allowed to settle in
stride and finished in a mild rally. MISCHIEF MAMA was forwardly placed from the start, drifted out five-wide entering the stretch and finished willingly when
straightened. TWITTERATI saved ground while being unhurried and failed to threaten. BOUNDFORJAMAICA dropped back while racing two-wide and was
not a factor. DODROPIN appeared to get hung up in the gate getting away well behind the field and was outrun. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY,
DODROPIN WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
