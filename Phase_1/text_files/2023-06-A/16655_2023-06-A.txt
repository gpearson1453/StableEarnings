in the final seventy yards while best of the rest. FIRST SONG chased to the half, ran on evenly from that point for show spot. SILENT STEVE no speed

WELL CONNECTED tracking from outside to the stretch, roused to kick clear in the late going under stout handling to the wire. HAGLER no speed to the
turn, sustained a rally in the stretch for place spot. ZIP IT SCOTTY lost best chance at the start when rearing badly from the gate, rallied up rail in a gallant
effort for the show spot. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET chased leader to the turn, dueled in the stretch run and faltered late. SOUTH SEA raced along three wide to
the turn and could not go in the stretch. DESOTO'S WAR inside speed to the front, battled to the stretch but could not go on 9in the final furlong and
weakened readily. BEACH FRONT never menaced throughout with no excuse.
