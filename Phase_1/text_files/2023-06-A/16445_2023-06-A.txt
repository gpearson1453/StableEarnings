Footnotes
BOLT FORTY FIVE sped to the lead at the start nd set the pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of HUSKER BUTCH near the quarter pole, shook
off rival leaving the turn, opened up to clear command and kept to task. HUSKER BUTCH tracked four deep in the flight sitting just off the early pacesetter,
moved up to challenge eventual winner at the quarter pole, could not move on with rival turning for home but sustained a solid bid and finished clearly
second best. RUDIANO raced off the compact second flight in the early stages, swung four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and secured a share.
MR. MUNNINGS chased the leader between rivals in opening stages, ran on two wide around the turn then gave way in the lane. MEGA SHACK hustled
along in pursuit along the rail in the early going, saved ground entering the lane then retreated in the lane. CAPTAIN DOZER chased three wide in early
contention, flattened around the turn and continued to falter down the lane.

Footnotes
SWEET NELLIE dueled three deep in opening stages and continued to battle outside of COLLECTED GLORY into upper stretch, dug in gamely under firm
handling, seized command in final strides and inched away. COLLECTED GLORY dueled inside a duo up the backstretch, continued to match strides with
SWEET NELLIE into upper stretch, held a slight edge at the furlong marker, battled on gamely along the rail then got denied in final strides. PEACH
STREET broke on top then settled back although never too far off the front runners, made a move three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four
wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and finished well clear over the rest. SUGAR BELL raced just off the embattled trio in the opening quarter, hustled
along two wide around the turn then tired in the drive. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM was not too far back in early stages, failed to advance under pressure
along the rail around the turn then faded in the lane. LUV MAP dueled between rivals in opening stages, battled on past the three eighths pole then steadily
retreated.

CLAY'S MOON STONE tracked the pace two wide up the backstretch, crept closer around the far turn, given cue two wide at the head of the lane, dueled
outside of ELUSIVE AMELIA, fought on gamely with rival holding a slight edge, battled on near equal terms approaching the wire and nailed foe in final
stride. ELUSIVE AMELIA sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, remained the leader near the inside around the far turn, took on
the challenge from CLAY'S MOON STONE at the head of the lane, battled back tenaciously from the inside, never gave up just got nipped on the wire.
SWEET LAURA settled in the back and saved ground heading into the first turn, edged a bit closer and raced off the top trio, picked up the tempo midway
around the far turn, hustled along three to four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and secured a share. ALL GOOD TIMES was the closet pursuer of
the pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the far turn then flattened in the lane. MY DAMS ATITUDE settled off the early pace,
swung three to four wide into the lane and had no response when called upon.

REINA DEL SUR was allowed to settle in opening strides and raced in the back, continued unhurried leaving the backstretch and saved ground around the
turn, cut the corner and given cue entering the lane, shifted out three wide near the furlong marker, split foes determinedly and prevailed under a driving
finish. LIL DITTY'S KITTY rated off the pace up the backstretch, urged three to four wide around the far turn, quickly gathered ground along the outside in
the final furlong but could not not get by the firm holding winner. PAISLEY'S VISION got hooked up with SWEETNESS TO in opening strides and dueled up
the backstretch, continued to battle for command around the turn, shook free in upper stretch then got swallowed up by the late gainers. SWEETNESS TO
dueled for the lead in opening strides racing outside of PAISELY'S VISION, battled on two wide around the turn, could not match strides in upper stretch but
remained in range then flattened in late stages. GAME TO PLAY tracked the embattled duo through early stages, made a bid for the top pair racing three
wide around the turn then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SEASIDE BOY was allowed to settle in early stages and rated off the pace, picked up the tempo past the half mile marker, circled up four wide to take
command mid-way around the far turn, shook off the brief challenge of WHISKEY WEDNESDAY in upper stretch and kept clear under a drive. WHISKEY
WEDNESDAY rated off the pace in early stages, picked up the tempo past the half mile marker, gained closer contention along the rail around the far turn,
briefly advanced to challenge the winner at the head of the lane, could not move on with rival, dueled for second place and nipped rival for the spot.
MEGATAP dueled inside of MR.SOLO around the first turn and up the backstretch, got overtaken when the winner swept by midway around the far turn, still
had kick left in reserve, ran on three wide down the lane and got nipped for place. HERZEN tracked the early pace, urged two wide around the far turn and
failed to move on. HIT ONE OUT was forwardly placed sitting just off the top pair, ran on into the far turn then weakened near the quarter pole. MR. SOLO
dueled outside of MEGATAP up the backstretch and into the far turn then retreated in the lane. THREE FOR THREE failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
FIT AND FAMOUS sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm still unleashed around the turn, cut the corner entering the
lane, given cue at the three sixteenths pole, responded willingly, widened to a commanding advantage and finished ridden out in the final sixteenth. MY
HAPPINESS lacked early speed and raced three wide in the back, angled out wider and asked for more midway around the turn, swung five wide into the
lane, responded in the lane, steadily gained ground and cleared second best. TARA'S TIME got pushed inward and came away last at the start, picked up
the pace and raced four deep in the flight behind the leader late on the backstretch, hustled along four wide around the turn, sustained a mild bid down the
lane and secured show. DIAL SUM IN was forwardly placed racing just off the early pacesetter, launched a two wide bid for the leader around teh turn,
sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. SING LUCY SING raced in range up the backstretch, flattened around the turn and continued to falter in
the lane. ESPIRIDION tracked the pacesetter, made a two wide move approaching the quarter pole then retreated in the lane.

GOLDEN LUNA raced three wide in the second flight up the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide near the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, vied
with MO CHOCTAW a furlong out then dug in gamely, seized command and kicked clear. MO CHOCTAW set a pressured pace in opening stages and vied
for the lead with the winner at the quarter pole, battled on with GOLDEN LUNA into the final furlong then had nothing left in reserve for final stages.
IMPRESSOR raced two wide in the second flight up the backstretch, launched an outside bid heading into the lane, sustained a steady bid and just lasted
for show. MONTEREY PENINSULA raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane, showed interest in the stretch run and just missed show. C C'S
LEGACY tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner and continued in contention to the furlong marker then cam eup empty. REVENIR was well
reserved racing in the back, came wide into the lane and had no response. RECONCILING FORCE pressed the early pace, vied for the lead at the quarter
then retreated in the lane.
