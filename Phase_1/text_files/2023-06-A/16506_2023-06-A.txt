Footnotes
LADY MAEVE (IRE) had a good position behind the pacesetter into the first turn, tracked on the rail through the back straight, angled out for run in the two
path at the top of the lane, took command at the eighth pole and held safe to the line. MACHISIMA travelled in midfield all alone rating kindly down the
backstretch, began to rally outside at the quarter marker, threatened four wide for the stretch drive, was gaining slowly down the lane but could not reel in
the winner and had to settle for second best in the end. PINO IN A PURSE prompted the pace two wide in the early going, took closer order to the
frontrunner forcing the issue on the far turn, was in with a chance between runners three wide at the top of the lane but needed for to threaten at the wire.
SPARKLE SAMMY led the field into the first turn, continued to dictate the pace down the back straight, was headed outside by the winner turning for home,
fought on stubbornly until deep stretch and faded late losing placings just before the wire. COURTINGCOURTNEY was allowed to settle near the rear
entering the first turn, trailed in the two path at the half, was asked for run three eighths from home, offered little run and passed a tiring rival in the final
furlong. PHIL IN ECHO stalked at the rear just off the fence into the first turn, travelled inside down the backside, was scrubbed on for more run at the three
furlong pole and gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
WINGS FROM ABOVE took the lead in the beginning, was then content sitting off the pacesetter entering the turn, cruised to the lead at the five sixteenths
pole, opened up turning for home and had enough left late to hold safe by a diminishing margin at the wire. GHOST PAINTER stumbled on the break to trail
in the early going, circled four wide around horses at the three furlong marker, began to lengthen her stride in the four path in mid stretch and finished up
well to make it close at the wire. MAP took the lead inside with five furlongs from the prize, was collared by the winner outside midway through the turn,
gave way to the winner in upper stretch but stubbornly battled on the fence late to capture the show money. PORT RENFREW travelled in hand in the
middle of the pack watching the top pair down the backside, comfortably closed in on the leaders at the quarter marker and stalled through the stretch.
JUST ON TIME stalked in midfield down the backstretch, was asked early into the turn to quicken with others, could not make any impression and was
never in contention through the lane. ROSES ARE FREE settled near the rear three deep between rivals down the backside, was asked to keep pace with
others with three eighths remaining and lost touch with the field through the turn.

Footnotes
PATCHES O'HOULIHAN engaged for the front two deep while in hand in the beginning stages, still hounded the leader outside running comfortably on the
turn, began to edge away in workmanlike fashion in the final furlong to get the measure of his rival in deep stretch. AIM FOR THE SKY had a short lead on
the eventual winner down the back straight, continued on the rail upfront narrowly throughout the turn, battled inside four wide through the stretch and gave
way grudgingly in the late stages. SOUPER CLASSY was unhurried on the rail near the rear in the early going, advanced smartly inside on the turn and
closed up the fence to capture third in a tight photo at the line. THREEFIFTYSEVEN tracked on the rail while in hand watching the top contesting pair with
three furlongs from the finish, closed the gap on the frontrunners to be in the hunt turning for home in the five path and could not threaten late levelling out in
the final sixteenth. SOUPER RUSH stalked at the back outside of foes two deep down the backside, made no headway on rivals through the turn and
passed a tired competitor running three wide between horses to the finish. GATLING GUN tracked two wide outside in the second flight at the half, could not
rally three wide losing ground to others running on the turn and was empty finishing to the wire.

Footnotes
LANGSTAFF ROAD settled in midpack on the rail entering the first turn, was on hold inside behind runners when the field bunched up at the half, weaved
his way through horses on the far turn, loomed four wide in upper stretch and was full of run to the wire to get up nearing the finish. HUNGRY WOLF
showed good early foot to clear from the outside to lead the field into the first turn on the rail, set the soft pace down the backside and through the far turn,
opened up on the field at the top of the lane and was caught by the surging winner in deep stretch. COLONEL MUSTARD travelled near the back inside
early on, shifted outside three deep tracking with a half left to run, was in the mix three wide straightening out for the drive and finished up evenly to settle for
a clear third at the line. MAGNIFICENT MARIO trailed the field in the early stages of this two turn event, was roused at the three eighths marker circling
runners outside, angled out four deep turning for home and passed some through the lane to garner a minor share. UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE)
tracked the loose leader down the backside, was asked at the three furlong pole to go after the frontrunner, could not gain at the top of the stretch and
weakened on the fence at the furlong marker. BLASITO had a good inside position sitting behind the leaders down the backstretch, was nudged on the
fence into the final turn and gave way on the rail two furlongs out to be a non factor to the finish. CHAIRMAN LAYLA travelled in the middle of the pack two
wide between runners four furlongs out, was ridden for more on the final turn and backed away the five sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
TRIPLE TREA broke just a step slowly, raced mid-pack off the rail in the clear into the turn, shifted six wide in upper stretch, was flying late and drove past
inside the final seventy yards. BUCYK broke a step slowly, was strongly encouraged and advanced up to within range of the leaders heading into the turn
three to four deep, edged closer and bid four to five wide at the top of the stretch taking a narrow lead, was outkicked by the winner but held place under
steady urging. MIDNIGHT MASCOT broke on top but ceded the lead to an intent rival content to press that one while shifting in, went two to three wide on
the turn, battled for the lead coming out of that bend, fought on in late stretch and narrowly missed second. MOTSKARI was bumped just lightly in the early
going, tracked the leaders from inside, came out five wide in upper stretch, finished up well willingly but was too late. YACHT BOY was coaxed forward to
the lead while moving nearer the rail, was pressured into the turn saving ground inside on that bend, fought on till late stretch then yielded. VALLEY
VICTORY was a bit reluctant to load, veered out at the start, mid-pack outside 4-6w, faded. HALCON NEGRO was fractious in the gate, broke a step slowly,
was outpaced. IMPRESSIVE STYLE was forced in, bumped lightly with a rival and steadied slightly, dropped back and raced off the pace near the inside,
failed to rally.

Footnotes
ROCKCREST broke sharply and was quickly clear to dictate terms while being guided nearer the inside, set the tempo racing just off the rail through the
turn, turned back a mild challenger leaving the bend, drew off when roused in upper stretch and was eased up late with victory safely assured. CANDY
OVERLOAD settled mid-pack outside in the early going, travelled about three to four wide into the turn, shifted in a touch at the quarter pole and put to stout
urging, rallied inside foes to secure the place and make up ground on the winner but was no real threat to that one while clearly second best. LAST
AMERICAN EXIT was forwardly-positioned racing near the inside, tracked from between runners on the turn, shifted six wide into upper stretch, kicked on to
garner show honors. RELOAD'S RASCAL was a bit fractious in the gate, broke a step slowly, raced well back of the leaders early, advanced inside on the
turn, angled seven wide into upper stretch and gained position but needed more late. MISS SPEEDY bumped very lightly with a rival at the start, pursued
the leader into the turn just off that one's flank, ridden along three wide at the five-sixteenths, came out a bit further into upper stretch and could not kick on
with the top ones. MASON'S GAMBLE was forwardly-positioned inside, put under a hold coming past the half in behind runners, saved ground along the rail
on the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. POSEIDON STEEL shifted in early to be two wide up the backstretch, raced mostly two to four deep thereafter, ran
on to improve position in the stretch. DUN DRUM raced in the back half of the field off the rail, went evenly and made on bid. FORESTER'S FORTUNE
settled outside at the rear, failed to rally. SECRET RESERVE was up close to the leaders outside rivals going four to five wide, dropped back and faded.
BOSSY HOLIDAY bumped lightly with a foe at the start, steadied on heels at the five-eighths, was never a threat.

Footnotes
SOUPER DORMY broke sharp to be in front at the start, soon after relaxed to have a good position rating kindly inside behind the leaders, waited
comfortably throughout the turn, was headstrong straightening out for the drive when looking for a clear path, finally found a seam at the three sixteenth
pole, burst on by splitting runners and won going away at the wire. LUCKY SCORE stalked near the rear on the rail in the early stages, saved all the ground
inside on the turn, rallied on the fence in upper stretch , angled off the tiring leaders at the eighth pole and split foes late getting for the second money.
VOODOO ZIP settled in the middle of the pack on the fence with a half remaining, sat behind the winner at the quarter marker looking for room, found a
clear lane four deep at the furlong pole and finished strong just missing out on the runner up finish at the line. STRIKER prompted the pace outside down
the backside and throughout the turn, was headed running between rivals in the two path at the eighth pole and faded in deep stretch to hold for a minor
role. ROARING FORTIES took a slim lead under a snug hold travelling up front through the turn, was collared outside by multiple runners at the furlong
marker and yielded on the fence in the late stages of the race. COINAGE trailed the field at the half, continued to be last turning for home, angled out to the
seven path for the drive and offered late energy to finish up strongly not being beaten all that much for the runner up share in the end. FULL SCREEN
stalked inside near the back of the field in the beginning, angled outside three wide on the turn, shifted in for the stretch drive on the rail and could not get
involved running to the finish. IRONSTONE travelled outside of rivals in midfield three wide at the three furlong pole, shifted out starting a rally in the seven
path at the top of the lane and made little impression outside to the wire. SILENT RUNNER tracked in the second flight outside three deep on the turn, was
ridden in the five path at the quarter pole to keep pace between foes and gave way in mid stretch. SHEKKY SHEBAZ tracked the engaging duo with runners
on either side throughout the turn, bid four wide in upper stretch and retreated between horses at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
TREASON stalked the leading pair from outside into the first turn going four to five wide on that bend, continued just off those two into the far turn, took over
the lead at the five-sixteenths, was clear turning for home, held at bay the challenge of CARROTHERS, who was caught outside foes in the second flight
going five wide on the first turn, raced just off the leading trio up the backstretch into the far turn, urged along about the five-sixteenths, came into upper
stretch with aim on the winner, drifted about and could make no headway. TYSON broke outwardly just a bit, settled in behind the leaders in the second
flight racing two to four wide throughout, kept on in the lane to secure show honors. ARTIE'S STORM was in a bit tight between runners just after the break,
settled in the back half of the field racing near inside, began to pick it up two to three wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch to get up for fourth. WOLFIE'S
DYNAGHOST pressed the early pace from outside in about the three to four path, applied more pressure up the backstretch at the five-and-one-half taking
a narrow lead, continued two to three deep on the far turn but was overtaken late on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. CONGLOMERATE settled off
the pace shifting in three to four wide into the first turn, swung eight deep turning for home, gained mildly. WAR BOMBER (IRE) got away alertly and went
straight to the front, dictated the early terms racing just off the rail, was pressured early up the backstretch and continued to be prominent inside, gave way
in the stretch. RONDURE settled off the pace caught four to five wide early, made a mild advance on the far turn still four to five deep, never reached
serious contention and flattened out in the lane. AVOMAN tracked from inside up close to the leaders, steadily weakened past the quarter pole. BRINGER
OF RAIN settled mid-pack off the rail, raced two to four wide throughout and failed to rally. LUCKMAN trailed the field early and was never near enough to
threaten.

Footnotes
SIMCOE had a good position on the rail watching the front two runners engage down the backstretch, waited inside on the far turn, bullied his way through
in the two path at the top of the lane, opened up at the eighth pole and held safe crossing the finish line. WICKENHEISER was taken back to be near the
rear soon after the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the rail at the half, waited inside midway on the far turn, had no path in upper stretch, finally
found a seam at the eighth pole and finished strongly to garner the runner up position at the wire. STOWAWAY angled in at the start to prompt two wide for
the lead into the first turn, continued to press the issue down the back straight, posed the threat four wide between runners in upper stretch and stayed on to
hold for third in the end. RED LINE OVERDRIVE took command from the onset, set the fractions on the first turn, dictated the pace down the back straight,
continued to battle on the front taken the field into the stretch drive, was collared by the winner a furlong out and faded the last sixteenth to hold for a small
share of the prize. HALL OF DREAMS trailed the field with a half left to run, burst between runners splitting foes midpoint on the turn, loomed boldly seven
wide at the top of the stretch and stalled in the final furlong. MO TOURIST was pushed inwards at the break, settled in midpack two wide at the half, had no
room from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, angled outwards eight wide at the eighth pole and finished evenly to the wire. MAD MOCHA tracked just
outside in the two path watching the top pair down the backside, was ridden to keep when the pace quicken midpoint on the final turn and tired between
runners in upper stretch. MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU broke in at the start, was eager five wide running in the first turn, tracked three wide in the second flight
down the back straight, offered a mild run three wide at the five sixteenths pole and weakened in the six path between foes running to the wire. CURLIN'S
GHOST was in tight quarters soon after the break, clipping inside rivals heels, stumbled, recovered to be with the pack down the backstretch, put in a mild
rally into the far turn and stopped at the five sixteenths pole. STEWARDS GENERAL INQUIRY REGARDING THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN
