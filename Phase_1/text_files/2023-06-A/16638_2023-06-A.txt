Footnotes
ZONG TOUGH was sharp out of the gates, settled in hands off the pace, raced three wide, advanced at the three eighths pole, cleared the front runner at
the five sixteenth pole then drew off down the lane and won easiily. GALLANT STAR settled off of the pace, raced in the three path, moved at the half mile
pole, shifted out into the four path and circled the field at the three eighths pole, was under a drive entering the upper stretch, closed well and was able to
take second place. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST raced along the rail, was mid pack early, advanced into a stalking position, maintained his position there after.
YES BAB had an awkward start and showed little. DONNA'S COURT went to the front willingly, raced along the rail, set the pace, was challenged and
relinquished the lead at the five sixteenth pole, and tired in the stretch. MEDITATE raced in the two path, settled off the pace while racing inside of another
rival, launched his bid at he half mile pole, and made no impact late.

Footnotes
JOANIE GAL raced in the three path while chasing the early leader down the back side, improved position through the turn, shifted out at the quarter pole,
was floated out by the early leader even more, was encouraged and kept on pooint, kept closing and building momentum, drew next to the early leader and
cleared her in thelaast eighth of a mile, was threatened by an outside foe closing fast but had enough of a lead was able to put another win in her column.
CUSTOM GUITAR raced in the middle of the pack in the four path early launched a bid and started gaining ground at the three eighths pole, improved
position on the outside through the turn, was inching closer in the stretch under encouragement, was floated a bit wide while still closing, passed a tired rival
in the last sixteenth, kept closing in on the eventual winner but just missed today. DERBY DAY LASSIE was the early speed in the race, showed the way
while setting a moderate pace, saved ground, drifted out in the turn and even more in the stretch then gave way. CRYSTAL CRESCENT was off slow,
moved down to the rail and saved ground, was asked and responded well while gaining ground, angled out at he quarter pole, was encouraged and driven
through the lane while she raced in the eight path was able to finish with a mild bid. SHEZA HUNK raced off the pace along the rail, angled out at the
quarter pole, was three wide in the stretch but had no real impact today. WHO DAT GREY was never involved. WHAT CAN I SAY showed brief speed, then
faded. GEE SHE'S PRETTY showed little.

Footnotes
ZULTAN vied for the early lead, willingly showed the way and set the pace, raced along the rail and saved ground through out, was pressured by rivals
down the back side and late in the furlong ground, continued to keep a length in front and finished as an un contested winner. OGRE'S LION KING raced
mid pack and three wide early, launched a bid at the half mile pole, responded well and began to close, angled out in the upper stretch and closed well while
being encouraged, just was not enough today. REVERENT raced on the rail, stalked the front runners, advanced willingly after the half mile pole, was in
striking distance but had no late kick. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE raced off the pace, was four wide while finding his stride, launched a bid at the half mile
marker, continued wide through the turn, gained ground and responded well, shifted out eight wide in the stretch and closed with every stride but to no avail.
TRAFFIC CONTROL vied for the lead, decided to pressure the early leader and raced right off his hip, followed the leader close behind through the turn,
tried to take command but was repelled, struggled to switch leads in the stretch and faded at the eighth pole. RED RAIDER XPRESS raced mid pack from
the rail, raced inside of horses, had a well timed clean trip and slightly improved late. THUNDER ROAD was off a bit slow, raced along the rail, improved
position down the backside then tired. SHANKINSTINE raced mid pack but had no kick. PEPPERONIKID showed little. BELLO CREEDO hit the side of the
gate and lost his rider. THERE WAS A STEWARTS INQUIREY REGARDING THE START AND THE STEWARTS RULED BELLO CREEDO HIT THE
GATE ON IS OWN, IS A STARTER AND DID NOT FINISH THE RACE.

GUITAR SLIM raced off of the pace along the rail, settled in hands and waited for his cue, launched his bid at he half mile pole, improved position while
racing on the rail, gained ground and inched closer to the front runners, part the quarter pole with company, raced in a set down the lane, shook his
company after the eighth pole, closed under encouragement ,shifted out into the three path, drew next to the leader with just a few strides to go, cleared that
rival in a few jumps and took the win. OAK HILL LG stalked the front runner from the three path, stayed just off the leader until the half, drew beside the
leader and matched strides with that foe until the quarter pole, tired to clear that one, but could not and had to battle down the lane, finally shook that rival
but had a fast closing foe on the outside, continued to battle with the new challenger, tried but was beat at the wire and was second best today. CATHOLIC
GUILT vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the first two fractions, then faltered. UNANIMOUSLY raced mid pack and maintained that position through out.
