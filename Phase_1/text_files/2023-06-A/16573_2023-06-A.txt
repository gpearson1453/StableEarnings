Footnotes
CHIPZ pressed the pace, challenged for the lead leaving the turn, dueled through the stretch and proved best in a long drive. TAX FREE TEXAS was
unhurried early, dropped inside, rallied on the turn, angled out, swung wide, closed willingly and was gaining late. HORNS N HALOS set a pressured pace,
drew clear briefly on the turn, dueled through the stretch, was in tight near the wire and was outfinished in a game effort. JUST KEEP LAUGHIN pressed the
pace, bid inside to contend, was in tight late and outfinished in a good effort. MAKE UP A STORY broke awkwardly and was steadied at the start, raced in
the back, advanced around the turn, bid three wide and finished well. HOLY BULLET stalked the pace towards the outside, rallied four wide on the turn, fell
back into the stretch and hung late. SWEET BUT FIERCE showed speed to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. SI PASA ALGO raced close to
the pace along the rail, was checked hard entering the turn and stopped.

COMMUNITY LEADER vied three across and inched away late to prove best. SPORTY PANTS broke awkwardly, vied between horses to deep stretch and
yielded grudgingly. JUANA RUMBLE vied inside to deep stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and held safely for show. OUR VALENTINO dropped inside
and failed to threaten in an even effort. EVERYROSEHASATHORN broke out, raced close to the pace towards the outside, was through early and steadily
dropped back. HES HIGH OH SILVER was checked after the start and failed to contend.
