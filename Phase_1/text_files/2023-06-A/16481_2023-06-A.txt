Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE SOUSI chased the pacesetter in the two path down the backside, began to close the gap on the frontrunner at the three furlong pole,
quickly assumed command at the quarter marker, opened up comfortably in upper stretch and coasted home for the victory. LEGISLATOR trailed three wide
at the half mile marker, rallied four wide around horses through the turn, had the winner in his sights at the top of the lane but could not reel him in to pose a
threat down the stretch. TOWN'S WARRIOR was unhurried early on the rail to trail the field, took closer order to the pack entering the turn, had to tap on the
brakes when behind rivals inside at the three furlong pole, angled outside three deep midpoint on the turn and closed well in the five path to be a clear third
in the end. MOON OVER EGBERT led the stalking flight two wide between foes down the backside, was ridden for more with runners on either side at the
five sixteenth marker and was one paced finishing to the wire. CADFAEL chased the frontrunner on the rail in the beginning stages, was coaxed for to keep
up with three eighths remaining and gave way turning for home. PROUD RONIN set the fractions leaving the chute, continued to dictate the pace angling to
the rail into the turn, was collared outside by the winner two furlongs from home and retreated on the fence in mid stretch.

Footnotes
DOMER ALLURE hounded the pacesetter into the first turn, was content sitting outside the leader down the backstretch, pushed the button to go midway on
the far turn, took control by the quarter pole, opened up smartly at the top of the lane and cruised home for the win. KNOTTY AND NICE was in a good
position inside watching the top pair in the early stages of the race, advanced on the fence throughout the far turn, shifted off the tiring leader to be three
wide turning for home and determinedly ran to the wire between rivals to hold for the place share. DREAMS AND SCHEMES travelled in the middle of the
field under a good hold with four furlongs left to run, picked up the pace between horses midway on the far turn and was five wide offering a good finish in
upper stretch battling outside the wire losing out on the place award in the end. WAHRER SCHATZ settled near the back inside down the backstretch,
saved ground five sixteenths from the finish, angled four wide in upper stretch, shifted inside rallying at the eighth pole and ran on to the wire to be involved
in the photo for place. HIGH TREASON trailed on the rail in the early going, tried to get more involved three wide at the three furlong pole, made little impact
on the final turn and passed tired foes in the stretch. I'M A BOURBON GIRL took the field through the first turn and back straight while setting soft fractions
up top, was collared outside by the winner offering no resistance at the quarter pole and tired on the fence at the furlong marker. CRUMLIN BEAST settled
in midfield three wide on the first turn, continued that position at the half, when the running started midpoint on the far turn could not quicken with others and
gave way in the five path at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
GIZMO'S B F F tracked in the middle of the pack on the rail, waited inside into the turn, was nudged on to go after the leader with five sixteenths to run,
shifted out to the four path for the drive and found her best stride late wearing down her rivals getting up in time. HATMAKER HOLIDAY prompted the pace
on the rail in the early going, was ridden with five sixteenths for more, took command three wide entering the lane, battled through the stretch and was
caught late by the surging winner on the outside. SILENT GHOST set the fractions in the early going, was collared outside at the top of the lane, battled on
stubbornly in the stretch and gave way grudgingly near the finish. LOADED QUESTION stalked on the rail down the backside, put in a good move picking
up runners smartly on the fence in the turn, was in range turning for home inside and levelled out in the final eighth. SUPER LUNAR stalked near the rear
three wide down the backside, was ridden for more at the three eighths marker, offered no response through turn and passed tired runners in the final
sixteenth. NORTHERN RUBY settled in midpack three deep at the half, put in a brief rally three wide at the three furlong pole, was in the mix for a small
piece of the prize straightening out for the drive and stalled in mid stretch. STARLIGHT RIDGE travelled in midfield between rivals with a half remaining, was
urged with runners on either side midpoint on the turn, offered little in the stretch drive and faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MIA AND ME was prominent early but soon eased back off the leaders to track that duel in behind, moved three to four wide coming to the quarter pole, was
in command by the top of the stretch, drew off as much the best. TREBUCHET stalked from outside into the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, was no
match for the winner but secured the place. BUSTA GROOVE was guided nearer the rail in the early going racing in behind the leaders, shifted out past the
quarter pole, ran on to get up for show. YORKVILLE dueled outside, weakened. DEFOGGER settled at the back racing outside, swung out for the stretch
run, was unable to menace. RIVER OF BABYLON bumped with a rival at the start, was encouraged forward inside but checked on heels about the
five-eighths, thereupon settled at the back inside, came out for the drive but was never near enough to threaten. VIDEO VIDA moved forward inside, dueled
through the turn, was empty for the stretch. RED ZEPPELIN bumped with the inside foe at the start, was coaxed forward early, forced in by a rival at the
five-eighths then steadied at the half when that rival moved nearer the rail, saved ground on the turn, failed to rally. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CRAFTY OAKS broke inwards to begin, recovered to have a good position tracking the top trio four furlongs from the wire, made little gain on the leaders
when roused through the turn, split foes in the three path in upper stretch and was full of run rallying in mid stretch to win going away in the end. PIPIT led
the field on the rail at the four furlong pole, improved up front on the turn to open up on runners at the top of the lane, began to get leg weary in mid stretch
and was caught a few jumps before the wire on the fence by the fast closing winner. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS stalked near the back of the back in the
beginning stages, continued to see most of the field entering the stretch, began to find her legs five wide down the lane and closed strongly at the furlong
marker to get up for third money. WHY EM SEA AY was bumped at the start to be near the back running down the backstretch, was in tight quarters
between horses entering the turn, angled out widest in the six path and finished up evenly for a minor role. MOION was pinched at the start to be near the
back in the three path in the early going, put in a good move four wide around foes at the seven sixteenth pole, continued her sustained rally on the turn,
loomed five wide in upper stretch and stalled with a sixteenth remaining. MIRAMICHI was away alertly to have a good position down the backstretch, angled
to the rail offering an early inside move at the three eighths marker, was in the mix on the fence turning for home and weakened at the sixteenth pole. VILLI
OLENTO settled near the rear on the fence down the backside, was steadied on the fence entering the turn, could not regroup to make an impression
through the turn and was a non factor to the wire. CALL THE QUESTION broke out at the start, pressed the issue outside at the half, continued to chase the
frontrunner through the turn, angled four wide at the top of the stretch and tired at the furlong pole. SWIFT RIVER lost all chance at the start when away
poorly, trailed and could not recover to be involved. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #3 VILLI OLENTO ON #4 WHY EM SEA AY

Footnotes
OL' BLONDIE hounded the pace four wide with four furlongs left to go, took control outside midway on the turn, opened up on her competitors turning for
home, was kept to the task at the eighth pole and held safe at the wire. BASALT STREET tracked in the second flight on the rail, waited inside behind the
tiring leader midpoint on the turn, found a seam on the fence in upper stretch, burst through at the furlong marker, shifted just outside and finished up well
late to make it close at the wire for the win. GOGO SHOES was unhurried on the fence to be last down the backstretch, angled out to the five path to start
picking up rivals and offered a good closing kick to get for third in deep stretch. VERDEJO tracked between horses watching the front pair on the turn, was
in the hunt three deep at the top of the lane for a small piece of the prize and finished evenly late losing the show award at the wire. BREATHING FIRE
travelled on the outside in the tracking flight three deep throughout the turn, was in in range four wide turning for home but needed more between rivals to
be a contender in the late stages. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING led the field just off the fence at the half mile marker, was collared outside by the winner midway
on the turn, was urged to keep up at the quarter pole and gave way in the two path in mid stretch. HAI BOBBI was allowed to settle in the two path at the
back down the back straight, continued to see the field running on the turn outside, was pushed out to the six path for the drive and could not reach
contention to the wire.

Footnotes
OUR FLASH DRIVE stalked from outside rivals off the pace, began to advance willingly three then four wide on the turn, engaged just off the flank of the
leader in upper stretch, dueled with that one taking a narrow lead at the furlong marker, edged away under continued encouragement to be clear coming
past the sixteenth and held well. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) settled just off and outside a trio pursuing the loose-on-the-lead pacesetter, went four then five
wide on the turn, kept on in the lane advancing to second, was no match for the winner and held the place. MILLIE GIRL was lightly bumped at the break,
raced toward the rear inside, saved ground early on the turn, was guided out three wide coming to the three-eighths while passing a rival, moved out a bit in
upper stretch, angled out further nearing late stretch and finished up strongly but too late and missed second. FOREST DRIFT broke sharply and was
quickly clear, shifted in to dictate terms, was engaged in upper stretch, fought on before yielding grudgingly inside the final furlong. ADAAY IN ASIA (GB)
shifted in early while being allowed to settle, advanced between runners into the turn and again between foes late on that bend, ran on evenly in the stretch.
BABY NO WORRIES exchanged a light bump at the start, settled at the back inside, came out gradually through the stretch and showed good late interest.
IMAGERY bumped the outer rival lightly at the start, chased from inside, lacked the needed late kick. AMBASSADOR LUNA settled off the pace outside,
went four wide on the turn, needed more. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE exchanged a light bump at the start, raced outside foes mid-pack going five wide on the
turn, needed more. DEMODOG was bumped into a rival albeit lightly at the start, had brief forward position chasing from between runners, dropped back on
the turn and faded.

Footnotes
SOUPER HOITY TOITY exchanged a light bump at the break, moved forward to dictate the pace racing on or just off the rail and shadowed by a rival,
moved clear in upper- to mid-stretch and just held. MOIRA tracked in behind the leading pair racing inside foes on the first turn, lost some ground on the
leader early on the far turn, was guided out and ridden past the three-eighths, came into upper stretch five wide with aim, gained steadily and slowly but just
missed. PURRFECT was bumped and in a bit tight at the start, tucked in behind rivals at the rear while reserved early, saved ground through both turns,
showed good late effort inside. IL MALOCCHIO exchanged a light bump at the start, moved forward to press the eventual winner from outside two to three
wide, had no extra in the lane. KEYFLOWER (FR) moved closer advancing outside rivals early up the backstretch to gain position nearer the leaders, went
four to five wide on the far turn and ran on evenly in the stretch. SARATOGA VISION was forwardly-positioned three to four wide in pursuit of the leading
pair, was ridden along by the three-eighths, weakened. SISTER SEAGULL exchanged a light bump at the start, had forward position stalking from between
runners two to three wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
DIOSA CATRINA took the field into the first turn, continued to be left alone setting the pace at the half, bunched up the field entering the far turn, opened up
on her challengers with a quarter to go and had enough in reserve to keep her rivals at bay to the wire. INSCRUTABLE trailed this compact field on the
fence on the first turn, shifted just outside runners in the two path running down the backside, was urged to go after the loose winner three eighths from
home, loomed the only threat three wide in upper stretch, shifted inwards to the rail the final eighth but could not threaten late. TELLTALE stumbled slightly
on the break, recovered to prompt the pace into the first turn outside, tracked inside on the rail at the half mile marker, waited on the fence through the far
turn behind a tiring rival to be shuffled back to last at the top of the lane, split horses in upper stretch and closed in to capture third in the end. MISS
LINDYSUE settled on the rail near the back of the pack in the first quarter, stalked two deep between horses into the far turn, was ridden to go after the
leaders with five sixteenths remaining, could not threaten the top pair straightening out for the drive, battled briefly for the show money in upper stretch and
had to settle for a minor share in the end. SMOKEN CHLOE tracked three wide entering the first turn, continued to keep a close eye on the frontrunning
winner down the back straight outside, was roused midway on the far turn, made little movement towards the leader and stopped on the fence turning for
home.
