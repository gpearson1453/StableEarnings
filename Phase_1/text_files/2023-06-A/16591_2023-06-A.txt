Footnotes
HALLIE'S RAINBOW shared the early lead in hand from outside, was two wide through the bend, put to urging upper stretch, steadily opened up on the
others and was kept to task to the wire. MISS DUTTON was checked when her path was compromised midway on the backstretch, altered out, progressed
two wide on the turn, altered out upper stretch, altered to the inside after entering the last eighth and took over second just inside the seventy yard marker.
JAMAICAN TRAFFIC prominent early, was two then three wide taking the bend, gained second upper stretch but slowly wore down in the late going.
DELTA LADY was hustled up to vie for the lead from inside but wore down for the drive. UNEEKY altered in looking for a clear path midway on the
backstretch, was steadied briefly, moved to the rail shortly after that and soon gave way.

Footnotes
PAYNT BY LETTERS soon had the advantage, showed the way just off or along the rail, moved clear when allowed on the second bend and widened
command under urging in the lane. EIGHT MAY bumped with VALIENTE CLAYMORE at the break, advanced between rivals to take over second three
wide on the second turn, angled in some entering the stretch, was no match for PAYNT BY LETTERS but was unchallenged for the place. DRAGGING
MAIN prominent just behind PAYNT BY LETTERS, did not keep up after a half mile, was just off the inside into the lane, angled out deep stretch and caught
VALIENTE CLAYMORE for third. VALIENTE CLAYMORE was bumped then squeezed solidly between horses at the start, recovered quickly to prompt the
pace, came to the leader on the backstretch, failed to keep up two wide on the second bend and gradually yielded in the stretch. MARCHING ORDERS
drifted out some just after the break, bumped solidly with VALIENTE CLAYMORE, moved up to contention from inside on the backstretch but faded after a
half mile. DURANGO CHROME was a factor from outside for a half mile then began to yield.

Footnotes
WITCHING was kept close between horses, commenced her bid three wide on the bend, took the lead upper stretch, lugged in some inside the last furlong,
was engaged from inside, battled on even terms the final sixteenth and edged ahead in time. MINI DRESS in tight quarters between rivals early, gradually
moved toward the inside nearing the turn, steadily progressed from inside, caught up with WITCHING in the late going, fought gamely but had to settle for
second best. AMARI S. vied for the early lead from inside, moved ahead on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch, began to wear down, angled out
some when her path was taken inside the final furlong and was easily best of the others. LORI ATTACK raced in contention toward the outside, retreated
some three wide on the turn, fanned out further entering the stretch and had no late bid. WARM BEAUTY chased from along or just off the rail and failed to
menace. FILLY FROM ILLY disputed the pace outside AMARI S. on the backstretch but began to yield two wide on the bend. DIAMOND GUCCI showed
little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
BLAME TERI rated on the front end from outside, took over when let out some into the bend, moved clear, received mostly hand urging in the lane and
maintained full control. LITTLE ACCOUNT without early speed, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn, gained second leaving the bend, came off the
rail some for a clear path upper stretch, was no match for BLAME TERI in the late going but lasted for the place. BACKSTAGE BAMBI settled outside,
commenced her bid three wide on the turn, fanned out further into the lane, lacked the needed late kick but moved clear for third inside the last eighth.
DRAGONFLY KISSES prominent just off the inside, swung out three wide for the stretch and gradually yielded. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY displayed early speed
from inside, did not stay with BLAME TERI on the bend, floated out some leaving the turn and gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
LIMA ZULU shared the early lead outside LAGRUE, did not stay with that one upper stretch, dug in as he gradually angled out inside the last furlong and got
up in time. LAGRUE vied for the lead from just off or along the rail, moved ahead upper stretch, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the
last furlong, was narrowly outfinished but easily best of the rest. UNCLE O. G. pressed the early leaders from just outside, stayed just off the rail taking the
bend, raced evenly through the stretch and held onto third. MY KINDA TETON chased from outside, progressed from path three on the turn, fanned out
further into the lane and also ran evenly the rest of the way. SPAN chased from just off the inside and had no late bid. THACKER FROMM failed to menace
in a ground-saving trip. LORD SHAFTESBURY broke well but soon dropped back, stayed off the inside throughout and showed little.

FEVER NATION was soon clear of the rest, rated from inside, asked midstretch then steadily lengthened command under a drive. WILDWOOD RUBEN
raced closest to FEVER NATION from the early going, stayed just off the rail taking the bend, was no match for the leader when set down for the drive but
was unchallenged for the place. WESLAN hesitated, broke a bit awkwardly, was then steadied briefly behind traffic, just off the inside on the turn, moved to
the rail leaving the bend, took over third upper stretch then could only hold his position late. I'M YOUR VALENTINE progressed three wide on the bend then
flattened out for the drive. B G ATTACK gave way from inside soon after a quarter mile, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

ORBITAL STARR urged along from the early going, came into contention four wide on the bend, was all out in the lane and took over with ninety yards to
go. GREAT PLAINES was sent to vie for the lead inside horses, moved ahead as he saved ground through the turn, widened command under urging in the
stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards. STORMIN EL PRADO raced in the second flight from outside on the backstretch, moved clear for
third three wide on the bend, lacked a serious stretch bid but pulled away for third inside the last eighth. ARGYBARGY BUCK was prominent from inside
early, began to yield into the turn and only passed inside tired ones in the lane. EVIDENCE displayed early speed outside GREAT PLAINES, did not keep
up leaving the bend and gave way for the stretch run. I CAN'T TELL YA helped prompt the early pace from between horses but faded two wide on the turn.
INDEFENSIBLE hesitated and made a small leap from the gate, was soon well back from the others, picked up his pace some on the bend, angled out
widest upper stretch and failed to have a significant response.
