Footnotes
CRIDER CHASE away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, garnered a larger advantage late in the final turn, held the runner up at bay the entire
length of the stretch in a determined effort. GEORGIA DAWN stalked the two leaders in the three path, moved closer on the outside turning for home, could
not get to the winner after an extended stretch drive. WHATS UP SWEETS in the second flight to the inside of the runner up, moved closer in some traffic
between horses turning for home, flattened out through the lane. HARLANS WARRIOR broke out to bother SUFFRAGETTE, was straightened and moved
up to duel into and through the first turn, continued to alternate for the advantage in the run up the backstretch, first to blink midway on the final turn.
SUFFRAGETTE bothered at the start, trailed throughout and was never a threat.

Footnotes
FORTY NINE MODEL with the early pace outside, vied three wide into the turn, dueled into the stretch closest to the inside, kicked clear through the stretch
under a firm right handed crop. PUZZLING PRIORITY in the second flight up the backstretch well out in the strip, advanced four wide early turn, dueled
outside the winner into the stretch, proved no match in the run to the wire, fully extended to save the place. BIND ON EARTH back off the pace and outside,
moved closer four wide through the turn, continued to advance and was closing the gap on the runner up late. KNIGHTS SWORD with the pace along the
inside for three furlongs, fell back off the lead pair by late in the bend, went evenly through the lane. BOURN with the pace four three furlongs while between
horses, faltered when the real running began entering the stretch. SUMMERTIME BANDIT with the early leaders, steadied in tight quarters between horses
with a half mild to run, fell back and did not threaten thereafter. PRAYERS SAVED fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke slowly, raced back, angled
out five wide late in the turn, failed to make an impact through the stretch. GABY'S PROMISE remained back in failing to menace. FIRE OF GOLD with the
early pace three wide, steadied from between horses into the turn, continued to fade in the drive.

Footnotes
SIKARA SIKARA allowed the pace to go early inside, moved off the rail while in hand onto the backstretch, ranged up three wide to challenge entering the
stretch, put a head in front just past the furlong marker and drew steadily clear while kept to pressure. PAYTON'S INDIAN fractious prior to the start,
pressed four wide early in the first turn, continued to prompt the issue the middle half, vied between foes upper stretch, could not match the winner the final
furlong, clearly second best. STARSHIP NOLA last to leave, trailed early, saved ground through the second turn when moving a bit closer, shifted out a bit
for the drive, up late for the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. LOVE CREED moved up to race with pace between foes early, showed the way up the
backstretch in the two path, with the top two turning home then began to gradually weaken, caught late for the show. ZONG WAVE forwardly placed along
the inside, had little for the drive. TIME TO CLOSE broke through the gate prior to the start, broke on top, flashed early foot for a half and gave way. MARDI
GRAS GORMLEY also broke through the gate prior to the start, rank at the break and past the wire the first time, five wide through most of the first turn, fell
back, trailed.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S TOWN broke sharp, sprinted clear before a furlong, shrugged off a bit from the runner up late in the turn, clear again when straightened for
home, fully extended to hold that same rival safe again late. THE FIVE B'S away in good order, chased the winner into the turn, moved closer late in the
bend, fell back off that foe in upper stretch, roused, coming again late off the inside. MAJESTIC MANDATE broke back, lacked speed, came five wide into
the lane, finished willingly to be in time for the show. NOCOMET in mid pack along the inside, continued one paced through the turn, steered out into the
lane, improved position, not enough for the show late. TENOR lacked early foot, raced three wide through the turn, displayed some mild interest to better his
position while not a serious threat. VEGAS GUY forwardly placed along the inside, weakened the final furlong. SIXTO last away, five wide into the turn,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals late well after the issue had been decided. BYATHREAD in mid pack early, staged a steady retreat. MY LITTLE JUNIOR
also steadily backed up.

Footnotes
MACEE with the pace while four wide into the first turn, cleared toward the inside onto the backstretch, long lead, given a bit of a breather second turn,
stayed comfortably clear through the lane while kept to task. EASY ACT fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to lag the first five furlongs, began to
move far turn, came six wide out of the final bend, finished willingly to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. COME WHAT MAE with the early
leaders inside the winner and three wide, chased that rival the middle half, roused for the drive, could do little with that same foe to the wire, caught late for
the place. AUNT JANA back off the pace, raced three to four wide second turn when improving a bit, flattened out in the drive. OVERLY SWEET broke in
the air, raced back in lacking speed, made little impact. SING THE NOTES settled in mid pack along the inside, also had little for the drive. ATALANTA
ASTERIA with the early pace, raced in the second flight onto the backstretch and was finished after five furlongs. LUCKY HARBORAGE was also through
early, fell far back, jogged in, distanced.

Footnotes
ZINGING BAYOU within striking distance while four wide into the turn, continued in the four path through the bend, firm roused into the stretch, displayed
good resolve late to keep coming and prove best. LIKE THIS set or forced the pace three wide continued to vie when applying pressure into the lane, late
bid, between rivals, proved stubborn to the end. HEZA SEXY ZONG with the pace from the start, vied between horses through the turn, closest to the inside
of the lead pack through the lane, also gave ground grudgingly. HARDLY ABLE with the early pace inside, began to weaken after three furlongs.
STEAUXLIT off a step slow, lacked early foot, improved position with some mild late interest. CHARLIE'S PARADE broke back, came up empty while racing
outside. JOSIE'S PRIORITY raced back off the pace and the inside, failed to muster a rally. COCAL fell back to trail after the start, was always outrun.

Footnotes
HEZA PICKLE broke out, raced back and four wide through the first turn, continued to lag in the run up the backstretch, began to advance midway on the
second turn, steered widest for the drive, finished with good determination to be in time at the wire. JEFFROW lacked early foot, raced four wide and just in
front of the winner into the lane, also closed well to miss while between horses at the wire. BET AGAIN settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide
for the drive, lodged a late bid inside the top two, not enough for that pair in the final strides while proving best of the others. CASH HOLIDAY in the second
flight, ranged up to challenge three wide late in the final turn, vied past the furlong marker, outgunned late while also between horses at the end.
VETERANS DAY prompted the early leader, moved up to duel with that one the middle half, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker and proved
stubborn until late. ROCK ON COWBOY set or forced the pace along the inside, faltered in the drive. PESO PESADO hopped at the start, moved up to race
in mid pack for five six furlongs, faded through the lane. ALIGNED INTEREST rank early along the inside, was finished after a half, well beaten.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT OIL broke out, was straightened to be forwardly placed from the start toward the inside, continued to track the two leaders up the backstretch
just off the rail, patiently handled in some traffic second turn, moved out for the drive, challenged from the outside past the furlong marker and drew clear
under steady handling. SHOETRICK four wide when back off the pace, advanced to a forward position before a half, challenged far turn, held a narrow
advantage into the stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. MIDNIGHT CROWN moved up to take control early, dueled before a
half, disposed of that rival only to be joined by the runner up soon after, dueled inside that rival into the stretch and began to weaken, comfortably saved the
show. R T'S IRON MAN settled off the pace, continued to race one paced into the lane, evenly to the wire. ST PIERRE void of speed for a half, improved
through the second turn, no real threat in the drive. WILD FIST away in good order, set or forced the pace for five furlongs and began to give way far turn.
SIMPLY WOW bothered to break back, was never involved. LAMONT off a step slow, was used four wide to advance into a position in mid pack, faded
through the lane. SEXY IN THE GRASS stopped after a half, finished well back.
