Footnotes
KENDAMA prompted the pace outside STRONG HEADED, engaged that one leaving the far turn, was overtaken on his outside by CANNON'S ROAR in
mid stretch then battled back. CANNON'S ROAR , patiently rated along the inner rail on both turns, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, sprinted
clear in mid stretch then hung. JACKIE A , unhurried to the stretch, was behind several horses in mid stretch, swung to the four path near the sixteenth pole
and rallied outside the top pair. SUPER E , outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn, was fanned four deep turning for home and flattened
out. STRONG HEADED set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. SEMPER FI , along the inner rail both
turns, trailed.

Footnotes
HOP AND SCOTCH secured the inside early on and stalked a contested pace, moved through along the rail to take over mid turn, spurted clear in upper
stretch, kept on under solid handling past the furlong grounds and held firm. ESPRESSO LUNGO , used four wide outside rivals to reach contention into the
turn, dropped in a bit and took closer order past the three eighths, awaited room near the three sixteenths, worked through a seam between runners in mid
stretch and finished gamely. GRAND MANNER stalked four wide early on, took closer order under some coaxing mid turn, dropped in to the two path
approaching the stretch, gave hard chase with aim past the eighth pole, kept on with effort but was out finished by the top pair. ICE COLD FROSTY
prompted three wide outside the leader, was floated out a bit mid turn, drifted to the five path entering the lane, corrected to chase, brushed with a rival
leaving the three sixteenths and faded. THRUSTER broke slowly, raced off the pace while between runners nearing the turn, angled in and came up empty.
JOHNSELECTRICRIDE , off the pace three wide, swung well wide for the drive but failed to respond. MERCURY TEN , bumped at the break, rated off the
pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the far turn, shifted out for the stretch run but lacked a rally. HIS ROYAL G , bumped at the start, advanced
inside rivals leaving the chute to take over, set a pressured pace two wide, drifted out mid turn affording the winner a clear rail run, wandered outward near
the three sixteenths brushing a foe and weakened.

approaching the sixteenth pole and drew off. ICE CUBE BABY , steadied lacking room along the inner rail leaving the turn, eased out turning for home and
rallied between horses. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN , checked when bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, was kept four wide on the turn, floated
to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. MO CO GOLD prompted the pace outside AND WHISTLE around the turn, gained the lead and sprinted
clear in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. MYSISTERNANCY bumped with BLACK DIAMOND RAIN at the break, raced in the three path on the
turn and was no factor. AND WHISTLE , bumped by STORM RATE after bobbling at the break, saved ground on the turn while setting the pace and gave
way in upper stretch. STORM RATE bumped AND WHISTLE when coming out at the break, chased the pace while along the inner rail and gave way
turning for home.

Footnotes
SHE IS WISKY settled well back early on while off the inside, came under pressure three wide leaving the far turn, dropped in towards the rail advancing
past the three sixteenths, came back out and bumped with AMPLIO ESQUEMA when rallying between rivals leaving mid stretch, altered back in soon after,
surged under solid left handed asks and got up to the inside of GALS GAL in the final yards. GALS GAL , under a snug hold while allowing leaders to get
involved in a pace scrum, saved ground and was patiently handled stalking into the far turn, moved up to the inside of a foe past the five sixteenths, eased
out into the lane, closed in under pressure and took over in mid stretch, spurted clear, continued with good effort but just failed to fend off the winner's
charge. AMPLIO ESQUEMA , three deep early, settled off the pace, picked things up four wide into the stretch, was bumped by the winner when advancing
between foes past the eighth pole, regrouped and continued on with a steady run. NAVAL EMPIRE rated off the pace and towards the inside, eased out
leaving the far turn, moved up three wide into the stretch, altered out for the final furlong and finished well. MAP EM UP broke a step slow, was used wide to
contention, disputed the pace outside ANGEL ART, saw that one get away a bit leaving the far turn stayed on to pursue five wide past the five sixteenths
then faded. ANGEL ART set a pressured pace inside, moved clear into the far turn, was collared in upper stretch and weakened late. EVANGELINE
ALLONS , between foes nearing the first turn, was well placed in the clear leaving the far turn, angled out and chased three wide past the five sixteenths but
came up empty. POSTNUP drafted back off the pace while saving ground, failed to kick on when nudged on leaving the far turn, dropped back and was
eased late.

Footnotes
BOSS IS A PAL had speed between foes then rated back off the leaders nearing the turn, chased a contested pace while saving ground mid turn, eased out
in upper stretch, made a grinding run under right handed asks leaving the sixteenth pole and got up between foes late. PUTIN ONLINE , in a bit tight at the
break, raced in mid pack removed from the rail, circled four to five wide into the stretch, leveled off to his best stride leaving the sixteenth marker and
nabbed second at the wire. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN took over between rivals then secured the inside to set a rated but pressured pace, kept JOHNYZ
FROM ALBANY at bay past mid stretch, shook clear under asking approaching the sixteenth pole then his rider misjudged the wire and stood up through
the final sixteenth of a mile. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY had speed four deep early, emerged leaving the far turn in a battle three wide outside
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN, forced the issue under pressure past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MARCHED had speed to the inside of a trio of
runners, drafted back nearing the turn, chased two wide into the lane, shifted out a bit wider and came back on with interest. BOURBON CURRENCY , off
the pace while saving ground, steadied off heels in upper stretch, angled out and churned on between foes. HE'S ORIENTATE chased the pace, saved
ground into the lane but came up empty in deep stretch. TAUBER broke a step slow then steadied soon after, raced three wide off the pace, swung wider
and offered a belated kick. MONSTER MASON , four wide off the early pace, angled in around the turn, stayed inside into the lane, came back out but failed
to generate a solid run. MANOLITO steadied soon after the break and was outrun.

Footnotes
PIT STOP MAN came out at the break, accelerated to the early lead, was well off the inner rail around the turn, responded to urging in the stretch and
eagerly pulled away. BRILLIANT ICE raced in the two path between horses entering the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, swung to the five path in
upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. CRYO saved ground on the turn, chased the winner and exchanged bumps with LEFT HAND THREAD three times
in mid stretch. LEFT HAND THREAD hit the outside of his starting gate stall at the break, chased the pace three wide around the turn and exchanged
bumps with CRYO in the stretch drive. FRIGHTLAND saved ground on the turn, was in hand waiting for room leaving the bend, had ample room along the
rail in the stretch and wekened. AWARD NOMINATED came out at the break, raced in the three path between horses entering the turn and failed to rlly.
MILITARY HOP , four wide on the turn, weakened and was eased late. ABUELO PAPS , outrun, swung to the six path in upper stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
ROCK ROSE took command early and set a rated pace just off the inside, handled outside pressure from LADY JEAN into the lane, battled on near even
terms with that one heading to the furlong grounds, shook clear under a drive with a sixteenth remaining, wandered outward and prevailed. AWESOME
VIEW , forwardly placed under some coaxing and off the rail, edged up between foes past the five sixteenths, was briefly stalled behind foes nearing the
eighth pole, altered out and finished strong to gain. DANCER'S MELODY , hung out four wide stalking the pace, took closer order nearing the lane, pursued
five wide in upper stretch but lacked a serious response through the final furlong. LADY JEAN prompted the pace three wide, moved up to challenge outside
the winner approaching the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then faded late. TAP N GLO lagged back off the pace, came wide for the drive, angled in but failed
to threaten. A GIRL NAMED JAC bumped with LA FAMILIA early on, steadied off heels near the five eighths, saved ground past the five sixteenths, worked
outward in the drive but failed to menace. PRAY FOR THE U S A edged up inside rivals early and gained a stalking spot, failed to go on when asked mid
turn and gave way. LA FAMILIA , bumped early, steadied off rivals near the five furlong pole, was taken wide and moved up a bit leaving the far turn, failed
to go on in upper stretch and weakened.
