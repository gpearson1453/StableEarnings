Footnotes
SECRET BLARNEY stalked the top two leaders in early stages, picked up the tempo and swung three wide into the stretch run, steadily gained ground
down the lane and caught GONE WITH THE FINN on the wire. GONE WITH THE FINN sped to the lead in opening stages and set the pace with SHIP
BOSS not far behind, held firm around the turn then opened up to a clearer lead in upper stretch, continued to dig in on top under a drive and got nipped on
the wire. SHIP BOSS applied pace pressure to GONE WITH THE FINN in early stages, edged closer two wide nearing the quarter pole, could not get to the
leader but sustained bid into upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. DISCREET INVASION was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground
around the turn and failed to rally in the lane. OSCAR WINNER WALLY was not terribly far back in the early going, ranged up a bit closer racing three to
four wide, failed to sustain bid into the lane and gave way. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE raced off the pace, was ridden two wide around the turn and failed to
move into contention.

Footnotes
LANCELOT N ELAINE dueled inside of SHUT UP MAN for the early lead, shook free entering the turn, given cue at the head of the lane, responded
willingly, opened up to clear command, took on the challenge from TAKE ME UP BRADY in deep stretch, dug in gamely and held firm. TAKE ME UP
BRADY came away in good order and raced in contention heading into the turn, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, responded, swung three to
four wide into the lane, closed the gap on the leader, raced within striking distance in final stages but lacked the needed kick to get by. SHUT UP MAN
dueled outside of LANCELOT N ELAINE in opening strides and battled to the turn, could not maintain equal terms past the three eighths pole but remained
in contention, hustled along three wide into the stretch run and secured a share. BOTTOMLESS was allowed to settle in early stages and raced off the
pace, urged to pick up the tempo late on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GINGER RULES raced near mid-range in early
stages, failed to kick on under pressure two wide around the turn and failed to threaten. APOLLO BAY raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn,
shifted three wide entering the lane and had no response.

GRAPHENE CASSOCK stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch and into the turn, edged up to challenge CONSTITUTION DAY at the quarter pole, took
over a slim lead in upper stretch, dug in two wide under firm handling, edged away from CONSTITUTION DAY in the final sixteenth and held off late gaining
PANZER PRIDE. PANZER PRIDE was allowed to settle off the early pace, made a move near the quarter pole, swung three wide into the stretch run, rallied
down the lane and closed determinedly on the winner. CONSTITUTION DAY broke out and brushed with rival at the start then was ridden up to the lead, set
the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, took on the challenge of eventual winner at the quarter pole, cut the corner and got headed in upper stretch
but fought back gamely then came up tired in final stages. BIG VANILLA was not too far back in early stages, ranged up closer around the turn, swung wide
into the lane and retreated. SPEEDBAYOU raced in range, urged along the inside around the turn then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
PENETRATOR was forwardly placed racing in tight along the rail in early stages, waited patiently for a clear path along the inside around the turn, cut the
corner entering the lane, gamely slipped through a narrow opening along the rail in upper stretch, battled for the lead with BROADWAY down the lane,
edged away near the final sixteenth and finished clear. BROADWAY sped to the lead in opening strides and set the early pace, held firm over pursuers
around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, took on the challenge of the rail running PENETRATOR in upper stretch and battled for command,
could not move on with the winner past the sixteenth pole and settled for second best. REPLETE was well spotted racing three wide just out of striking
distance, given cue midway around the turn, ranged up into close contention, could not reach the front end but ran on and cleared a share. SISAWAY NOW
raced up close in opening stages, continued to chase the leader two wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. WHEELER DEALER raced in the back,
came two wide into the lane and had no response.

SUGAR SHACK QUEEN moved up to challenge BYE LOVE GOTTA GO in opening stages, vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free without asking
mid-way around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, given cue in upper stretch, responded willingly, tapped a couple times past the furlong marker,
widened to a commanding advantage and finished ridden out. PEGGY RULES was unhurried up the backstretch, responded when called upon two wide
late on the turn, sustained response into the lane and produced a solid finish. OLIVE OYL tracked the top two leaders in early stages, swung four to five
wide into the lane, stayed on with interest and captured show on the wire. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO broke on top then quickly came under pressure from
SUGAR SHAKE QUEEN, vied up the backstretch and into the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner near the five sixteenths pole, ran on into the
lane, flattened in the final furlong and got nipped for show. CAMCORDIA raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally.
DONNA'S HOPE raced in the back, came four to five wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
BIG LUKE was off to a good start and sat well positioned three wide just off the top pair, picked up the tempo and challenged CALL ME Q for the lead near
the three eighths pole, vied with rival into the lane, drifted out under left handed pressure near mid-stretch, straightened back out, took a commanding lead
and finished going away. TALONS TIME raced four wide in range in the opening quarter, hustled up two wide racing in the second flight around the turn,
gathered momentum under a drive and produced a solid finish. CALL ME Q advanced up the inside in opening stages and took over a slim lead, set a
pressured pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge of BIG LUKE entering the turn, vied along the inside into upper stretch, fought back past the
furlong marker then failed to be a match and gave way. ANNUAL BUDGET tracked the pace in early stages, hustled up along the inside racing in the
second flight around the turn, ran on into upper stretch then gave way. JUSTASTROLLIN raced up close up the backstretch then weakened to the second
flight entering the turn, hustled along two to three wide and had no late response.

Footnotes
GO GO GO settled in opening stages then moved up closer racing between rivals late on the backstretch, continued in range midway around the turn then
swung out turning for home, came six wide into the lane, kicked in gear, accelerated down the lane and swept by in deep stretch. ACELA EXPRESS raced
in range and tracked the pace along the inside through early stages, waited patiently for a clear path along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering
the lane, got through along the inside and raced in tight quarters, shook off outside rival and battled on with LORI'S EYES, edged by rival in late stages then
got denied when the winner kicked by late. LORI'S EYES held a slim lead in opening stages then quickly came under pressure from WUMPMUG, dueled for
command racing two wide around the turn, took on the added challenge of rail running ACELA EXPRESS at the head of the lane, battled on into the the
final sixteenth then came up empty in final stages. DIAMOND OF EKATI was well placed sitting three wide just off the embattled duo, given cue three wide
near the quarter pole, swung four wide into the lane, ran on with interest but needed more for late impact. EUROWENDI lacked speed and trailed in the
back, came four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. CAT TALE SKY raced off the early pace, was ridden along tow to three wide around the turn ad
failed to move on. WUMPMUG applied pace pressure to the leader in early stages, dueled for command around the turn, took on the challenge of rail
running ACELA EXPRESS at the head of the lane, fought back to the furlong marker then came up empty.
