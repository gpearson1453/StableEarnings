Footnotes
ATHENAIS broke with the leaders, allowed the two leaders to go while under firm restraint toward the inside, continued to rate into the far turn, covered up
early in that bend, crept closer along the rail soon after, was not making progress on the winner nearing midstretch when switched out, late bid outside, fully
extended to prove best. SURREY showed the way early along the inside, dueled the middle half while headed late backstretch, regained the advantage and
disposed of the other speed turning into the straight, clear a furlong out, responded when confronted by the winner late and proved stubborn to the end. LA
VILLANA settled in mid pack along the inside, shuffled back while saving ground far turn, continued along the inside, rallied up the rail to garner the show,
no real threat to the top two. IM SINGLED UP pressed early off the inside, dueled the middle part, led, no match for the top pair in the stretch, caught late for
the show. SHE'S WAYNE'S went one paced while racing off the inside, lacked a closing kick. CAPELLA RED bothered to be last away, continued to trail for
five furlongs, began to better her position late in the final turn, four wide into the lane, continued to improve without posing a serious threat. DIVERGENCE
settled off the pace toward the inside, bettered herself the middle half then flattened out through the lane while remaining inside. LIGHTENING MO in the
second flight early, was finished after a half. ARTIE'S DEAL broke back, moved out to be five wide into the first turn, was never involved in remaining back.

Footnotes
J Z'S FIRST took back after breaking with the leaders, tracked a soft pace inside, continued to save ground second turn, cut the corner to move closer
turning for home, rail bid past the furlong marker, late duel, proved narrowly best under firm handling. LAKE RUNNER prompted the pace from the outside
while three wide, continued to lurk outside in the run up the backstretch, challenged on the outside midway on the final turn, put a head in front nearing the
furlong grounds, dueled late outside the winner, held on gamely to miss. HERE COMES LOVIE in the second flight early toward the inside, moved out for
the drive, slowly gaining late while widest of the lead flight at the wire. SHE'S MY PRIORITY away in good order, pressed the issue between horses, dueled
into the lane, weakened the final furlong. LAURIEANN narrowly set a soft pace while toward the inside, gave way entering the stretch after allowing the
winner the rail. COLD HEARTED WENCH in the second flight while four wide, continued outside up the backstretch, four wide once again through the
second bend, came up empty for the stretch run. LACIS JEWEL last away, trailed throughout in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
PLAY MASTER broke alertly, set or forced the pace up the backstretch three wide, continued to vie in the three path while between horses turn, extended
duel through the lane inside the runner up, proved narrowly best in determined fashion. ONE MORE SLEEP never far back well out in the strip, ranged up
closer to press four wide through the turn, hooked up with the winner outside that one for a duel the length of the stretch, outkicked late, clearly second best.
CALL ME FIREY broke in to be last away, trailed behind the lead flight inside, shifted out for the drive, gained the nod for the show late, not a threat to the
top pair. CHILI RED with the pace for a half along the inside, in a bit tight, shuffled back along the rail late in the turn, went evenly through the lane to miss
the show. ASTERN BANKER forwardly placed while widest, five wide through the turn when pressing the issue, weakened through the lane. ADMIRAL
AFLEET away well, vied for five furlongs while between foes, backed up through the lane. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ONE MORE SLEEP
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR AN ALLEGED WHIP STRIKE EXITING THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
WOOD RIVER settled off the pace and the inside, unhurried into the far turn three wide, covered up in some traffic with a quarter to run, came four wide and
clear into the lane, set down, late bid outside the leader, proved narrowly best. LITTLE ROCKY in the second flight inside, inched closer through the second
turn, rail bid nearing the furlong grounds, took over, shook clear, came out, responded when the winner came alongside in the waning strides, missed. MY
LIL DUDE broke in, was straightened to track in the second flight off the inside, mild challenge a furlong out, lacked a closing punch to finish up best of the
rest. RUN ON ACES four wide in the first turn when with the main body, continued outside, four wide into the second bend, floated out five wide by the
winner into the stretch, finished up evenly while improving position a bit. MO CREDO raced in the second flight toward the inside early, remained in the
second flight while between horses and outside the runner up into the far turn, lacked a serious closing response. CAJUN CARLOS narrowly set the pace
toward the inside, in the two path while showing the say into the lane, allowed the runner the inside when straightened for home then began to weaken
when headed by that rival. MY PAL SWEET broke in to tighten up PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN, raced four wide when moving to press the issue into the first
turn, continued to force the issue up front in the run up the backstretch, faltered in the drive. WHEELS TURNING void of speed, fanned six wide into the
lane, remained back in failing to menace. UNITEDAPPEAL broke back, lacked speed, angled five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally.
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN bobbled then took up when in tight, remained back and was never a threat. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN AGAINST MY LIL DUDE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED.

CARLOS' BLAST away in good order, stalked the leader from the second flight in the run up the backstretch, continued to pursue that rival through the turn,
engaged that same foe from the outside past the furlong marker and wore him down under firm handling. MR. SNOWFLAKE broke on top, soon sprinted
clear, in hand through the turn when rating, responded when challenged past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the wire, well clear of the others.
SABERMAN stumbled at the start, raced back and inside for a half, two path into the lane, rallied between horses to be up for the show, no threat to the top
pair. ST JOE closest to the runner up in the run up the backstretch, evenly through the turn and into the lane, lacked a closing punch,nipped at the wire for
the show. SASSI ASPEN shuffled back break, trailed in lacking speed, saved ground through the turn, improved slightly while never dangerous. IDE LIKE
HAWAII outrun while racing outside. AMAZING AMERICAN in the second flight early, backed up down the lane.

GOTTATAKEHIMTO broke back, unhurried out of the chute and up the backstretch, closer from between horses turn, dropped inside, rail bid into the lane,
kicked clear, ridden out. ITELLYOUTHEFACTS dueled up front closest to but not on the rail, pulled away a bit from the other speed early in the turn, allowed
the winner the inside entering the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms with that one then proved no match the final furlong, held sway for the place. MR
ELVIN within striking distance off the inside, four wide into the lane, slowly gaining on the runner up late. JOEY'S LIGHTENING settled off the pace, saved
ground turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a serious closing punch. BAQUERO'S BIND broke outward, moved up to duel in the three path outside
the runner up, began to give way in the turn. CIGAR VAN last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
INDIMAAJ came out early to tighten up outer rivals, moved out further to race closest to the leader in the three path, continued to stalk that rival into the far
turn, was still chasing when stalling upper stretch, late push to be up in time. STEPHEN'S ANSWER broke well from the outside, moved up to take control
early in the first turn in the three path, angled in a bit onto the backstretch, continued to set the pace, garnered a larger advantage into and through upper
stretch, faltered late to be run down by the winner, saved the place. SMOKY TOPAZ broke sharp, fell back off the pace while four wide into the first turn,
second flight middle half, asked three wide into the lane, getting to the runner up late outside. BAYOU JAM lacked speed while racing outside, four wide
turning for home, improved position with some mild interest down the lane. SERMONONTHEMOUNT went one paced while racing just off the inside.
ARCTIC ROSE floated out early when racing toward the front, second flight for five furlongs and began to give way. RUN ROCKET in tight, steadied early,
saved ground to no avail. PAYDAY TOO off slow then steadied to trail early, continued to lag, came five wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. TIME
TO MOVE five wide into the first turn, raced outside and tired after a half.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PALACE away in good order, fell back a bit soon after, closer four wide through the turn, vied between foes past the furlong marker, proved best
under firm handling. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN broke alertly, with the leaders backstretch, continued to contest the issue while between horses turn,
closest to the inside of the leaders past the midstretch point, outkicked by the winner late, clear for the place. ALTERANA last to leave, joined the first flight
into the turn widest, five path through the bend, remained with striking distance past the furlong marker, no late punch to finish up best of the rest. DOUBLE
BARREL MAN fell back to trail after the break, could still see them all through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals with some mild late interest. EASY
RUNNER with the early pace along the inside, weakened through the lane. NOSY BANKER vied early in the two path, gave way from between foes turning
for home.

Footnotes
ALL AMERICAN PAT broke running, cleared toward the inside before a quarter, set all the pace, drew off through the lane under steady handling. MINT
JULIUS lacked early foot off the inside three wide into the turn, angled out to be six wide exiting, late run down the middle of the strip to finish up willingly.
GRACE'S SOLDIER broke back, moved up in traffic backstretch, went evenly through the lane, caught late for the place. SUM CHARM broke out to soundly
bump with SEEMYMVALENTIVE, was straightened to be forwardly placed while racing three wide, remained within striking distance turn, lacked a closing
kick. SWEETHEART VISION turned in an even effort while racing in the two path. CHARMING KAT in mid pack off rail, three wide into the lane, not
dangerous to the wire. SHEEZA PRIORITY pinched then checked up at the break to fall far back, continued to trail by a large margin turn, showed some
belated interest to improve position the final furlong. SEEMYVALENTINE soundly bumped at the break, four to five wide turn, went evenly through the
stretch. SWAMP ROCK chased the winner early, gave way turning for home. DREAMED I AM FAST was never factor.
