Footnotes
AGED TRUTH cleared early, under pressure down the backstretch and through the turn, cleared straightening in the lane when urged right-handed, was
encouraged left-handed just inside the eighth pole then quickly extended the advantage while being ridden out. ICE TIME saved ground throughout when
never far back, cut the corner into the lane when moving closest to the winner, could not gain on the top one but stayed on well to be clearly second best.
ROYAL COURT chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path, weakened inside the eighth pole while
saving the show spot. ILLEGAL raced in the four path through the turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was
a factor. PURSUIT OF POWER pulled through the first turn and ran up on rivals, steadied and taken to the back, trailed through the far turn when in the two
path, angled four wide into the lane, was under a drive while in the five or six path, bothered by another near the sixteenth pole and never menaced.
MAGNIFICUS pressed the pace two wide and in the three path into the far turn, continued under urging into the lane and was empty.

DEVILS GOTTA GO raced in the three path through the turn when unhurried, was asked for more in late turn, came into the lane from the three path,
engaged two rivals after straightening, continued in the three or four path through the lane and cleared. LOONY chased the pace from the three path
through the turn, bid two wide and still in the three path into the lane, was with the winner outside the eighth pole, put in tight and steadied near the eighth
pole when pacesetter drifted out then continued on with good energy to be second best. WHOSFORJUSTICE set the pace while in the two path, came into
the lane with a clear lead while still near the inside, drifted out near the eighth pole then yielded to the top two. GOLDEN RAPPER saved ground into the
lane and lacked a closing bid. BUCKLE UP was in the two path through the turn when near the back, angled into the five path after straightening in the lane
and never was a factor. TAP TAP COMIN THRU never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the lane. RUNNING SMART was bumped
then steadied at the start, raced in the three path through the turn when well back and tired. PAIGE PERFECT was outrun while saving ground.

BRITTLE AND YOO led inside, was headed late and prevailed under steady urging. FIRESIDE KITTEN stalked the pace between foes, bid on the far turn,
had a head in front late but was outfinished. TELLER TO SING saved ground, angled four wide at the quarter pole and rallied belatedly.. INDICIA trailed, bid
inside at the three-eighths pole, then had no closing bid. ELUSIVE JUSTICE pressed the pace in the three path, then gave way on the far turn. TREATY OF

Footnotes
GO FOREVER chased the pace from the two path into and through the far turn, shifted into the three path when straightening in the lane, passed the
previous leader and took aim on the new leader inside the eighth pole then determinedly ran down that one in the final stride. NINE POINTER stalked the
pace three wide through the far turn, bid into the lane from the four path, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, cleared through the final eighth then could
not hold the winner safe while well clear for the place spot. EPIC THE LEGEND chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid while moving
into the four or five path, was a threat inside the sixteenth pole bud could not sustain the effort late. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE pressed the pace two wide
into the far turn, asked for more in late turn, led into the lane then gave way once headed. JENNY'S BEIGNET was never a threat while along the inside
throughout. SCREAMIN PADDY was along the inside while well back into the far turn and never was a factor. EL TORNADO set the pace while in the two
path through the turn and under pressure throughout then suddenly was done in mid-turn. SARGENT HULKA was off to a tardy start and spotted the field
some five lengths, raced well back and was never in it. BINNINGTON BLUES raced through the first turn while four wide, chased the pace from well off the
inside down the backstretch and was done on the turn and was eventually eased to the wire late.

SANDRA D led inside at the three path, dueled inside through the stretch, exchanged bumps and prevailed under mild urging. UPPER CASE pressed the
pace in the five path, dueled outside in the stretch, exchanged bumps but was outfinished. PICK ME GURL stalked the pace in the four path before fading.
WICKED BEAUTIFUL saved ground before fading. MEET IN SECRET passed tired rivals. IN OPEN COURT broke outward, then was no factor. PARTY
NEVER ENDS pressed the pace in the four path, then gave way on the far turn. The Stewards declined to take action following an inquiry into the stretch

Footnotes
ONE BIG DUDE vied for the lead from the outset while between rivals, continued on near even terms through the far turn with one other, stayed on near
even terms with that one until near the sixteenth pole then gamely cleared. TOUR THE MOON was along the inside through the turn when well back, came
into the lane from the three path and showed good energy to gain the place spot while being brushed by a tiring rival late. PRINCE SHIM vied for the lead
three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn, continued to duel for the lead with the winner into the lane while gaining a short lead then faltered
late while drifting in and out. AMAZING JUSTICE saved ground through the far turn and into the lane and lacked a closing kick while far clear of others. J'S
NAUGHTY BOY never a factor while in the three path through the turns. BOULDER BAY was in the two path into the turn when never far back, came into
the lane from the three path and tired. C. J'S STORM vied for the lead along the inside of two others into the turn and was done approaching the quarter
pole. GOODTIMEJUSTICE outrun while in the two or three path. WISHY WASHY trailed throughout while along the inside.
