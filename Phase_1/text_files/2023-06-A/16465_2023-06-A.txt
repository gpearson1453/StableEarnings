Footnotes
WIN DIXIE RONNIE pressed Sea Pearl from the outside, took command just inside the eighth pole and edged away to be clear under strong
encouragement. SEA PEARL vied for the early lead while racing near the rail, dug in nearing the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late while
holding the place position. POLITICAL ASTRAY stalked the top pair, moved up to challenge the leader three deep near the quarter pole but couldn't match
strides with the top two in the drive but kept on willingly to the wire. VERIFIABLE broke awkwardly, raced near the back of the pack after the poor start,
moved up five wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late. KAZILLION raced off the early going, was near the inside around the far turn through the
stretch run and lacked a bid. FOR THE THRILL was coaxed along from the inside and weakened through the drive. ROMANCE IN HABANA raced mid
pack, hard ridden into the far turn, raced three to two wide in the stretch run and had no late response. MYSTICAL LADY raced in tight quarters soon after
the start while being crowded by Gilded Chammrose, trailed early on, angled in race near the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and never
menaced. GILDED CHARMROSE hustled from the outside, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
LASSO dropped back early while under pressure, moved up into the far turn, altered out just past the quarter pole, circled the field from the far outside and
finished strongly to surge clear under steady handling. EL ROJO VIVO chased the top pair from the inside early, hard ridden into the far turn, raced three
deep nearing the quarter pole, was off the inside in the stretch run and kept on gamely to the wire. CINCO HARLEY dueled near the rail early on, headed
into the upper stretch, led near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly late. A G DIAMOND was shuffled back at the start, ridden along early near the
inside, experienced traffic near the eighth pole, angled out to race three to four wide between rivals and kept on willingly to the wire. Jockey of A G Diamond
claimed objection for interference against El Rojo Vivo and stewards ruled no change. MR. LEFTY hustled early while racing mid pack, raced from the
outside in the stretch, shifted near the sixteenth pole and kept on showing good late interest. Jockey of Mr. Lefty claimed objection against El Rojo Vivo for
interference in the stretch run and stewards ruled no change. UNEQUIVOCALLY dueled outside of foe and faded in the latter stages. DESTINO raced far
back and never threatened.

Footnotes
DOO WOP DON raced off the early going, was two deep around the far turn, raced near the inside through the upper stretch, angled to race three to four
wide, surged late and got up under steady pressure. FROSTED FAITH showed good early foot while racing just to the outside of Cajun Mandate, took
command early while under confident handling, led near the sixteenth pole and was wore down late to just miss. HIGH PRESS stumbled at the break, raced
mid pack after the poor start, was five wide into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. UBIQUITOUS stalked the pace from the outside of foes
and weakened through the drive racing three to four wide. NEVER SATISFIED dropped back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled
through the drive and had no late rally. BANKER'S HOURS void of early speed, raced five deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. CAJUN
MANDATE showed good early foot from the inside to lead early on and faltered.

Footnotes
BOBBY'S CANDY was forwardly placed, moved up confidently two to three wide through the far turn to take command and drew off to be well clear under
steady handling. LOVE SPELL showed good early foot from the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. PARTNER TOURS was bumped at the
start, dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. GOOD BUMP was bumped soundly at the break, raced three to four
wide into the upper stretch, angled to race from the far outside and had not enough for the top trio. NYQUEST NIX chased the pace from the inside and
weakened in the drive. VOY Y VENGO was coaxed along from the outside of rival early on and faded. GALACTIC JACK was bumped, squeezed at the
break and never threatened.

Footnotes
VOLCANIC tracked the early leader from the outside, challenged for the lead alongside Seven Bridges Road near the three eighths pole, kicked on gamely
through the stretch run to edge clear under steady pressure racing two to three wide. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD settled off the early going, made a strong
three wide bid near the three eighths pole, raced three to four deep in the drive and was no match for the winner. LOOKINASSAH settled off the early going
while racing near the inside, angled through the far turn to race from the outside in the stretch run and moved up to improve position. KINISON was
unhurried early on, advanced towards the leaders through the far turn, raced four deep into the upper stretch and had not enough for the top trio.
I'LLSMILEAGAIN was fractious in the starting gate, tracked the pace from the inside, shifted two to three wide and weakened late. HELLO SUCKER quick
to begin, met bid near the three eighths pole, tired readily and was eased up on through the stretch run.
