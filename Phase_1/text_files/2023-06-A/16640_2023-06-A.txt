Footnotes
SHACKLE CAT broke alertly and moved clear, was challenged on the turn and held off rivals the entire stretch. R GOODTIME CHARLIE made a menacing
bid on the turn, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. POSITIVELY AWESOME close up inside, was in tight into the far turn then
continued willingly inside. POINTER angled inside on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. TRIGGER PULL lacked speed outside and was never in
contention. FEARLESS FLY underwent a shoe repaid in the paddock then was always far back. IRONBOUND broke well and raced close up briefly then
stopped abruptly.

PEYTON'S COLLEGE outrun early, saved ground, bid to the near the front top of the stretch then drew off while kept to her task NANA'S BOOPA raced off
the pace outside, angled in the stretch and closed well. FALL CAMPAIGN prompted the pace inside, swung wide into the stretch and held the show.
JOHNNYSLITTLEGIRL rated off the leaders near the inside and continued well wide. ROLIN N CONTROLIN chased in the two path then passed rivals
without menacing. I LOVE MAGEL broke awkwardly and trailed early then passed fading rivals. RISEN CHANGE lagged far behind then caught fading
rivals. BELLA MARIA lacked speed and was never in contention. AMERICA'S PRIDE forced the pace outside then stopped abruptly in the stretch. SHANIA
SEA set pressured a pace inside and gave way after half a mile.

WORST BEHAVIOUR tracked the leader outside, took over midway on the turn then pulled clear. OLYMPIC ARTIST settled inside the pacesetters, angled
wide in the stretch and closed well. PRACTICAL RACHEL broke slowly, then offered some late energy to gain the show. SHE'S AWESOME raced just off
the leaders three wide, moved closer at the quarter pole then flattened out. TWO SIDES OF LOVE sprint away in the opening quarter then stopped after half
a mile. UNDISPUTED TRUTH dropped back early and weakened steadily while drifting wide.

Footnotes
CABRA CHICA alternated for the lead outside, lost the advantage in the stretch then came again and edged clear. PEAK OF CHIC raced behind the dueling
leaders, bid to the front three wide into the stretch, led but tired in the final furlong. MISS LOYALTY lagged far behind then offered some late energy inside.
BOSS CARA lacked speed along the inside and failed to respond. BACI was urged off the pace outside, moved very wide on the turn and faded. AFLEET
DIVA vied along the inside for half a mile and gave way in the stretch.

CAUSE I SAID settled off the pace, advanced wide on the turn then edged to the front and held rival safe. OUR UPTOWN GIRL was in tight near the three
eighths pole, split rivals and closed well. SHETALKSTOMUCH trailed far behind, advanced extremely wide into the stretch and finished strongly. SCHNUER
WILL dueled four wide down the backstretch, led at the quarter pole and tired. HIDDEN CACHE chased just off the pace inside and proved empty in the
stretch. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE raced wide well behind and lacked a rally. CHRONOLOGY dueled three wide between foes for half a mile and faded.
THAT'STONY'SSISTER hustled to a narrow advantage inside then gave way in the stretch. PEARLBDANCING engaged in a contested pace in the two path
and stopped.

GOLDEN HAVEN hustled to the front inside, repelled a challenger and edged off through the stretch. QUEEN OF THE DANCE well placed behind dueling
leaders, angled out on the final turn, loomed a threat but tired. FANCY SCEPTER forced the pace inside to the stretch and weakened. CULPA BLANCO
prompted the pace three wide then faltered on the final turn. OVERTHEBLUESKY dropped far behind and was never a factor. DONS LAST CALL was in
tight entering the first turn then faded after half a mile. CAPE NEDDICK dropped far behind and was never in contention. CIVIL NOTION dropped back at
the start and trailed throughout.
