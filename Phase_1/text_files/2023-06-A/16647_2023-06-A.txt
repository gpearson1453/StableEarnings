LITTLE MIGHTY MAN encouraged from the gate, was then rated once on the main track, angled outside GINSBURNED midway on the backstretch,
commenced his bid when asked on the bend, was carried out to path five into the stretch, took over approaching the last eighth, drew clear soon after and
maintained control under steady handling. NOT AGAIN JACKIE rated in midpack, was in path three on the turn, angled out widest upper stretch, rallied
belatedly but swept past GINSBURNED for second in the waning yards. GINSBURNED broke outward, was straightened and hustled to vie for the early
lead, moved clear after the first eighth, was challenged from outside on the bend, drifted out to path four entering the lane and gradually wore down. TWO
COOKIE RULE void of speed from outside, came into the stretch behind GINSBURNED, lodged a mild bid but could only make up minor ground late.
MEMORY BANK failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

bend, began to drift out under left-handed pressure as she took the lead, her rider lost his riding crop midstretch, continued to gradually drift out but kept

out upper stretch trying to keep a clear outside NEXT TIME YOU WIN, straightened after the leader moved out further inside the last eighth, closed well,
came up short but was clearly second best. KIANA'S LOVE bumped after the start, soon moved clear of the others, angled toward the rail into the turn, was

CANDY LOOKER took the lead after the first eighth, showed the way in hand, was roused leaving the bend, steadily drew away under urging in the lane and
was allowed to coast the final seventy yards. W W VALID saved ground through the turn and edged ahead for second inside the last eighth. DART ATTACK
in contention early between rivals, advanced two wide on the bend, edged ahead for second midstretch but could not sustain her bid late. GREER
CROSSING pressed the early pace from outside, did not stay with CANDY LOOKER through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, leveled off but was
easily best of the others. ENVEY N ICE broke somewhat slowly, picked up her pace on the bend, swung to the outside for the stretch run and passed some
tired rivals. WHITE CASHEL was briefly rank at the start, two wide on the turn, moved to the rail for the drive, progressed to midstretch then flattened out.
THE SCORE IS EVEN chased from inside, began to yield on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run and continued to give way.

Footnotes
FAST JACK encouraged to the early lead, gradually angled in on the backstretch, was roused leaving the bend, put to a drive inside the last furlong and
maintained full control. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE prompted the early pace from outside, moved clear for second two wide on the turn and proved easily
second best. DIAMOND MAXIMUS reluctant to load, soon trailed once the race began, was just off the inside on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch
run and gained third in the late going. SEMINOLE BEACH was without early speed, though hustled along, widest taking the turn, gradually drifted out in the
lane, held a straight path inside the last furlong but had little to offer. STALLONE pressed the pace from inside on the backstretch but began to steadily yield
once on the bend.

Footnotes
GOLDICAT broke on top, was rated on the front end outside rivals on the backstretch, took over when allowed on the bend, angled in leaving the quarter
pole, was put to a drive in the lane, steadily opened up on the rest and was kept to task to the final strides. BOYCE'S BANDITA vied for the early lead
between rivals, angled to the rail on the turn, did not stay with GOLDICAT approaching the quarter pole, swung outside the latter into the stretch and began
to wear down inside the final furlong. COMMISSIONER GULCH hustled up while toward the outside on the backstretch, progressed three wide on the bend,
fanned outside BOYCE'S BANDITA for the drive, lacked the needed late kick as she closed the gap on the BOYCE'S BANDITA in the waning yards but was
clearly best of the others. LUTION chased from outside on the backstretch, angled in to be just off the rail on the turn, fanned out to path five entering the
lane, angled out widest upper stretch and steadily improved position without threatening. WICKED SKY prominent from inside, came off the rail some for a
clear path on the bend, angled out five wide upper stretch and had no late bid. RAIN ATTACK quickly recovered from stumbling inward at the start, disputed
the pace from inside, began to yield on the turn, steadily faded in the lane and weaved under right-handed pressure deep stretch. HARPER BRIANA chased
from outside, bolted through the bend and had little to offer for the stretch run. TINA'S TAPIZAR was an early contender between foes but gave way two
wide on the turn. MISS MIA though prepared to race when the gate opened, MISS MIA refused to start. The rider of BOYCE'S BANDITA lodged an
objection alleging interference from GOLDICAT leaving the quarter pole. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul. There was a
stewards' inquiry into MISS MIA'S start. After that review, it was determined MISS MIA was prepared to race but refused to leave the gate and she was
declared a non-starter. Win, place, show, exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers were refunded and a consolation daily double was paid.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT shared the early lead between rivals, angled in on the bend, moved clear, gradually drifted out as she lengthened command upper stretch,
continued to drift inside the last furlong, held a straight path the final sixteenth and kept WILDWOOD BYE at bay. WILDWOOD BYE in contention from
outside on the backstretch, advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out further into the lane, took over second, drifted out under right-handed pressure with
a sixteenth of a mile to go, was corrected in the waning yard but too late. ORNERY ANGEL was an early factor from inside, two wide taking the bend,
angled out some upper stretch, altered in for racing room midstretch and moved clear for third inside the final eighth. G CITY WARRIOR pressed the pace
from just off the inside, on the backstretch, failed to keep up along the rail on the turn and continued to gradually yield for the drive. LIL BIT TIPSEY
displayed early speed from outside, did not stay with TRIPLE SCOUT on the turn and gave way between horses in the lane. WILDCAT BOBBIE was a
factor between rivals on the backstretch but faded three wide on the bend. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE threw her head and bucked at the start and was never
a factor.

Footnotes
CHEEKERS reluctant to load, quickly took a clear lead once the race began, showed the way in hand just off or along the rail, was let out on the second
bend, drifted out to path four entering the stretch, under steady urging from between rivals and held sway. KING DOODLE vied for the lead from between
horses once on the backstretch, retreated some approaching the end of a half mile, lost ground staying outside the CHEEKERS into the lane, lacked the
needed late kick but edged ahead for second in the waning yards. STOLICH hesitated at the break, advanced from outside on the backstretch, picked up
his pace after four furlongs, came into contention along the rail on the second turn, loomed a threat midstretch, leveled off instead but was clearly best of the
others. GEORGE'S VISION chased from inside, angled out widest upper stretch, closed the gap some but also leveled off inside the final furlong.
OKLAHOMA HEAT steadily retreated from just off the inside, swung out to path five entering the lane, lugged in midstretch and coasted the rest of the way.
ARROW STRIKE raced in contention from outside for five furlongs, steadily gave way and also was allowed to coast in the late going.
