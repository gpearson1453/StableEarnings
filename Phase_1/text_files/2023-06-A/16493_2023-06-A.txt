SLEW'S DA BOSS away well and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide
through the final turn, collared the pacesetters entering the lane, and inched clear late. BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DRILLER in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken entering
the lane, and battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to hold the place. DRILLER broke sharply and pressed the pace from the outside of BABY
GRAND in the run down the backstretch, continued to battle two wide through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and just missed the place
while racing one out from the rail in the drive. JUVEE TOO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, eased off the rail and gained a striking position in the
run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while lacking racing room late. YOU DON'T OWN ME
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and lacked the needed closing
response when called upon.

Footnotes
SELF SERVING dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, held a clear lead into the lane,
and drew clear late. BORROWED EQUITY tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. UNION MAN bobbled in the opening strides, but recovered
quickly and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but
was unable to make a late impact. SHOWMAN broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep
tabs on his pace rival entering the final turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong. BARBERRY BANDIT away alertly and tracked the leaders two out
from the rail from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, clipped heels midway through the turn, and fell.
Barberry Bandit walked off under his own power following the race. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the final turn following the race.
After review there was no change made to the original order of finish.

Footnotes
AROLLERCOASTERRIDE away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip
in the run down the backside, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane and quickly drew clear as much the
best. STORMY BLUE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the stretch the first time,
turned back a challenge from BOITANO in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was no match when tackled by AROLLERCOASTERRIDE
leaving the turn, and while no match for that rival late, continued on gamely three wide in the lane to prove clearly second best. BOITANO away well and
stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, moved up through the second turn to force the issue from the outside
of STORMY BLUE in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep pace with the top pair late while finishing from along the inside
in the drive to garner a share. EDDIE WHO was off a step slow, but raced into a tracking position from along the rail entering the stretch the first time,
maintained his position into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was unable to mount a late bid when called upon. PRINCE
CAIRO unhurried early while dropping back to trail, saved ground through the final turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, but needed more when called
upon.

AQUITANIA ARRIVAL away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering he first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of EARS TO US in
the run down the backstretch, sprinted to a clear advantage through the final turn, and continued to widen his advantage late while well in hand. ROOKIE
YEAR broke sharply and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the
stretch drive to prove clearly second best. ITSMYDAY settled well off the early pace while saving ground along the inside, commenced his bid one out from
the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. EARS TO US away well and chased the pacesetter
into the first turn while drifting five wide, pressed the leaders two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with the pacesetter
entering the final turn, and was outfinished in the drive. JOCK TALK unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch while racing two out from the
rail, was always well back and failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final
turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to prevail. KNOPFLER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch,
shifted off the rail midway down the backside, rallied smartly three out from the rail entering the final turn, and battled through the lane from the outside of
FOOT SOLDIER to just miss. RACING RIVER chased the leaders four wide entering the first turn, tracked the pacesetter three out from the rail in the run
down the backside, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, but failed to last while finishing at the rail in deep
stretch. CALAMAZEUS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched a strong three wide bid entering the final turn, and finished with late interest
one out from the rail in the drive in a solid effort. I'M A CHI TOO tracked the early pace while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. IT'S IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken on the final turn, and weakened in the drive. SIR BARCLAY away well and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, began to drop back midway down the backside, and had nothing to offer late.

Footnotes
SETTEBELLO dueled for the lead from the outside of MILO'S COMMAND entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival
through the final turn and into the stretch, and got the better of his pace rivals late while inching clear. MILO'S COMMAND away alertly and vied for the lead
from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with
his pace rival in deep stretch, and just managed to hold the place. SOMTHING ELUSIVE stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering
the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and continued four wide in the drive to just miss the place. WELLSLEY broke sharply
and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail
in the drive. DEANARROW settled well off the early pace while racing a bit rank in the early going, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. BECKAS BOY unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch , saved ground at the rail from the
back of the pack entering the final turn, but was only able to pass tired rivals late. BE SPARKY tracked the early pace while racing two out from the rail
entering the backstretch, began to weaken entering the final turn, and had nothing left for the drive. THREE DAY BENDER was unprepared at the start
while tossing his head prior to the break, began to advance four wide upon entering the backstretch, but weakened over the final furlong.
