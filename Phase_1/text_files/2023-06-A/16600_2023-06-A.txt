good try. LAND OF NOD bumped hind start, shied 1/8. HERRADURA off slow, broke in, green, lugged out. DASHAS FAVORITE lost irons start, saved.
ONE EXECUTIVE MRL off slow/took up start. JOCKEYS OBJECTION, Jockey Armando Cervantes on #2 Land of Nod (4th) claimed an inquiry against #4
Connies Dynasty (1st H.Lopez). Connies Dynasty did drift in and cross the path of Land of Nod but in the opinion of the Stewards, the outcome of the race
was not compromised and therefore no change was justified.
