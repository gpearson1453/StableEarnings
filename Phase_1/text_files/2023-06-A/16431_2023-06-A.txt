Footnotes
SOFT TALK was unprepared at the start, raced back early on, rallied along the far turn, was in the five path into the lane, took over command down the lane
and drew off late under a brisk drive. SWEET SHILD O MINE raced three wide along the first turn and stalked the early pace, led the field into the lane from
the four path but was no match for the winner late in the stretch run. SPARKLING JEWEL chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and
moved up late in the stretch drive. NEAR PERFECT was through after a half. LARRY'S ANGEL set the pace for three quarters then folded up.
ANCHORWOMAN pressed for a half from the inside then stopped.

Footnotes
SQUID pressed the pace early two wide, was in the three path into the lane, took command and drew away late in the stretch under a steady drive. TIVIS
chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. AMADEVIL set the pace early, was on the inside into the
lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. SALLY STRONG raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch. LIONISTIC
tracked the pace early from the inside, was in the four path into the lane and faded late. TWERK raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and
improved position. SPICE ICE was never a threat. WINE ME UP BABY was through early. VITA'S HOPE bobbled at the start and was done early. A SMILE
A DAY was never a factor.
