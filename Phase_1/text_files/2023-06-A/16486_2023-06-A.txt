backstretch, took a slight lead while racing in the two path around the far turn, dueled down the lane and was outfinished late. BALIMOS raced in the two
path early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and kept on in the stretch. MAIDEN ROCK tracked

JOHNNY UP raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole, quickly took command and drew off to the wire, much the best. DIRECT ACTION raced off the pace on the inside through the early going,
navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in the lane but was no match for the winner. K C'S FIRST B M W led the field on the inside up
the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path coming around the bend, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the finish.
SCARYATCANTERBURY pressed the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path and faded in the stretch. HALO'S
LADDIE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the bend and was empty in the lane.
HOLDENTIGHT raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S MAGIC led the field rom the two path around the first turn, opened up while racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two
path coming around the far bend and held that margin while drifting out in the stretch. MYSTIFIER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. TRI SPOT
bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, saved ground at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the
second bend from the two path and gained ground late. NORTH ARM BAY bumped with the horses to either side at the break, saved ground early, settled
in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and finished evenly. BURNING LEAVES
bumped with the horse to his inside at the start of the race, raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated
the second turn from the three path and never threatened. BUBBA BOB bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the
leader on the inside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. COLOR ME LEGENDARY
raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the two path and faded
from there. GABRIEL'S LEGEND trailed the field from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the second bend
and made no bid.
