Footnotes
CAJUN FANTASY was quick to begin to set the early pace under mild coaxing, raced in hand under his own pace into the far turn through the stretch and
drew off to be well clear as a handily winner. MACASSA chased the three deep from the outside of rivals, raced three to four wide around the far turn and
was no match for the winner in the drive. HUSTLE QUEEN was coaxed along early racing between rivals into the far turn racing two deep and kept on to the
wire racing three wide. MARTINI'S AMICA was off a step slow, rushed from the inside of foes and raced evenly with no closing run racing three deep.
SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY chased the early pace, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. CAIRO WINNER chased the
early going racing four deep, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened through the drive. SONG AND TAP was void of early speed,
raced along the inside around the far turn and never threatened. OUR LA DOLCE VITA was hustled throughout, raced near the inside past the quarter pole
and faded.

Footnotes
FLORINDIA dueled for the early lead along the inside, kicked clear through the upper stretch and held a clear margin under a strong hand ride. IT'S ONLY
WORDS broke awkwardly, raced near the back early on, was along the inside past the three eighths pole, shifted out four around the far turn, raced five to
six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get up for the place position racing from the outside. JUST TAKE NOTES coaxed along early from the
inside, raced near the rail in the stretch and moved up to improve position. MIST chased the early pace from the outside of foes, raced three to four wide
around the far turn, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ROSCOE VILLAGE dueled for the early lead
outside of Florindia and faded in the drive. LAS COLINAS dropped back early, raced four wide through the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

ANGELIC STORM settled off the early going, moved up into the far turn, made a strong three wide bid to split rivals near the quarter pole and finished well
to edge clear under strong handlng. TROTTING GEAR vied for the early lead from the inside of foes while racing just off the inside, challenged through the
far turn and dug in to hold the place position. MY BATON ROUGE tracked the early leader three deep, raced between three to four deep through the upper
stretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CARAVANA was bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the inside and raced evenly with no closing run.
SHOW ME LOVE was forwardly placed early on, drifted through the upper stretch and faded. I LOVE IRELAND was void of early speed, raced wide
throughout and lacked a bid. SPRINT BREAKER was bumped at the start, raced off the early going, was three to four wide through the stretch run and
never threatened. SHE'S RED HOT race mid pack early, was five to six wide around the far turn and never threatened.

the outside of rivals and just got up under strong handling. EXTRA INDY rated along early under a hold, made a strong three wide near the quarter pole to
challenge for the lead, led deep stretch and just missed in a game effort racing two wide. X Y LADY race six to seven wide into the first turn, rushed from the
outside to contend for the early lead, dug in late and kept on gamely to the wire. SPIRIT OF POWER was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack after
the slow start, circled seven wide into the upper stretch and closed in belatedly. ANDIE ONE raced mid pack early on, moved up three to four wide between
rivals in the stretch and improved position. CONFER dropped back early on, raced three to two wide in the drive and lacked a rally.

under strong handling. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL was hustled along early, raced from the outside in the drive and closed in well late. SPEIGHTFUL SIS pressed
the early pace from the outside of foe, was clear nearing the eighth pole and was outkicked late. VELOCISSIMA broke awkwardly, raced along the inside
into the upper stretch and moved up late to improve position. AVE FENIX raced off the early pace, was four to five wide in the stretch, moved up but had not
enough in the drive. RIGBY showed good early foot from the inside and gave way. BULLOCK was hustled early from the outside, raced six wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. WILDCAT STAR was hustled along, raced three wide around the far turn and faded.
