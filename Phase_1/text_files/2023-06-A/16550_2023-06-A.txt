Footnotes
DISCOVERY PEAK was well rated along the inside throughout the first half, then stared bid around the far bend, rallied in the early stretch to close fastest
down the lane and was up at the wire. PERFECT TOM stalked the pace while two wide, then gained command at then top of the far turn, was in a long drive
down the home stretch but was caught at the end and was second best. MAN IN THE MIDDLE chased the pace from the inside, was urging strongly on the
far turn to menace in the stretch and held the show prize in the end. SEEKING CHROME set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive heading
into the far turn, was headed by an outside rival, vied for the lead heading into the early stretch then gave way in the end. DIXIE MOONSHINE settled in the
two path then made a mild bid on the far turn and into the stretch but needed more in the end. BAJA BOOGIE raced two to three wide down the backstretch,
then bid on the far turn and did not rally.

Footnotes
CINNAMON FACE stalked the leader from the rail through the first turn and down the backside, loomed up turning for home, took command while angling
out around the tiring front-runner, drifted further out two paths bumping PRINESS VOODOO and crowding SHEZA SHINING STAR, was straightened away
and drew clear to the wire. PRINCESS VOODOO reserved off the pace while racing along the fence to the far turn, followed the winner along the rail to
upper stretch, angled out to the five path , was making up ground when CINNAMON FACE came out several lanes to bump her and cause her to crowd
rivals to her outside, was taken up and dropped inside the winner to finish up well as second best. OIL N CANDY unhurried for the first three quarters, was
set down for the drive leaving the quarter pole, found a seem in the three path when the winner drifted out and closed well to be coming late. GLORY O
sped off to a clear lead in the first turn, set rapid fractions for the first three-quarters and faltered in upper stretch. MYLITTLEWISKEYGIRL settled in hand to
race near the rear of the field for the first half mile, circled five wide with a bold move in the far turn and finished evenly while herded in the lane. SHEZA
SHINING STAR tracked the pace for the first half, was set to an early drive between horses entering the far turn, rallied from four wide in upper stretch and
was squeezed between horses in upper stretch when the winner came out, was taken in hand and finished up evenly to the wire. CHARMING LEAH went
evenly and never menaced. TIZ A KNOCKOUT trailed most of the way as a non-factor. DICE ARM sped up to prompt the pace into the first turn, continued
to be well placed three wide down the backside, came up empty into the turn and dropped back. THE RIDERS OF SHEZA SHINING STAR AND
PRINCESS VOODOO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED HER SIXTH.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE PRINCE settled in hand to be well rated off the dueling pacesetters, saved ground the entire trip along the rail, cut the corner and closed
willingly along the fence to draw clear. GRAMI'S BOY stalked the pace from five wide down the backside, rallied up from four wide to take the lead in upper
stretch, failed to change leads down the lane and drifted out to the fifteen path while still keeping momentum and held the place. FORT HOOD sped to battle
for the lead from three wide, continued to duel on the pace from between horses to the head of the lane and kept on the only survivor of the front-runners.
WINGS FOR ENO chased the leaders down the backside, rallied from four wide turning for home, failed to gain on the top three and passed the tiring
pacesetters in the lane. MORO OUTLAW pressed the pace from between horses to upper stretch and weakened coming home. VILLAGE WAY sped up the
fence to duel on the lead for a half mile and gave way down the lane. BLING MOUNTAIN raced near the rear of the field and never menaced while making
up some ground in the stretch. SHANGHAI GOLD went evenly and was never a threat. SUPREME CAPO raced prominently on the far out side in the early
going and faded. GREYSTOKE trailed throughout as a non-factor.

FEE chased the pace while three wide, was in a hard drive on the the turn then surged down the lane to duel in the deep stretch and was up at the wire to
prove best. BLAME DAY chased the pace while three wide, was moving up swiftly on the turn to gain command mid stretch, then dueled with an outer rival
in late stretch and hung in the end. PERILOUS LIFE vied for the lead between rivals heading into the turn, continued to rally gamely in the early stretch then
gave way late and was best for show in the end. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER chased the pace from the inside, then menaced on the turn, and came up evenly in
the stretch. CONFLICTING TALES vied from the inside, then faded on the turn and had no final bid. THE GIRL IN RED vied for the lead while three wide,
then faded on the turn and needed more. M G BIG MARIA raced while four to five wide close behind the field and failed to rally.

MIDSUMMER SOIREE broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, opened a well measured advantage in the turn and drew off down the lane as much
best. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA stalked the pace down the backside, loomed up to challenge in the turn to threaten the winner, could not go with that one but
finished well to be second best. POETIC UNION slow early to trail the field, found her best stride turning for home and closed well in the stretch. HONEY
CREEK reserved in mid-pack, gained ground through the turn and flattened out down the lane. VEGAS BLUE prominently placed in the early going and
failed to mount a rally fading to the wire. EUROROSE went evenly never posing a threat. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN pressed the pace to be close up for a
half mile and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
VA VOOM stalked the pace while two wide, was gaining ground to take command at the top of the far turn, lead the way in the early stretch then dueled
grudgingly in the final furlong with an outer JAZZY LASSIE and was up at the wire to prove best. JAZZY LASSIE stalked the pace from the inside, was well
rated throughout to come out three wide in the early stretch, dug in gamely then dueled with VA VOOM in the final sixteenth but hung in the end. HOT
COOKIE was pinched back at the start, then settled along the inside into the far turn, rallied in the late stretch but came up empty. ACCELERATING BABE
was off slowly at the start, then raced in the three path, was moving up in the late backstretch to menace in the upper stretch but needed more in the end.
MISS CARMEN CIBO set the pace down the backstretch from the inside, then couldn't retain bid on the far turn and gave way in the early stretch.
BERING'S SPECIAL raced in the middle of the field while four wide, made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. AZUSA STREET was
sandwiched at the start, then raced behind most of the field while two wide, then gradually lost ground and was no menace. S S TURBINIA trailed behind
the field and was no factor.
