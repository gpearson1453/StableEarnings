VIOLETS SMILE pressed the pace racing close up outside early on, chased on the turn, rallied outside of CARATS FOREVER entering the stretch, wore
down that rival at the sixteenth pole and pulled away. CARATS FOREVER set the pace on the inside, briefly shook free on the turn, drifted well off the rail at
the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch run, dueled with the winner and came up second best. LILY THE KID was a bit reluctant to load, settled off the
rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly into third and held that spot. EXCLUSIVE CHAMPION stalked two wide, chased two wide on the
turn and weakened. TWYLA raced off the pace with an inside trip and had no rally. ROCKY SEAS was bumped at the start, chased on the inside, chased on
the turn and tired. WHISKEY AND RAIN was bumped at the start and outrun. DELIGHTFUL AVA chased three wide and faded.

was ridden out and in hand late. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn, bid at the
quarter pole and came up second best. COCO SHELL stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and bested the others.
BLOWN SAVE raced off the pace inside, then two wide, advanced on the far turn and finished evenly. GOLDEN TALENT cleared the field entering the
clubhouse turn, set the pace, showed the way on the far turn, dueled between rivals at the quarter pole, then gave way readily. DUBROVNIK raced three
wide early, two wide off the pace and did not factor. MAJOR CAM was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and outrun.
