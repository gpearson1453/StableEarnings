ON THE MONEY RED stalked the early speed, took over when allowed three wide on the bend, angled in as he lengthened command under urging in the
lane and maintained control while kept to task to the waning yards. HIGHLY PERFECT broke alertly, was rated from outside, moved to the inside with four

ON THE MONEY RED on the bend, was no match for the pair in the stretch but was unchallenged for third. RUN THE TABLE displayed early speed just
outside ST. LOUIE LOUIE and gave way the final quarter mile. GOVERNOR ATTACK dwelt at the break, was hustled along while staying well off the inside,
proved unresponsive to urging at the head of the lane, was eased and walked off.

LASTFORTINOFAMILY advanced in hand two wide on the backstretch to gain the lead into the second bend, widened his lead when asked shortly after
that, was under urging until inside the last sixteenth, proving much the best. CAMPAIGN SPY in contention early from inside, did not keep up two wide on
the second turn, lodged his bid into the lane, moved to the rail upper stretch and caught ROAD GAME for second. ROAD GAME gradually progressed three
wide to threaten on the second bend but slowly wore down inside the last eighth. FORT RIDGE moved up from outside to be a factor four wide on the
backstretch and second turn but gave way for the drive. W W TRAFALGAR was hustled to a clear early lead but began to yield with three furlongs to go.

VIVA VIOLENCE shared the early lead two wide while in hand, moved ahead when allowed on the bend, widened her lead under urging in the stretch and
maintained control under steady handling. NOT TO BE DENIED hustled early, moved to the inside nearing the half mile marker, swung out four wide into
the lane, drifted out midstretch, held a straight path the final eighth, closed well but came up short. MAZLAN progressed three wide to threaten with two
furlongs to go but slowly wore down for the stretch run. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER displayed early speed from inside but gradually began to yield once on
the turn. JEMEZ FALLS chased from outside, was two wide taking the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and had little to offer. HUQOOQ soon
trailed, was steadied briefly when her path was taken nearing the half mile marker, angled out, stayed well off the inside through the turn and was empty for
the drive.

TIZ APPROVED rated on the front end from off the rail, was roused leaving the bend, began to wear down some in the late going but kept D' YANK at bay
under steady handling. D' YANK raced in contention from inside, rallied along the rail in the lane, did not have enough in the waning yards but was easily
second best. LATIN CASINO was checked behind TAP'S BIG SHOT leaving the chute, soon moved up between rivals to vie for the lead outside TIZ
APPROVED, did not stay with that one on the turn and flattened out for the drive. TAP'S BIG SHOT lugged in some leaving the chute, stayed close from
outside for a half mile but gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
LIFE OF SATURDAYS soon shared the early lead while in hand from inside, moved clear when allowed on the bend, floated out some entering the lane
then gradually drifted out as she opened up on the field, continued to drift in the late going but maintained full control. SWEET JUSTICE forwardly placed
between rivals, came five wide into the stretch and edged ahead for the place inside the last eighth. BEIRUT BEAUTY gradually angled out trying to gain a
clear path leaving the chute, bumped with ABBMAR, made it to the outside before finishing a quarter mile, took over second from outside on the bend,
swung out to path four into the lane, battled to hold her position but did not have enough left late. ABBMAR was pinched between horses shortly after
leaving the chute, dropped back and moved toward the inside, progressed from outside on the turn and gradually lugged in as she rallied belatedly deep
stretch. ASHLEY ELIZABETH angled in between horses nearing the half mile pole, was three wide leaving the bend, lacked a significant stretch bid, was
steadied behind ABBMAR deep stretch and altered out. BOBBIE TOO TOO displayed early speed just outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS, found herself boxed
in on the turn, steadily yielded in the lane and also lugged in deep stretch. PECOS AUTUMN broke well but soon retreated, moved to the inside nearing the
bend, improved position some along the rail, was checked behind BOBBIE TOO TOO deep stretch and finished in hand. BAILESTON LASSIE angled in
some leaving the chute and also bumped with ABBMAR, chased from outside and was never a factor. PRINCESS MANDII steadily yielded.

GO MADI GO broke a bit inward, brushing with CARSON RESERVE, was settled, moved to the inside with a half mile to go, began her rally on the bend,
angled outside LICHITA upper stretch, took the advantage nearing the final sixteenth then drew off under hand urging. LICHITA was sent to gain the early
lead then allowed to relax, came off the inside some entering the lane, roused upper stretch, began to wear down inside the last furlong but lasted for the
place. THINK BLUE prominent just off the inside, angled out on the turn, came into the stretch from path five then could only pull away for third. DOROTA
pressed the early speed from outside, floated out some into the stretch and gave way. CARSON RESERVE crowded briefly at the break, moved to the
outside early on and showed little.

Footnotes
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY broke with the pack but was settled well back, was two wide on the bend, fanned out some entering the lane, rallied under urging and
caught CRANKSHAFT in the final strides. CRANKSHAFT shared the lead from inside, moved clear when allowed on the turn, widened command under
urging in the stretch, began to wear down the final sixteenth and was outfinished. PACHI vied for the lead from between horses, did not stay with
CRANKSHAFT on the bend and gradually drifted out through the stretch. LONESOME DREAM disputed the pace from outside on the backstretch, failed to
keep up on the turn, came widest into the lane and gradually angled out through the lane. DUST DANCER well placed between rivals early, faded from
inside on the bend.
