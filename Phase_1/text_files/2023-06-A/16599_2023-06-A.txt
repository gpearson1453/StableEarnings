IRISH EXPECTATIONS stalked the pace while two wide, was moving up on the turn to battle for the lead down the lane and was up at the wire to prove
best. PLAY RULE set the pace while two wide, was confronted at the top of the turn by an outer foe to duel gamely down the home stretch but hung in the
end. VEILAZIG stalked the pace from the inside, rallied on the turn and into the stretch to close gamely for the show prize. LUCKY PROMISE chased the
pace while two wide, was in tight in the early backstretch, steadied slightly, rebid on the turn to menace in the early stretch and was closing belatedly. MR B
QUIET raced while five wide, then dropped back close behind the field heading into the turn, rallied but was no threat in the end. MAGIC BOW was moving
up while four wide to chase the pace into the turn, made a mild bid then flattened out in the stretch. CADDO FOX was moving up swiftly while three wide
down the backstretch, then stopped on the turn and was through early.

Footnotes
ROSES ARE GRAY was well rated while tracking the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was urging throughout the far bend, dug in gamely in early
stretch then closed fastest between rivals to be up at the wire. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN pressed the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was
moving up to duel briefly heading into the far turn, gained command then lead the way down the home stretch but was caught in the end. SUMMEROSA
chased the pace while three wide, was urging on the far turn to rally in the upper stretch and closed gamely for the show prize. MARTIQUE MISS chased
the pace while two under a steady hand drive down the backstretch. settled back throughout the far bend, rebid in the early stretch and closed well in the
end. SHEZA CAT settled along the inside, then bid on the far turn, angled to the three path in the early stretch to rally but came up empty.
ONLYTHREESOCKS was unhurried early then trailed behind the field, came out five wide to bid on the far turn and was no threat. BACK IN CHARGE set
the pace into the first turn, lead the way down the backstretch, was confronted by an outer rival heading into the far turn to duel to keep the lead but gave
way in the stretch.

Footnotes
TILLIS reserved off the early pace, rallied turning for home and closed well to be going away at the wire. LANGUAGE BARRIER slow early near the back,
swept up through the turn with a strong middle move, took command in upper stretch but could not last. TEXAS TITAN settled in mid-pack down the
backside, rallied in the turn and kept on to take the show. ROCK N JUNE BUG raced near the rear of the field for the first half mile, angled out for the drive
and made a belated close in the lane. PRIME CODE pressed the pace from three wide through the turn to be prominent and weakened in the drive.
DELIRIUM prompted the pace from the fence through the turn and faded coming home. MARCH WEST rushed up to take the lead splitting horses, set the
pace to the top of the lane and tired down the stretch. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN was never a threat.

Footnotes
TEMPLAR RED stalked the pace through the first turn and down the backside, challenged the front-runner in upper stretch and dueled with that one through
the lane and inched to the lead in the final strides. STELLACZAR broke alertly to assume command from the gate, set a well measured pace throughout,
responded to the winner's challenge down the lane and was nodded at the wire in a game effort. PLENTY OF VISION tracked the leaders the entire trip,
ranged up to mount a bid in the lane but could not gain on the top pair while clearly the best of the rest. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) unhurried early to be near
the back of the field and made mild rally in the stretch. RED HOT MOON pressed the pace for three quarters of a mile and weakened coming home.
CHIKARA went evenly passing tiring horses in the stretch. FEELING HAPPY was never a threat. BIRDIE CURDY well placed to be prominently placed
early, lacked a response and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
OUR PASTOR broke sharply and was quickly clear to set the pace while shifting in, held sway under steady handling. ORNATELY pursued the leader from
outside another rival, went about three wide on the turn and was under strong urging outside the quarter pole, could make no headway but was well clear of
the rest. LEOPARD BAIT shifted in tracking from inside mid-pack, came out for the stretch run, was no match for the top pair but best of the rest. I AM UP
was very reluctant to load, encouraged forward at the start, chased the pacesetter racing in behind and just off the rail, failed to rally in the stretch and kept
on one-paced. BODI ODI switched out racing off the rail, finished with mild late interest. SWEET ATTITUDE chased from outside five then four wide on the
turn, weakened. COPELANDER swung six wide into the stretch but was never near enough to threaten. REALITY CHECK chased the pace four wide,
dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MOR LANA SPIRIT was brushed at the start, tracked from inside, took closer order heading to the half but steadied at that juncture, lacked room and had to
again tap on the brakes in behind runners past the quarter pole, found room between foes nearing the furlong grounds, took command was quickly clear
then held while being kept to the task. PHANTOM RIDE bumped with a rival at the start, stalked from outside four wide, kept on in the stretch to get up for
place over DON'TCROSSTHEDEVIL, who exchanged light contact at the start, switched outside the leader to stalk from outside that one, edged closer to
press up the backstretch taking the lead near the seven-sixteenths, was outkicked. SEND THE BOSS settled outside off the pace racing three wide early,
moved out from four to six wide on the far turn gaining on the leaders, ran on in the drive but needed more. MANO DURA shifted in heading to the first turn
racing in the two path off the pace through that bend, edged closer on the far turn moving out four wide into upper stretch, lacked room and altered course
inwards but was no late threat. STOCKPILER was unhurried at the rear early, swung seven wide for the drive and kicked on mildly. IMA BIG BOPPER came
in a bit at the break, set the pace racing just off the rail in the two path, was overtaken heading into the far turn and came up empty. TALE TWISTER
bumped with a foe at the start, raced outside four wide early, was unable to threaten.

Footnotes
FEDERAL HILL settled near the inside, advanced on the far turn, struck the lead at the top of the stretch, was clear into mid-stretch, lugged out several
paths and bumped a rival but held sway. STRICTLY CONFIDENT was carried out on the first turn by a rival, stalked mid-pack outside, advanced making a
steady bid through the lane, was bumped late and couldn't get past. JOHN DOUGH broke awkwardly, raced at the back off the inside, swung out for the
stretch run and improved position while gaining mildly. MERCI moved clear to set the tempo racing comfortably and in the clear while off the rail, was
challenged turning for home and put to urging, weakened in the stretch. GEORGIA DEPUTY saved ground inside early racing off the pace, needed more for
to threaten. DYNA STRIKE switched out stalking the leader three wide, had no extra for the drive. DISCO DANZING shifted in early, tracked from mid-pack,
weakened. GOLD VERMILION was pulled up early on the first turn and vanned off. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF STRICTLY

Footnotes
TEXAS PRADO cleared the field early and shifted in entering the first turn to set the pace near the rail, was pressed by a rival up the backstretch, shook
clear of that one and held sway. ATTILA THE DUN was caught five wide on the first turn, stalked from outside just off the leader, advanced some four to five
deep on the far turn, was no match for the winner but second best. FLY'N SEXY saved ground racing inside, secured show honors in late stretch. SLIM
JIMMY chased the eventual winner from outside three wide, weakened. MOROLICIOUS raced off the rail two wide early, swung six deep into upper stretch
and ran on mildly. VICTOR VALENTINO was unhurried early, swung seven wide into the stretch, evened out. GOLIATH RIDGE broke a step slowly, settled
into stride four wide toward the rear early, advanced late up the backstretch to reach striking distance on the far turn, could not sustain the effort and
flattened out. RED DRAW was caught five wide early, swung seven deep for the drive, was unable to menace. LEGAL EAGLE rated mid-pack four wide
early, failed to rally. TOP HONORS veered out and was away slowly, angled in soon thereafter, advanced some in the early going along the rail, was never
near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
EASY BIG BOY attended the early pace inside, took the lead at the half, drew clear in the stretch when roused. TREASURE COAST set the early tempo
while kept quite wide in the early going, moved nearer the inside to press the new leader into the turn, was no match for that one but held the place. CALARI
BLUECAT was coaxed forward between rivals to race just off the leader past the nine-sixteenths, lost some ground on the turn, angled out six wide into
upper stretch, kicked on but missed second. PLAIN TAP WATER shifted in heading up the backstretch, tracked in behind the leaders inside, lacked the
needed late kick. CALIPARI raced at the back off the inside, angled seven wide into the stretch, improved position. GRAND SIR broke a step slowly,
switched out, went three to four wide on the turn, ran on. WHO'S BIG DADDY chased but was outpaced early, swung eight wide into the stretch, was not a
threat. COMPUTATION got away well, was just off the leaders racing outside, carried out six wide late on the turn then eased back and altered inside a
rival, flattened out in the drive. GIST was hard to load then off very slowly, did not factor. CLASSIC RUNNER angled in and saved ground on the turn, failed
to menace. MAYAN chased from off the inside mid-pack, tired.

Footnotes
PHARME'S PHAITH settled off the pace, came off the rail in the early going, swung seven wide into upper stretch, drove past late. CINCO RICHIE moved
out from three to four wide on the first turn just off the leaders, advanced outside up the backstretch to force the issue, dueled outside a rival through the far
turn, put that one away in late stretch but was outfinished. MOR VICTORY eased back from between the leading pair into the first turn to track in behind
shifting nearer the inside, was keen to go on but lacked room in behind heading up the backstretch and shuffled back several positions, came out a bit on
the far turn and lacked room past the quarter pole, bumped lightly with a rival soon after, finally found room in upper stretch and ran on well but missed
second. COWBOY RIDGE had forward position outside the early leader two to three wide, moved forward to contest the issue up the backstretch, dueled
inside a foe but off the fence through the far turn into late stretch then yielded grudgingly late. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS was caught outside foes mid-pack
three to four wide early, tracked from off the inside through the far turn, ran on evenly. BULLS IN THE BRONX saved ground through both turns coming out
a bit turning for home, kicked on well but too late. CAPTAINS COVE broke a step slowly, shifted in two to three deep toward the back into the first turn,
moved out leaving that bend, advanced outside five wide on the far turn, faltered and faded in the lane. CRAZY RIDGE moved clear and in to set the early
pace racing inside, was overtaken heading up the backstretch, could not rally, dropped back and faded. DOUGH BOY trailed racing inside, failed to rally.
