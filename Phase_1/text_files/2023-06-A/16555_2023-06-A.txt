Footnotes
ERV'S WENCH tracked leaders inside to the turn, angled out into the stretch run, dueled in the final furlong and prevailed in a long drive to the wire.
CLEVER TALE just off leaders to the turn, hooked in a duel but lost the head bob on the wire. L. A. STAR floated back to last early on, rallied in earnest
through the stretch for show spot. FUTURE FLAY speed from inside early on, could not keep up and faded. MY DARK SECRET chased leader to the turn
with brief lead into the stretch but gave in readily in the final furlong.

DRIFTWOOD crossed over smoothly to the front, well handled to stay clear. AMENDED had good position to far turn, rallied to split horses while coming on
through the final furlong. EDEN PARADISE broke sharp while never far back, saved ground and tried hard through the stretch. INDOCUMENTADO no
speed from inside, stuck on rail to far turn, improved stretch. IN HONOR OF ARTIE raced evenly throughout with no late response in the stretch. BASTIEN
LE BROWN good position to far turn with nothing left for the stretch run. HONKY TONK HERO through early, dropped back readily. HEMP HEMP HURRAY
never a real factor throughout. COUNT FROST no speed throughout. TORNADO BOY good speed to duel early on, stayed on to the stretch faltered.
ENGLISH CLASSIC never really a factor.

Footnotes
PRONTO CHARLI no speed to the turn, put to a drive quarter pole, wide run clear. COMPUTER WHIZ good position to turn, angled out for clear run, good
effort. EMERALD EYES tardy from the gate, lagged back to the stretch, wide late run. SWEET AS MERRIE lunged at the start, outside leader, took over,
cleared, weakened from inside through the final sixteenth. LIVIE ANNE unhurried from the gate, inside run to turn, no response. SHAKA'S LYRIC broke
sharp outside, tried hard to deep stretch, faltered badly. SHEZ IN A TIZZY inside speed to the turn, gave way readily from quarter poe.
