MAINE was allowed to settle early, came wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up in time, driving. MIZZEN MONEY chased the early pace
and made a four wide bid off the turn and gained the lead at the sixteenth marker but was caught late to just miss. SUPER ROCKER was reserved early,
angled in leaving the seven sixteenths, advanced on the inside on the turn, came two wide off the turn and finished well but needed more. NEON SIGN was
away alertly and dueled for the lead and made a two wide bid leaving the turn to shake clear, but faded in the furlong grounds. FREEDOM'S START chased
the pace and was three wide on the urn but lacked the needed stretch bid. SON OF A BEAST dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
BROTHER SHOWTYME was settled early, made a four wide move off the turn, continued that move to get up in time under a drive. KNOCKDOWN KID
stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead by the furlong marker, then ran on but was caught late to just miss. CHIEF
REIDER tracked the pace on the inside, checked leaving the three eighths, then made a inside bid off the turn but was out kicked. POLSAR was settled
early, five wide by the quarter pole and had a mild late rally, needed more. LITTLE J P set the pace and was on the inside on the turn and faded the final
furlong. ZOOMSTER broke in the air and was not a factor. UNCLE REMI showed brief speed between rivals and stopped, raced with no front shoes.

FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, drew clear on the turn and then drew off smartly in the lane to prove much the best,
driving. SAKETUMI prompted the winner two wide and fell back nearing the quarter pole and proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best.
MEAN MACHINE was settled early, came three wide into the lane and bested the rest. CALL ON CLARA was taken back early, advanced on the turn three
wide and came four wide into the lane but had no late rally. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER was reserved on the inside and lacked a rally, raced with no front
shoes.. EGOT A POKER FACE chased the pace on the inside and tired. LAKE NAKURU showed no speed and was not a factor.
