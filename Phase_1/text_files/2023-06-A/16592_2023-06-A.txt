Footnotes
EXTRA INNINGS was hustled leaving the break and dictated terms early on, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, held a narrow lead on
TEE SHOT to the furlong pole, shifted out a path inside of the furlong marker, shook free into deep stretch and drew clear under steady handling in the final
stages. TEE SHOT broke alertly and was prominent leaving the start, pressed EXTRA INNINGS through quick early fractions, kept close attendance to that
rival into upper stretch, altered course inside of the furlong pole when EXTRA INNINGS shifted out, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch
and held safely for second. RIVER'S BEHEST chased the quick early pace, raced two wide between rivals along the bend, was steered three wide into the
drive, offered a mild late rally and held well for third in the final sixteenth. RANCHO RED lacked early speed and trailed into the turn, waited behind runners
at the quarter marker, angled four wide into the stretch, finished evenly in the drive and missed for third. MEDAL ICE chased from the inside and weakened
in the stretch. TIZ A THRILL chased the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals along the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
A ROUSING BABE raced under a snug early hold, saved ground along the turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, loomed a threat nearing mid-stretch, split
rivals at the furlong pole, responded to steady urging and took command nearing the sixteenth-marker, fended off LIKE NO OTHER in deep stretch and held
in a drive in the final strides to prevail. LIKE NO OTHER settled off of the quick early pace and was well placed heading into the turn, advanced outside of
rivals along the bend, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied nearing mid-stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong pole, lost the lead at the
sixteenth-marker to A ROUSING BABE, was outfinished by that rival in the final stages and bested the rest. BLACK ZABAT broke alertly then took back off
of the quick early pace and tracked DANEHILL SONG into the turn, re-engaged and pressed that rival to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper
stretch then continued to battle approaching the furlong pole, was unable to match strides with the top two heading to the sixteenth-marker and weakened in
deep stretch, while holding clearly for third. MATCHLESS bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the solid early pace, raced
outside of a rival into the turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and finished evenly. DANEHILL
SONG was asked to show speed in the early stages and was sent to the front, set solid fractions while on a clear lead into the turn then was pressed by
BLACK ZABAT to the quarter marker, held a narrow lead into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and faded in deep stretch.

Footnotes
QUE SERA SIR RALPH broke alertly and contested the early lead with LYING GHOST, assumed command into the first turn and set decent fractions while
well handled through the backstretch run, was set down in upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, kept to task in the final sixteenth, felt
mild late pressure from the runner-up and held safely at the finish to secure the rider's first career win. WELLSWORT (IRE) settled off of the decent early
pace, tracked the leaders while outside of a rival through the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the far turn, ran in pursuit of QUE SERA SIR RALPH
into the stretch, made a mild late gain on the winner in the final stages but could not reel that one in and was an easy second at the end. BEROLIJEAN (FR)
was unhurried, saved ground into the backstretch run then was steered outside of a rival while advancing heading to the far turn, came within aim while
three deep nearing the quarter pole, was outrun in the stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong and was up in the final strides to secure third. VANISKY
settled just off of the early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, was well placed while tracking the leaders into the far turn, gained ground nearing
the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch, lacked a late response and missed for third. LYING GHOST contested the early
pace with QUE SERA SIR RALPH then took back to stalk that rival into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, could not
keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
BLEVYS TIGER broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, shook clear and set solid fractions into the turn, was well handled along the bend,
drifted out a bit nearing the top of the lane, extended the lead heading to mid-stretch, had the margin cut into a bit in the final sixteenth and kept to task
under steady urging to prevail. DON'T WORRY BOSS chased the solid early pace from the inside, tipped two wide for the stretch run, chased BLEVYS
TIGER to the furlong marker, made a mild late gain on the winner in deep stretch and was second best in the end. BIG CATTY chased from the second
flight, advanced outside of a rival along the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong pole, could not muster the needed late
response and was outkicked, while holding safely for third. LITTLE NAUGHTY contested the early pace with BLEVYS TIGER, could not match strides with
that rival and chased into the turn, was a bit green and hard to place into the bend, raced in the four path into the turn then chased three wide nearing the
quarter marker, was coaxed along two wide into the stretch and gave way. CEE'S THE IMAGE was forwardly placed leaving the break, came in tight and
was shuffled back at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased two wide along the turn, was steered to the rail into upper stretch and did not rally in the drive. SHANA
MADEL broke in a bit at the start and chased from the rail in the early going, trailed into the turn and was steered into the three path heading to the quarter
marker, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain to the furlong marker, could not sustain that bid in the final stages and did not threaten.
CRYPTO CRUSH settled toward the rear while saving ground, angled three wide into upper stretch and did not factor. AMERICAN TSUNAMI chased the
fast early pace, took back approaching the turn and saved ground along the bend, was outrun into upper stretch and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
STRAIT OF GEORGIA was forwardly placed in the early running, prompted the pace along the first turn and kept close attendance to the decent fractions
through the backstretch run, assumed command heading to the far turn, was confronted in upper stretch by MOVIETIME, battled with that foe to the furlong
grounds, repelled that foe's bid approaching the sixteenth-marker, responding to steady urging into deep stretch and drew away in the final stages to prove
best. WAY TOO HOT stalked the decent early pace, tracked the leaders while two wide through the backstretch run, slipped to the rail nearing the quarter
pole, gained ground in upper stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner in deep stretch and ran on in the final
strides to secure second. MOVIETIME prominent in the early running, was rank and hard to place entering the first turn, steadied off of heels leaving the
seven-furlong pole and drifted out a bit on the run into the backstretch, settled while well placed through the backstretch run, advanced two wide on the far
turn, drew to even terms with STRAIT OF GEORGIA in upper stretch, battled with that rival to the furlong pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch,
weakened and was outfinished for second while just holding for third. SILENT BULLET was allowed to settle, moved up along the backstretch run and was
well placed approaching the far turn, was roused three wide heading to the quarter marker, made a steady gain into the stretch while outside of rivals, could
not muster the needed late response and was outfinished for the minor awards. TITOS WITH A TWIST settled in the second flight while not far back, was
well placed while saving ground through the backstretch run, came into tight quarters along the second turn, checked between rivals midway through the
bend, swung three wide for the stretch drive and did not offer the needed late response. COACH OTT was unhurried, saved ground through the backstretch
run, was steered to the two path into upper stretch and did not factor. RIVER'S BENCHMARK showed early speed and set a pressured pace into the first
turn, set moderate fractions while prompted by STRAIT OF GEORGIA, lost the lead to that rival heading to the second turn, chased to the quarter marker
and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ATTENZIONE was allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the far turn, rallied and loomed at mid-stretch, continued his rail bid into deep stretch,
confronted MACHO CHROME inside of the sixteenth-marker, surged in the final strides and won the nod on the wire to prevail. MACHO CHROME was
prominent in the early running, raced in the three path along the first turn while prompting the pace, attended to the decent fractions through the backstretch
run, confronted the pacesetter at the quarter marker and took command into upper stretch, was set down at the furlong marker and held foes at bay to the
sixteenth-pole, drifted and became erratic in deep stretch, was headed by ATTENZIONE, came again and re-established the lead in the final yards, was
erratic and hung in the final strides and was nailed on the line for the win, while just holding for the place. CARDIFF CRACK was allowed to settle and saved
ground in the early running, gained ground along the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive, advanced
and came within aim at the furlong marker, closed on MACHO CHROME approaching the sixteenth-marker, steadied off of that drifting rival into deep
stretch, finished well in the final strides and just missed for the win and place, while holding for the show. JOHNNY DAR stalked the decent early pace from
the inside, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, gained ground and was steered two wide to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit of MACHO
CHROME to the furlong grounds, drifted out a path and impeded CANELITO inside of the furlong pole, was gaining in deep stretch but could not muster the
needed response and was outkicked. CANELITO settled in the second flight early on, gained ground along the backstretch run and was well placed heading
to the far turn, was roused three wide heading to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch, altered course behind a
drifting rival inside of the furlong pole, made a mild late rally in deep stretch but lacked the needed late response. UPSTART YANKEE was unhurried in the
early stages, settled outside of a rival into the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the
furlong marker, found his best stride late but was unable to threaten. DUPLICATION was allowed to settle, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch
run, was coaxed along two wide into the far turn, swung three wide for the drive, made a mild gain at mid-stretch, was gaining in the late stages but did not
factor. BLUE SILVER broke alertly and dictated terms in the early stages, set decent fractions while prompted by MACHO CHROME, was confronted by that
rival at the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BARBERA was sent leaving the break and established the early lead, showed speed into the turn then was well handled through decent fractions along the
bend, drew to a clear lead while in hand into upper stretch, was kept to steady urging through the final furlong, kept to task into deep stretch and remained
clear to the finish to prevail. MALASADA tracked the decent early pace from the inside, gained ground along the turn, tipped two wide for the stretch run,
chased BARBERA to the furlong marker, was not able to make headway on the winner in the final stages and bested the rest. ROUSING STAR bumped
PASSIONATE KISSES sharply at the start, chased the solid early pace, ran in pursuit while two wide into the turn, slipped to the rail into upper stretch,
could not keep pace with the top pair in the drive and was outkicked, while well clear for third. AUTISM SHINE tracked the decent early pace while outside
of rivals, raced three wide while within aim along the turn, was outrun into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. RUNAWAY SALLY broke alertly and
was prominent leaving the start, lost the early lead to BARBERA and pressed that rival into the turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter along the bend,
drifted out a bit approaching the top of the lane and came three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace heading to the furlong marker and tired in the final
stages. PASSIONATE KISSES was bumped sharply at the start by ROUSING STAR and was off slowly, lacked early speed, became erratic heading into
the turn and continued to be hard to place along the bend, recovered into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EVENEREVENWORSE broke sharply and was sent to the early lead, set a quick pace while clear into the turn, carved out fast fractions while clear to the
quarter marker, raced in hand into upper stretch, was asked for more at the furlong pole, felt pressure from TOP HARBOR nearing the sixteenth-marker,
responded to firm urging into deep stretch, determinedly dug in in the final strides, held off the closing runner-up and prevailed on the line in a game win.
TOP HARBOR tracked the quick early pace while between runners, advanced along the turn, chased EVENEREVENWORSE into the stretch, rallied inside
of the furlong marker, confronted EVENEREVENWORSE inside of the sixteenth-pole, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and just
missed for the win, while holding safely for second. PSYCHO DAR tracked the fast early pace, was steered three wide along the turn, made a mild gain
nearing the furlong marker, finished well in the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and held well for third in the final strides. RAGER
was unhurried in the early running, saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, made a slight gain at mid-stretch, shifted four wide
inside of the furlong marker, closed willingly in deep stretch and just missed for third. MY SUMMER DREAM was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved
ground into the turn, was roused three wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, closed well in the late stages but was outkicked and just
missed for the minor awards. LARRY'S LEGEND chased the rapid early pace while three wide between rivals, advanced three wide along the turn, was
coaxed along four wide into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final stages but could not muster the needed late response.
LEXINGTON HUMOR was prominent in the early running, chased the fast pace into the turn while outside of rivals, drifted out a path while three wide along
the bend, lost ground into upper stretch, re-rallied in the final sixteenth but needed more. HONEYMOONZ OVER chased the fast early pace from the inside,
advanced along the turn, saved all of the ground to the top of the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and did not offer a final response.

Footnotes
ALMANERA (IRE) broke sharply then was content to sit just off the flank of DICK BEST while those two left the rest several lengths behind, pulled even at
the quarter pole, gained a slight lead by mid-stretch then ran on gamely under strong handling to fend off a pair of late challengers. INDIANERA broke
inward at the start, impeding the path of MAGICISTHEMOONLITE, raced near the front of the group chasing the two pacesetters, closed the gap on those
two with a nice middle move through the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and sustained the bid but came up just short and held for second. MYSTIC
TBILISI broke with the top pair then was taken back off the pace, moved forwardly through the turn in tandem with THE SANDY SURPRISE to the inside,
looked to swing out for room in mid-stretch then surged through an opportunistic hole to the inside and finished well but had to settle for the third spot.
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE squeezed at the start by INDIANERA and MYSTIC TBILISI, was being pushed to pick up the pace from the half-mile marker but
never got untracked and ran on one-paced to the finish. THE SANDY SURPRISE broke sharply but was outrun in the early going, deftly worked over to the
rail, saved ground through the turn then made up some ground on the leaders racing together with MYSTIC TBILISI, came under a hard ride from the
nine-sixteenths marker, took an awkward step approaching the furlong grounds and was ridden out to the wire. DICK BEST broke out at the start and made
contact with MIGHTY MATT, hustled to get the early lead but was unable shake ALMANERA (IRE) who sat just behind and to the outside through the turn,
hung on to mid stretch then weakened. MIGHTY MATT was bumped at the start and shuffled back, chased the pack to the turn while saving ground, was
unable to mount a serious threat but kept to task and finished evenly despite the early trouble. SASQUATCH RIDE broke a bit slow, was outrun and fell well
behind in the early going, moved towards the rail to save ground, came under a ride before the three furlong marker, swung six wide into the stretch and
drifted in under right handed urging late.
