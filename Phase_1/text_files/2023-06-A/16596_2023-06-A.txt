Footnotes
SAKIC saved ground, shifted three wide on the far turn, rallied late and prevailed under a strong hand ride. BACKYARD JUSTICE stalked the pace in the
three path, bid at the eighth pole, led late but was caught. BOOK OF ROMEO saved ground, angled four wide at the quarter pole, bid but couldn't close late.
HOBNOBIN GENERAL rallied belatedly four wide. KILLER HOTROD stalked the pace inside, rallied late but was caught late. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS
broke outward, bumping a foe, led inside, then faded in the stretch. FRUITCAKE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, then faded on
the far turn. GO EARLY STAY LATE was not a factor. CABOOSE pressed the pace to the stretch before giving way.

Footnotes
POISED lost her path at the start and was steadied, raced in the back into the turn, moved through the two then the three path through late turn, came into
the lane from the four path, caught the leader just inside the eighth pole, drove past and was widening the to the wire while kept under a hand drive. J'S
NAUGHTY KITTEN chased the pace from the four to the three path through the turn, was inching up on the leader outside the eighth pole when quickly
passed by the winner, stayed on to chase that one home and finished well clear of the others. ROSAS FOR LUZ set the pace while in the two path through
the turn, came into the lane from the four path then gave way just inside the eighth pole. RUSHIN LUCY stepped in at the start and was steadied to
straighten, raced in the two path through the turn when never far back then tired. EURCOOL pressed the pace along the inside early then steadily faded.

Footnotes
TRYINFORJUSTICE settled off the early three rival duel, moved four wide entering the turn, dueled through the turn with three others, gained a short lead in
late turn, cleared after straightening in the lane then was kept to the task to hold. SHEZA NUT vied for the lead along the inside of three others through the
turn, lost some ground into the lane, kept on while still along the rail and was inching up to the end. DABNEY in the three path through the turn when in
mid-pack, came into the lane from the five path, looked to be a serious threat with an eighth to go then slowly gained to the end and just lasted for the show
spot. SEQUEEKER hopped start and spotted the field a couple of lengths, raced through the turn while in the three or four path, came into the lane from the
six path and was gaining faster than all and just missed the show spot. MY BOYS vied for the lead from between rivals through late turn, was checked
approaching the quarter pole when in tight then did not menace thereafter. EMPIRE DANCER in the two or three path through the turn when well back then
moved up while not a threat. LITTLEBITOFLASH was checked early when in tight, raced in the three path and never factored. BATIBAT vied for the lead
three wide into the turn, was between rivals and still three wide into the lane and was empty through the final eighth. RAISE N PRAISE was outrun while in
the two path through the turn. BEVELED chased the pace from the inside into the turn and was done in mid-turn.

STAR WISHER dueled inside in the two path and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. PANTALONES ENFUEGO stalked the pace inside, had no late
bid but held the place. CRICKENBERGER raced in the four path and bid belatedly. BRODY MO stalked the pace in the three path, then had a mild late bid
inside. BAND OF ROSES dueled outside of the winner before giving way in the stretch. SHARP LIFE raced inside, bid at the three-eighths pole, then
faltered. UNBRIDLED FOX improved position late outside. SIGNATURE STREET stalked the pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then
faltered in the stretch. HONEY RED stalked the early pace inside before fading. OUT OF PROMISES saved ground to no avail. AMERICANA ANNA was
not a factor. TAP THE LINE raced four wide before fading.

lane and finished clearly second best. LIAM THE BRAVE chased the pace from the four path into the far turn, asked for more into the lane, could not gain
on the top ones and stayed on to hold the show spot. KING RAMOS was unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide through the turn, swung into the lane
from the four path then flattened out inside the eighth pole. LUCKY BOSS chased the pace into the far turn then tired. BULLBRIAR raced in the four path
into the far turn, asked for more in late turn then was empty late. SKATE TO HEAVEN moved through the four path down the backstretch and into the far
turn when never far back, lost ground through late turn and was done entering the lane. C F V TEXAS RED set the pace while near the inside through the
far turn then was done entering the lane. TOSS OF FATE chased the pace along the inside into the far turn, was pulled up in mid-turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
ONE FAMOUS AMOS popped, led, drifted in, held. PJAY always prominent. TF CROWN RESERVE came in start, lacked finishing kick. DJ SMOOCH
ALOT even run. BRAVEAUX moved up, no threat. ZOOMIN LIL TWIST broke outward, moved up. JUST A COMPACHUY losing ground. CAUSE FOR
CARTEL bothered, shut off start. RIII VICTORIO losing ground inside. CARVERSLITTLERUNAWAY trailed. AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF #4
CAUSE FOR CARTEL AGAINST THE RIDER OF #5 TF CROWN RESERVE FOR INTERFERECE AT THE START RESULTED IN THE
DISQUAIFICATION OF #5 TF CROWN RESERVE FROM THIRD (3RD) TO EIGHTH (8TH).
