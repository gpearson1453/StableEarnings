Footnotes
GRAVE DANGER well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, gaining a short lead,
then drew off inside the furlong marker and was kept to the task. RECKLESS AFFAIR well placed, gained position into the second turn, held position on the
two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. DAD'S LIL SPARK sprinted to a
long lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. RUBY ROAD unhurried,
saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and flattened out. FLAT BUSTED pinched back at the
start, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled out and passed tiring rivals. MOCA MONSTER
well placed, held position on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch and could not gain. BIALYSTOCK mid pack,
gained position two and three wide through the second turn, then had no rally. SHAKEN AND SHIMMY was no factor.
