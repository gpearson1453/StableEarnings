Footnotes
BARSINVIEW lead the way from the inside, was confronted by an outer rival at the top of the turn, then inched away heading into the stretch, then continued
to draw away to prove much the best in the end. RICHARD'S TX BLING broke outwardly and bumped rival, then raced in the back the pack while three
wide, bid on the turn and was gaining ground gamely in the stretch and was up for the place prize in the end. DANDY LOU was bumped at the start, then
chased the pace from the inside, was gaining on the turn, rallied in early stretch and was out bid for the place position in deep stretch and was best for
show. JUST HANGIN RIDGE raced while two wide, then rallied on the turn to close evenly down the stretch. TWELVE PACK was in a hard drive to press
the pace while two wide, was used up on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SKYKAT unhurried in the early going, settled in mid-pack for the run down the backside, circled four wide in the far turn while put to an early drive,
responded well to the strong urging and took command in mid-stretch and held the closer safe. FOR FUN hopped at the start to give the field a length at the
start, settled into stride under patient handling down the backside while trailing, angled wide turning for home and closed with a rush to be gaining late.
CARPE HORSESHOE sped to the lead into the first turn from the fence, set a pressured pace to the head of the lane and kept on gamely through the lane
although unable to hold off the closers. CARRY ON pressed the pace from the on-set from two wide, kept stride with her stablemate the entire trip and
finished willingly in a good effort. ROZEY CHEEKS prompted the pace from three wide throughout, loomed up boldly in upper stretch and weakened late in
the drive. CATO'S LADY tracked the leaders from the rail down the backside in striking position, was forced to sit behind the front wall of the three
pacesetters in upper stretch, dove to the rail approaching the gap in upper stretch and failed to respond when clear. LIL ASHLEY B. chased the field within
striking distance to the far turn and failed to respond when called upon. AFFICIONADO (FR) prominently placed from four wide through the first turn and
down the backside and came up empty approaching the final bend.

Footnotes
MORO FLASHBACK had shoe fixed prior to the start, set the pace along the inside, cleared the turn, then continued to draw away down the stretch to prove
best in the end. LOOPY DUDE chased the pace while two wide, then dueled gamely with an outer rival throughout the last furlongs and was up by a head in
the end. PRATHER chased the pace while three wide, then dueled for the place position with an inner rival throughout the turn and into the stretch, and
hung in the end. GHOST CREEK raced between rivals in the second flight of rivals, then rallied on the turn, drifted in the early stretch continued to bid down
the lane but came up empty. CAPO'S DREAM raced from the inside in the second pack of rivals, then bid on the turn before giving way in late stretch.
HONOR THE LAW chased the pace while two wide, then dropped back at the top of the turn then continued to flatten out. ONEDRUNKNIGHT raced in
three path in the second group of rivals, menaced on the turn then stopped. CAROLINA PARTISAN was unhurried early, then trailed behind the field
throughout and eased.

Footnotes
FASHION RAGE broke alertly, was allowed to settle just off the pace, stalked the leaders through the turn, rallied three wide to take command turning for
home and drew clear holding his advantage to the wire. MY FRIEND AMY reserved off the pace for the first half mile, angled out at the head of the lane and
closed with a rush to gain the place in the final stride. TIFFANY TWIST tracked the pace from striking distance to the quarter pole, loomed up turning for
home with his bid and failed to sustain his bid late. PINKY TOE pressed the pace from the fence for a half mile, briefly took the lead, was overtaken quickly
by the winner, kept on to mid-stretch and weakened deep in the drive. RECLUSIVE slow early to trail and showed late interest making up ground in the lane.
HEATED ARGUMENT went evenly failing to ever menace. TIPSY GAL sped to the lead from two wide, battled on the front to the quarter pole and tired
turning for home. UNIQUE BABE was never a threat.

Footnotes
CAMP CUSTER stalked the leaders from five wide, took the lead at the quarter pole while still in hand, was set to a drive in upper stretch and drew clear
late. LOOK SHARP flashed speed to duel on the lead from between horses to top of the lane, dropped off the leader when passed in upper stretch and
dug-in gamely to keep coming down the lane in a good effort. TAKE FLIGHT hesitated at the start giving the field a length advantage, moved into contention
along the rail down the backside while patiently handled, angled out in mid-stretch and kept on well to gain the show. SMOKEY STORY pressed the pace
from the rail in a three horse duel, loomed in upper stretch and ran-on well to just miss the show in a blanket photo. JUST BATTLE trailed early on, found his
best stride late to be gaining belatedly down the stretch. GOLD BARON raced in mid-pack within striking distance to the top of the lane and failed to close
ground coming home. COMO ESTAS prominently placed for the first quarter mile, dropped back into the turn and posed no threat. PONZA flashed speed
for the first quarter to press the pace from three wide and faded leaving the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
POMEROY HAZE tracked the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn to rally in the early stretch, then edged clear in the final furlong and was
up in the final strides to prevail. LOOKIN HIGH tracked the pace from the inside under a steady hand ride, then bid on the turn, angled out three wide in the
early stretch and closed belatedly in the end. BEHIND THE CURTAIN set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive heading into the home stretch but
was out bid in the end by outer foes and was best for the show prize. LOUIS LE GRANDE raced in the middle of the field from the inside, was in a steady
drive on the turn, rallied in the early stretch and closed well in the end. FRA MAURO stalked the pace while two wide, then menaced on the turn to try and
catch the leader but flattened out in the stretch. GOLD ACCOUNT raced along the inside towards the back of the pack, made a mild bid on the turn from the
three path but needed more in the end. GUNNER PAUL was bumped at the start, then raced in the middle of the pack while two wide, was urging on the
turn to rally in mid stretch but came up empty in the end. HE'S PRETTY LUCKY raced behind most of the field while three wide, then rallied on the turn and
was no threat. OJITOS settled in the three path down the backstretch, then bid on the turn and flattened out in the stretch and was no threat. PEPPERMAN
was unhurried early then raced behind the field along the inside and needed rally in the end. PRINCIPE GUILHERME raced in the middle of the field while
four wide, then faded throughout and was no rally. EPIC RUN was in a hard drive while racing from the five path in the middle of the pack, came out nine to
ten wide in the upper stretch and was no threat.

Footnotes
XTRA SPICY stalked the pace from two wide in the second flight, moved to challenge in the turn, took the lead in mid-stretch under strong handling and
kicked clear late. MISSINGYOUCRAZY pressed the pace from two wide into the first turn and down the backstretch, moved to the lead at the quarter pole
and continued well to the wire but failed to hold off the winner in a good try. HAILEY'S JEWEL unhurried for the first half mile, rallied four wide on the final
bend to loom boldly in upper stretch but failed to sustain her bid late in the drive. WICKED SONG well positioned in the clear down the backside, moved to
contention turning for home and lacked a closing kick. COUNTRY JEWEL went evenly and failed to gain on the leaders. ITS A GEE THING prominently
placed for the first three quarters along the fence but lacked a response when called upon for the drive. KAUSE I'M DEVINE bumped at the start, dropped to
the rear through the first turn and down the backside, continuously raced up to be on heels and taken in hand, rallied wide in the far turn and flattened out
coming for home. QUEEN OF BEERS sped to the lead into the first turn and set a pressured pace for a half mile and came up empty.
