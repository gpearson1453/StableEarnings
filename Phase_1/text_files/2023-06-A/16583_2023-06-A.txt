BATI KING was sent clear from the inside, held a clear lead inside the eighth pole while racing nearing the inside and prevailed late under strong handling.

coaxed along from the inside and had not enough for the top pair. DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE dropped near the back of the pack early, raced four to five
wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. WESLEY THOMAS chased the early pace between rivlas and faded.

Footnotes
BREITHORN dueled from the inside of foes early on, dug in near the eighth pole and proved best under strong handling. TACO BEAN dueled for the early
lead from the outside of foes and finished gamely to the wire. UNDERDOG dueled for the early lead between rivals and kept on to the wire. CLASSY
SOLUTION chased the early pace, lacked racing room near the three eighths pole, was four deep past the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire.
Jockey of Classy Solution claimed objection for interference on Breithorn and stewards ruled no change. KIRBY raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
R AVERIE LYNN quick to begin to set an unpressured early pace, confronted near the five sixteenths pole and held gamely under a steady hand ride.
IZZYBELLA rated early while racing in hand early, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole, raced two to three wide around the far turn and kept on
gamely to the wire. IFIHADACHANCE tracked the early leader down the backstretch, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly late
with no closing bid on the top pair. SNEAKY CHEEKY stalked the pace along the inside and had no final bid in the drive. MISS DILLINGHAM dropped back
early on, raced near the inside past the five sixteenths pole, angled nearing the upper stretch and lacked a bid while racing from the outside. CHALK HILL
was off slowly, settled along the inside near the back of the pack, raced three to four wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. TOMARIE
chased the pace from the outside and failed to sustain a bid.

CITI CREEK stalked the early duel, raced three wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly to prove best under strong handling. LITTLE HENRY
dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe, angled in to race near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. CUP
MATCH was off slowly, raced off the early going, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. MY BIG DRAMA dueled for the early lead from
the inside, checked just past the three eighths pole and weakened a bit late. Jockey of My Big Drama claimed objection against Little Henry for interference
and stewards ruled no change. NATURE OFTHE BEAST broke in at the start, void of early speed, raced far back and never threatened.

JUBILEE BRIDGE rated along two deep from the outside of rival under a firm hold, ridden along past the quarter pole and edged clear late racing two to
three wide. THEREARENORULES settled off the early going, swung wide into the upper stretch, surged late and got up for the place position. STILL MY
BABE showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside and gave way grudgingly in the final stages. STARRY HOPE settled off the early pace to race
mid pack, was two to three wide in the drive and had not enough. STIR CRAZY stalked the pace, raced three to four wide in the drive and raced evenly late
with no closing run. KILIMANJARA ducked out sharply at the start, raced near the back of the pack early, lost ground and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
YOU'RE THE ONE pressed the early leaders from the outside and finished strongly to kick clear under steady pressure. HONEYCAMP vied for the early
lead from the inside of rivals and narrowly held the place position. BEST WORST IDEA raced in tight quarters soon after the start, shifted out through the far
turn, raced five wide in the lane and finished willingly to the wire. LADY LANCER pressed the early pace under a steady ride between rivals and weakened
the final eighth of a mile. ARIANA VALENTINA raced off the early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.q. CHOOSELOV was void
of early speed and never was a factor. NEVER FREE stalked the pace from the outside of rivals and tired readily.
