LIL GREEN MACHINE was away alertly, set the pace and was headed at the top of the stretch but fought gamely for the win. NO MORE stalked the leader,
was a factor on the turn and vied from the three path at the top of the stretch but just missed. FOUR BOUNCE was unhurried early and moved up on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. KING OF AWESOME was hustled early but chased on the turn and had no impact.
DYNAMIC MISSION was bumped early, showed little and was outrun. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN NO MORE BEING
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACE FIFTH.

Footnotes
JUNGLE GODDESS set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. FRESH DREAMS was in range
and hustled along on the turn but was second best. PACENZA was away alertly, roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up
for show. REMEMBEROLDTYMES was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but needed more. J M R GEMMA was off slow, trailed the field on the turn
and passed tired foes through the stretch. FUN COOL stalked the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
weakened. LOUEMMA was hustled early and saved ground on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT ANGEL was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch drew off. ASHWICKEN was in touch, raced
evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. MIZZ GEMMA was hustled early and a factor on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch was all out. LADY OF THE FORT tracked the leaders and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch failed to hold. OUR STORMY SOPHIA set the pace but was headed on the turn and had nothing left. RUMOURS FLY was well back and closed
the gap on the turn but was never a threat. SHE'S SO COLD was off the pace, showed little and was not a factor.

touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. BLUES POWER set the pace but was headed on the turn and
gave way. VOYANT was in range and forced the pace on the turn but evened out. SCENIC HOLIDAY was off the pace and roused on the turn but from the
