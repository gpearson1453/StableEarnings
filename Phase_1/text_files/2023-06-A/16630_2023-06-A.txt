Footnotes
ABUNDANT broke out and brushed with rival at the start then placed forwardly through early stages, hustled along three wide around the turn, got carried
out wider entering the stretch run, stayed on determinedly in the lane and kicked by near the sixteenth pole. K C ROCKET got brushed at the start then sped
to the lead and set the early pace, repelled bids around the turn, hustled along two wide into the lane, held clear in upper stretch then got overtaken
approaching the final sixteenth. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE was forwardly placed in opening stages racing just off the early leader, was ridden along two wide
around the turn, came three wide into stretch run, ran on in upper stretch then weakened off the top pair in the final furlong. B MAKER raced in range along
the inside while briefly a bit tight, roused for more around the turn, failed to respond and gave way. WHONEW lacked speed, trailed the field and failed to
move into contention.

DIALED IN TO WIN raced in contention just off the top pair in opening stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn, roused forward and took
command near mid-stretch and finished going away. BORDINOS came away last at the start and raced near the back, edged up closer four wide late on the
turn, hustled along into stretch run, responded and produced a solid finish. X RAY VISION took over a slim lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace
around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, got collared by the winner near mid-stretch and gave way. DON JUAN BUBBA raced in the back
although never too far back, swung four wide into the lane and produced a mild bid. ESCAPEFROMPARADISE broke on top then conceded position to X
RAY VISION soon after the start, applied pace pressure to rival around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
GIRL PRO was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide into the first turn, settled nicely rated just off the second flight up the backstretch, let out
a notch entering the far turn, cleared command racing in hand leaving the five sixteenths pole, roused three wide into the lane, responded willingly and
pulled away. FROSTED DIAMOND got bumped at the start and raced three wide into the first turn, settled off the pace up the backstretch, crept closer late
on the far turn then launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, responded, steadily gained ground and finished clearly second best. ELI'S GIRL
stalked the clear leader up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the far turn, was no match for the top duo but stayed on and cleared the rest.
SWEET DYNASTY was unhurried and raced in the back, coaxed three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FABULOSITY sped to the lead at the
start and crossed over, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, got collared by the eventual winner midway around the far turn and gave way.
ALTERNATE ABBY tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch and came up empty around the far turn.

Footnotes
PURE ROCKET raced off the pace in the opening quarter, crept closer then launched a bid late on the turn, moved up in tandem with COLONEL KLINK in
upper stretch, dueled for command, held a slight edge, dug in gamely from the inside position and refused to be denied. COLONEL KLINK lacked speed out
of the gate and raced in the back, picked up the tempo midway up the backstretch, moved into closer contention near the quarter pole, advanced win
tandem with PURE RICKET in upper stretch, dug in along the outside but failed to get by stubborn winner. NEW STRIPE was unhurried up the backstretch,
saved ground then shifted out near the quarter pole, momentarily raced in traffic at the head of the lane, came under a drive four wide, showed response
and gained show. HERITAGE PARK tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch and around the turn, raced in the two path and given cue at the head of the
lane, failed to kick on and steadily weakened. TOO LATE set the clear pace in the opening quarter and held firm around the turn, got collared by outside duo
nearing the furlong marker and quickly retreated. MUCHO GIFTED was not too far back in the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and faded in
the lane. MARQUEE THUNDER showed response in the opening quarter then dropped back.

Footnotes
RISKY WHISKY rated off the second flight in the opening quarter, was ridden along three to four wide entering the lane, shifted out to race five deep a
furlong out, kicked in, rallied along the outside and got up in final strides. S C SKYLARS EMPIRE pressed the pace in opening stages then edged back into
tracking position, waited patiently along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, made a bold bid along the rail in upper stretch, slipped
through then cleared command, led into late stages then got edged out approaching the wire. CONFETTI BETTY got bumped at the start then was
forwardly placed up the backstretch, chased in close contention around the turn, swung three wide into the lane, sustained bid into the final furlong then
flattened out. DIAMOND OF EKATI led the way under pressure in opening stages then cleared on top and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around
the turn, got collared nearing the eighth pole and gave way. KID BIZ raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane and showed some interest in
final stages. IVY ABAD GIRL tracked the early pace, raced three wide up close around the turn, sustained bid to the eighth pole then weakened. BIT A BAD
NEWS got bumped at the start and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
FINISH UP was off slow at the start and raced in the back, steadily picked up the tempo running up the backstretch, let out a notch entering the turn and
quickly advanced into contention, swung into action racing four deep in upper stretch, dueled along the outside into the final furlong, battled on with stubborn
running KNIGHT COMMANDER into final stages and edged by late. KNIGHT COMMANDER was forwardly placed in opening stages and stalked the leader
up the backstretch, crept closer midway around the turn, given cue heading into the lane, dueled three wide between foes a furlong out, battled on
stubbornly with FINISH UP into final stages, fought back gamely and got denied in final strides. SIR WALLY WALLY raced in range along the inside, slipped
through along the rail near the quarter pole, dueled for command into late stages then weakened in the final sixteenth. CHINLEE rated off the leaders up the
backstretch, ranged up closer four wide late on the turn, flattened at the head of the lane, ran on but needed more for late impact. JUSTA STREAK set the
pace in the opening quarter, came under pressure around the turn, dueled for command to the furlong marker then gave way. SHIPS ON FIRE was
forwardly placed up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and had no late response. ALLEN'S ROCKET was not too far back in the opening
quarter, faded around the turn and had no response in the lane.

Footnotes
MRS. BEANS vied for the lead with TIME MACHINE in the opening quarter then took on the challenge of OIL MONEY three furlongs from home, dueled
inside of rival around the turn, roused for more in upper stretch, responded, shook free, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. OIL MONEY
slightly hopped at the start and steadily edged up closer sit in good position just off the top flight, let out a notch leaving the backstretch and challenged
MRS. BEANS for the lead, dueled around the turn, fought back in upper stretch then failed to move on with the eventual winner and settled for second best.
TIME MACHINE vied for the lead with the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match strides entering the turn but remained in contention, shifted
three wide into the lane and stayed on for a share. WESTONS WILDCAT raced off the top flight in early stages, chased three wide around the turn, ran on
two wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. MYSTERY MAN was forwardly placed sitting three wide just off the embattled pair, came under a ride
around the turn but failed to advance ad weakened in the lane. BUMPERDOO lacked speed, raced in the back and never threatened. HEY PILGRIM raced
off the early pace, saved ground around the turn and retreated in the lane.
