SILVER GALAXY was well off the pace early on, settled in hands for the first half of a mile, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, easily circled half of the
field through the turn, built momentum up to close down the lane under strong urging, drew next to the early leaders at the sixteenth pole, engaged a three
way charge for the last sixteenth of a mile, cleared the others by a nose and got the win. PLAY MO settled into the second tier on the outside, stalked the
early leaders until the three eighths pole, was cued, responded nicely gaining ground and gaining momentum, shifted out five wide and drifted down the
lane, drew beside the early leader and was caught by a fast outside closer at the last sixteenth, battled in between two other rivals and came away with a
good second. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF was in the second tier in the three path, quickly advance and shifted out four wide to draw next to the other pace
setters, improved position and continued to lead in a set while shifting over into the two path, was ridden under strong urging entering the stretch run, shook
the other runner who was leading in a set with him, briefly had the lead but was soon challenged by a pair of outside closers, participated in a three way
race to the wire and came out third running a game race just the same. RELENTLESS DANCER vied for the lead, set he pace for the first half, was collared
at the three sixteenth, faded after that. INTO WISHING showed little. WISE ANCHOR vied for the early lead, helped set the fractions from the rail and tired.

CABO COWGIRL used her natural speed to take the lead, followed the rail around the track at her own pace, ran professionally down the stretch, passed
the wire uncontested, showed a beautiful debut for a two year old filly. SISTER HONEY was sent after the leader out of the gates, was three wide stalking
the leader, continued to chase the leader down the stretch and to the wire proving to be second best today. GOOD BY FAITH showed brief speed, settled
off the pace mid pack, saved ground and was up for third. TAKE HER AWAY was off a bit slow, raced in the two path and next to an outside rival down the
back stretch, edged away from her company entering the stretch and maintained her position until the finish. FOREIGN TOURIST was never involved.
BETONYA trailed through out.

Footnotes
SMUGLERS BLUES showed early speed, raced just off the leader in the two path, was joined by an outside contender just after the half mile pole, raced in
a set through the turn and past the quarter pole, while still stalking the early leader, shifted over a lane in the upper stretch, shook her previous company
and in the next two strides collared the early leader and took over the leading position, finished the last eighth of a mile alone on the lead and drawing away.
BLESS D'SOUTH was settled off of the pace wile being thee wide, launched a bid at the half mile pole, started gaining ground, circled through the turn,
angled out into the six path in the upper had to much to do to over come the eventual winner stretch, was encouraged and responded well, closing in on the
early leader with every stride, had too much to do to over come the eventual winner but out finished the rest and ran a game second. NOWNOWDANCER
showed early speed and inherited the lead, was pressured by an inside foe until the quarter pole, starting tiring after that. THAT IS AWESOME settled off
the pace, raced on the rail angled out three wide at the five sixteenth pole, move next to the eventual winner, but lacked a late bid. JIVIN ASTRO made no
impact. DON'T BLINK TWICE trailed.

Footnotes
DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) broke well and let his speed carry him to the front while racing on a loose rein, took the rail and was asked to relax while setting the
fractions, showed the way willingly leading the rest past the five sixteenth pole, was gathered up and given the cue at the quarter pole, happily kicked into
what seemed like another gear and drew away winning by a good margin. BUTLER CABIN was racing three wide and off of the early pace, starting inching
closer after launching a bid at the half mile pole, circled the field in the turn, responded well to urging and continued to close down the stretch, cleared the
rest of the field at the eighth pole, could not catch his stable mate today but was definitely second best. CLARESTOWN was off the pace early on, advanced
and improved position, before the half mile pole, raced in a set with the second place finisher and split horses at the half mile pole, was two wide and closing
entering the stretch and tired. RUSSIAN TANK was three wide while racing off the pace and in between horses, was steadied a slight bit, lost momentum,
had no late kick. FORTY THREE was three wide and racing from the second tier, maintained that position until the three eighths pole, was collared at the
five sixteenth pole, battled on into the stretch but gave way late. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY trailed early and slightly improved position late. FATHER RED
showed little. BIG SUCCESS trailed though out.

QUICK TO BLAME raced from off the pace early, along the rail, launched a bid at the half, shifted out and joined the early leaders at the five sixteenth pole,
battled down the lane with an outside foe while closing ground on the early leader, repelled his battling foe at the eighth pole and went on to chase down the
one who lead through out, drew next to him matched strides, exchanged blows with every stride all the way to the wire, at the finish it was too close to tell
ending in a dead heat. PESO IN MY POCKET vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace, looked like a winner until the eighth pole, was challenged by
an outside closer, battled, dug in, matched strides all the way to the wire ending in a dead heat. CRIMSON STORM stalked the leader, improved position
near the half, drew next to the leader and challenged through the turn then faded. CHIEF CHEETAH was well off the pace early, stayed on the rail while
improving position, saved ground through the turn passing along the inside and making up ground, maintained position after that. OXXON had no impact.
OBVIOUSLY TOO showed brief speed then faded after the half. BOLD N WILD trailed through out.

TWO HANDS FULL was reluctant to load, broke well, raced on the rail in a stalking position, improved position through the turn, gained ground in the
stretch, shifted out into the three path late, split horses in the last sixteenth and was up for the win. KISS UPON A STAR raced off the pace three wide,
closed through the turn and into the stretch, battled after the last sixteenth, just missed. MISCHIEVOUS ME was four wide while stalking the pace,
advanced in the turn along the out side, closed well under urging, challenged for the lead, battled a few strides and finished third. SHESTHEBIGGAME vied
for the lead, raced on the rail, was challenged buy outside foe at the five sixteenth pole, battled down the lane then tired. SWEET SASSICAIA mild bid late.
SWEET N SALTY raced off the pace, and maintained positioning through out. IRISH WRIT was not a factor. LADY KRISTEN flashed early speed, tired.
DAZZLING THE MOON showed little. BOSTON MILLIE mild bid early.
