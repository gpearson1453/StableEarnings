Footnotes
MEGAN'S CLARA stalked two wide, bid while getting floated to the four path entering the lane and drove clear nearing midstretch. SHELL SHOCK tracked
three wide, spun into the lane in the five path, ran on to vie for place through midstretch, gained that position entering the final sixteenth and held it from an
outer rival late. CANDY CARAMEL bumped with an outer rival at the start and trailed in the aftermath, took the turn in the two path, swung out to the seven
path in upper stretch and stayed on late but did not have enough to reach place. MARGOINABUBBLEBATH bumped with an inner rival leaving the gates,
laid off of the pace two wide, took aim between the leading pair in the four path entering the lane, but failed to split them through narrow and non-existent
seam in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the eventual winner nearing midstretch, vied for place with an outer rival into the final sixteenth, but tired late.
YOLANDA WHO stalked along the inside and faded. CAMI CAT set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner entering the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
WHAT'S TO DO tracked in midpack from the three path while among foes around the turn, split rivals in the four path entering the lane to launch her rally in
pursuit of the clear leader, then surged past that one at the furlong grounds and drove clear. SHE'S MAGIC was herded outwardly by an inner rival at the
start, laid off of the pace early on, pursued from midpack four wide and outside of rivals around the turn, got outkicked by an inner foe while being floated to
the five path entering the lane, yet ran on to gain place in the final sixteenth. STAGE BELL broke outwardly, tracked three wide, but was outkicked by an
outer rival in upper stretch and chased between horses to gain show in the closing stages. EXCLUSIVE JONI laid off of the pace along the inside,
surpassed an inner weakening rival turning for home, then sustained stride to advance along the rail in the final furlong. GRACEFUL UNION set a clear
pace around the turn, but offered no resistance to the eventual winner's bid at the furlong grounds and faltered between horses late. MISS ANALYZED
lacked speed in the three to four path around the turn, spun into the lane in the five path and failed to factor. MAGIC PALACE raced towards the rear along
the inside, trailed in the two path around the turn and never got involved. ANGORA DEB stalked two wide, chased between horses around the turn and
weakened entering the lane. TWO WORDS tracked along the inside and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
BRAGANZA vied two wide while tugging well in the bit, pulled clear entering the turn, then drew off through the lane under mild urging. NAPA CANDY set
the pace inside of a vying rival, proved no match for that one entering the turn, yet held place well to remain clear of show through the final furlong. JOKE
SISI (CHI) took a bump from an outer rival at the start, tracked the top pair from the three path into the turn, was urged along in pursuit from the two path
around the turn, spun into the lane in the four path, but failed to sustain a bid. CHIQUITA MOSCA broke inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of
the pace along the inside, lagged behind around the turn, yet ran on with late interest in the final furlong. BATUCADA tossed his head at the start while last
away, laid off of the pace three wide, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and failed to menace thereafter. SKRATCH KAT laid off of the pace along the inside
and faded.

Footnotes
SCOTLAND broke half a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, led
entering the final sixteenth and held off an outer challenger late. CAGLIOSTRO broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five
path approaching the five sixteenths pole, fanned seven wide entering the lane, yet rallied outside of rivals in the final furlong, ranged up to the leader to
offer a late bid, but missed and never got past in the gallop-out. HEROIC MOVE stalked three wide, took aim from the five path entering the lane, but lugged
in on his left lead while offering a bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer bidder nearing the final sixteenth, then
yielded late but held show. ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN got a bit antsy awaiting the start, pursued from midpack four wide, got outkicked by an inner rival while
being floated six wide entering the lane, then chased evenly between horses thereafter. LOYAL COMPANY raced forwardly two wide and between horses,
shifted out to the four path while chasing behind the leaders and hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over entering the final furlong, but lacked
a bid. TEJAS dropped back after breaking well, saved ground far back, shifted outwardly in midstretch and moved up in the final furlong. GILCREASE was
briefly fractious in the starting gate, stalked along the inside, but lacked a rail bid before tiring late. BOURBON BASH pressed two wide, vied in the three
path around the turn, led in hand turning for home in the four path, but failed to maintain a clear margin in upper stretch, got headed by an outer foe at the
furlong grounds and faltered between horses. ITZOS stuttered a step at the start but recovered quickly, set the pace in the two path, got headed by an outer
vying rival at the five sixteenths pole and weakened between horses in upper stretch. SEEKING UNITY bumped the outer half of the gate while breaking
outwardly, lacked speed in the four to three path around the turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
MISSION OF JOY broke a touch outwardly, prompted outside of the top pair before stalking behind them from the inside entering the first turn, pursued
comfortably from the pocket around the far turn, muscled her way outside of the leader while bumping an outer GIRL NAMED CHARLIE in upper stretch,
offered a bold bid while menacing well in hand, led confidently leaving the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear at the furlong grounds and safely fended off an
inner bidder through the late stages while under moderate handling. PAPILIO (IRE) laid off of the pace in the two path, but was blocked behind rivals in the
three path in upper stretch, tipped inwardly and split foes at the furlong grounds after the leader got a jump, then chased the foe home well to prove second
best. MRS. ASTOR broke half a beat slow, trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, shifted out to the five to six path in upper
stretch and stayed on to gain show in the final sixteenth. MISS RIDDLER broke a bit outwardly, set the pace along the inside, got headed passing the three
sixteenths pole, proved no match for that one nearing the furlong grounds and weakened. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE pressed two wide, but was bumped by
an inner rival before failing to keep pace in upper stretch and gave way. SABALENKA laid off of the pace in the three path, inched closer three wide around
the far turn, but floated four wide entering the lane and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
GUNITE tracked along the inside, loomed a danger while laying patient behind the leading trio around the turn, took aim four wide entering the lane as a
leading BANGO edged clear, sustained a grinding charge to offer a bid outside of that one in the final furlong, then drove past at the sixteenth pole and drew
clear. BANGO stalked three wide, vied around the turn, led entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, changed leads approaching the furlong grounds
as an outer GUNITE menaced, but was bested by that one with a sixteenth to go. TEJANO TWIST lagged behind in the two to three path, swung to the six
path in upper stretch, rallied to gain show leaving the furlong grounds and chased the top pair home to prove best of the rest. SIBELIUS rushed after a
flat-footed beginning to prompt the leader from the inside, decided to shift outside of that one approaching the half mile pole, vied two wide and between
horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart entering the lane and gave way. STRAVA set the pace two wide, cleared to the rail
at the half mile pole, vied with an outer pair of bidders around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, shifted inwardly at the furlong grounds and held sway from a pair of outer chasers thereafter. MENDELSSOHNS
MARCH took a bump from an outer rival at the start, stalked along the inside, bid up a vacated rail nearing the far turn, vied with a pair of outer rivals around
that bend, but was outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane, sparred with DESERT DUKE for place thereafter and held that position late. DESERT
DUKE veered in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked the leader from the four to three path around the first turn, inched closer and vied three wide around
the far turn, but was offered little resistance to the eventual winner's outer challenge nearing the lane, sparred for place with an inner foe thereafter, but was
kept at bay for that position. SCOOBIE QUANDO transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside while just off of
the inner railing, but only managed to chase through the lane while lacking a bid. SHARAR bobbled shortly after the start, lacked speed while hung in the
five path around the first turn, raced towards the rear in the four to five path around the far turn and failed to menace. J. P. RACE broke a step slow before
being bumped and put to crowded quarters by an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, then between horses around the far turn,
successfully maneuvered around traffic entering the lane but failed to factor. LAZARUS set the pace with his ears pricked while remaining off of the rail
around the first turn, which allowed for an inner rival to offer a bid approaching the far turn, vied two wide and between horses around that bend but
weakened entering the lane.

IDIOMATIC set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer presser before meeting SIXTYTHREECAILIBER's challenge entering the lane, yet swiftly
repelled that foe in upper stretch, inched clear and held sway through the final furlong. SIXTYTHREECALIBER stalked three wide, ranged up around the far
turn to offer a bid entering the lane, but was quickly turned away in upper stretch, then held place from an outer rival in the final sixteenth. FROST POINT
hopped at the start, trailed two wide, moved out of last in the three path around the far turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and stayed on to gain show
in the final furlong. MOON SWAG popped open the gate pre-race without leaving it, then broke a step slow at the start, laid off of the pace three wide,
inched closer under urging four wide turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. HIDDEN CONNECTION bobbled at the start, pressed two wide, but
yielded between horses turning for home. SOUL OF AN ANGEL broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, trailed leaving the three furlong pole and was
outrun thereafter. TRAVEL COLUMN stalked along the inside while briefly keen around the first turn, but chased the leaders while failing to sustain position
around the far turn and faded entering the lane.

SET PIECE (GB) trailed two wide, inched closer in the three path around the far turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane, rallied with a clear GET
SMOKIN to catch in midstretch, reeled in that foe at the sixteenth pole and edged away. GET SMOKIN set the pace via a clear margin, showed the way in
hand as foes subtly closed in, shook away once again in upper stretch, remained clear before flopping back to his left lead inside the final furlong, but was
caught entering the final sixteenth and held place. HARLAN ESTATE hopped slightly at the start, saved ground off of the pace, trailed around the far turn,
spun into the lane in the three path, tipped inwardly in midstretch to produce a rail rally in the final furlong, gained show in the final sixteenth before tipping
two wide, but did not have enough to reach place. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY stalked two wide, moved to press the leader turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with that one in upper stretch and yielded between horses in the final furlong. ROYAL PATRONAGE (FR) pursued from midpack three wide, chased in
upper stretch, but flopped back to his left lead while getting outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. KENTUCKY GHOST tracked
along the inside, pursued patiently from the pocket around the far turn, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before weakening through the final
furlong.

RATTLE N ROLL saved ground off of the pace, advanced to a stalking position at the five furlong pole, awaited racing room turning for home while getting
outmoved by an outer bidding CALL ME FIRST, gracefully slipped through along the inside while bumping with a foe and the inner rail in upper stretch,
shifted out and rallied with a clear aforementioned foe to catch in midstretch, reeled in that rival in the final sixteenth and edged clear. CALL ME FAST
brushed the outer half of the gate while last away, laid off of the pace in the three path, circled foes with a four wide rush turning for home to lead in the five
path entering the lane, quickly drove clear in upper stretch, maintained a margin through midstretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth before lasting for
place. HAPPY AMERICAN broke a step slow, trailed in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, rallied to gain show in midstretch and
chased the top pair home to prove best of the rest. BARBER ROAD set the pace along the inside, vied with a trio of bidders turning for home, got headed by
his outermost challenger while shifting off the fence entering the lane, bumped with a rail skimming foe in upper stretch, got subtly herded out by that foe at
the three sixteenths pole and bumped an outer rival in the aftermath, then yielded to the top trio at the furlong grounds before holding fourth. SANTIN
pressed two wide, vied between horses turning for home, but was herded outwardly by the early pace setter entering the lane causing contact with an outer
PIONEER OF MEDINA while getting outkicked by an outer bidder, then transferred contact from his inner counterpart to once again bump PIONEER OF
MEDINA inside the three sixteenths pole and yielded. PIONEER OF MEDINA tracked in midpack two wide, shifted out entering the backstretch, was urged
to pressing position three wide around the far turn, but was outmoved by an outer bidder while being bumped by an inner foe entering the lane, took contact
from that foe again inside the final three sixteenths and faded. COOKE CREEK tracked three wide, but yielded with nine sixteenths to go and made little
impact thereafter. MASQUEPARADE stalked behind the leader and from the two path, pursued between horses approaching the far turn, awaited racing
room turning for home, but remained blocked behind rivals entering the lane and failed to factor.

Footnotes
AMERICAN RETRO bumped with an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of that pressing foe, drew clear in upper stretch and lasted safely from an
outer on-charging foe late. LITTLE PRANKSTER was reluctant to load, pursued from midpack in the three path around the turn, gained four wide entering
the lane, rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds, then cut into the clear leader's margin but did not have enough to reel that one in. METHODOLOGY
bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed that foe from the outside, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, lost place to an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds, then vied for show between horses thereafter and prevailed. NO GUILT tracked along the inside, vied for show with outer rivals while chasing
leaving the furlong grounds, but narrowly missed that position. SNOW PRINCESS stalked three wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival for place in
midstretch, vied for show soon after, but tired late. MIRUS made little impact from the four path. COMMENCEMENT broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in
the two path and faded. VOSTRA hopped at the start and was off slow, then got outrun.
