Footnotes
DIXIE PENNY sat back in the opening quarter then crept up three wide to engage rivals midway around the turn, got carried out wide heading into the
stretch run, dueled with JAZZ BRUNCH down the lane, dug in under firm handling and edged away. JAZZ BRUNCH raced three wide just off the top pair up
the backstretch, moved up to challenge for the lead with three furlongs left to run, dueled around the turn, drifted out heading into upper stretch, battled on
with DIXIE PENNY into final stages and got denied nearing the wire. CHAMPAGNE BLING settled off the pace up the backstretch then urged to picked up
the tempo mid-way around the turn, was forced to go wide heading into the lane, came back in a couple paths, sustained bid and cleared show. BOLD
LEGEND tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner entering the stretch run, moved up into strong contention at the eighth pole but failed to sustain
bid. GLAMOROUS LIFE was off a step slow at the start and continued in the back, hustled along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
NOSTALGIA set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled around the turn, battled back into upper stretch then gave way. UNHERDOF pressed the
early pace, dueled late on the backstretch, weakened mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
OUR LAST CHANCE broke sharp, cleared and crossed over to the inside soon after the start, continued to lead the way up the backstretch, came under
some inside pressure from GRAND DESIGN entering the turn, turned back bid then repelled bid from KINGSWOOD near the quarter pole, roused for more
in upper stretch, responded willingly, pulled away and finished in hand late. GRAND DESIGN came away last at the start then advanced up the inside into
close contention, made a move for the leader entering the turn, lacked racing room along the rail, waited and steadied slightly, cut the corner then tipped two
wide in upper stretch, sustained bid and finished second best. KINGSWOOD raced two wide in contention up the backstretch, made a move for the leader
nearing the quarter pole, could not reach the eventual winner, ran on into upper stretch then weakened and held show. JAYSKER raced three wide in range
of the pacesetter, came under a ride around the turn, failed to kick on, stayed on three to four wide down the lane and just missed show.

WARREN L was allowed to settle in early stages and raced in the back along the inside, tipped out and moved up into striking distance late on the
backstretch, dueled with SHOULDABOUGHTABAR around the turn, swung four wide into the lane, ran on gamely in pursuit of the aforementioned leader,
dug in determinedly and edged by late. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR held a clear lead around the first turn then set a pressured pace up the backstretch,
dueled with WARREN L around the far turn, cut the corner and shook free at the head of the lane, led the way into the final furlong then got worn down in
final strides. OCEAN OF STORMS raced in contention around the first turn and stalked in close range up the backstretch, urged for more entering the far
turn, failed to move on with the top duo, kept under a drive into the lane, weakened off the top pair and stayed on for a share. LEA ME BE raced up close
through the backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and faltered through the lane.

into the lane and kept clear under steady encouragement. A J'S RIDE vied four wide to the half mile marker then got overtaken by the eventual winner,
remained in close contention, launched a bid for the leader around the turn, sustained bid down the lane and cleared second best. DREAM STREAK vied
along the inside to the half mile marker then got overtaken by the eventual winner, continued in range along the rail on the turn, cut the corner then tipped
two wide and cleared the rest. SABRIA raced off the top flight in the opening quarter, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
ASK FOR BODE raced between rivals in a compact flight in the early going then sat just off the front runners entering the turn, picked up the tempo near the
quarter pole, swung four wide into the stretch run, advanced in tandem with SAIILOR CHOW, dueled into final stages and got up late. SAILOR CHOW rated
along the outside in the opening quarter, let out a notch and loomed closer at the quarter pole, advanced in tandem with ASK FOR BODE in the final
furlong, dueled in deep stretch and just missed. COCO BRAVADO vied for the lead in a compact field up the backstretch, held a slight edge around the turn,
dug in for more in upper stretch, led by a narrow margin at the eighth pole then got overtaken by charging outside duo. FLY FIRST CLASS vied in opening
stages then edged back into tracking position, waited patiently along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and produced a mild bid.
BARSTOW was off slow at the start and trailed in the back, swung wide losing ground entering the lane and showed late interest. HIGHER AUTHORITY
raced off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane and failed to rally. LIVINGONTULSATIME raced up close in the opening quarter, flattened around the
turn and had no late response. WESTA WAVERLY vied for the lead up the backstretch, battled on around the turn then came up empty at the head of the
lane.

AIN'T LIFE GRAND was taken in hand and allowed to settle out of the gate, raced two wide into the first turn, remained unhurried up the backstretch, let out
a notch entering the far turn, quickly advanced into close contention, swept by to clear command in upper stretch, responded willingly, drew off and finished
in hand. PALUXY was unhurried and raced off the early pace, given cue five wide nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into the lane, was no match for
pulling away winner but finished clearly second best. ITS A WRAP rated off the pace up the backstretch, edged closer along the rail late on the far turn, cut
the corner and gained position, churned on and secured a share. BUCK MOON set a pressured pace around the first turn and vied for the lead up the
backstretch, held a slight edge late on the far turn, got overtaken entering the lane and gave way. JOE FRAZIER pressed the pace around the first turn,
dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle around the far turn then tired in the drive. MUNQAD stalked the top pair three wide, failed to advance when
called upon midway around the far turn and retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
CRYPTO MO held a clear lead around the first turn, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge from BROKEN HEARTS BAY near
the quarter pole, roused for more, had more left in reserve, held off aforementioned rival down the lane and finished clear. BROKEN HEARTS BAY settled
back and raced three wide entering the first turn, rated off the pace in early stages, let out a notch and began to edge up closer late on the backstretch,
crept up two wide to challenge CRYPTO MO at the quarter pole, raced in striking distance into the final furlong, could not reach the winner but finished
clearly second best. FLIRTING GIRL stalked the clear leader up the backstretch, remained in contention and saved ground on the rail around the far turn,
tipped two wide for the drive and churned on for a share. DON'T GET PICKLED tracked the pace in early stages, hustled up two to three wide around the
far turn, failed to kick on and faded through the lane. OUR DAVINA rated off the early pace, failed to move on when called upon and faded through the lane.
ARIZONA KALEI broke rein in the first turn, taken to the outside, pulled up and walked off.

CINCO DE MO dueled four deep in early stages, battled on three wide around the turn, remained in striking distance in upper stretch, dug in determinedly,
collared the leader in the final furlong and edged away. LUCKY AIN'T ENOUGH dueled two wide between rivals in a compact flight, edged back mid-way
around the turn, launched a four wide rebid at the head of the lane, responded under firm handling and finished well. FRANKLYGREAT vied inside of rivals
for the lead in early stages, battled on around the turn, held a slight edge past the final furlong then got overtaken by the inner and weakened to show.
BILLY BOB ROCKET raced near midpack, hustled along four wide around the turn, swung five wide into the lane and had a mild improve.
MADETHEDEAN'SLIST dueled for the early lead racing three deep, battled on between foes around the turn then weakened in the lane. GOLD TAPPER
broke in at the start then tugged under restraint near the inside, steadied along the backstretch, settled and saved ground around the turn then had nothing
left in the lane. PRIZED TAP hopped and got carried in at the start, raced off the pace, swung wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BAD BOY BRAWNY
lacked early speed, came three wide into the lane and never menaced.
