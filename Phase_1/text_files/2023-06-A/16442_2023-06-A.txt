Footnotes
RUDA raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside into the stretch, took over and kicked clear. ROMANTIC FANTASY
steadied leaving the chute, trailed the field, saved ground throughout, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied in the two path and finished well for second.
INFLUENTIALOUS broke outward, set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner turning for home, yielded,
then dug in to the end. CAPTURE MY DREAMS raced off the pace with an inside trip and failed to rally. HEART LIGHT raced off the pace, moved up two
wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. JUDGEMENT TIME stalked the pacesetter, chased on the far turn and tired. SHERRY ORIENTAL raced off the
pace, went three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. GINETTES ON FIRE pulled on the inside, steadied entering the far turn, settled off the pace and
gave way.

Footnotes
SHEA ON THE LAM set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, responded when roused and was kept to the task in the lane. BODONTKNOW
chased three wide, continued three wide on the turn and rallied for second. VEGAS PLAYBOY chased between rivals early on, raced inside on the turn and
finished evenly for third. KING SHARK chased the winner early on, continued two wide on the turn and faded. LITTLE BANKER MAN chased on the inside
and gave way. BOY IS IT HOT was off slowly, dropped far back early and was outrun. DISCREET MAGIC raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn,
failed to threaten, then veered out sharply in deep stretch and lost the rider, walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the incident in deep stretch, the race
was declared official.
