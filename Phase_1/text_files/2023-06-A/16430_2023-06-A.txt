Footnotes
STATUS SEEKER raced between foes into the turn, drafted professionally in the two path going around the bend, was asked three wide into the stretch,
swapped to the proper lead under a strong hand-ride outside the furlong marker, gained on the pacesetter coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under
strong handling to prevail. PERMED broke very fast, showed the way in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked at the top of the stretch,
was given one pop of a right-handed crop into the final furlong then switched to a left-handed crop, led into the final seventy yards but was caught while well
clear for the place. MAGIC EIGHT BALL was hustled from the gate, raced inside of two opponents while tight against the rail into the turn, hugged the fence
while saving ground in a good striking position going around that bend, dropped back under urging into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the
show. RAICHU was hustled from the gate, moved up on the outside, vied four then three wide on the turn, chased the runner-up in the four path into the
stretch and tired. JUST THE OAKS was awkwardly into stride then dropped back, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and was no factor.
TALAVERA dropped back off the pace, traveled around the turn in the three path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TAP IT UP two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, inched away in the late stages
safely in front to the finish. DIAMOND STATUS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch,
offered up a mild kick to be along for the place honors. VOLATILITY saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing in the two path with
five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared with a sixteenth to go
and was outfinished in the late stages while safely preserving the show honors. WONDER GIRL raced three to four wide in aim of the front, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. CANT KEEP ME DOWN coaxed from the gate, established the
front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under pressure half a mile from home and clung to the front from a pair of
rivals through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in overwhelmed by a host of rivals a furlong out and yielded the front just outside that
juncture, then weakened in the late stages. GERMANY JAYVO tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route
into upper stretch, made no impact. SOLEVO SPRITZ coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before advancing to apply
pressure with half a mile to run, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded. Please note WONDER GIRL
ran with no hind shoes requiring her to run for purse money only. Also note, that the seven-eighths split was omitted pending review.

Footnotes
SON OF AN EX settled off the pace, moved out near the five-eighths pole then was roused around the nine-sixteenths, gained to make a bid with a half-mile
to run, took the lead in the three path at the seven-sixteenths, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, responded well while remaining clear into the final
furlong, drifted out under a left-handed crop from that point into the final sixteenth and held while placed under a hand-ride late. SOUTH STREET broke
through the front of the gate prior to the start, had his saddle adjusted after being brought back around behind the gate, was loaded in his stall then had a
his bridle replaced without the rider aboard before being backed out again, had the rider climb aboard and was reloaded a final time, was asked to move up
between foes early, advanced to set a joint pace on the inside of an opponent, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused for more near the five-sixteenths,
dropped back outside the quarter-pole, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the stretch but missed while clear for the place. BOYS CODE settled well behind
the rest of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and narrowly earned the show. ASAP RESTORATION showed
speed on the outside, set a joint pace on the outside of a foe, was asked between rivals in the two path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole,
came four wide into upper stretch and tired then just missed the show. FLUTE MASTER was well placed just off the pace, went two then three wide whiled
asked on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, raced between foes from that point into the final furlong and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MELTING SNOW broke on top and raced forwardly placed seven paths off the inside before advancing tucked six wide to duel with MON PETIT CHOU to
her inside with five and a half furlongs remaining, knocked heads through the turn coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and was ridden out to the finish. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE along the inside briefly,
tipped out to chase three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one
while keeping on to secure the place honors. GAME THEORY bobbled at the break, raced just off the inside briefly before being tipped to the four path five
and a half furlong from home, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. J D'S VISTA sluggish early on, grew detached at the tail of the field when briefly six wide, tucked to the two
path with six furlongs to run, went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly passing tired rivals. MON PETIT CHOU hustled from the gate, led early on before being engaged in head to head combat five and a half furlongs
from home by MELTING SNOW to her outside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route at
the quarter pole before tipping to the three path straightened away into upper stretch in behind MELTING SNOW when shaken off and weakened to the
finish. RUN DEVIL five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch, tired. HAPPY
SOPHIA five paths off the inside briefly, tucked to the two path with five and a half furlongs to run, came under coaxing tucked inside midway on the turn,
went just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NOW SHOWING went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when set down
into upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker, fought on when challenged by the runner-up at the sixteenth-pole, lost the lead just prior
to the finish but won the head-bob at the line and narrowly prevailed. RIVER TAY (IRE) bumped with a rival while off a step slow, moved up on the outside,
was asked in the four path on the turn, chased outside under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid into the final sixteenth, gained the slimmest of
advantages just before the finish but was out-nodded on the line and denied while clear for the place. LINARITE settled off the pace, was roused while
moving from the rail to the two path on the turn, angled out into upper stretch then came a bit further out and finished with good energy to garner the show.
BELLESHAZZA tracked the pace, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick then
missed the show. NIGHTSABER (GB) was rated just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and weakened. GRACEFUL settled off the pace, was roused while inside on the turn, angled out into upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. LEXI'S SPIRIT bumped with a rival while off near the rear then was taken up with the left rein, raced at the back while eager under restraint, was
let out two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained some but failed to impact. BOUNTY KILLAH settled off the pace, moved
from the two path to the four path on the turn and failed to threaten. MY INNER VOICE dropped back on the outside while slow into stride, went three wide
on the turn and was no factor.

MONDEGO (GB) three then two wide into the first turn, tucked inside to track along the inside from just off the pace, tipped to the two path three furlongs
from home and remained under a rating hold behind the leader LOVE ME NOT nearing the quarter pole, angled out four to five wide into upper stretch
called upon straightened away, rallied to engage the front a furlong out, took over command just inside the sixteenth marker, then dug in and held on to
prevail over a fast closing rival on the line. CLEVER THOUGHT crossed directly to the two path just after the start and raced just off the inside through the
opening bend before taking to the three path down the backstretch, tucked back to be just off the inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish to close with a rush outside but missed at the end. MERCANTE four then
three wide into the first turn, tracked the front three wide from in range, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to collar the leader a furlong out, knocked heads with that rival when caught by the eventual winner just inside the sixteenth pole and ran on to
preserve the show honors on the wire. LOVE ME NOT just off the inside through the first turn, attended the leader from the outside in the four path down the
backstretch before tucking to the two path half a mile from home, steadily advanced on that rival now applying pressure and took over the front near the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on to the finish. C'EST
MAGNIFIQUE three wide into the first turn, tucked inside through most of that bend before tracking just off the inside down the backstretch, went back to the
rail through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was
outkicked. JUNGFRAU three wide through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before going four wide through the far turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. REGAL KINGDOM coaxed from the gate, saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no headway. GAME CHANGE
three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and came up
empty. BILLIEVE IN JOSH stumbled at the start and recovered to show the way pulling keenly on the bit through the first turn as the rider attempted to
restrain him, settled showing the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch, came under pressure into the far turn and yielded the front with
five-sixteenths to run, spun along the inside route into upper stretch and tired. MAYFIELD STRONG four then three wide through the first turn, chased four
then three wide coming under coaxing in retreat at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATING CARA prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead near the seven-sixteenths, shook clear in the two path with three furlongs to run,
responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, remained clear into the final sixteenth and just held. HALO CITY settled on the outside, was
roused three then four wide on the turn, chased outside into the final furlong, gained in the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. ITS
COLD IN DEHERE bumped with a rival at the start then was in tight between foes, settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, was asked
while four then three wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and weakened while clear for the show. GRINGOTTS came in
slightly at the start then brushed with a foe, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue at the half-mile pole, chased three then two wide on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired then drifted out around the sixteenth-pole. TRIPLE P broke out then bumped lightly with an opponent, was rated
between foes, dropped back some while placed under tighter restraint outside the three-quarter pole, was urged in the two path early on the turn then
moved to the three path, shifted five wide late on that bend and came up empty. VALLARAND brushed the outside of the gate at the start, set the pace with
company to her outside, lost the lead while inside early on the turn and faded. SHE'S GOT GAME bumped with rivals at the start then was taken up while in
tight between foes, was rated off the pace, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths and faltered. THISLADYIS THE LAW brushed the inside of
the gate then stumbled awkwardly after going a stride, lagged at the rear, drifted out late on the backstretch, went five to six wide on the turn and was no
factor.

JUAN VALDEZ saved ground on the first turn, was unhurried while reserved towards the rear, raced between foes in the two path on the far turn, was asked
for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. AMERICAN HUSTLE moved in early while taken under a tight hold, threw his head while
becoming rank on the initial straightaway, was hard held in the two to three path going around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, was let
out in the two path on the far turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, turned into the stretch between foes, chased into the final furlong and came up
empty. ROCKSTAR RED moved in while going to the front, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked
while inside on the far turn, lost the lead near the quarter-pole and gave way.
