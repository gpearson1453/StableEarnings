Footnotes
CALL THE CAVALRY bobbled shortly after the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came through a rail opening to make a bid into upper
stretch, shook clear while asked for his best inside the three-sixteenths and proved much the best under a hand-ride while flagged with a right-handed crop.
ROCK STAR BOY was hustled from the gate then chased the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths,
turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, lost touch with the winner inside the three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead until outside the
sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead when thrown in by the rider to encourage that switch at juncture and determinedly earned the place. EVERY
FOUR YEARS was bumped soundly at the start, chased the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, pursued the winner while outside in the drive,
fought with the runner-up for the place and just missed that position while clear for the show. DREW D'ORO broke out and bumped soundly with a rival,
went to the front, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, lost the advantage into the stretch and faded. REAPPLY brushed the inside
of the gate at the start, dropped well behind, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
HANG TIGHT got brushed at the start by UNION LIGHTS, who broke inwards, settled in pursuit two then three wide at the tail of the field, grew detached
from the main body of the field into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
steadily gaining on embattled rivals up front, collared the lot seventy yards from home and prevailed edging away at the end. CUMBERLAND BLUES four
then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in heads apart for command to the
sixteenth pole, ran on to secure the place honors. CHEEKY TICO led early on before being displaced by UNION LIGHTS to the inside, prompted that rival
from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, rallied to take command between rivals
just inside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and was caught seventy yards from home and kept on to preserve the show honors. MO REWARDS coaxed
from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in behind foes and tipped out to the five path a furlong from home, then weakened to the finish. UNION LIGHTS broke in at the start brushing
HANG TIGHT, came under coaxing and advanced to be forwardly placed before taking over command seven furlongs out, showed the way in hand along
the inside under some pressure from CHEEKY TICO to the outside, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch under
threat, dug in under challenge and relented just inside the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish.

Footnotes
LEDDY was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, made a bid in the three path while between foes at
the quarter-pole, fought inside of the runner-up into the final furlong, shook clear under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the
best while placed under a hand-ride in the final sixteenth. THREE TWO ZONE settled off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, gained in the four
path to take a short lead into upper stretch, battled outside of the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while able to get the place. JALEN
JOURNEY was urged along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then
missed the place while clear for the show. PRINTRACK went to the front, vied inside on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage in
the two path into upper stretch and gave way. MOTION TO STRIKE broke in and bobbled while off a bit slow then was taken up while recovering, moved up
to race just off the pace then was taken under a stout hold while tugging very hard on the bit, remained eager under vigorous restraint behind the leader
while inside on the turn, was let out some at the five-sixteenths, waited coming to the quarter-pole, had a hole open along the fence into the stretch,
steadied when that hole tightened near the three-sixteenths, continued to steady behind the tiring pacesetter until near the furlong marker then finally moved
out and had nothing left in a tough journey.

LET FREEDOM SPRING established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand from the two path briefly before being engaged on the front just
inside five furlongs to run by GINNSU WARRIOR to the outside, tucked inside through the turn knocking heads with his main pace rival and came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. CENTRAL PRIDE coaxed from the gate,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick and was just up for the
place honors in the final jumps. GINNSU WARRIOR three wide in pursuit early on, advanced inside five furlongs remaining to duel outside of LET
FREEDOM SPRING through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off nearing the eighth

Footnotes
STJAMES was unhurried near the rear of the field, moved from the two path to the five path on the turn, gained late on that bend, rallied outside in upper
stretch and closed strongly to get up late. STEADY SCHEMING was last to commence then reserved off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn,
rallied to the lead in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY was
reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, was held up behind horses from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths then
checked off heels, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker and finished willingly for the show. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE went
to the front, showed the way on the inside through solid fractions, was asked at the quarter-pole then lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought inside of the
winner into the final furlong and weakened. NIEUWENDYK settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid in upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SHAKIN THE BELLE showed speed between foes then tracked the pace, traveled around the turn in the two
path and came up empty. PEJA DU became rank under restraint outside the three-quarter pole then lost action some near that pole, continued rank under a
tight hold, took an awkward stride near the half-mile pole then dropped back, checked near the five-sixteenths and capitulated. GLOBALIZATION settled at
the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn and showed little. ETERNAL GLORY showed speed between foes then was rated off the pace, dropped
back three then four wide on the turn, checked while falling out of contention near the five-sixteenths then moved to the five path and faltered.

rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady handling. MORE THAN WORK
rounded the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path on the far turn, took the lead into upper stretch,
inched away coming to the furlong marker, was quickly collared by the winner inside that marker and proved no match late while able to get the place.
BORN A GAMBLER was rated just off the pace on the inside, moved to the two path under some urging around the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into the
stretch, pursued the leader into the final sixteenth and weakened while able to get the show. BLAME D RULE MAKER hit the outside of the gate at the start,
went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the outside under a strong hold, raced three wide while let out on the far turn, came five wide
into the stretch, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and also weakened. PARQUETRY went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off
the pace, shifted from the two path to the four path while asked on the far turn, turned five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. URBAN
MYTH bumped soundly with a foe into the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was rated just off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, raced
inside on the far turn, came out under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. NO REGARD went to the front, rounded the first turn in
the two path, showed the way while in hand, vied inside on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way.
PENNER ASH (IRE) was last to commence, traveled three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, shifted from three to five wide on the far turn,
dropped to the four path near the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. WINNING CONNECTION bumped soundly with a rival nearing the first turn then
checked, saved ground on that bend, lagged at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, came out near the quarter-pole and was eased but walked
off.
