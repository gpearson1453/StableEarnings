Footnotes
SEVENTEEN BLACK was asked to show speed leaving the break and was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent fractions through the
backstretch run, ran in pursuit of DEO to the quarter marker, was given his cue at the top of the lane, overtook DEO at mid-stretch, kept to task under firm
hand urging into the final sixteenth and pulled clear at the finish. ACERO tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, tracked the pacesetter
outside of a rival through the backstretch run, was roused three wide along the far turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, came within aim at the
furlong marker, could not keep pace with SEVENTEEN BLACK in the late stages and ran on to secure second. DEO showed good early speed and
assumed command in the early stages, set solid fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, showed the way to the quarter marker, came
under pressure at mid-stretch, could not hold off SEVENTEEN BLACK leaving the furlong pole, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for
second, while just holding for third. KERRY GOLD bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, settled off of the decent early pace while saving ground,
was coaxed along two wide into the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into the drive, offered a mild late rally in the stretch and just missed for third.
DAZZLE THE COMMAND settled just off of the early pace, was a bit keen into the first turn and tracked the leaders into the backstretch run, maintained his
position to the half-mile pole, slipped to the rail heading to the second turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid into the
stretch and gave way. CANTILEVER bobbled at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed, was steered three wide into the far turn, swung four wide
into the drive and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
GULARA was crowded at the start by R HEART OF GOLD and was away a bit slowly, rated nicely off of the decent early pace, came in tight entering the
turn and steadied at the three-furlong marker, angled four wide into the drive, improved position at mid-stretch, rallied in deep stretch and held the runner-up
at bay in the final strides to prevail in a good debut. MIGHTY RULER broke out at the start but broke best and was forwardly placed early on, conceded the
lead and tracked the decent pace into the turn, ran in pursuit while two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was able to match strides with
GULARA to deep stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final stages and was outfinished, while besting the rest. R HEART OF GOLD broke
in at the start and crowded GULARA , was sent to the early lead and set decent fractions into the turn, extended the lead heading to the quarter marker,
raced in hand into upper stretch, kept to task to the furlong grounds, could not hold off the oncoming top pair inside of the sixteenth-marker and held safely
at the end for third. DARK MYSTERY chased the decent early pace, raced three wide outside of rivals along the turn, lost ground into upper stretch,
re-rallied in the final furlong and offered a mild late bid. MAJOR TOM chased the decent early pace, was outrun along the turn while two wide and tired in
the stretch. NICKEY BIRD was prominent in the early running, chased the pace to the turn, dropped back along the bend and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
OUR BOLD PRINCE was prominent in the early going and dueled for the early lead with HANDR'SDREAM, pressed the quick pace along the turn while
outside of that rival, lost a bit of ground into upper stretch, re-rallied at mid-stretch and confronted HANDR'SDREAM at the furlong marker, determinedly
dueled with that foe to deep stretch and surged in the final strides to prevail over the game runner-up. HANDR'SDREAM was asked to show speed leaving
the break and assumed command in the early stages, dueled with OUR BOLD PRINCE to the turn then took a narrow lead on that rival into the bend, set
solid fractions while pressured to the quarter pole, shook free in upper stretch, was quickly re-engaged by OUR BOLD PRINCE nearing the furlong pole,
battled gamely to deep stretch, could not hold off the winner's late surge in the final strides and bested the rest. HORSE DOCTOR was forwardly placed in
the early running then took back to track the quick early pace, gained ground three deep on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch, could not match
strides with the top pair in the final furlong, was outkicked in deep stretch and just held for third. SHOT OF A LIFETIME tracked the fast early pace from the
inside, saved ground along the turn, advanced in upper stretch, offered a mild bid in the final stages and just missed for third. DR PESCADO tracked the
solid early pace, chased two wide along the turn, was coaxed three wide into the drive, lost ground at mid-stretch, ran evenly in the final stages and lacked a
final response. AWESOME DUDE a bit slow into stride early on, settled at the rear heading to the turn, raced four wide into the stretch and did not factor.
LOVE CANDY chased the quick early pace, raced between rivals into the turn, slipped to the rail along the bend, was asked for run three wide into the
stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but did not threaten.

Footnotes
NIGHT PROOF broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run while tracking the solid fractions,
inched closer while saving ground on the second turn, was roused two wide into the drive, overtook ROISTER inside of the furlong marker and drew away in
the final sixteenth. SIPPIN N KISSIN settled off of the quick early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run, moved up while two wide on the far turn, was
roused three wide into the stretch, continued to advance and came within aim at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with NIGHT PROOF in the final
stages, was outkicked and ran on in deep stretch to secure second. ROISTER was sent leaving the start and disputed the early pace into the first turn,
shook free along the backstretch run and set solid fractions to the half-mile marker, showed the way to the quarter pole, was confronted by NIGHT PROOF
nearing the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner into deep stretch, weakened in the final stages and was outfinished for second, while well
clear at the end for third. OH GREAT (IRE) contested the solid early pace, prompted the pacesetter through the backstretch run, kept attendance to
ROISTER to the quarter marker, lost position into upper stretch and tired in the drive. HARBOR ABBEY bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly,
was unhurried in the early stages, trailed to the far turn and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
TESSA (GB) tracked the fast early pace, was well positioned while outside of rivals heading to the turn, loomed three wide at the quarter marker then was
steered four wide into the lane, overtook PERKINS nearing the furlong marker, took command into the final furlong, drew away in deep stretch and was
hand ridden to the finish as much the best. ANNA'S MUSIC chased the fast early pace, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker, gained ground
and came within aim approaching the furlong pole, was no match for TESSA in the final furlong and bested the rest. SURFLINE chased from the second
flight, saved ground along the turn, swung three wide for the drive, finished evenly and ran on in the late stages to secure third. PERKINS broke alertly and
showed good early speed, was engaged by GOLDEN PRAYER and contested the pace with that rival into the turn, dueled for pace duties with GOLDEN
PRAYER along the bend, shook free into upper stretch, was collared by TESSA nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. ALFONSIA
chased the fast early pace, raced two wide along the turn and did not factor in the stretch. GOLDEN PRAYER was forwardly placed in the early stages,
pulled on the rider and disputed the pace into the turn, pressed PERKINS to the quarter marker, lost position into upper stretch and tired in the drive.
STORMY ROUGE stumbled sharply leaving the start and spotted the field several lengths in the early stages, raced far behind into the turn, was eased
through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
SMART KITTEN settled in the second flight in the early going, was well placed through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and
advanced to come within aim at the quarter marker, tipped two wide into upper stretch, made a mild gain heading to the furlong marker, closed determinedly
in deep stretch, wore down BOURBON GLAZE in the late stages and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. BOURBON GLAZE was prominent leaving
the start then was sent to establish the early pace, cleared to the rail and set decent fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, opened to a
clear lead at the half-mile pole, came back to the field a bit along the second turn, was set down in upper stretch and extended the lead again heading to the
furlong pole, held foes at bay to the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by SMART KITTEN in deep stretch and was outfinished, while holding safely in the
end for second. MY YAMMY LADY was allowed to settle, raced outside of her stablemate through the backstretch run, gained ground at the quarter pole,
was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied while widest inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was up in the final
strides to secure third. TURIAF broke alertly, took back off of the early pace and stalked BOURBON GLAZE into the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground to
that rival nearing the half-mile pole, re-engaged and prompted the pace into the far turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, lost ground at the
furlong pole, weakened in the late stages and was just edged for third. CHEEKIEST bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the
early stages while saving ground, was content to trail through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and
closed willingly in the final sixteenth. HERSABIGGIRL was forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace while outside of a rival into the backstretch run, ran in
pursuit to the half-mile marker, was steered three wide into the second turn, gave way into the stretch and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
TALBOT BAY took back off of the fast early pace and tracked the leaders into the turn, gained ground while outside of rivals nearing the quarter marker,
circled the field and rallied five wide into the stretch, loomed in upper stretch and took command at the furlong marker, drove to a clear lead approaching the
sixteenth-marker and pulled away in the late stages. I'M DR. O chased the fast early pace, raced widest into the turn, inched closer while four deep nearing
the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch, could not match strides with TALBOT BAY inside of the furlong pole and was outkicked in deep stretch,
while besting the rest. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA was forwardly placed in the early running, came under a hold and took back to track the speed
approaching the turn, raced two wide between rivals along the bend, came in tight approaching the top of the stretch and was boxed in in upper stretch,
found room inside of the furlong marker, split rivals nearing the sixteenth-pole, was not able to impact the top pair in deep stretch and kept on late to secure
third. GRAZEN SUN close up in the early stages, pressed the fast pace to the turn, raced between rivals while three wide on the turn, waited for racing room
and lost ground heading to the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch and was outrun to the furlong marker, lacked a response in deep stretch and
was outfinished for third. RUNKERRY was prominent in the early running, disputed the fast pace with COMMANDER KHAI into the turn, dueled with that
rival to the quarter marker, weakened into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. SAINT IVES tracked the fast early pace from the inside, came in
tight into the turn, was boxed in at the quarter pole, lacked room into upper stretch, was blocked along the rail at mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.
COMMANDER KHAI contested the early lead with a host of rivals then assumed command into the first turn, dueled for the lead with RUNKERRY into the
turn, battled with that rival to the quarter marker while carving out fast fractions, was overtaken nearing the furlong pole and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
HALFWAY TO NOWHERE quickly sped to the front without much urging, maintained a comfortable advantage through the turn well in hand, responded
when prompted at the top of the stretch and quickened away under intermittent urging in a sparkling debut. ISABEL LUDLOW raced mid-pack down the
backstretch, stayed towards the inside, made some forward progress through the turn, took the rail path for the stretch run, had some trouble changing
leads but rallied well to get up for second. I'M A RISQUE GIRL broke sharply then angled towards the rail once clear of the rest of the field, was within
striking distance of the leaders through the turn, tipped out to the two path for the stretch run and ran on well but lost the place in the final yards. OH ANGEL
broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, bided time held up near the rear of the field down the backstretch, lacked a clear path through the turn, got
some running room in mid-stretch, responded when asked and was gaining ground in the late stages. BOBBY'S GENIE broke on top then ceded the lead to
HALFWAY TO NOWHERE, content to track to the turn, bid just past the five-sixteenths marker, could not muster the needed response and was outfinished
down the stretch. ZOE'S PRIDE close early, raced three wide into the turn, loomed a threat when asked to go after the leaders past the five-sixteenths
marker then was unable to keep up the bid down the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. GIANT KID bobbled leaving the break and was slow into
stride early, advanced on the turn while three to four wide, swung six wide into the stretch, failed to sustain that wide rally into the stretch and weakened.
GADDING bumped slightly with MOHAYHAYTHE BOLD just after the break, was hard to place in the early stages, settled down and raced three wide
through the turn then swung five wide into the stretch and finished one-paced. MOHAYHAYTHEBOLD bumped with GADDING after the break, raced near
the rear in the early going, struggled to keep up passing the half-mile marker and trailed the field to the wire.
