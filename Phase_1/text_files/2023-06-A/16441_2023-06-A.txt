Footnotes
FREEZER BURN sped to the lead taking command shortly from the gate, opened a well measured lead through the turn, widened her advantage in upper
stretch and held the closer safe at the wire. HISSY MISSY stalked the pace from three wide to the top of the lane, was set down for the drive and made
steady gains coming home but was unable to get to the winner. COSTANARMANDALEG settled into stride to be reserved off the early pace, rallied from the
back of the field leaving the quarter pole and closed belatedly to gain the show. GANGSTER RAP tracked the leaders from two wide into the turn, was
squeezed back, checking to the rear of the field, was gathered up and came again willingly in a rough trip. SHELL GAME chased the leader for a half mile
and faded. GIRONA raced five wide most of the way, angling even further out for the drive and failed to make up any ground finishing evenly.
SALACIOUSACUSATION tracked the pacesetter in the second flight along the rail and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BOSSADUSU chased the pace from the inside, then settled back heading into the bend, came out five wide then surged down the lane and was up at the
wire to prove best. DAPHNE'S FIRE was bumped at the start, then rushed up to set the pace, continued to lead the way in the early stretch but was passed
up by an outer rival in the final furlong and was second best. SIGNE chased the pace from two path down the backstretch and into the turn, rallied in the
early stretch and was able to hold onto the show prize in the end. DIAMOND GAL broke inward and bumped rival, then raced along inside, steadily slightly
entering the turn, came out six wide to rally in the stretch and finished well. THE X FACTOR was unhurried early, then moved up swiftly down the
backstretch while four wide, rallied in the early stretch but came up evenly. VALLEY VERDE chased the pace while three wide, was under a strong drive
throughout then flattened out in the stretch. DIVAESQUE stalked the pace under a hard drive while two wide, was used up leaving the turn and weakened in
late stretch. SHE'S SPELLBOUND raced behind the field while two wide and never fired. BOY CHASER moved up down the backstretch while three wide,
then bid on the turn but did no respond in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT TUB HOTTIE step slow leaving the gate, hurried up the fence to stalk just off the pacesetter, steadied off heels approaching the turn, cut the corner
turning for home and closed gamely to be up in time. HALE'S ANGEL sped to the lead in rapid fractions in a pressured pace, responded when challenged in
upper stretch and dug-in gamely down the lane but could not last. MY GOLDEN BLING broke alertly, settled to prompt the pace throughout, loomed boldly
turning for home and kept closing in the lane to just miss the top spots. TIZ HOPPIN reserved off the early pace near the rear of the field, saved ground
along the rail to rally into contention on the turn, angled out four wide for the drive and closed well to be coming late. CIDSTAYINURLAINE trailed the main
body of the field early and showed good late interest down the lane. TELLING THYME well placed to be up close early from between horses but went
evenly lacking a response when called upon. MY BABYS GONE raced wide most of the way, was forced to make his bid from five wide and flattened out in
the drive. BECKY'S TATTOO raced close up to the pacesetters from four wide and steadily faded coming home. STALEMATE was never a threat. IGNIS
dropped back early in the run down the backside, was taken in hand and eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
OLIVIA'S RACE DAY was under a steady hand ride while stalking the pace from the two path down the backstretch and throughout the far bend, then dug in
gamely to close strong down the lane and was up at the wire to prove best. JOHN LOUIS' BEVO lunged at the start, then was rank in the early backstretch,
then split rivals while moving down the back stretch and into the far turn, menaced in the early stretch, shifted to the three path then closed gamely to be up
for the place prize. TEAM GORMLEY dueled for the lead while two wide throughout the first three quarters, continued to dig in grudgingly in the final furlong
but was out finished in the end and was best for third place. IBERIAN RUNNER dueled gamely for the lead from the inside down the backstretch and
throughout the far turn, then dropped crop in the early stretch and gave way in the end. KING ARTHUR RIDGE stalked the pace from the inside, rallied on
the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. GOD'S GOLD was moving up the early backstretch while six wide, then raced at an even pace throughout the
far turn and needed more in the end. SECOND BATTALION settled along the inside throughout and showed little. MORO TRENDSETTER raced in the
middle of the pack while five wide then dropped back on the backstretch and failed to rally in the end. DADA BOOM RIDGE broke outwardly then raced
behind the field and was no factor.

Footnotes
DEVAMANI (FR) rated in mid-pack for the first half mile, rallied splitting horses in the turn, angled out to the seven path when straightened away for home
and closed well to be pulling away late in a well managed ride. CLIFF DIVER raced four wide the entire way while stalking the pace, loomed up nearing the
quarter pole to loom boldly, took a lead in mid-stretch only to be out-finished by the winner. CATHOLIC GUILT settled in hand down the frontside the first
time, sat near the rear of the field to the far turn, commenced a long drive to be steadily gaining and garner the show. JUST A IRISH LAD trailed the field
through the first three-quarters and found his best stride in the lane to mount a belated rally. BUBBA BLING tracked the leaders from three wide to midway
on the far turn, took command in upper stretch and failed to sustain his bid down the lane. MANOR BORN tugged against rider restraint through the first
turn, raced near the back of the back under a hold, moved briefly turning for home and was taken in hand late in the drive when in close quarters. FLIP THE
COIN JAN tracked the leaders from two wide in mid-pack and lacked a closing response. OPTIMUS KAT was well placed along the fence in striking position
and went evenly without a closing kick. SIDETOWN sped to the lead in rapid fractions, opened a clear advantage but weakened in the stretch tiring late.
LAB RAT raced up early only to be parked six wide in the first turn, kept on down the backside and faded in the final quarter. JR'S PACIFICO prompted the
quick pace for a half mile and came up empty.

up by a neck in the end. ZAVALA lead the lead down the backstretch and into the turn, continued to hold on gamely in the early stretch, then dueled with an
outer rival in the final sixteenth and was out nodded in the end. NIGHTWIND chased the pace from the inside, then menaced heading in the stretch then

wide, menaced in the early stretch then continued to close well. SWEET TAPIN MORO raced between foes down the early backstretch, then moved up to

Footnotes
DIAMOND GRAND saved ground tracking the pace from the fence, moved into contention on the turn, cut the corner turning for home and drew clear down
the lane a convincing winner. LIL MISS SUNSHINE sped off to the lead while drifting out to the five path down the backside, dropped in to the rail while
maintaining a clear advantage through the turn, drifted back out in upper stretch allowing the winner up the fence and kept on to hold the place. YVONNE'S
MISS broke severely outward leaving the gates impeding COURAGEOUS CAPPEN severely and brushing CRAFTY CHARLIE, was gathered up by the
rider and straightened away to race mid-pack early, moved into contention on the turn to threaten but finished up evenly. CASHMERE DANCER reserved
off the pace to the quarter pole and made a mild rally down the stretch to hit the board. CRIMSON LADY prompted the lead from a carried out six path down
the backside, dropped in behind the front runner into the turn and moved toward rail to save ground two wide, failed to maintain his bid and weakened late in
the lane. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN checked sharply when YVONNE'S MISS broke outward leaving the gate nearly causing the rider to be unseated, was
taken up and gathered back into stride, chased the field for the half mile and finished up willingly in a very rough trip. DARE TO WISH raced in early
contention to be prominent and flattened out in upper stretch. I'M ALL SHOOK UP chased the leaders from four wide in the turn and made no impact.
CRAFTY CHARLIE brushed at the start when rival broke outward, dropped to the rear of the field and was no threat from there. FREYAS CATZ was never a
factor.

Footnotes
FROM THE HEART saved ground throughout the first three quarters of the course then came out seven wide leaving the far turn to close fastest down the
home stretch and be up just in time to succeed. NERKY ROSE was rated down the backstretch while two wide, was gaining ground on the far turn to vie for
the lead while six wide down the lane and was closing strong to be up for the place prize. WHITEROSE JEWEL chased the pace from the inside down the
backstretch, dug in gamely leaving the far turn, split rivals then closed belatedly and was best for show in the end. FRIDAYNIGHTSOLDIER chased the
pace from the three path down the backstretch and throughout the far turn, then dug in gamely to vie for the in the home stretch but was out finished in the
end. BENISSIMO raced in the middle of the field while two wide, was urging on the far turn to menace in the stretch and was closing well in the end. TOP
COP saved ground down the backstretch while racing from the inside, then rallied mid stretch but came up empty. ANOTHER JOURNEY raced along the
inside down the backstretch, then came out four wide to bid on the far turn and into the stretch but it was too little too late. OLCZYK stalked the pace while
three wide down the backstretch, then inched up to vie for the lead on the far turn and into the early stretch then flattened out in the the end. O T C WIZ
stalked the pace from the inside, then moved up to gain the lead on the far turn, vied to keep the lead in the early stretch was used up and weakened in the
end. CAJUN FIRE set the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was in a long drive, was used up on the turn then tired in the stretch. BLACKHEATH
stalked the pace from the two path then dropped back before heading into the far turn and stopped. PASS IT AROUND was off slowly then trailed
throughout and was never a factor.
