Footnotes
MEDIA SENSATION stalked in the five path, was put to a ride going into the far turn, under right handed urging from the four path midway around that far
turn, tipped back out to the five path into the lane, and drew past an inner rival in the closing stages to win. EMERGENCY RESPONSE prompted the pace
in the four path, made a bid early around the far turn and took the lead approaching the quarter, opened up from around the three path into the stretch, and
stayed on but was caught late by an outer foe to place. MAKE 'EM TAP bumped with an inner foe at the start, was unhurried in the five path early, under
coaxing early around the far turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and kept on but had to steady slightly nearing the final sixteenth to finish with
show. CHACHARERO bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, received a right handed cue and was under a drive early into the far
turn, fanned out to the seven path entering the stretch, and finished evenly. ROYAL FOX HILLS chased along the inside down the backstretch, was ridden
around the far turn, but did not factor from around the four path down the lane. SIR GOOSA bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace under a hold
in the two path early, received a left handed cue when challenged midway around the far turn, but lost the lead and faded in the stretch. KADAR INDY
bumped with an inner foe at the start and stumbled slightly just after, rated in the three path early but made no impact. VOICE AN OPINION trailed in the
four path early and did not threaten. REDISUR was wellback in the two path and never menaced.

EPONA'S HOPE raced off the pace in the four path, steadily gained outside in the lane and was up late. SUGAR N SPICE set a clear pace in the two path,
drifted in then out in the final sixteenth and led until the final strides. ALE'S GIFT saved ground off the pace, rallied along the rail and just missed second.
CHEROKEE steadied nearing the half-mile pole, angled out early on the turn, chased the winner in the three path, gained between foes in the lane, was
outkicked and steadied in the final strides. DREAM DIAMOND was outrun while racing two wide. LADIDA trailed inside.

Footnotes
LOYAL LOUIE raced in range in the three path, angled widest in upper stretch, closed outside, took over near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BARONE
CESCO tracked the pace four wide, bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of BELLA FUTURE, bumped with that foe late and was game to win the place
battle. BELLA FUTURE pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, dueled to the sixteenth pole, bumped with the runner-up
and was outfinished. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY raced off the pace three and four wide, lugged in in midstretch and improved position. GUN MAESTRO chased
the pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. SMOKIN CLOUD hit the starting gate, raced four wide and never threatened. BIG LOUIE
was outrun inside. RAKA RAKA CRUZ set the pace in the two path and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
LEXINATOR laid off the pace in the two path, advanced into range from the four path rounding the turn, was under right handed encouragement in the six
path at the top of the lane, rallied past inner rivals just past the eighth pole, and went clear. LOVIELEE set the pace in the two path, was roused while tipping
inside into the turn, floated out to the four path into the lane, was overtaken by the outer eventual winner just past the eighth pole, but held on to place.
HIALEAH HOTTIE was fractious during the loading process, coaxed along while up close in the five path, under a drive in the four path rounding the turn,
and kept on from the six path in the stretch for show. SUMMER HOME prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, sustained
that bid from the five path into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. DANNYHILL stalked along the inside but faded in the stretch. FOR EVER OURS
trailed in the three path early and made no impact. DEMURELY was hustled between foes while in range from the two path, stymied slightly into the turn,
but did not threaten. PER RULING #2023-00578 FROM HISA, LOVIELEE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

and churned on for the show. MIGHTY MIRACLE set the pace along the rail and and gave way nearing the five-sixteenths marker. WALT WHITMAN (IRE)
broke inwardly and bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. HIGH STAKES tracked the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
RAIN set the pace inside, was under coaxing midway around the turn, cued right handed while opening slightly from the four path into the lane, and held
sway. MABEE LUCKYNWILD prompted the pace in the two path, was under urging from the five path into the stretch, and held place. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL
stalked in the six path, was roused from said position midway around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on for show. NO
DECAF bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path, received a right handed cue while in the four path passing the three eighths pole,
but was one paced from the six path down the lane. DRILL'S VALENTINE raced off the pace in the five path, shifted inside into the turn, cut the corner into
the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. DIGNIFIED chased in the five path, tipped out to the center in upper stretch, but did not factor. DOMINEERING
bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed from the rail into the turn and was never involved. TEE UP was pushed along from up close in the five path but
backed up early around the turn.

Footnotes
NOVO SOL (BRZ) settled off the pace in the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch and quickly cleared.
VLADISLAV settled off the early pace while racing three wide, moved up two wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on to gain the
place. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS raced well back four and five wide and ran on for the show. SURROGATE was devoid of speed while racing four and five
wide and had a mild belatedly. IRON WORKS failed to menace while racing three and four wide. NOVGOROD THE GREAT set a fast pace in the two path
and tired in the drive. JOURNEYMAN was outrun inside. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) raced closest to the pace in the clear three wide and had little left for
the drive.

Footnotes
CHAPALU set the pace in the four path, was coaxed while in the three path midway around the far turn, opened slightly while floating out to the five path
into the stretch, began to shorten late, but held on. A ROSE FOR RAVEN settled in range around the five path, was roused early around the far turn, fanned
out to the eight path into the lane, and ran on but just missed to finish in place. EVER DANGEROUS tracked in the three path, was put to a ride along the
rail midway around the far turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and stayed on for show. WARP SPEED BABY rated in the three path, was
driven around the far turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, but was one paced. XY TIME stalked in the four path, was urged between foes rounding
the far turn, but faded into the lane. MR MAC QUHAE trailed throughout from the two to six paths.
