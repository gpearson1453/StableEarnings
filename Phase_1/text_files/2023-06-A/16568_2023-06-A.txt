Footnotes
MARY JANE CHROME , unhurried to the far turn, moved up outside horses leaving the turn, was taken to the five path in upper stretch, closed steadily and
was up approaching the finish. LADY MOSLER stalked the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead leaving the far turn, was clear in mid stretch
and gave way grudgingly. HEARTBURN , lightly bumped by STORMIN' AMANDA at the start, raced mid pack to the stretch, moved to the four path in upper
stretch, raced between horses and offered a mild rally. STORMIN' AMANDA came out bumping HEARTBURN at the start, sped to the early lead, saved
ground on the far turn and weakened in the drive. QUEEN TAPITURE hugged the inner rail throughout and failed to menace. CANDY ARCADE , four wide
chasing the pace on the far turn, was well positioned in mid stretch and tired. BLETCHLEY GIRL lacked speed, swung very wide in upper stretch and
passed tired horses. SINGALONG , no factor, raced outside horses in the stretch. PRINCESS PALMER , in the three path chasing the pace around the far
turn, gave way in the drive. GENIEINABRIDLE , checked in tight quarters entering the first turn, faltered.

Footnotes
SHADY MUNNI cleared three wide outside rivals while in hand near the seven eighths, dropped in a bit and set a rated pace, met challenges approaching
the stretch, kept on under left handed asks inside the eighth pole, drifted out late and held sway. ACE NINE NINE angled out early and settled four wide,
edged up outside foes past the five eighths, bid three deep nearing the lane and kept on willingly to preserve the place. CURLIN'S MALIBU , unruly in the
gate, settled behind rivals while about two wide, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch and closed steadily. MAJESTIC FRONTIER
, bumped at the break, was taken to rate while not far back, moved up between runners past the five eighths, dropped in briefly around the far turn then
came back out, lodged a mild bid between foes near the quarter pole, altered out with pursuit past the furlong grounds and faded. MYSTIC LINK , bumped
with MAJESTIC FRONTIER at the stalk, stalked three wide, was pushed along leaving the far turn, failed to respond and faded. GHOSTLIGHTER hopped
at the break, recovered and secured the inside when advancing around the first turn, was well placed past the five eighths, steadied near the far turn,
dropped back and failed to recover.

and took the lead inside the sixteenth pole. CERTAIN prompted the pace outside SURPRISE HELLO, gained the lead near the eighth pole, came in very
slightly approaching the finish and gave way grudgingly. COVERT KAT lightly bumped the winner at the break, swung very wide in upper stretch and
passed tired horses. SURPRISE HELLO , reluctant to load into the starting gate, saved ground setting a pressured pace around the turn, drifted out in upper

Footnotes
LUV YA BYE BYE vied two wide on a short lead and outside APPENDAGE into the turn, spurted clear around the turn, was put to strong asking when
threatened from his outside by MOONSET approaching the stretch, kicked away under energetic handling in mid stretch and was kept alert to the wire.
MOONSET , in range off the rail and behind rivals, edged up into the turn, knifed his way between runners with a quick move heading to the five sixteenths,
had aim outside the winner into the lane, gave futile chase in mid stretch, continued with effort and was well clear of the rest. APPENDAGE reared when
unruly in the gate pre race, was taken back for a rider change then was used inside vying with the winner into the turn, gave pursuit while saving ground
past the five sixteenths, shifted out in upper stretch and faded. DISTANT FIRE had speed between runners then was rated back off the leaders near the
half, saved ground past the five sixteenths and into the lane, was flashed the whip a few times but came up empty. OBOY came in some at the break,
chased four wide, remained in range to upper stretch then faded. GREAT CALL broke outward bumping SILVER PATRON, regrouped and raced off the
pace and off the inside, circled five wide with a bit of a run nearing the lane, failed to sustain and gave way through the final seventy yards. SILVER
PATRON , bumped and pinched back at the break, raced well back around the turn, came three to four wide for the drive but lacked a response. HIT THE
JACKPOT bobbled at the break, was pushed along four and three wide chasing, failed to keep up mid turn and tired.

Footnotes
GUNSLINGER (IRE) assumed the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail and dug in stubbornly in the late going. SIR TERRE stalked the pace outside
horses down the backstretch, circled foes around the far turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. TIJUANA BRASS saved ground on the far
turn, found room along the inner rail in the stretch and rallied nicely. SHOFAR , along the inner rail stalking the pace to the stretch, moved to the two path in
upper stretch and weakened in the drive. OFFICER COUNTRY , , in the two path down the backstretch and on the far turn, chased the winner to mid stretch
and weakened. NOBLE CONQUEST , always outside horses, failed to rally. PRETTY GOOD YEAR , no factor, was very wide turning for home. RESIDENT
LIBERAL was not a factor. MENTALIST was outrun. MONGOLIAN HERO was outrun.

Footnotes
BERKS cleared soon after the break and dropped in towards the rail, set a rated pace, handled outside pressure from CLUBMAN into and around the final
turn, kicked clear under solid asks in upper stretch, kept on past mid stretch and was taken in hand for the final yards. CLUBMAN rated between foes while
forwardly placed into the far turn, ranged up outside the winner near the five eighths and prompted the pace, drifted four wide under pressure and pursuing
into the lane, corrected and stayed on well to be clear of the rest. BOBBY G settled off the pace, came under pressure leaving the far turn, advanced to the
inside of a rival leaving the five sixteenths, eased out a few paths entering the lane, finished with good energy to gain and kept on nicely through the gallop
out. NEVER CHANGE bobbled at the break, recovered and lost ground five wide outside runners into the first turn, dropped in and tracked three deep near
the five eighths, saw the leaders get away exiting the far turn, shifted in towards the rail and faded. WALK AWAY JOE , three wide into the first turn while
close up, raced between runners past the five eighths, edged up a bit under a hearty ride leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive and came up empty.
GUILLAUME stalked the pace while saving ground, came under pressure into the far turn but failed to kick on. GOLDEN GULLEY stumbled at the break,
moved up four wide between foes entering the first turn, lost ground three wide outside foes through the backstretch and gave way nearing the lane.
WORKIN ON A DREAM , off last when stumbling badly, trailed.

Footnotes
ZABRACADABRA , in the clear tracking the leading trio, gained four wide and in hand to have dead aim mid turn, shifted a bit wider and bid outside the
dueling leaders soon into the lane, took control leaving the quarter pole, responded when set down a sixteenth later, opened up under energetic urging and
was kept alert to the wire. DONTMESAWITHME , three wide outside BACKNTHEWOODS prompting the pace, applied more pressure when coaxed along
mid turn, sparred and held a slim lead in upper stretch, kept on willingly and saved the place. YODEL E. A. WHO , off the pace and outside a rival, shifted
out near the three sixteenths, worked between runners past mid stretch and churned on. VANCE SCHOLARS , urged inside while forcing the pace, saw the
leaders get away leaving the half mile marker, was scrubbed upon with little response mid turn, wandered out to about the five path nearing the lane,
straightened away and faded. AMERICAN D'ORO steadied when in tight at the break, lagged off the pace while saving ground, lost his action for a few
strides in upper stretch then failed to kick on through the final furlong. BACKNTHEWOODS took over early and set the pace in about the two path, took
pressure from both sides nearing the turn, dueled to the inside of DONTMESAWITHME from mid turn to upper stretch then weakened through the final
furlong.

TALL ORDER broke well to make the early lead, set the pace off the rail and pulled away under some urging in the drive. ACT LIVELY broke slowly, saved
ground around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. WILL'S MUSIC lacked speed, raced in the four path in upper
stretch, angled to the inner rail near the eighth pole and passed tired rivals. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE stalked the pace, raced in the two path on the turn and
weakened in the drive. BASHDAFLASH showed speed near the inner rail and weakened. IRISH STORMY bobbled at the start and trailed.
