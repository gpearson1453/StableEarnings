Footnotes
CHARLOTTE THE BRIT allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove
clear. HALF BIRTHDAY well placed and off the rail, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear,
then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) well placed and outside, moved to position three wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. SO MOXIE unhurried, moved up three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up
for a share. RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) set the pace just off the rail, shook clear through the turn, then faded into the stretch. LAWN DART stalked the pace on
the inside, drifted out and was steadied into the turn, then faded.

Footnotes
ANTARES sprinted to a clear lead quickly, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. ITALIAN SYMPHONY
rated close up and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no match for that
one, while clearly best of the rest. I STRONG unhurried, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch and closed well for the show.
COLORFUL LAD mid pack, held position on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. DIAMONDHARD STONE
allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. CITY OF CLOUDS well placed, lost
some ground two and three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. AMERICAN SYMPHONY passed a tiring rival. DOUBLE WARRIOR chased the
pace on the inside and had no stretch rally.

HE'S A MESS unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late.
ORDER AND LAW well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick. NICE ACE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show.
I WANNA WIN well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. WISH FOR
PEACE passed a tiring rival. SPIRITED SOL hard to rated, held position on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
MAGIC BOMB unhurried, was blocked through the turn, angled five wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drew off late. LARZ set the pace just
off the rail, shook clear through the turn, drew off in the stretch, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. EL DUQUE allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. RISEN SAVIOR hopped at
the start, was allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and edged up for a share.
DONTINVADEMYSPACE well placed and outside, gained a striking position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final
furlong. HINDENBURG never far back,, looped five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and flattened out. T C GREELEY well placed and
between, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened. NICE STAR improved position. VOORHEES stalked the
pace inside, lost some ground through the turn, then faded the final furlong. BORN HAPPY tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the turn,
then had no stretch rally.
