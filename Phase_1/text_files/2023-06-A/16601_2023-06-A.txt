strides as they set the pace as a pair, had her head in front when they passed the half mile pole, was challenged by an outside foe at he five sixteenth pole,
battled with this rival through the turn and down the stretch, pulled away late and got up in time. VIOLA STAR raced along the rail while off the pace early
on, patiently waited for the cue, launched her bid at the half mile pole, improved position while still saving ground on the rail, was driven and encouraged
past the quarter pole, was kept on point and was able to out finish the rest of her rivals and earned second place honors. CAJUN ACES stalked the early
leaders while racing in the three path in between horses, drew near even terms with the leaders after the half mile pole, bid at the five sixteenth pole, battled
for the lead leaving the turn, matched strides while drifting out in the stretch and came up third. KENYA STRIKE stalked the early leaders in the four path,
was forwardly placed and nearly co leading along the outside, shuffled back at the half mile pole and ran even after that. PAT HAND GIRL was off a touch
slow, was in contention at the three eighths pole and chased through the stretch. WHY WAIT vied for the early lead, was joined by battling rivals on the

the early pace while racing in the three path, advanced position and bid at the three eighths pole, challenged for the lead nearing the quarter pole, was

B B GUN BULLSEYE broke sharp, settled off of the pace, was rated early, stalked the early leader from the two path, was pressured by an outside rival at
the five sixteenth pole, collared the early leader, took command at the quarter pole, drew in front by the top of the lane and maintained the lead through out
the stretch run. DONTFORGETRDREAMS stalked the early leader, raced in the three path, improved position along the back side, launched a bid at the
three eighths pole, shifted into the four path entering the upper stretch, challenged for the lead at the quarter pole but could make up any ground on the
eventual winner, was second best today. LOYAL TO THE CHIEF was sent out for the lead along the rail, could not make it to the front fast enough and had
to steady a bit going into the turn, stalked into the stretch and faltered. LUCKY GONE SWEET stalked while racing three wide, bid at the three eighths pole,
shifted out in the turn and circled the field to improve position but chased down the lane. DECORATED LADY trailed through out.
