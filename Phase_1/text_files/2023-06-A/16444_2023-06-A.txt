Footnotes
TWO BY TWO settled behind foes through the backstretch run, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide advancing into the lane, sustained under
right handed asks to put a head in front outside runners in mid stretch, emerged in battled outside SAMUI SUNSET soon after and edged away to a clear
lead at the wire. SAMUI SUNSET stalked outside a rival, eased out around the final turn and moved up four wide between rivals to challenge nearing mid
stretch, battled head to head with TWO BY TWO past the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. BOB MARCO , tucked up towards the rail tracking the
embattled leaders, awaited room nearing the lane, worked between rivals leaving mid stretch, altered out late and closed willingly. RICOCHET took over
between rivals early then secured the rail and set a pressured pace, dueled inside runners from the three eighths, failed to go on nearing the sixteenth pole
and weakened late. ONE TWO KID settled off the rail early on, moved up and bid three deep into the far turn, sparred between rivals from upper stretch to
about mid stretch then gave way. MINT GAME , well placed and settled towards the rail, eased out into the stretch but failed to kick on. FERMAT , sluggish
from the gate, lagged back, came under a ride three wide leaving the far turn but failed to respond. ARISTOCAT , two wide outside RICOCHET contesting
the early pace, fought on between rivals past the five sixteenths then surrendered through the drive.

Footnotes
LADY SERENITY vied outside a rival while under rating, moved clear leaving the five sixteenths, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, stayed on her left
lead and held firm while kept to task. PRINCESS PALMER , taken to rate between rivals early, advanced three wide to have aim approaching the stretch,
failed to quicken on with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on willingly to save the place. WRITE THIS DOWN , off the early pace and removed from the
rail, circled four wide with some momentum into the stretch and closed steadily. BALLYHOOLY broke through the gate pre race but didn't get too far, stalked
while saving ground leaving the far turn, came out for the drive and churned on between foes. QUEEN TAPITURE rated off the pace while behind rivals
leaving the far turn, swung out to be well wide through the final furlong and rallied. SMART EULEE saved ground off the pace, continued inside into the
lane, eased out, worked between rivals heading to the sixteenth pole then was out kicked late. MY LADY'S AUNT MA vied inside the winner to about mid
turn, gave willing pursuit past the three sixteenths then weakened. AMERICAS WOMAN lagged back early then failed to generate a serious run. SHAKE IT
GIRL , three wide, gave way.

Footnotes
FAST TRACKED set the pace well off the inner rail, opened up on the far turn, remained well clear through the stretch and drifted out inside the sixteenth
pole. MAJOR HOULIHAN , three wide the first turn, began a three deep rally entering the far turn, chased the winner through the stretch while on her left
lead and altered course to the inside of that one approaching the finish. AUNTIE RONA lacked speed, swung four wide leaving the far turn and passed tired
rivals. LIL SPINNER , sent soon after the break, chased the winner racing near the inner rail, was in the two path between horses the far turn and gave way.
DONNA'S COURAGE , outrun, was four deep leaving the far turn. OCEAN GATEWAY , three wide the first turn, moved up a bit along the inner rail on the
far turn then retreated through the stretch. MYSTIC SEAPORT chased the pace while in the two path down the backstretch, faltered and was eased.

BOSSERATI broke inward bumping and forcing in ISLAND PHILO, was corrected and disputed the pace outside FLIRTATIOUS LASS, got the better of that
one in upper stretch, spurted away leaving the three sixteenths and held sway under repeated right handed asks. AFANDI , away alertly, stalked the dueling
leaders while outside a rival, shifted four wide for the drive and steadily bridged the gap. WINKED , bumped and steadied at the break to be away last,
regrouped and edged up while saving ground, was shuffled back nearing the turn, angled out around the turn, circled five wide into the stretch and finished
well to gain. CHROMEPLATED HEART saved ground chasing mid turn, eased out in the drive and offered a late bid. FLIRTATIOUS LASS got engaged in a
duel to the inside of the winner soon after the break, failed to match strides leaving the three sixteenths and weakened in the final seventy yards. ISLAND
PHILO steadied after being bumped and forced in by the winner at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, came out in the lane but lacked a
serious response. EVANGELINE ALLONS , off the pace, came five wide for the drive and failed to menace. SKYLAR'S SISTER , two wide in mid pack,
faded. IRISH VALENTINE , off the pace and three wide leaving the far turn, failed to respond. PER RULING FROM HIWU, AFANDI WAS DISQUALIFIED

EXPRESS leaving the eighth pole, dueled, gained a slim advantage in deep stretch and prevailed. BAR DOWN EXPRESS broke inward a bit and bumped
with a rival, corrected and dueled two wide outside UPSIDEDOWN MAN, maintained command into the lane, emerged in a battle to the inside of the winner
leaving mid stretch, fought valiantly but wasn't quite good enough. NORTH HIGHLAND , four wide chasing early on, dropped to the rail entering the turn,
moved up past the three sixteenths, altered out in the final furlong and closed steadily to gain. UPSIDEDOWN MAN , bumped at the break, got into a battle
along the rail soon after, stayed on under asking to mid stretch and faded. WE GOT LUCKY , in range off the rail leaving the far turn, failed to respond
leaving mid turn and faltered.
