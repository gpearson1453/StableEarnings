the rail and weakened in the stretch. CLASSIC UNION raced close up along the inside then flattened out in the stretch. IN SPADES lacked speed, moved
very wide into the stretch and was no threat. RUFFY angled out early, bid into the far turn then gave way. COMMINGLING dropped back early and trailed
throughout.

retreating before half mile. JUST A THOUGHT four wide on the first turn, remained wide and gave way. JUMP FOR ALEX raced between rivals off the pace

PERFECTLY GOLDEN lacked speed, advanced on the final turn, split rivals into the stretch then drew off. ICE raced very rank and steadied repeatedly in
the opening half mile and continued well. KEEP IT SWEET dropped back early then rallied inside through the stretch. MARVELETTE hustled to the front to
midstretch and came up empty. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA fanned wide into the first turn and lacked a rally. CANNY LAND prompted the pace for half a mile
and gave way. END OF THE RAINBOW dropped back early and was never a factor. TEMPTED TO TOUCH broke sluggishly and was never in contention.

Footnotes
MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT lunged at the start then quickly took control and pulled away driving. GAME SEVEN broke slowly, rushed to contention inside
and continued willingly for the place. DANCE CODE dropped back outside, remained wide and closed well. PUTTHEBLAMEONME raced in closest pursuit
of the winner and weakened. THREEPETE trailed to the stretch and was was never a factor. AMIGOS GUITAR chased close up outside down the
backstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
GETAWAY PALACE broke alertly and moved clear, remained well ahead and scored decisively in a mild drive. COLLEGE TRY pursued the winner
throughout and proved easily second best. DESTIN FOR DRAMA saved ground off the leaders and continued willingly. LOOKINATLIGHTENING forced out
on the first turn, chased inside with a mild rally. LIPARI forced out on the first turn then was never a factor. BOUNTY KILLAH fanned very wide on the first
turn, remained wide and was no factor. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO lagged far behind then caught fading rivals. MAGNOLIA ROAD raced off the pace inside
and gave way readily. NOW ACT SURPRISED settled outside and was finished after half a mile. ANACARAVA (IRE) dropped far behind losing contact with
her field.
