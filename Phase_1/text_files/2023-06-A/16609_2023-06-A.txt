Footnotes
KHOZZY VALINTINE had a good position three wide outside tracking the pacesetter, began to close the gap when nudged on at the quarter pole, bid
between horses in the three path turning for home and was edging away from the field nearing the wire. WICKED MIAH was allowed to settle trail this tight
bunch in the beginning, was on hold between foes at the seven sixteenth marker, slipped up the fence two furlongs to go and rallied on the rail through the
stretch to best the rest in the end. CARLA'S HONOR settled behind the frontrunner on the rail at the half, continued to keep a close eye on the leader inside
in the turn, angled outside at the quarter pole, threatened four wide in upper stretch and was one paced late holding for third. GORMLEY GIRL broke out at
the start, travelled in midpack between foes down the backside, was scrubbed on two deep at the midway point on the turn making little advance, angled out
to the five path for the drive and found some late energy between horses to get up for a minor share at the wire. WEST PAW assumed command shortly
after the break leading the field down the back straight, continued comfortably setting the pace on the turn, was headed outside by the winner at the top of
the lane and tired between rivals in deep stretch. LITTLE FIRE settled near the rear three deep down the backstretch, trailed the compact field with three
furlongs to go, angled out widest in the six path for the stretch run and could not reach contention finishing to the line.

Footnotes
SOUPER SUNDAY was content to track the early pacesetter on the turn, was asked for run at the 1/4 pole, quickly responded to take command outside in
upper stretch and was drawing away at the furlong marker. INDIAN MUSIC took command from the onset, set the fractions on the backstretch through the
turn, was collared by the winner outside at the top of the stretch, offered little resistance and was tiring late but held safe for place. FIRST ROUND PICK
was bumped by the outside rival at the start to trail early on, started to pick off runners midway on the turn inside, continued advancing up the fence at the
top of the lane, shifted just outside at the sixteenth pole and finished well to be a solid third in the end. BIG GINGER tracked on the rail watching the top pair
with four furlongs to go, was ridden to go after the leaders at the quarter pole, could not any gains on the leaders in upper stretch and faded slightly late but
held at the wire for a minor share. SMART BIRD settled in midpack three wide down the backstretch, was urged for more midpoint on the turn, offered little
response and could get involved more through the stretch run. STOLE THE RING broke inwards at the start, settled near the rear down the backside,
offered a brief run from the three eighths pole until upper stretch and stalled in the five path outside foes at the furlong marker. TIPSY MOON travelled in
midfield inside at the half mile marker, was taken a hold of on the rail entering the turn, was shuffled back to last with three eighths remaining and could not
be a factor running to the wire.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC FENCER settled off the pace outside a runner two to three deep into the turn, advanced between foes in upper stretch, struck the lead near the
sixteenth pole rallying inside foes and was quickly clear then held well. HOT OMELET raced off the pace, advanced outside on the turn going five then six
wide, kept on in the stretch to get up for second. PRACTICAL GIZMO moved forward inside to contest the pace, took a narrow lead on the turn, drifted out
three paths leaving that bend, continued to drift out in late stretch and was outfinished. PASSION TO PLEASE brushed the gate lightly, was
forwardly-positioned outside, went four to five wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. SHELLY THE ROCKET got away well, pressed the pace from
outside then between runners going three then four wide on the turn, needed more in the lane. FOREST CHOICE was coaxed forward to take a narrow
advantage after the opening sixteenth, dueled outside a runner into the turn, weakened thereafter. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS was ridden along inside, failed
to menace.

Footnotes
SPEEDY PAL pressed for the lead in the early going, was narrowly in front setting the pace through the turn, put away his early challengers at the top of the
stretch, braced for the outside challenger in mid stretch and stubbornly dug in to prevail in the end. OLD BLUE CLIFF was in the tracking flight five wide
outside horses at the half, began to take closer order rallying around runners at the three furlong marker, loomed the threat in upper stretch three wide and
could not get by the determined frontrunning winner in the final eighth. MENTORING battled on the front end in the three path down the backside, lost a little
position between rivals midpoint on the turn to be behind the pacesetters looking for a seam at the quarter pole, angled out to the four path turning for home
and picked up a runner late to capture third money. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE was part of the pace scenario four deep at four furlong pole, prompted the front
three wide on the turn outside, was in range between runners in the two path at the three sixteenths marker and faded to the wire while holding on for a
minor share at the line. MUSICAL STRIDE travelled in the middle of the pack four deep down the backstretch, was shuffled back early on the turn, began to
offer a finish six wide at the top of the stretch, lost path turning for home, shifted inwards to the three path in mid stretch to weave his way through runners to
finish well in the end. MR. RUDY trailed the field at the half, advanced on the rail through the turn, angled five wide for the drive and showed some good late
energy passing tiring runners to the finish. AMAZON FORESTER was ridden for position soon after the start to sit behind the engaging leaders on the rail
into the turn, waited behind the contested front three with five sixteenths to go, was in tight surroundings on the fence at the quarter pole, had to be taken up
briefly losing momentum and levelled out in the drive to the line. MARTEN STORM was away slowly to begin, appeared to be eager afterwards and rushed
up between foes to be behind the front foursome at the half, inside the seven sixteenths pole was steadied, waited behind rivals midway on the turn, angled
five wide for the stretch run and tired. SERENADE AT SEA settled near the rear on the rail in the beginning, lost contact with the field through the turn and
pass a troubled foe in upper stretch. DANCIN' DEPUTY battled for the lead in the two path down the backside, began to back away from the front pace duel
midway on the turn, was in tight and steadied at the quarter marker and was not persevered with galloping to the finish. STEWARDS INQUIRY

Footnotes
LAST DAWN had a good position under a snug hold watching the top pair throughout the turn, was looking for a path behind foes at the quarter pole, finally
angled out for a seam to burst between runners at the furlong marker and got up in the last jump in a well timed rally. DIRECT DRIVE had a narrow lead
inside in the early stages of the race, was headed outside in upper stretch, put away the first rival at the three sixteenth pole, braced for the new challenger
in the final furlong and stubbornly dueled to the finish unfortunately losing the nod in a hard fought runner up finish. WICKED DJANGO threw his head and
broke inwards to trail the field down the backside, caught up with the pack straightening out for the drive, was looking for room in the three path behind
runners in upper stretch, shifted in for a clear path on the rail at the furlong marker and finished up well to be a solid third crossing the line. FINN'S
MOMENT pressed the issue two wide on the backstretch and throughout the turn, bid between runners in the three path two furlongs from the prize and
gave way at the eighth pole holding onto a small share. VENTI tracked the leaders outside three deep down the backside, was in the hunt four from the
fence straightening out for home and stalled in the final furlong. CALUSA DONNIE tracked in the second flight between runners in the two path down the
back straight, lost position on the turn to trail in the six path for the stretch drive and could not get involved running to the wire.

Footnotes
UMNEYAAT stalked from outside three to four wide, steadily ground away at the leader in the stretch taking the lead about seventy yards from home and
just prevailed. BEQUIA exchanged minor brushing in a scramble to the first turn, eased back off the intent leader early on the bend and switched outside
that one to stalk from outside, edged nearer to take the lead near the three-eighths, was clear into mid-stretch, outfinished for the win and just saved the
place. FOXY DIVA broke just a step slowly, shifted in racing unhurriedly toward the back, saved ground early on the far turn, swung out turning for home
then angled out further for room, was finishing fastest of all but too late and just missed. BEDAZZLE ME was off the pace and just off the inside part of the
course, swung out five wide into upper stretch and ran on. VIVID VIXEN settled at the back outside four to five wide, swung eight deep for the stretch run
and finished evenly. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL eased off the leaders and tucked in two wide into the first turn, tracked in behind the pace just off the leaders, failed
to rally. IMPROVISE (FR) exchanged light brushing early, moved clear into the first turn to set the pace racing just off the rail, moved nearer the rail up the
backstretch once clear, was challenged into the far turn, weakened thereafter. SHARP AZA RAINBOW exchanged some light brushing heading to the first
turn then was taken back and shifted in to track from inside, steadily dropped back and was not a threat.

Footnotes
TIBURON stalked near the back on the rail in the early going, was watching the top foursome between runners at the three furlong pole, rallied four wide at
the quarter marker, continued the sustained bid six wide at the top of the lane and wore down his rival late to edge away at the line. LEGAL CATCH tracked
three wide into the first turn, was then a part of the front quartet in the two path with four furlongs remaining, took the lead in upper stretch and battled on
until the sixteenth pole giving way grudgingly to the closing winner late. SAMMY STONE stalked near the rear just off the rail into the first turn, pulled his
way to bid for the lead four deep at the half, was in the hunt four wide in upper stretch, could not match strides with the leaders at the eight pole and settled
for a clear third in the end. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE prompted the pace in the first turn, relaxed down the backstretch behind the front foursome with four
furlongs to go, saved ground waiting behind foes on the final turn and finished up evenly on the fence to the wire for a small reward. GREYSTONE was
squeezed at the start trailing in the beginning stages of the race, put in a mild rally outside three wide with three furlongs to go, stalled by the quarter pole
and passed weary runners in the stretch. MAGIC TOMAHAWK tracked two wide on the first turn, bid three deep in the front foursome at the half, battled
with runners on either side on the final turn and yielded at the top of the lane. ERNIE'S MARTINI was headstrong behind foes in midpack on the first turn,
continued unsettled inside down the backside, trailed the field with three eighths remaining and was not a presence to the finish. MIAH SAID took command
under a strong hold into the first turn, slowed the pace down to bunch up the field at the half mile marker still narrowly dictating the pace, was the first to give
way when the running started inside midway on the far turn and retreated on the fence in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CAHIRA'S BLESSING took control from the start, was left alone unchallenged on the turn, opened up on her foes at the furlong marker and cruised home to
the finish. HOT CARGO travelled in midfield two off the rail in the beginning, shifted out six wide at the two furlong pole, closed in well on rivals with the
exception of the long gone winner through the stretch and held safe at the wire for the place share. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES broke out at the start, was
reined back to get to the rail trailing the field down the backside, saved ground at the back through the turn, waited behind runners looking for a seam in
upper stretch, had no room nearing the eighth pole, finally shifted out to the four path in deep stretch for clear run and finished up strongly just missing the
place share at the wire. SOUPER SINCLAIR watched the pacesetter with rivals on either side of her travelling on the turn, continued to be involved up front
in upper stretch three deep between foes and fought on the the wire only to fade late having to settle for a minor role in the end. STRIKE THE POSE tracked
behind the loose leader on the fence running on the turn, was in with a chance for a share in the two path in upper stretch and could only be one paced thru
the lane offering a mild finish. HELLUVA HOLIDAY travelled in the middle of the pack inside, angled four wide at the top of the lane, lost paths in mid
stretch, found clear running room five wide at the furlong marker and had no finish to give. SOCIETY'S KAT stalked near the rear two wide in the early
going, angled out widest in the seven path for the long stretch drive, could not get interested running to the finish and was a non factor. RIFLING tracked the
frontrunner three wide outside on the turn, still was in the mix in the three path straightening out for the drive and stopped between foes at the three
sixteenth marker.

Footnotes
TICKER TAPE HOME moved clear to set the tempo racing just off the rail and going comfortably, was unasked till the stretch, kicked clear while much the
best. ELYSIAN FIELD settled off the pace, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn, was no match for the winner. ME AND MY SHADOW was ridden
along coming to the three-eights from the back half of the field, went five to six wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch. TITO'S CALLING settled off the pace
racing inside, angled three wide past the quarter, ran on to get up for a minor award. FASHIONABLY FAB chased the eventual winner three wide, lacked
the needed late kick. SPEED TRAP tracked from inside, failed to menace. CANADIANSWEETHEART fanned five wide into the stretch, was not a threat.
ANAM CARA swung seven wide for the drive and was never near enough to threaten. COURTLY RO was ridden along on the turn and not a factor.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S BIT was situated in the middle of the field between horses running on the turn, angled five wide entering the stretch to be in the mix, was asked for
more at the furlong pole, found another gear and was edging away when crossing the wire. FIRING BULLETS was situated on the rail not that far removed
from the front pack tracking, rated kindly inside throughout the turn, found a seam at the three sixteenth pole in the five path and ran on late to get up for the
runner up position. LUZ DE LA LUNA was in a good tracking position outside on hold watching the top pair up front, was coaxed three wide to bid for the
lead two furlongs out, fought on until deep stretch and faded late between runners losing the photo for second. GAYELETTE was situated on the rail in
midpack early on, waited on the fence behind horses travelling nicely on the turn, found a clear lane six wide at the furlong marker and closed well late to be
involved for the photo for place at the finish line. MOSLER'S IMAGE leapt up in the air at the start trailing early, found running in the seven path at the three
sixteenth marker and showed good late energy to finish up smartly being beaten not that far for second placing in the end. GOOGLY EYES had a good
tracking position behind the engaging top pair on the turn, lost her path three wide trying for a seam in upper stretch, shifted inwards for clear run on the rail
at the eighth pole and offered little turn of foot to the wire. SPIDER BELLE stalked near the back on the rail down the backside, trailed the field on the turn,
angled out ten wide turning for home and passed tired runners in the final eighth. ALPHA MIA set the fractions on the backstretch and throughout the turn,
was swallowed up running inside in the two path at the eighth pole and emptied out in deep stretch. JAB settled in the middle of the large field three wide
outside horses, was in the mix five wide in upper stretch, could not find another gear and was outrun in the final furlong. RETAIL THERAPIST was unhurried
early to be near the back of the pack in the early stages, angled out six wide turning for home, shifted inwards at the eighth pole and was never involved to
the finish. MITZI prompted the pace two wide outside under a snug hold down the backside, was hard ridden offering a bid three deep between runners at
the quarter marker and stopped quickly in mid stretch galloping to the wire in the end.
