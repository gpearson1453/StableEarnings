Footnotes
MILITARY BEARING was sharp out of the gates, had enough speed to pass rivals, take the lead and the rail going into the first turn, set the pace as he
rated for the first half of a mile, was joined on the outside by stalking rivals, continued to show the way with two foes battling just off his hip, was given the ok
at the five sixteenth pole and left his rivals behind and drew off to win as he pleased. THUNDERSHOOK stalked the early leaders from the four path,
advanced at the half mile pole on the outside, joined the leaders after the half, battled with an inside foe through the turn and down the stretch, shook his
rival and got up for second. GORDON ANTHONY stalked from the three path, drew in between rivals at the half mile pole, continued through the turn, lost
touch with the eventual leader at the five sixteenth pole, battled with and outside foe into and down the lane and came up short. MOUNT KENYA was well
off the pace early, made on run, launched a bid at the half, shifted out five wide, was in contention but had too much to do. DREWPOWER raced from off
the pace, launched a bid at the half mile pole, angled out six wide, drew next to the early leaders on the far outside but made no impact. HALEYS SAILOR
flashed early speed and tired.

Footnotes
C D'S WILD FIRE was off mid pack, raced behind horse, had a horse to his inside, was asked and responded giving good effort early on, was ridden up
right behind the early leaders, took the dirt in has face as he kept responding to urging, was encouraged with a left handed crop and responded well from
that and continued to gain ground, raced four wide in the stretch, continued to respond from left handing urging and finally had enough momentum to clear
the last of the early leaders in deep stretch, race by and get up for the win. A very nicely ran race for a two year old. CUNIMBUS was off mid pack and raced
off the pace early on, launched a bid at the half mile pole, responded and began to gain ground, was just behind the early leaders in the stretch, was angled
out five wide late to get out of the dirt, and came up short. COOL RIDE was off in the middle of the pack, launched a bid at the half mile pole, in the four
path, circled up on the outside, gained ground, was in the lead at the quarter pole, continued to lead down the stretch, and tired late.
LOUDTHUNDRHEVYRAIN was well off the pace early, raced five wide, bid at the half, was gaining ground, was still well off the early leaders entering the
stretch, stayed five wide and had clean racing room, continued to close extremely fast, but it was not enough today. WESTERN AFLEET vied for the early
lead, stalked the early leader from the two path, stayed on through the turn, was even ground by the quarter pole, shook the early leader was collared by an
outside foe and tired. DEACON JONES raced off of the pace along the rail, but made np impact. MIGHTY MADDOX was off a bit slow and passed tired
rivals late. ALLONANITA'SLUCK showed little. POUND OUT A DEAL flashed early speed.

Footnotes
KID SHELLEEN was off the pace early on in the two path, was gathered up and cued to run, responded well, easily passed rivals through the turn and drew
off in the stretch to win by MANY. Much the best. EMPYREAL SHADOW shuffled back early, was well off the pace, saved ground, found his stride and
starting moving around the half mile pole, responded with a big turn of foot and willingly kept closing and gaining momentum, was in contention at the three
eighths pole, continued to gain ground through the turn, still had a lot of ground to make up at the quarter pole. was driven and urged, continued to respond
well and closed passing other rivals as he continued to close down the lane, couldn't get to the eventual winner but ran a game second. KISSOFTHENILE
vied for the lead along the rail, settled off the speed briefly, stalked into the turn, was steadied a bit going into the turn, was asked in the turn and into the
stretch, drifted out a bit in the stretch, was able to get up for third. ROULETTE was off mid pack, raced three wide, advanced after the half, circled in the
turn, closed through the stretch but had no late kick. MR. TEXAS CHARM vied for the early lead, was racing four wide, battled with outside contender at the
five sixteenth, shook horses next to him but was collared by a fast closing outside rival and tired. WINDTAPPER WIN mild bid late. APPLEGATE made no
impact. POPPY T stalked briefly, faded.

early leader and getting up just in time for the win. FROSTY FLIRT vied for the lead, secured the rail, while setting all the fractions, was collared ;late and
had
to
settle
for
second.
SAINT
KENNEDY
raced
from
the
middle
of
the
pack
early
on
launched
a
mild
bid
scoring
the
show
spot.
FLOWERSFORSHANTELL was forwardly place and stalking early, maintained positioning through out. MOONLIGHT RAIN made no impact. MUMBLEBEE
showed little. BEYOND THE HYPE flashed early speeded, faded. STRUMMER trailed.
