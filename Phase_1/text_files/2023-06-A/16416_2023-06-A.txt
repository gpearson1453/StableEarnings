Footnotes
EVER SUMMER bumped with a rival at the start and was off step slow, came under vigorous restraint early, traveled inside to the two path while tugging
very hard at bit and held together under stout restraint, bobbled some down the backstretch, was let out when an opponent made an early move inside the
half-mile pole, ranged up to the front with three furlongs to run, inched clear while set down into upper stretch, responded well under a strong hand-ride to
the finish and prevailed. ANATOLIAN settled on the inside, stumbled inside the three-quarter pole, moved off the rail on the far turn, chased the winner
willingly in the stretch, gained gradually on that foe late but missed while able to get the place. LULLABY LAND bumped with a foe at the start and was off a
step slow then dropped back, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear under some restraint, was removed from cover near the half-mile pole then
advanced quickly to make an early move, made a bid in the four path going around the far turn, pursued the winner on the outside in the drive and finished
with good courage but missed the place while clear for the show. RHEAUME was taken under a tight hold early then rated on the outside in the two to three
path, came under urging on the far turn, chased under a drive into the stretch and came up empty. UNION DOLLY quickly went clear then dropped in while
taken in hand, showed the way on the inside, was swallowed up with three furlongs to run and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

SHE CAUGHT MY EYE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch facing some pressure from TOWERING
GAZE to the outside through moderate splits, tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside, drifted out through the final sixteenth while gamely holding sway to the prevail at the end. SA
FORADADA coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide down the backstretch before tucking inside with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole and tipped out four wide into upper stretch, rallied to loom boldly outside the aforementioned foe through the final furlong shying out
slightly as that rival drifted but was ultimately repelled to the finish. TOWERING GAZE prompted the pace loosely between foes three then two wide, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. GAGLIANO got away to an awkward beginning when brushing the near
side stall in a lunging action forcing the rider to pull on the bit, chased along the inside sluggish early quickly growing detached from the main body of the
field while taking up the rear, continued along the inside through the turn and went five to six wide into upper stretch well behind and was eased home to the
wire. DOLCE SERA four then three wide in aim of the front outside the top pair, began to back away nearing the quarter pole when bumped solidly by
CHAYSENBRYN when that rival suffered an injury, got altered out into upper stretch getting brought to a canter a furlong out before being pulled up with a
sixteenth to go, then had the rider dismount and walk her the rest of the way to the finish before being examined by veterinarian and walked off under her
own power. CHAYSENBRYN chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, suffered an injury to the right front nearing the quarter
pole bumping with DOLCE SERA just prior to being expertly pulled up by the rider and had to be euthanized on track.

DREAMPOINT settled off the pace, was roused between foes while two then three wide on the turn, rallied outside to get the lead in upper stretch,
responded well under threat from the runner-up into the final sixteenth, drifted out under a left-handed crop while fending off the runner-up late and held
sway. CAPTAIN PARTY settled towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn, was held-up behind horses at the three-eighths, moved forward while
shifting to the two path late on that bend, spun three wide into the stretch then tipped further out while rallying, chased the winner on the outside into the
final sixteenth, shied out off heels when that opponent drifted out late and was turned away while clear for the place. LT. MITCHELL was well placed just off
the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, steadied while blocked behind horses near the three-sixteenths, altered course
towards the outside outside the furlong marker, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened. PRINCE OF TROY was last to commence then
reserved under a tight hold, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SCREW LOOSE stalked the pace
on the outside, was given his cue while three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, dropped back under a drive
into the final furlong and tired. HERONEANDONLY went to the front, showed the way while inside of a foe, moved to a solo lead near the half-mile pole,
raced inside on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. UNAFFECTED had his
saddle adjusted behind the gate, dropped back on the outside, angled in late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. ONE FOR
MY BROTHER settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and came up empty.
FOLLOWING A JOCKEY CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF CAPTAIN PARTY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AGAINST DREAMPOINT IN THE FINAL
SIXTEENTH. THE STEWARDS' MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. THREE QUARTER FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A
TIMING ISSUE.

Footnotes
BERT BERT BERT brushed the off side stall when breaking out at the start and bumped and squeezed back PAPI ON ICE in tandem with STRONG LIGHT,
conceded three to four lengths to the front and chased three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped three to four wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged away under a drive to prevail. OUR SON JAKE prompted the leader from the outside in the four path
before advancing on that rival in tandem with STRONG LIGHT with nine-sixteenths to go, took over command tucking to the two path nearing the half mile
pole and showed the way through the turn patiently handled until set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a
furlong out, kept on clear of the rest to preserve the place honors. STRONG LIGHT bobbled at the start recovering inwards to bump and squeeze back PAPI
ON ICE in concert with BERT BERT BERT, chased four then three wide advancing on the top pair suddenly with nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths and swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, couldn't sustain the move and flattened out in the late stages.
SCOTTO four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced through to the
finish. PAPI ON ICE got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was squeezed back at the start conceding about five lengths to the front,
chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild late bid. GOING IN STYLE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and tired. SORPRESO showed brief speed from the three path down the backstretch under prompting to the outside, tucked inside
with nine-sixteenths to go under threat from a pair and yielded near the half mile pole, got coaxed along fading through the turn along the inside, continued
in the inside route into upper stretch and folded.

LA CONQUISTADORA bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked
near the quarter-pole, fought off multiple challengers in the stretch and held gamely under strong urging. BOMB SQUAD went three wide on the first turn,
was rated just off the pace under a tight hold, saved ground on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong,
gained in the two path into the final sixteenth and finished willingly to just get the place. THE SPLENDID ONE broke out and bumped with a rival, saved
ground while keen under snug restraint on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved
further out, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining around the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy to just miss the place while
able to get the show. ARISAEMA bumped with a rival at the start, bumped with that same foe nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was
reserved off the pace, bumped with a rival near the nine-sixteenths, traveled three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in
the drive and lacked the needed kick. DREAM ON CARA was bumped at the start, bumped with foes on both sides nearing the first turn, tugged on the bit
under stout restraint while between foes in the two path going around that bend then was taken under a tighter hold while off heels, moved in near the
three-quarter pole, saved ground on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and improved position. SILENT MELODY was a bit slow into stride, bumped
with a rival nearing the first turn, saved ground while rank on that bend then checked off heels, was reserved towards the rear, moved from the rail to the
two path on the final turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and failed to rally. SHE'S A NATURAL was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths,
went five wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside without cover, rounded the far turn in the four path while let out, came under a drive while in
striking range in upper stretch but lacked the needed response. SPERSS bumped with a foe just after the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, was
rated off the pace, moved out and bumped with a foe near the nine-sixteenths, was asked in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch
and also lacked the needed kick. PINSTRIPEPIZZO bumped with a rival just after the start then was taken in hand, tugged on the bit while eager in the four
path on the first turn, dragged her way forward entering the backstretch then stalked on the outside, issued a challenge near the seven-sixteenths, vied in
the two path on the far turn, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated.

Footnotes
BUSTIN BAY established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper
stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one and was able to hold for the place honors on the wire. MY FIRST LOVE four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. MIA BEA STAR got bumped at the start lightly by SISTER
LINDA, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SISTER
LINDA broke out coaxed from the start and bumped MIA BEA STAR lightly, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to
four wide into upper stretch and weakened. RIBOT'S VALENTINE chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
MID DAY IMAGE bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed inside of two foes then was eased back off the pace, moved out while well placed behind
the leading duo, stalked that pair while two then three wide on the turn, rallied to the lead in the five path into upper stretch then kicked clear, responded well
in the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. HEAVEN STREET made light contact with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, was
roused in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner to the finish and
earned the place. GUN IT bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was roused while two to three wide on the turn, advanced into a
reasonable striking position before the quarter-pole, moved out outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while along for the show.
SLIPSTREAM broke in then was corrected by the rider, dropped back on the outside early then angled to the rail, saved ground while asked on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, steadied behind horses approaching the furlong marker, hesitated while attempting to go between those foes inside
the that marker, split horses outside the sixteenth-pole and missed the show. SOUPER SUCCESS bumped with a rival at the start, set the pace under
pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead late on that bend, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. COMEDY
TOWN pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the turn, took a short lead late on that
bend, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ONE HEADLIGHT three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path through that bend before tipping back out three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing angling three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and
offered up a good finish to close outside of rivals to take command seventy yards from home then inched away to the end. SLAPINTHEFACE just off the
inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and rallied with good energy to be in
the midst of seizing command when ONE HEADLIGHT went on by to the outside and was along for the place honors on the wire. TONY O broke out at the
start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside in aim of the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch,
tipped out to the two path with three-sixteenths to run and offered up a mild kick to just get up for the show honors in the final jumps. STOW ON THE WOLD
established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught in the final seventy yards to the
finish. FERRIS MULER broke out at the start bumping VALENTINO'S HERE, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just of the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the wire. VINCE THE PRINCE forwardly placed just off the inside tracking
the leader in closest aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two then three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the stretch.
VALENTINO'S HERE got bumped at the start by FERRIS MULER, raced just off the inside through the first turn before chasing three to four wide down the
backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn bumping ZAPRUDER to the two path, went seven wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an
impact. ZAPRUDER four wide into the first turn, tucked quickly to the two path and chased two to three wide, was briefly three wide heading to the far turn
when bumped back to the two path by the aforementioned foe, angled six wide into upper stretch and came up empty. OVER THE CAP dwelt at the start
getting away last and conceding six to seven lengths to the front, chased along the inside through the opening bend and then two to three wide down the
backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. MUDVILLE NINE four then
three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path by midway, chased three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, went four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
