early then finished with good late energy. INDIRECTLY saved ground off the pace, angled wide in the stretch and gained without threatening. LONG TERM
THINKING dropped far behind on the turn and offered a mild bid wide. ONE SLICK START raced close up three wide down the backstretch and faded.
MANAHAWKIN lagged far behind and was never in contention. PYLON earned a narrow lead inside through the opening quarter then stopped.

swung eight wide in the stretch and closed well to gain place. TAP THE CANDY bid into the far turn, angled wide advancing in the stretch and continued
gamely. C C GOLDRUSH hustled to clear inside, vied through on the final turn and finished willingly. DEPLANE dropped back early and narrowed the gap
without menacing. DON'T BLAME FREDDY saved ground throughout and lacked a solid rally. KING SWANSBORO lacked speed and finished willingly
