Footnotes
CATALINA QUEEN broke well from along the inside to take immediate command, set a pressured pace into the turn along the rail, shook clear of nearest
pursuer turning for home, steadily increased advantage to the wire. BARRANCA angled in steadily the opening furlong, pressed the winner from the outside
into and through the early part of the turn, could not keep up with that rival through the lane, fully extended to save the place. SABERFIGHT lacked early
foot just off the inside, continued in the two path out of the turn, rallied through some traffic down the stretch, finished up willingly to be getting to the runner
up late. ROARING QUINN in mid pack early, moved closer in the turn off the inside, dropped to the rail past the furlong, continued to show some mild
interest late but was outkicked for the show spot. A P HUMOR last to leave, lagged up the backstretch and through the turn, came three wide for the drive,
found best stride too late. APRIORITY GIRL within striking distance in heading up the second flight early, weakened through the stretch. ASTRO FLASH
void of early foot, raced five wide through much of the turn, improved position slightly by picking off a couple of tiring rivals. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT in the
second flight early, backed up along the inside. GLADS LOVE CAT in mid pack up the backstretch, faded down the lane. CONTINENTAL RED shuffled
back in traffic after a furlong, continued to fade through the stretch. A CLAIM FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MISS HURRYUPNWAIT AGAINST THE RUNNER
UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE UP THE BACKSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
CAJUN CONNECTION bothered slightly just after the break, moved up to head up the second flight off the inside, continued closest to the leader through
the final turn, drifted out upper stretch, was righted and closed with good resolve late to be up at the wire to gain the nod. BEAUDEAN broke outward but on
top, showed the way through the first turn, clear in the run up the backstretch through some soft fractions, continued to hold a clear lead into the stretch,
nipped late, well clear of the others. BUCK'S GLORY in the second flight off the rail, three wide through the final turn, floated out by the winner nearing the
furlong grounds, proved no match for the top two late. KAT'S SOLDIER bothered when the runner up broke outward then was bumped by an outer rival to
be last away, improved with a run through the far turn off the inside then flattened out in the run through the stretch while finishing up inside. ANGOLA
VACATION bumped at the break with CAMEO TRICK, settled off the pace in the second pace, lacked a closing response. SAUCY ARGUMENT void of
early foot, moved closer four wide into the far turn, went flat through the lane in weakening. CAMEO TRICK broke out to bump with ANGOLA VACATION
then came in to bump KAT'S SOLDIER, pulled in traffic first turn, checked when in tight early backstretch, remained back. CREOLE REB broke in, remained
back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
FIRINGTOTHEFRONT in the second flight toward the inside early, raced in the two path when still pursuing the lead group through the turn, tipped out three
wide when straightened for home, rallied with determination to be up in time. EXPECT OURS vied up front closest to the inside up the backstraight, dueled
through the turn remaining on the rail,disposed of the other speed in upper stretch, clear until late, nailed in the final strides. TAPIT RIGHT broke out and
lastly, lacked speed into the turn, same some ground through the turn and rallied up the inside to be in time for the show, not a serious threat to the top pair.
AMARDINE lacked speed, raced three wide through the turn, switch out in upper stretch, staged a mild rally to improve position. LA TRESS GRAY broke
out, settled in mid pack out in the course, came four wide for the drive, drifted out late. CHARLIE'S PEAK vied up the backstretch between horses, dueled
outside the runner up through the turn then faltered through the stretch. CONDESA'S HANDMAID with the early pace three wide, got out early in the turn to
fall back off the lead pack, continued to fade through the lane. ISOLATION in tight at the start, four out to five wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally
while near the outside rail late.

Footnotes
WHY JOEY WHY in the main body while racing outside, four wide into the lane, kept coming late to be up in time. GALAXY BUILDER outrun early toward
the inside, advanced along the inside into the lane, split foes a furlong out, finished up willingly to be in time for the place. PRAY IDE SING forwardly placed
off the inside, chased the leader into and through upper stretch, challenged with a sixteenth remaining inside the winner, could not match that one late,
outkicked in the waning strides to lose the place. FLUFFPOINT in mid pack well out in the strip, four wide exiting the turn, lacked a closing punch to finish up
evenly. CURTIN'S UP took command after start, shook clear turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going
to lose several positions. GRACIDA broke back, lacked speed well wide, came in the five path for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not
posing a serious threat. I'M LOOKING UP chased the early leader, began a steady retreat after three furlongs. SET HUT fell back after the start and failed to
menace. REECE'S PRIORITY off a step slow, was used to advance the opening furlong, gave way late in the turn.

Footnotes
MEAN CRUISER prominent early along the inside, fell steadily back, moved out and came five wide for the drive, engaged the leader inside the furlong
grounds and wore that rival down under firm handling in a determined effort. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY stalked the leader while racing off the inside, engaged
that one far turn, took over in upper stretch, clear last the furlong marker, responded when the winner challenged soon after and gave ground grudgingly to
that rival, remained clear of the others. GRAHAM 'S CRUISER chased the leader toward the inside, two path for the drive, finished up best of the rest in
lacking a closing kick. GENERAL EISENHOWER away in good order from the outside, sprinted clear, set the pace for six furlongs then began to gave way
when headed by the runner up turning for home. TIN DELAY off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run.
COURAGEOUS TIMMY in the second group early, gradually weakened. HOPE FOR CHANGE settled off the pace and the inside, lacked a rally. CARRIES
MAN broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.

CALIFORNIA BELLE in the main body early outside, ranged up to challenge late in the turn while four wide, vied into the lane, set down firmly, drove clear
the final furlong. SHE'S MY LOUIE V. back off the early pace and the inside, challenged between rivals into the stretch, raced on equal terms with the

drive, along late for the show. PINTORA away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, vied while remaining closest to the rail of the lead pack
through the turn, steadily weakened through the lane. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW in the second group out in the strip, challenged three wide and inside that

racing four to five wide through the turn. COURTING RANDI devoid of speed while well reserved and far back, picked off a couple of tiring foes late with
some modest late interest. MEAN DREAMER balked at loading, broke sharp, dueled off the inside, stopped in the turn. BALTIMORE BABE always outrun,

Footnotes
COUNTRY LADY moved up outside to join the leaders before two furlongs, dueled in the two path through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and
maintained daylight to the finish under steady handling. FOR REAL ALICE bothered at the break to be off slowly, lacked speed, improved inside of some
foes turning for home, briefly waited in traffic past the furlong marker, split foes then finished up willingly to earn the place. BUILDING HOME back off the
pace inside, continued to save ground in the second flight turning for home, steered out for the drive, outkicked for the second spot late. TWO JET in mid
pack off the rail, set down for the drive, mild late interest, not enough for the show. BE A BANDIT lacked speed, asked along late in the turn, failed to muster
a rally. DEBBIES PASSAGE broke out, was straightened to set the early pace inside, dueled along the rail with the winner turn, gave way in the drive.
CCED FOR STEPH failed to menace while racing four wide. MY KIKI briefly paced forward while off the inside, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
ROLL ON OUT broke on top, angled in while narrowly showing the way up the backstretch, continued to hold a narrow advantage while inside a pair of
rivals through the turn, shrugged them off to be clear when straightened for home, enough left to hold off the runner up. AWESOME CAJUN in mid pack
while well out in the strip, four to five wide turn, rallied down the middle of the strip and was going well at the end to be rapidly getting to the winner.
PALLATON behind the first flight outside, four wide into the lane, lacked a winning response to finish up best of the rest. ARKANSAS ZONG vied up front
outside winner and between foes for three furlongs, weakened a bit in the drive, caught late for the show. MARVINS' WARRIOR with the pace three wide,
also began to falter after three furlongs and entering the stretch. WILDCATS'S MEOW fell back to trail through the turn, improved position with some belated
interest. CRAFTY ONE lacked speed while well wide, continued in the five path through the turn, improved position slightly while picking off a couple of tiring
rivals. MIDGE'S TIME hopped at the start to be last away, remained back. RUNAWAY JIM was finished early. TYLER'S SENSATION in mid pack for three
furlongs while saving ground, backed up through the stretch.
