Footnotes
RUMBLING THUNDER rushed from outset, gained first command, and refused to relish that command for a gate to wire score. BURTNJOE stalked the
front runner through the turn, rated close up at the head of the stretch, and finished well clear of the rest but was unable to catch the winner.
EURONTHEMONEY settled in between rivals, trekked two wide around the turn, and prevailed in the stretch duel for the show. REMEMBER ME TONY
established an inside stance behind the pacesetter, locked into a stretch battle for show, but was outdueled in final sixteenth for those honors. EXCITING
was unhurried along the backstretch, trailed the field around the bend, and improved placing in the closing strides. TIZ STRONG lacked a needed rally after
settling into the second flight and losing ground to rivals with a three wide journey. OVER EZ settled into the second flight, rated as the widest of four
abreast around the turn and lost ground to rivals by doing so.

MONEY EXPRESS rushed from outset and gained first command, led the field at every call, was challenged to a stretch duel and prevailed for a wire to wire
score. OKIE CHROME trekked widest of all through the first turn, closed the gap on front runner through the closing bend, locked into a stretch duel, but
was bested by that rival. AMMENTHEDESTROYER saved ground and chased the pacesetters through both turns, and proved best of rest while no match
for top pair. SUPER SIZER lacked a need rally after settling into mid pack and giving chase from between rivals. HAMMER DOWN saved ground to no
avail. LITTLE MAD MAX failed to threaten while trailing from outset.

REVEREND AJ rushed form outset and led every step of the way while steadily widening the margin. BAYRON chased rivals from a back rated pose,
circled three wide around the turn, and rallied to procure place honors. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR settled in between foes along the backstretch, led the second
flight at upper stretch, then faded in closing strides. OGA BEAR established a ground saving stance, chased the pacesetter around the turn and weakened
in final furlong.

Footnotes
RIVER RULER stalked the pacesetting duo through the opening half, angled out to three wide at upper stretch, and got up in the three way stretch duel for
the victory. GRAB THE MUNNY broke alertly, set the pace in concert from a two path pose, locked into a three way stretch duel, and was bested by RIVER
RULER. SPANISH HOMBRE hustled from outset, set the pace in tandem as the inner rival, was headed at upper stretch, then was outdueled in final
sixtenth. UNITED PATRIOT lacked a needed rally after giving chase from a ground saving stance. RONALD DALE trekked wide through the opening turn,
gave chase from a back rated pose along the backstretch, and failed to improve position in closing strides. GENTRIFIED settled into the second flight,
trekked the two path, and failed to threaten.

RUNNIN BOOTS pressed the pace from a two path stance, responded to urging at upper stretch and dug in for the score in late strides. DEVINE CANDY
rushed from outset and led the field from a ground saving pose around the turn, was challenged to a stretch duel, then was nailed at the wire and forced to
settle for place honors. SHOOTIN RUN showed reserve along the backstretch, tucked to save ground through the bend, and rallied along the rail for the
show. LITTLE MO BROWN trekked wide while rating mid pack before floating inward in the homestretch and finishing evenly. SWEETASLIFECANBE
settled into mid pack and travelled the two path around the bend, but lacked a needed rally in closing stages. BOTTLES AN BIBLES trailed the field in early
stages before passing tiring rival in late going. SWEET ISABELLE was unhurried along the backstretch, shifted in near the eighth pole, and tired in late
strides.

FANCY PAYNTER pressed the pace from a two path stance, gained command at the head of the stretch and got up for the score. LANGMEAD hustled from
outset, set the pace in concert as the inner rival, rated two wide at upper stretch, locked into a stretch duel, then was nipped at wire for the score. RYAN
EXPRESS showed reserve through the opening half before rallying along the rail to procure the show. FORT NECESSITY showed reserve from outset,
closed the gap on front runners by rushing up along the backstretch, rated close up as the widest of five abreast at upper stretch, and finished willingly but
was unable to run down the leaders. KANT CONQUER ME lacked a needed rally after giving chase from a four path pose and rating close up and four wide
t upper stretch. TIZKANDOIT trekked wide around the first turn and tucked to save ground late to no avail. GOSPEL BONANZA was unhurried and failed to

Footnotes
LOCK UP YOUR PETS rushed from outset, established a comfortable margin and finished in hand for a wire to wire score. TATER showed reserve through
the opening bend, circled rivals to advance on pacesetter along the backstretch, rated three wide at upper stretch, and earned the place with stiff drive in
final furlong. KYEMBEA settled into mid pack while travelling the two path, rated between rivals at upper stretch then was bested in a stretch duel and
forced to settle for the show. GOSPEL DANDY weakened at the end of a ground saving journey. TOMMY TSUNAMI was unhurried from outset, established
an inside stance, saved ground throughout, and was no threat. JOAN'S JUNIOR trekked the two path from a back rated stance, and lacked a needed rally in
the end.
