LOUELLA STREET controlled the pace, was collared into the stretch, resisted a strong challenge and edged clear again. CONNELMAURA stalked the pace
inside, angled out on the turn, bid but could not get by the winner. SEIVER faded after half a mile in the two path then rallied mildly in the lane. ISLAND
BELLE raced off the pace inside and continued well while no threat. FANCY SCEPTER raced close up under urging three wide, proved empty in the stretch.
COLETTE'S SPIRIT lacked speed and moved very wide on the final turn and stretch. MISBEHAVING LADY pressed the winner to the final turn and gave
way. INCOMPARABLE dropped back after the start and trailed throughout. PER RULING FROM HISA, LOUELLA STREET WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR

Footnotes
RABBIT quickly took control, remained clear then widened in the final eighth under mild urging. SPIRIT SKY saved ground throughout and continued well
while no threat. VIRAL VIDEO raced outside in midpack and rallied for a dead heat for third. SEPARATE WAYS raced in closest pursuit of the winner and
weakened in the stretch. SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE sluggish at the break, moved to contention then was no factor. GO EAST raced just off the pace three
wide and proved empty in the stretch. PRIVATE CABANA chased off the pace and lacked a rally. WHOOSH dropped far behind wide and was never in
contention. T'WAS THE NIGHT dropped back early and trailed throughout.

FOGGY NIGHT settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out in hand on the turn, led at the top of the stretch and drew off easily. CELTIC TIGER vied for
the lead outside, led briefly on the turn and continued gamely while no match. AVATAL HERO forced the pace along the inside and began tiring after half a
mile. GOLDIENESS lacked speed outside and was never a factor. CARLOTUK moved closer three wide into the far turn and had no further response.
SUNDRIA trailed early racing wide and was never in contention. CLOUDY TIMES raced within range early then gave way readily.

pacesetter, bid on the final turn, dueled the winner but could not get by. RUN FOR KARL settled inside, angled out on the final turn, continued willingly. LT'S
JACKNTHEBOX settled inside, was blocked repeatedly and steadied along through the stretch. SPARTAN BOY saved ground off the pace and lacked a
rally. JEWELS IN THE BAY rated in the two path and was never a factor. I'M NOT A BABY raced wide off the pace and began fading after half a mile. IT'S A
PITY close up three wide, was asked for run on the final turn then faded. FIRST SQUAD lacked speed and raced far behind throughout.
