Footnotes
HARLOW'S HARMONY led the field up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and dug in the lane, holding clear to the finish.
MISSMOLLYORBIT chased the leader up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and dueled to the wire but could not get by
the winner. STRABELLA raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, began a mild bid while racing in the three path around
the turn and chased the top two home in the stretch. I'M SO FUNNY raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and finished evenly. MIDNIGHT LANE was pinched back leaving the gate, trailed the field through the early going, navigated the turn
from the four path and never threatend. SUMMER FIREFLYS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the bend and faded in the stretch. THE MARGINS FOR THIS RACE WERE ESTIMATED BY EQUIBASE.

ONE IN VERMILLION led the field on the outside up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn, was headed in
upper stretch and battled back gamely to edge clear near the wire. XAVEY DAVE pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
dropped back to chase the leader from the three path coming around the bend, launched a bid entering the stretch and dueled to the wire but could not get
by the winner. MY KACEJJ bobbled slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and improved position in the
lane while never threatening the top two. FRANZ raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. CASEY'S LAW chased
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.

MINISTER OF SOUL dueled on the outside up the backstretch, led from the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane, much the best. SHIP IT RED
stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and chased the winner home in the stretch,
no match for that rival. CENTRAL PARK chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and kept on in the
lane, no threat to the winner. DEFLATER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the bend in the two path and was outkicked in the
lane. CITRUS BAY trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and made no bid. TAPPED TO THE MAX dueled on the
inside up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.
