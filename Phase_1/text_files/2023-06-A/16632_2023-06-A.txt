Footnotes
LAST CALL LONDON broke a hair slow but still came away with the others, stalked in hand along the inside then waited for room a bit off the rail behind the
top pair leaving the bend, roused and split foes in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole, then kicked clear under strong handling and won going away.
MR. DREAMCYCLE set the pace under pressure from THIRSTY GAMBLER, dueled around the turn and into the lane, put away that rival in upper stretch
but was soon challenged by LAST CALL LONDON and lost command at the eight pole, then stayed on through the final furlong to secure second. BURAQ'S
REFLECTION raced up close three deep early, chased two to three wide around the bend, put to left handed urging in the lane and was along for the show.
MICI'S EXPRESS tracked from outside, three to four wide outside a pair of rivals on the bend and could not rally. THIRSTY GAMBLER prompted the pace
from outside, moved up on even terms around the turn, fought to upper stretch, then weakened in the furlong grounds. DATSYUK was reluctant to load
before eventually going in the gate, broke slow from inside, chased off the rail then two wide into the turn, ran up behind rivals and lacked room on the turn,
angled five wide into the stretch and could not make an impact.

LOVE OUR FAMILY took control outside SENT BY ANGELS early then crossed over on that rival into the first turn, took some pressure early on the
backstretch before moving clear again, met the challenge from MIDNIGHT SILENCE entering the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging and kicked clear
from the runner-up entering the furlong grounds and padded the winning margin while continuing to drift out in the late stages. MIDNIGHT SILENCE tossed
her head and was off slow to begin then moved into range two then three wide, tugged into the backstretch and pulled up alongside the leader, chased past
the five-eighths pole, bid two wide into the lane, was bothered by LOVE OUR FAMILY and had to steer off that rival in upper stretch, lost touch into the final
furlong and kept on for a clear second. SHAMBALA GIRL took back back then chased along the inside early, eased out around the clubhouse turn to the
four path, traveled three then four wide into the lane, could not summon the needed rally and managed to save third. PRESTIGIOUS was off slow to begin,
trailed two wide early, raced along the rail into the far turn, came out and was asked four wide around the bend but failed to threaten. SENT BY ANGELS
had early speed inside the leader before getting shuffled into the first turn, tipped off the fence to give chase two wide, angled in on the far turn and saved
ground to the stretch while dropping back and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SAULS CALL had speed outside GOLDENSUNRISE early before moving clear, drew away on the inside around the bend, padded the lead in upper stretch
and held well under right-handed encouragement. FORGIVING SPIRIT moved just before the gates opened and came away a step slow, was reserved in
the early going off the inside, bothered by rival coming out slightly into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane, unleashed a late run but ran out
of time. BARELY FUNTIONAL got brushed leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside, angled out and exited the in the four path, rallied in the drive
and gained the show. TRUMPED tracked outside a rival leaving the backstretch, tipped three wide around the bend, asked in the lane but needed to find
more late. UNCLE JOHN bumped leaving the gate, stalked from inside, steadied briefly into the turn, continued inside and cut the corner while closest in
pursuit in to the lane, drifted in the lane and lacked a late bid. MY RANSOM broke in to brush rival, trailed on the inside into the turn, shifted to the two path
around the bend and never threatened. GOLF DRAMA brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, raced outside a rival at the back early, angled to the rail
on the turn and failed to make an impact. GOLDENSUNRISE bobbled and bumped leaving the gate, showed early speed inside the winner then ceded
control and moved off the inside, chased two wide into the turn, started to weaken around the bend and faded in the lane. PER THE HORSE RACING
INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, FORGIVING SPIRIT HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

range off the rail, came three wide into the drive, failed to produce a bid and got edged for the show honors. THIRSTY LOV got bumped around from both
sides early, raced between rivals at the rear, bumped twice with THIRSTY MOE approaching the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend three wide and failed

ESCAPE ARTIST stumbled a bit for a few strides leaving the gate, took a forward position three then two wide early, drew alongside the pacesetter past the
quarter pole, quickly cleared in upper stretch and drew off under mild urging. REXFORD stalked along the inside through both turns, tipped out into the lane,
could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but bested the others. EASTBOUND chased three then two wide off the pace, asked three deep around the
far turn, tipped out widest in the lane and got up for third three deep late. RANSOMWARE stalked in the two path, spun three wide into the lane and got
edged for third between rivals late. STAR PROSPECT settled near the inside then moved into the two path, continued two wide into the lane and lacked a
rally. CASTLEKNOCK cleared quickly and moved inside, remained unchallenged for six furlongs, gained company leaving the far turn, yielded in upper
stretch and retreated through the final furlong. ACQUIRED CLASS was off a bit slow at the start, raced along the inside at the back early, inched closer in
the middle stages, saved ground to the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL BUSINESS had speed three deep early then chased the leader past the half-mile pole, bid three deep around the turn, took over and clear in
upper stretch when asked right and left-handed, then drew off and was ridden out to the wire. FRIED ASPARAGUS was rank in the early going then got put
in a bit tight chasing between rivals at the half-mile pole, went two wide into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally
and gained second. SUGAR SUGAR stalked four then three deep, went four wide into the stretch and gained the show. TENACIOUS LADY chased
between early, two to three wide on the turn, drifted to the fence in the lane and was not a threat. STORM D'ORO pressed from between early then chased
past the half-mile pole, challenged again between runners around the bend, could not go on with the winner in upper stretch and weakened in deep stretch.
TOBY'S CANDY gained the front inside a pair of rivals then cleared at the half-mile pole, challenged again on the turn and held a short lead over outer pair
to the top of the lane, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. ZZYZX stalked the pace from inside, cut the corner into
the lane and came up empty.

WIZARD OF WESTWOOD cleared in-hand early and controlled the pace from inside, took some pressure leaving the clubhouse turn before clearing again
on the backstretch, challenged again with a quarter mile remaining, responded to urging and disposed of MI HERMANO RAMON into the final furlong and
stayed clear under a drive to the wire. MALTESE FALCON (IRE) bothered by inner rival leaving the gate, steered down to the inside racing at the back,
continued along the rail towards the rear into the far turn, tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths pole, rallied in the lane and got up for the place. MI
HERMANO RAMON broke out, stalked off the rail and then drew alongside the leader on the clubhouse turn, lost touch with that rival but remained close in
the middle stages, reengaged WIZARD OF WESTWOOD with a quarter mile left to run, failed to sustain the challenge entering the final furlong, kept on
through the late stages but got edged for second. SMART UNCLE was keen early when trying to rate, trailed two wide around the clubhouse turn, angled in
on the last bend, tipped out in the lane and improved position. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) bobbled leaving the gate but still came away near the front,
entered the stretch for the first time four wide, settled outside a rival, chased two wide to the lane and lacked a rally. EL PERFECTO traveled in mid-pack on
the inside, asked right-handed at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. WORCESTER chased four wide into the stretch for the first time, went three
then two wide around the clubhouse turn, spun three wide into the stretch and could not rally.

AMERICAN ADMIRAL chased in the two path out of range then moved closer leaving the clubhouse turn, tipped three wide to launch a bid between rivals,
took over in upper stretch and cleared rivals on both sides with a furlong left to run, then drew away in deep stretch. MISSED THE CUT broke a step slow,
chased three wide outside AMERICAN ADMIRAL early, bid three deep at the quarter pole, fought to upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the late
stages and kept on for second. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH dueled outside IT'S MY HOUSE into the first turn then ceded control around the bend, moved up to
challenge again in the middle stages and took over a the half-mile pole, dueled into the far turn, cleared briefly at the five-sixteenths pole, challenged by a
pair of outside rivals with a quarter mile left to run, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened to third. IT'S MY HOUSE dueled from inside then
cleared around the first turn, dueled again in the middle stages and lost command at the half-mile pole, fought to the three-eighths pole then lost touch with
MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH midway around the far turn, asked with the right-hand at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane.

IRRESISTIBLE FORCE dueled for the lead from outside, disposed of RIDIN'THESTORMOUT past the quarter pole, drew away under left handed urging
and was kept to task in the final sixteenth. HOT TEA bothered by inner rival in the early going, moved to the rail giving chase while out of range, saved
ground through the bend, moved out in the drive, rallied and whittled the gap on the whinner while proving second best. SULTRY KITTEN stalked outside a
rival two wide, spun three wide into the lane and gained the show. MY MOON stalked along the rail into the turn, chased two wide into the drive, took aim at
the winner in upper stretch but flattened in the late stages. STRIKINGLY bumped and lost his path early, steered inward and traveled inside a pair of rivals
off the pace into the turn, moved off the fence in the lane and improved position. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT dueled for the lead inside IRRESISTIBLE FORCE
to the turn, kept the pressure on to the quarter pole, chased the winner into the lane and gave way. YOLO CALLS tracked off the rail then outside a rival,
took the turn two wide then moved out and lacked further response. ANNIE'S JOY bobbled leaving the gate, went three deep near the back into the turn,
remained three wide into the stretch, steered out further and failed to menace. FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER bumped in the hind-quarters early, raced between
rivals two wide into the turn, angled to the inside around the bend and was not a factor. BOLT'S GAL was off slow to begin, dropped far back early, eased in
the lane and walked off.
