Footnotes
THE FINAL FOOTNOTE was rushed up to take the lead from between horses through the turn then inched away and proved best. NOGAL CANYON raced
near the back to the turn while saving ground then moved out to four wide on the turn, tipped out to six wide in upper stretch to make a late rally and was
second best. EL OCHO stalked the pace from six wide down the backstretch then moved in to four wide on the turn, made a steady gain in the stretch and
was up for the sho. SEA OF INDY tracked the leader from between horses through the turn then moved out to three wide in the stretch, drifted out and
brushed with outside rival, kept on but was out finished. AL GRANO D ORO veered in at the start then hustled up to vie for the lead from the inside to the
middle of the stretch and tired. RIG IT RIGHT broke in and bumped with inside rival, was last through the turn then made a late mid track bid to improve
position. JR'S CONFIDENCE had no early speed through the turn, moved out to three wide in the stretch and passed tiring rivals. D C GUN RUNNER was
steadied at the start, roused to contention and was placed off the pace on the inside through the turn but lacked the late response. TOO HOT FOR YOU
was hustled away from the gate then vied for the lead from three wide to the quarter pole and gave way.
