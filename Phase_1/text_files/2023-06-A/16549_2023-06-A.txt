Footnotes
MILK MONEY settled off the early pace while in the two path, moved into the three path approaching the the turn, bid from there through the turn, gained the
lead into the lane, cleared with an eighth to go and widened. FLAT OUT FAY was in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, continued in the two
path through the lane and gained the place spot. GOLDEN DAME set the pace while in the two path into the turn, continued off the rail when joined by the
winner, could not stay with that one and finished very tired to last for the show spot. PEPPER SWEET was in the four to the three path through the turn
when in the back, continued in the three path for the drive and offered a belated gain. WOO WOO GIRL hustled up to contend before the first call, continued
along the rail through the turn, came off the rail into the lane and tired. FAR'S LAST ONE never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the
lane. AKEDAH raced along the inside through the turn, was done in late turn and was eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

E'S MAGIC vied for the lead while in the three path and two wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path while clearing on the lead, widened
to the eighth pole and continued to lengthen the advantage while being ridden out. TU CHA chased the winner from the three path through the turn,
continued in the three path into the lane, could not gain on the top one but stayed on to save the place spot. MYGALJUSTICE was in the two path through
the turn when in mid-pack, continued near the rail into the lane, could not gain on the winner but was closing in on the place spot and ended well clear from
the rest. ADDICTED TO LOVE never a menace while in the three or four path through the turn. ANAITA hopped, hit gate and nearly dislodged the rider,
raced along the inside through the turn and into the and never factor while ending in the six path. CLOSER TOTHE TRUTH chased the pace from the four
path through the turn, was asked for more near the quarter pole and tired after turning into the lane. ALLIE MAES REVENGE was outrun while in the two
path through the turn. INDIAN ZARA was a beat slow at the start, rushed up to contend and lead on the first call, vied with the winner into mid-turn then
faded along the rail.

the five path into the lane, gained on the leaders under a left-handed urging, caught the leader just inside the sixteenth pole and cleared. BARN STORMER
chased the pace from the two path through late turn, shifted into the three path into the lane, moved up to duel with the leader, gained the lead outside the
eighth pole then was no match for the winner while clear for the place spot. MAS ORO set the pace on a clear lead into late turn, was joined by the
runner-up into the lane, dueled with that one to inside the eighth pole and yielded. SECOND TO NO ONE was in the four path through the turn when
chasing several, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing bid. ST. CALVIN chased the pace three wide through the turn then tired through
the lane. SWITCHBACKJUSTICE chased the pace from the three path and between rivals through the turn then dropped back entering the lane along the
inside. AMERIGOROUND was outrun while near the inside.

Footnotes
LUCKY LESSON was unhurried while off the inside, asked for more from the two path into the far turn, swung into the lane from the five path with
momentum gained the lead nearing the sixteenth pole then held off the runner-up while brushing late. BEYOND OSCAR was off with an awkward start,
trailed for half while in the two path, moved quickly through late turn, entered the lane from the six path, closed in on the leader approaching the sixteenth
pole, brushed with that one late and missed. ARGAN was floated into the six path into the first turn, moved closer to the inside down the backstretch, raced
in the two path through the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole and was outfinished by the top two. MAGIC TIP
saved ground through the turn and into the lane and offered a mild gain. ANORIA set the pace on a clear lead into the turn then gave way after straightening
in the lane. GYPSY WANDERER never a factor while saving ground. STEPHANIESWARRIOR never a factor while off the inside. BELLA VALENTINA
chased the pace from the two path into the turn, was asked for more in late turn and was empty into the lane. PRETTY VEGAS was getting out into the first
turn taking a rival with her, raced near the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn and was done. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #5
BEYOND OSCAR AGAINST THE RIDER OF #1 LUCKY LESSON FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
BALI DOVE (FR) set the pace along the inside through the turn when on a clear lead, came off the rail and into the two or three path into the lane when still
clear then was all out to the end to hold sway. CLOVERTOWNE was in the two path through the turn when in mid-pack, shifted into the five path after
entering the lane and was full of run through the final sixteenth. LITTLE GIA saved ground through the turn and into the lane, cut the corner and rallied up
the rail. BRISBANE ROAD chased the pace from the two path into the lane, had aim on the top one but lacked the needed response. GRACE CANDY
chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and weakened inside the eighth pole. AMERICAN ODALISQUE
never a factor while near the inside. SIMPLY COMPLICATED stepped out at the start and was steadied, raced in the three path into the turn, was asked for
more in mid-turn but was never a threat. MIDNIGHT XO raced near the rail through the turn, shifted into the five or six path into the lane never factored.
BLUE BLUE BAYOU never a factor while near the back.
