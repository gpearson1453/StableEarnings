Footnotes
MO BLING vied for the lead and took the rail spot, settled in hands and set a false pace, continued to show the way into the stretch, was threatened by a
closing foe on the outside, angled out to meet that threat, leaving the rail open, where HANNAH'S HAVEN took advantage of the rail and passed taking the
lead, MO BLING quickly angled back towards the rail and battled for her lead, dug back in and found enough to take her lead back and win the race by a
head. MO BLING raced giving a super competitive, winning effort. HANNAH'S HAVEN stalked the early leaders while saving ground, rated for the first half
of a mile, inched up closer to the lead and patiently waited behind horses for racing room until after the quarter pole, seized the opportunity, passed up the
rail at the sixteenth pole, took the lead, found a charging MO BLING battling next to her, battled back but MO BLING had the momentum from charging back
across the track to meet HANNAH'S HAVEN, where HANNAH'S HAVEN tried but just missed, settled for second. MAGNA COLORS raced off the pace
three wide, started gaining ground at the half mile pole, edged out into the four and five paths circling the field in the turn was in contention at the quarter
pole, was encouraged and pushed down the stretch, struggled to switch leads and finished third. COURTLY DOC stalked the eventual winner from the three
path while racing in hands, advanced in between horses to challenge for the lead, had pressure for both the inside and outside while launching her bid at the
five sixteenth pole, then tired by the quarter pole. FUHR MEO raced wide through out and was never involved.

the turn, inched in towards the rail at the quarter pole, was in contention but still behind until the sixteenth pole, found room on the rail was cued and
responded with a good turn of foot racing up the rail clearing the early leaders and getting up for a game win. CALLINGINTHENIGHT raced in the two path

raced through the turn and into the stretch in a set of three, shook the rival to the outside, was passed by a hard charging inside rival and came out with
second place rights. EGO was off a touch slow, was allowed to settle and find his stride while being well off the pace, saved ground, closed up the rail with a
well timed clean trip, closed with conviction, up for third. SILENT TAP vied for the early lead, took the rail, set the pace, was joined and matched strides with
two other foes and battled until the sixteenth pole, was caught by an inside closer, tired late. I'M D'CAT made no impact. SOURNOIS was off the pace,

THE FEATURE stalked the early pace from the three path, started to gain ground after the three eighths pole, continued to build momentum while being
lightly encouraged in the stretch, collared the early leaders at the sixteenth pole was pushed and driven past those rivals to willingly draw away for the win.
LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG stalked the early leader until half mile marker, joined and matched strides on the outside while racing three wide, shook the inner
most foe at the sive sixteenth pole, continued battling through the stretch with the same rival, was caught by a late closer to the outside but held o for
second. SHARK HARBOR vied for the early lead, took the rail trip, set the early fractions in company with another rival, battled until the sixteenth pole where
these two leaders were both caught by the eventual winner, kept battling but didn't have enough and settled for third. JAZZ IT UP staked the early runners,
raced along the rail, was keen in the bridle early, was asked to relax and bring his head down while waiting behind horses, shuffled back a bit and showed
little after that. SUCH was no menace. MR. PRIORITY trailed.

Footnotes
ATTA PARTY was stalking the early leader from the two path, was on the bit and resisted rating, pulled himself next to early leader who raced along the rail,
willingly matched strides with this foe through the turn, shook this rival in the upper stretch, was joined by an inside attacker, battled with this rival, was cut
loose and drew off leaving the inside rival behind, was full of run and gamely took this win. CREME DE BALI was racing mid pack along the rail, was asked
to patiently wait, rated, tucked in behind horses until the rail opened up moving into the stretch, was given the cue, passed up the rail and closed with a nice
turn of foot, not enough for the win but a game second. WILTON was fractious in the gates, was off a step slow, raced off the pace, made one steady run,
four wide at the half mile pole, circled the field in turn, was in contention and six wide at the eighth pole, not enough. OCEOLA was three wide, vied for the
lead, stalked the pace just off the leader, challenged briefly with a mild bid. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE made no impact. KAHAAL was never involved.
BRAHMS BOY showed early speed and tired.
