Footnotes
KELSEY'S ANGEL rated close inside, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep midway on the far turn and dug in
determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game stretch effort of LINDA'S TAJ, who moved to the inside and rated the pace, cleared the challenge of
Don't Annoy Me past the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway through the far turn but dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding.
DON'T ANNOY ME tapered in and stalked two deep, challenged approaching the three eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths, raced in the
three path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. RIA FORMOSA saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. SWEET FACTOR saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. WAY LUCKY showed little response through the backstretch.
COASTING TO WIN stalked the early pace three wide then faded through the backstretch. AWESOME LUCKYCHARM hesitated leaving the gate, raced
well back, was eased after a half mile and walked off post race.

JUBA'S HAT TRICK took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, was urged away at the rail on the far turn then kept alert through the stretch.
O'RIGSBY saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn and came along for second
mid-stretch. DUNCAN IDAHO stalked the earlier pace three wide, picked up the chase approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn
then flattened the final sixteenth. HILLBILLY ROCK saved ground well off the pace, raced in the three path on the far turn and could only improve his
position. MONKEY WRENCH showed little response through the backstretch. OFFICER STONE stalked two deep, challenged approaching the three
eighths pole but dropped back toward the quarter, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened.

SEEMS TO WHISPER rated the pace inside, was met past the half mile pole and kept the edge over Bali Balifly leaving the seven sixteenths, drew clear at
the rail midway on the far turn then kept alert through the stretch. SUPERSNAKE settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn but proved no match in the stretch. APPEALING ROAD saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the half mile pole and entered the far turn near the rail, angled to the four path toward the head of the lane and finished evenly. HOV LANE
became anxious in the gate and came away awkwardly, rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn at the rail then flattened past the eighth pole. SHE'S MYBUDDYBUDDY raced well back inside on the first turn, gave chase past the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was eased to the five path toward the head of the lane and showed little further. HOVEL raced well back toward the
inside and showed little response through the backstretch. BALI BALIFLY stalked the early pace two deep, took a brief slim lead past the half mile pole and
dueled from that point, but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and gave way. GRASS CUTTER stalked three wide, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
BAAGY saved ground on the opening turn then bid into the backstretch, was blocked in the four path through most of the far turn, altered course to the
outside entering the stretch and dug in under steady handling to get up under the wire. JUNGLE BEAST settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the
chase leaving the half mile pole and raced in the six path on the far turn, took the nod leaving the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but
was nipped under the wire. OVERLY CRITICAL raced in the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn five wide, was bumped leaving the turn, lugged in across the path of Rad Paisley past the eighth pole, dueled to a brief slim lead past the eighth pole
but was outfinished in the final strides. BRISTOL CHANNEL rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met a the rail
past the quarter then flattened leaving the eighth pole. RAD PAISLEY settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn four wide, was forced outward and into Overly Critical leaving the turn, shut off past the eighth pole but came back to finish evenly.
ALPHA CHI RHO stumbled to his nose and nearly lost his rider a stride out of the gate, saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then lacked a clear lane in the stretch. KOZY'S WILDCAT raced in the three and four paths the
first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn three wide but drifted out and made contact with Rad Paisley leaving the turn
and flattened stride in the stretch. TRINGALE raced with the pace two deep and between horses, challenged toward the three eighth pole, continued close
through the far turn then gave way in the lane. After reviewing a claim of foul against the rider of Overly Critical for interference past the eighth pole, lodged
by the rider of Rad Paisley, the Stewards disqualified the former to fifth place for interfering with the progress of the latter past the eighth pole.

Footnotes
LIEUTENANT BROWN stalked from the two and three paths the first turn, took the lead three wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear
midway on the far turn and held on well with steady handling. REVEREND JACK had a brief early lead then stalked, started a bid toward the three eighths
pole and challenged approaching the five sixteenths, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and settled for second best.
COMEONTURNMELOOSE was forced five wide into the first turn and settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the
far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. CRUISE ON BY drifted into the first turn and settled off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the turn,
rounded the far turn about the five path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP closed to the front approaching the three
quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole, was met toward the five sixteenths and flattened at
the rail on the far turn. DISCREET LOVE came away awkwardly and dropped well back. REAL RICK was forced six wide into the first turn and never
factored. Big Bad Brass ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch.
