Footnotes
SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) raced in range off the inside, went two wide into the turn, drew closer three deep around the bend, challenged the leader
entering the lane, took over in upper stretch and held well under a drive. BELMONT BILL sped clear and showed the way early on, led along the rail through
the turn, engaged by the winner exiting the bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, stayed on gamely through the final furlong and held the place.
STONKS trailed up the backstretch, saved ground and passed a rival around the bend, angled out at the top of the stretch, rallied and got up for third.
STORM THE NIGHT tracked along the inside into the turn, tipped two wide with a quarter mile left to run then three wide into the lane, rallied in the drive but
got edged for the show honors. NAK NAK BOLT stalked the lone leader outside a rival, rounded the bend two wide then chased between into the lane, got
crowded a bit and brushed in upper stretch, then leveled off in deep stretch. O'BANION (IRE) stalked inside a rival up the backstretch, remained along the
rail through the turn, brushed with NAK NAK BOLT in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. WARRIOR ROAD broke well then chased near the back
in the early going, went wo wide into the turn, trialed three wide into the drive and tired.

STAY QUIET chased widest up the backstretch, asked four then three deep around the bend, confronted the leader passed the eighth pole, dueled into the
final sixteenth and edged away late. IT'S SAUL GOOD was off slow to begin, rushed up on the heels of the leaders and had to check early, bid three deep
and took over on the turn, led two wide into the lane, fought with STAY QUIET to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. LIGHTING AND REIGN bumped
leaving the gate, dueled from inside for command, vied with outer rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, moved off the inside and chased past the quarter pole,
came back on in the late stages and was gaining to the wire. KEEPYOURPRANCEON broke in to bump LIGHTING AND REIGN, dueled outside that rival to
the turn, vied between foes around the bend then chased while drifting out a bit into the lane, kept on through the drive while tipping off the fence late but
lost the show. LOVME LIKEAFOOL bobbled a bit for a few strides while still coming away quickest, chased the top pair into the turn, dropped back around
the bend and was no match in the stretch run.

Footnotes
EXULTATION bobbled and broke out in a quick start, rated up the backstretch, stalked along the rail then tipped two wide midway around the bend, drew
alongside the leader past the quarter pole, took a narrow lead at the eighth pole, battled through the final furlong and dug in to inch ahead from TOOK
CHARGE late. TOOK CHARGE sped clear to establish the front, led along the rail through the turn, cut the corner while holding short lead over
EXULTATION into the lane, lost command with a furlong remaining, battled back from inside and yielded grudgingly in the end. NATURAL POWER (IRE)
got crowded between rivals leaving the gate, settled near the back off the rail, chased two wide into the turn, lacked room behind rivals from the
five-sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, shifted to the inside shortly after, angled out in the lane and finished well outside the top pair late. FLY THE SKY was
off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground on the inside then had to pause briefly behind NATURAL POWER (IRE) past quarter pole, kept
on through the lane and improved position. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) stalked three wide into the turn, traveled four deep at the quarter pole and leveled
off in the final furlong. ECONOMICAL stalked the pace two wide into the turn, chased three deep at the quarter pole and weakened in the drive.

LOOKS RARE cleared early and crossed over to the inside nearing the clubhouse turn, got pressured by SECRET TREASURE in the middle stages,
disposed of that foes on the far turn, felt pressure from EXCEL CALCULATOR entering the stretch but responded to right handed encouragement and held
that rival at the bay. EXCEL CALCULATOR tracked three deep around the first turn, went four wide into the second ben, moved in a few paths to take aim
two wide into the stretch, chased the winner through the furlong grounds and could not summon the needed late kick while clearly second best. RIVERSIDE
checked in the two path early on the first turn, coaxed along two then three wide on the second bend and lacked the needed response in the late stages.
MUCINO chased near the inside then checked when LOOKS RARE came over early, stalked along the inside to the far turn, steadied inside a rival near the
five-sixteenths pole and could not rally in the lane. SECRET TREASURE was forwardly placed two wide early, moved up to apply pressure from outside,
could not keep up past the three-eighths pole and weakened in the lane.

LUCY L forwardly placed three wide early, bid three deep on the far turn, dueled outside FLATTERWITHJEWELS through the lane and proved best in the
end. FLATTERWITHJEWELS took control and moved inside, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, vied with outer rivals with a quarter mile left to run,
battled LUCY L down the stretch and was bested late. RENEGADE PRINCESS was keen early chasing near the inside, saved ground to the top of the lane,
raced head-high in upper stretch before settling down for the final furlong and kept on to earn the show honors. VANDALIA raced up close in the two path
then went up to prompt the pace from outside, vied between foes late on the far turn and into the start, could not kick on with the top pair in the furlong
grounds and weakened. IF YOU WANT IT tracked two wide early, raced outside a rival at the back on the far turn and three wide into the stretch and failed
to menace. BIG BELL lost her path shortly after the start, tugged on the inside into the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and came up empty
in the drive. PER RULING FROM HIWU, FLATTERWITHJEWELS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
PUSHINESS cleared quickly then crossed over, opened up around the turn, lightly coaxed in upper stretch and remained well clear without ever being
asked for her best. BORNTOSTAYTHIRSTY stalked PUSHINESS into the turn, was closest in pursuit from the two path through the bend, failed to make
any headway on the winner in the drive but was clearly second best. BIG RAINBOW bumped leaving the gate, raced along the rail into the turn off the pace,
tipped two wide around the bend and was along for the show. GRACEFUL SCARLETT tracked out of range on the inside into the turn, saved ground and
cut the corner into the lane but lacked the needed response when called upon. UNIFIED A. P. lost her footing at the start, trailed four wide into the turn,
moved out to the five path to go around rivals around the bend, remained wide to the stretch and failed to menace. HIGH FLYING GRACIE broke in and
bumped rival, chased between foes near the back into the turn, navigated the bend two to three wide and was not a factor. FIFTY STARS bobbled leaving
the gate, chased three deep off the pace early, went three to four wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
MISS LIZZY settled in a stalking position on the inside, tipped two wide past the quarter pole to take aim into the stretch, took over with a furlong remaining
and drove clear in the final sixteenth. AVENTAPP set the pace under pressure to the turn, cleared outer rival near the five-sixteenths pole, challenged in
upper stretch and relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and was outfinished in deep stretch. DADDY CLASSY DILL chased from inside through the turn,
cornered nicely into the drive, lacked a bid but was able to hold the show. IRISH PATSY broke in and bumped rival, sat off the pace early on, bumped with
inner rival entering the turn, angled out and came four wide into the lane and needed to find more to threaten late. ABHITA took a bump from IRISH PATSY
at the start, lost her action shortly after crossing back onto the turn then lagged behind, saved ground to the stretch and improved position. BLONDE
BOMBSHELL stalked outside a rival into the turn, raced two then three wide around the bend and weakened. SIGNORA MINISTER prompted the pace from
outside to the turn, could not keep pace with the leader midway around the bend, chased three wide into the stretch and weakened. ROUBAIX tracked
outside rivals early, rounded the bend four then three wide and came up empty.

Footnotes
HULK showed early speed four deep into the first turn then chased outside rivals around the bend, remained up close outside the top pair in the middle
stage, challenged on the far turn, cleared with a quarter mile remaining, met the bid from ICE STORM in the final furlong and held that rival at bay. ICE
STORM chased along the inside, waited for room while easing off the rail then was roused three wide on the far turn, drew alongside HULK in midstretch
but could not find the late punch to get by. TAKE CHARGE CURLY settled in the two path, moved closer up the backstretch from inside, angled out and
came four wide into the lane, could not make an impact on the top pair but finished a clear third. PORT ROYAL was along the three path off the pace into
the first turn then moved into the two path, steered out around the second bend and came five wide into the stretch, churned on to improve position but
could not threaten the top trio. DANZ TILL TEN pressed the pace from outside, took a brief lead at the five-sixteenths pole before being overtaken by the
winner, chased two wide into the drive and weakened. ROAD OF LOVE sent for the lead from inside and gained control inside rivals, set the pace under
pressure while under a hold, challenged by outer pair on the far turn and lost the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, started to weaken past the quarter pole and
tired in the lane. CAPIAT broke a bit slow, trailed three then two wide early, continued off the rail into the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and failed to
make an impact. STELLA BOY broke well and was prominent early three deep into the first turn, dropped back off the pace and moved in a bit, went three
wide into the last turn, came five wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.
