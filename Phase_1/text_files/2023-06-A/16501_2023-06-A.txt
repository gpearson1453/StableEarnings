ground to upper stretch vying along the rail proving no match for the winner while saving place. MOBOT slow early gained on the far turn angling wide in
upper stretch pressing to the wire. MACHO CASH raced evenly moving from mid track down the lane lacking punch. SPY TOWN hustled along cleared on
the backside then was hooked between horses to upper stretch giving way there. KNOCKOUT GUY hustled along through the far turn faded wide into upper
stretch. WHY WINCHILL WHY was always outrun. BLACK BULL was steadied on the first turn giving a wide middle move flattening out on the far turn.
