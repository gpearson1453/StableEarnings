Footnotes
NOBLE JON briefly dueled for the early lead, cleared before the first call, widened through the turn, continued to lengthen the advantage inside the eighth
pole and geared down through the last seventy yards. JACKSON STRONG was checked behind a rival near the half-mile pole, moved through the turn from
the two path , entered the lane from the three path, angled to the inside late and just got up for the place spot. MACHO ALEGRE chased the winner through
the turn while in the two path, continued in the three path into the lane and lacked a closing kick. HARD NIGHT was in the three or four path through the
turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a threat. DAY IN THE COUNTRY raced three wide through the turn when never far back, moved
closer to the winner with an eighth to go then faded. LAKE TAHOE vied for the early lead then dropped back through the field on the turn, trailed into the
lane and returned having bled from his nostrils and walked off. PRINCE ACT was close up early while along the inside, was very close to the rail when
steadied, continued along the inside and lost ground.

path inside the eighth pole and finished willingly once clear. HOBNOBIN GENERAL was in the four path through the first turn, continued well off the inside
into the far turn, raced in the five path and four wide through mid-turn into the lane, gained momentum after straightening in the five path, gained a short
lead with an eighth to go then was outfinished by the top one. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE was unhurried when in the two path and never far out of it, continued
in the two path into the lane, shifted from the two to the six path near the sixteenth pole when running up on tired ones and finished with good energy to be
up for the show spot. CORONA GRANDE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane, bid to almost even terms for the lead with
an eighth to go then could not sustain the effort. BRIGHT BRIAN vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, was still a strong contender
with an eighth to go then weakened late. C. J'S STORM vied for the lead along the inside through the far turn, was still dueling for the top spot with an
eighth to go continued along and stepped in nearing the sixteenth pole while tiring. KILLER HOTROD chased the pace along the inside, bid along the rail
after straightening, was steadied near the eighth pole when rail path tightened, was attempting to get through nearing the sixteenth pole when hole closed,
took up sharply and was done. TAKECHARGEJUSTICE settled to the back down the backstretch and trailed. AFTER AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH
RUN #2 C.J.'S STORM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH (6TH) AND PLACED SEVENTH (7TH) FOR INTERFERECE WITH #1 KILLER HOTROD

Footnotes
UNDERDRESSED stalked the pace between foes, bid at the half-mile pole, checked hard on the far turn when a foe stumbled, bid late and drew off.
NERVES OF STEEL was never far back outside, bid at the three-eighths pole, but was no match in the stretch. MANSFIELD TIGER led inside, stumbled
just past the three-eighths pole, then bid late for show. SAMI'S TROOPER stalked the early pace inside, surged near the half-mile mark, then checked hard
on the turn behind a troubled foe and had no late bid. SUMMER ASSAULT stalked the pace in the three path, then had no late bid. NOMADIC FIGHTER
raced evenly. CASANOVA KITTEN hopped at the start, pressed the pace outside of the leader and checked on the far turn when that one stumbled.
PADDY'S HOUSE was not a factor.

DANANG raced near the rail through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and finished willingly to be up in time. CIELO AZUL vied for the lead
along the inside of two others through the turn, repelled challengers straightening in the lane, cleared outside the eighth pole, continued clear inside the
sixteenth pole and was caught and settled for second best. HE'S A WARRIOR chased the pace from the three path through the turn, moved into the lane
from the two path and was gaining to the wire. SACRED SKY stumbled badly at the start, drifted out to mid-track as rider replaced outside iron, moved to
the inside through the turn and into the lane and finished willingly from the rail. COMPLEX JUSTICE vied for the lead between rivals through the turn and
into the lane then faded inside the eighth pole. CLEARING WAIVERS raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path
and moved up while never a factor. MATERS N TATERS vied for the lead through late turn when three wide then was empty through the lane. HIGHEST
PRAISE never a factor while near the inside. SUCCESSFULLY DONE was close up early then steadily faded while off the inside.

Footnotes
HEAVEN AND EARTH pressed the pace three wide into the turn, gained a short lead in late turn, cleared into the lane, had her largest advantage with an
eighth to go, drifted from the two path to the rail just inside the sixteenth pole and held. CASTLE MAGIC vied for the lead from between rivals into the turn,
continued to chased the winner into the lane while dropping to the inside, altered out inside the sixteenth pole when rail tightened and was gaining to the
wire. NIXA was in the two path through the turn when chasing the top two, came into the lane from the three path, could not threaten the top ones but
stayed on to be best of the rest. CV WICKED NOTIONAL was well back through the turn while in the two path, angled sharply into the lane then showed
good energy once straightened. LUNAR LACE raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and never was a threat. BARB'S
VORTEX never a factor while in the three path through the turn. ICEY ANGEL raced in the four path throughout and tired. LIGHT UP MY LIFE chased the
pace along the inside into the turn and was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole. ZIINZI set the early pace while under pressure from the top two then
steadily retreated. SPOTTY SHOWERS was done early from off the rail.

Footnotes
ZOOM ERIN pressed the pace in the three path and prevailed under a strong hand ride. FRANGO ELECTRICO raced three wide and rallied belatedly to
just miss. MORNIN' BOSS stalked the pace in the two path, bid in early stretch but missed. KENDAL GRACE was checked near the half-mile pole and
rallied late to gain the fourth spot. SPEEDY DELIVERY stalked the early pace inside, then was checked on the turn in tight quarters. STELLA TERESA
pressed the pace and gave way late. BUTTONS trailed the field, steadied at the half mile pole, then passed tired rivals outside. PEACH COBBLER saved
ground to no avail. FAST TRANSIT was through early. BLACK FOREST led inside before giving way in the stretch. The Stewards disallowed an objection
by the rider of SPEEDY DELIVERY against MORNIN' BOSS for alleged interference on the turn.
