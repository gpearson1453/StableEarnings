ANTICIPATED stalked the pace two wide, made a steady advance through the far turn, raced three to five wide in the stretch and just got up under all out
pressure. RAMPATIOUS quick to begin to set the early pace, drifted through the stretch and finished gamely to the wire to just miss.
CRAWLINGBACKTOYOU was bumped at the start, tracked the early leader from the inside, swung wide into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the
wire. AFRICAN PRINCE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace along the inside and raced evenly late with no closing run. MIQUEAS dropped back
early, raced six wide past the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. ALEX'S DREAM void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
J C'S A LEGEND vied for the early lead from the inside, kicked clear through the upper stretch under confident handling, kept to steady pressure inside the
eighth pole and edged clear. A SKIP IN THE PARK dropped back off the early going, advanced into the far turn, fanned seven wide into the upper stretch
and rallied gamely for the place position. ALL THE KING'S MEN stalked the top trio, raced near the rail through the stretch run and was outkicked to the
wire. VORPAL was a bit fractious momentarily in the gate, had an awkward start, moved up five near the three sixteenths pole to advance towards the
leader, shifted in late while racing between and finished with good energy. ITS KRAKEN TIME was bumped at the start, prompt the early pace three wide
from the outside of rivals and weakened in the stretch run. MANGIA PANE was squeezed back at the start, raced near the back of the pack after the poor
beginning, angled wide in the stretch and had no late rally. LUCKY CODE raced mid pack early on, was three to four wide around the far turn and weakened
in the drive. UNCLE PETE raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, blocked near the five sixteenths pole, angled out and never threatened.
TAVERNELLE pressed the pace between rivals and tired readily.

DODROPIN stalked the pace along the inside, moved up from the inside of foes through the upper stretch and edged up while racing two to three wide in
the drive under strong pressure. CONFIDENCE BUILDER showed good early speed to set the early pace two deep early on, had a clear lead nearing the
eighth pole and gave way grudgingly late. COCOA CENTS prompt the early leader three deep from the outside and kept on willingly to the wire while racing
fro the outside. JACANA raced mid pack early on, was six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. MISCHIEF MAMA reared at the
break, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced far back early after the poor start and never threatened. LAKER JET lost ground, was eased
up on through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
SHESALILRUNAWAY was quick to begin to set the early pace and held gamely to edge clear late under steady handling. SETTLER'S COVE was bumped
soundly at the start, raced near the back after the start, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and rallied gamely for the place position. PERCY'S SIS
raced off the early going, raced four to three wide in the stretch and rallied willingly between rivals. SENSUOUS KITTY settled to race mid pack, was four
wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid in the drive. CHEDOODLE RYLEE chased from the outside early, raced three to four wide
in the drive and lacked a bid. A STORM TOO SOON was forwardly placed to lay up close early and faded along the inside. MISCHIEF MAME was coaxed
along and faded in the drive.
