Footnotes
CALIFORNIA BAY bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace and moved inside, ridden along through the far turn, swung out leaving the bend, reached
the front with a furlong remaining and kicked clear to win going away under mild asking. SILVER N BLACK bobbled leaving the gate, chased two wide into
the first turn then became rank around the bend, bid three deep on the far turn and vied for command into the stretch, took over briefly in upper stretch
before being passed by the winner and stayed on to hold second. SILENT HEAT had to steady briefly behind SILVER N BLACK on the first turn, raced
outside a rival in mid-pack up the backstretch, took closer order into the far turn, lacked room past the quarter pole and bumped with outer rival into the
stretch, lacked room behind the leaders again entering the final furlong, altered out midstretch and finished determinedly to miss second. GHOSTLY ACT
set the pace from inside under pressure, carried a short lead over outer rival around the far turn, vied with a pair of foes into the lane, relinquished the lead
in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. BRONKO NAGURSKI settled inside, chased under coaxing into the far turn, found traffic behind the
leader exiting the far turn, remained behind GHOSTLY ACT in the lane before altering to a clear path but could not find the needed late response. TITOS
WITH A TWIST threw his head and bumped leaving the gate, trailed early from inside, remained along the fence to the far turn, eased off the rail around that
bend and failed to menace. JOHNNY PAYCHECK prompted the pace from outside in the two path, kept the pressure on through the far turn, vied between
past the quarter pole, bumped into the lane and steadied shortly after, then weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
BELLA RENELLA dueled for the lead from inside, fought through the turn and into the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch before clearing at the eighth pole,
then drew off under right-handed urging. INDY'S STAR dueled for the lead outside BELLA RENELLA, inched head on the turn, overtaken by the winner in
upper stretch, could not keep up with that rival approaching the final furlong but kept on to secure the place. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL chased outside a rival into
the turn, traveled two wide around the bend, angled out past the quarter pole and came four wide into the lane, churned on through the lane while moving
out further and edged FLAT OUT JOY for the show. FLAT OUT JOY was off slow to begin, went up to stalk the top pair from outside, chased three wide
through the turn, drifted when asked left-handed and and failed to respond to urging while getting outfinished for third. HENNYS CRAZY TRAIN tracked
from inside out of range, lost ground on the rail through the turn and weakened. PER RULING FROM HIWU, BELLA RENELLA WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
VANTASTIC unhurried in the two path outside a rival at the back early, took closer around the far turn and set his sights on the top pair into the stretch,
moved out to commence a bid three deep and proved best late. CANE CREEK ROAD cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the way to the far
turn, challenged with a quarter mile left to run, dueled through the lane and yielded grudgingly late. TIME TO PARTY rated in the two path early, moved up
to be closest in pursuit on the far turn, challenged past the quarter pole, dueled head to head then between foes late and got outkicked. SPIRIT MAKER was
antsy in the starting gate, bobbled in the beginning, became rank into and early on the first turn, settled on the inside, moved closer around the second
bend, tipped out at the top of the lane and finished willingly for a minor award. REDLINE stalked the pace on the inside through both turns and lacked a bid
when called upon.

to menace. COUNTRY BOY was off a bit slow from outside, trailed outside a rival early, rounded the bend four wide, moved inward at the top of the lane
and came up empty.

Footnotes
FREE AND HUMBLE settled on the inside, angled four wide around the bend, reached the front in midstretch under hand urging and drew away late. AVA'S
STORM showed early speed then cleared inner rivals and crossed over, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged from the winner entering the final furlong,
relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on to save the place. ENCOLPION had early speed inside a pair of rivals then got brushed crossing back on to
the turn, pulled briefly at the seven-sixteenths pole then steadied at the half-mile pole, stalked the pace while hugging the rail to the stretch, tipped out in the
lane and gained the show. MISS POLO BAR tracked outside a rival then three deep into the turn, remained three wide into the lane, chased within striking
distance into the final furlong but lacked the needed late punch. UNKEPT SECRET trailed on the inside into the turn, angled out and came four wide into the
lane and passed tired rivals. LA PALOMA BLANCA stalked off the rail then between foes into the turn, got boxed in around the bend losing ground, tipped
out in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. TURQUOISE BIKINI got floated in crossing the dirt and brushed with rival early, was closest in pursuit
two wide on the turn and into the lane weakened in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTE HARBOR reserved in the early going, patiently handled wo wide or between foes on the turn, angled four wide into the lane, drew alongside
SOUL SWEET with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. SOUL SWEET chased briefly then went up to challenge SPOILED ROTTEN from outside, kept
the pressure on through the turn and raced on even terms leaving the bend, took over into the stretch, put away inner rival midstretch but was outkicked by
the winner in the late stages. SPOILED ROTTEN took control early from inside then dueled with SOUL SWEET up the backstretch, inched ahead on the
turn, lost command leaving the bend, fought to midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. EVERLYS GIRL bumped inner rival at the start, raced up close
three deep then chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, took aim three wide into the lane but flattened in the furlong grounds. ROMAN EMPRESS was
a touch rank chasing early before stalking on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to rally. ROSES R BLUE got bumped back leaving the gate,
moved up to be forwardly placed four deep outside the leaders then chased into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and weakened.

REAL FIRE broke well but was taken back, trailed up the backstretch, went two wide into the turn, angled out while advancing outside rivals and came five
wide into the stretch, reached the front midstretch and drove clear. M IS FOR MAGIC settled outside a rival, found traffic behind foes on the bend while two
then three wide, lacked room again in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and finished willingly for the place. SHE'S GOT A WAY stalked in the two
path outside a rival into the turn, chased between foes around the bend, tipped out and bid three wide at the top of the lane, took over briefly with a furlong
remaining, was soon passed midstretch and lost the place. TEEN DRAMA dueled for command from inside, clung to a narrow lead in upper stretch,
relinquished the lead at the eighth pole and flattened to fourth. PALEO'S PRINCESS settled on the inside, tipped two wide into the lane, lacked room in
upper stretch, moved out then back in only to lack room again at the sixteenth pole and could never build up any momentum. PROFESSORS' PRIDE
stumbled outward to bump rival, showed speed and went up to duel from outside, fought into and around the turn and into the lane but weakened in the
furlong grounds. ICE QUEEN stalked on the inside entering the turn, waited past the five-sixteenths pole and into the lane, continued behind rivals on the
inside through the lane and never gained a clear path. GRITTY GIRL took a bump from inner rival at the start, stalked three deep into the turn, chased four
wide into the lane and came up empty.

MY MAN BAGS raced up close outside the dueling pair, challenged three deep on the turn before moving clear at the quarter pole, was hand urged through
the lane and held safely to the wire. ESTABLISHED stalked two wide into the turn, tipped out and was roused three deep with a quarter mile remaining,
chased the winner through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. CHASING FAME moved off the inside while tracking at the back, went four
wide around the turn then three wide into the lane, could not threaten the top pair but was a clear third. GOLD CRUSHER was a bit fractious in the gate,
bobbled at the start, sent to duel from inside, vied with rivals on the turn, could not keep up approaching the quarter pole and tired in the lane. FAST PER
SE showed good early foot then dueled outside GOLD CRUSHER to the turn, vied between foes around the bend, chased the winner with a quarter mile
remaining and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BIRTH OF COOL trailed on the inside early, remained at the back into the lane, looked to rally but got caught in traffic in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear
path, surged late and proved best in the end. GOLDENEYE pulled chasing along the fence early then settled in a stalking position, coaxed into the far turn,
lacked room behind the leader from the quarter pole to the top of the stretch, tipped out in the lane and gained command at the sixteenth pole but could not
offer any resistance to the winner late. TALLIS was off slow in the beginning, reserved early in the two path, raced near the inside then two wide on the far
turn, moved out and launched a bid three deep midstretch but lacked the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. THIRTY FOUR COUPE dueled for
command from inside, inched ahead to take control, cleared into the far turn, challenged again into the lane, put away that challenger for good in upper
stretch, showed the way into the final furlong but yielded in deep stretch. SO I'M TOLD stumbled leaving the gate, stalked between foes in the two path,
spun three wide into the drive, bothered a bit past the eighth pole and flattened. KEEN TO GO bumped with outer rival at the start, stalked three deep early,
remained outside rivals and came four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. OVERRULE dueled for command from outside early, pressed up the
backstretch, lost touch with the leader into the far turn, chased two wide around the bend, re-engaged THIRTY FOUR COUPE entering the stretch but
weakened in the drive. DERECHO DANDY bumped with KEEN TO GO in the beginning, stalked four deep around the clubhouse turn, chased three, four,
then five wide into the lane, drifted in slightly in upper stretch and weakened.
