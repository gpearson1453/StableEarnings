Footnotes
LIKE SEGAL veered in and made contact with Pyeong Chang leaving the gate then settled in the four path the first turn, bid passing the three eighths pole,
improved in the three path of the far turn, lugged in through the upper stretch and came inside ADDY'S LADDY T N T to get up the final yards. The latter
settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead toward the quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn but
was caught in the final yards. PYEONG CHANG was bumped inward and into Night Boss leaving the gate, raced in the three path on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but was shut off toward mid-stretch, altered course at that point and came back to finish
well. DESPITE ODDS settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, left the turn
outside and finished well. ROCKET DAWG rated a slim lead inside, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, gave up the lead
at the rail approaching the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened the final sixteenth. CHROME HEIR was pinched back at the
start, rounded the first turn off the rail and could only improve his position. PRINCE OF FENTON tapered in and stalked into the first turn, challenged toward
the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back approaching the quarter and weakened on the far turn. NIGHT BOSS was bumped leaving the gate and settled
in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. AKINGISALWAYSKING
showed little response. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Like Segal for interference leaving the gate and through the upper stretch,
lodged by the rider of Pyeong Chang, and as a result, disqualified the former for that which was previously mentioned.

Footnotes
LUCKY BLONDE stalked two deep on the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled for the nod past the five sixteenths, drew clear
midway on the far turn and held on under steady stretch encouragement. YOLO CHARLOTTE rated a slim lead inside, was met leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and was closing on the winner late. TIZ A
COUNTRY GIRL was bumped leaving the gate and settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase passing the three eighths pole, had her heels clipped
approaching the top of the stretch and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. XANTHE veered out and made contact with Tiz A Country Girl leaving
the gate then saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased outward into the lane
and finished evenly. HERETODAYGONMANANA raced hemmed in between horses on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole but weakened
at the rail on the far turn and checked to avoid a fallen rival toward the head of the lane. NO DENYING DENIS came away awkwardly and raced boxed at
the rail the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch then checked to avoid a fallen rival toward the head of the lane. JUBA BABY broke a
step slow and hit the gate at the break, rated close three wide on the first turn and gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four path, clipped the heels of Tiz A Country Girl and fell approaching the eighth pole but got up and walked off. The Stewards reviewed the incident at the
eighth pole before calling this race official.

Footnotes
OCEAN STORM was bumped leaving the gate and had a brief early lead inside then stalked, took over past the nine sixteenths pole, dueled the runner-up
toward the five sixteenths and cleared that one past the quarter, dug in leaving the turn and held well under steady handling. MEETMARYSMAN tapered in
and set the early pace off the rail, stalked from the nine sixteenths pole and dueled the winner nearing the five sixteenths, but dropped back passing the
quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the lane then lugged in and flattened stride. CURB THAT TIGER saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved off the rail on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. CRUISE ON BY settled off the rail on the
opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. FRANK THE BULL
rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase into the backstretch but flattened in the four path of the far turn. COLONIAL ROAD raced in the three
path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. JUBAY veered out leaving the gate and made
contact with Ocean Storm, raced in the three and four paths of the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BAND TOUR veered out
leaving the gate, raced well back in the three and four paths on the opening turn and never factored. TOTHETRAINSTATION rated close inside on the first
turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail into the far turn.
