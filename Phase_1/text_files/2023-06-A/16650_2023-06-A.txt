AGGRANDIZE rushed to contention inside, vied to midstretch and edged away under steady handling. DIESEL alternated for the advantage outside then
yielded in the final furlong. BIG CITY BOB prompted the leaders wide and continued willingly to the finish. HIDE THE RANSOM saved ground off the pace
and flattened out in the stretch. PRIMORDIAL FEAR chased off the pace between rivals and was never a factor. REFUND RIGLER lacked speed and trailed
throughout.

NOT NORMAL dueled outside, took over midway on the final turn and drew away under moderate pressure. ASSUME NOTHING settled outside just off the
pacesetters, bid on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. MY IMAGINATION trailed for three quarters inside, continued along the rail in the
stretch. DESANTIS moved inside behind the leaders, was asked for run on the final turn and faltered. ALTA FOX earned a narrow lead inside dueling with
the leader then gave way. BATTUTA D'ORO broke slowest, was put to urging and weakened steadily.

TRIBORD quickly pulled clear, was collared near the quarter pole then held on determinedly through the stretch. R TENDERONI moved closer outside
before half a mile, bid on the turn but could not get by. FAST INTENTIONS saved ground just off the pace then weakened slightly in the stretch. PENANCE
lacked speed in the two path, was asked on the final turn but had no response. NOT A TRACE raced inside off the leaders and weakened steadily. SUGAR
STREAK trailed for five furlongs and was never in contention. ASSUME CONTROL dropped off the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. BEYOND A
MILLION lacked speed in the opening quarter and was never a factor.

EBBEN stalked the dueling leaders, bid midway on the final turn, drew clear and lasted driving. THE KING CHEEK dueled inside, faded briefly near the top
of the stretch then came again inside with a steady gain. DALTON forced the pace outside and weakened slightly in the final furlong. GOLDEN SPOKE was
fanned extremely wide into the first turn then rallied outside. SPEIGHTSTER RED forced out into the first turn, remained wide and lacked a rally. FRENCH
TOAST raced off the dueling leaders in the two path and faltered. THE JONES BOY saved ground within striking range and faded.

Footnotes
SPLICETHEMAINBRACE well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch, rallied and edged off driving. DREAMING OF GERRY raced off
the pace near the inside and closed well to gain the place. ROAN MOUNTAIN trailed far behind, swung wide advancing into the stretch and was too late.
SIMOVITCH prompted pace outside, battled throughout and weakened slightly. MALIBU STAR dropped far behind, advanced inside on the final turn then
was outfinished. ALLEVARE set a pressured pace inside for three quarters and faltered. LOOSE ENDS saved ground off the pace and lacked a solid rally.
SUPER JOHN raced off the leaders three wide and faded after half a mile. EAGLES CRY far back early, moved closer before half a mile and had no further
response.
