Footnotes
SPHEROID outrun in the early going while three wide through the first turn, moved out, fanned six wide into the lane, challenged while widest nearing the
furlong grounds, gained the advantage then held the runner up safe in the final strides. HELLUVA LIFE broke back, lacked speed while off the inside,
angled out to be five wide and inside the winner turning for home, saw his progress stall a bit past the furlong marker, launched a late surge to be closing
the gap rapidly on the winner in the late going. GETCHA within striking distance from the start, advanced and challenged three wide far turn, put a head in
front soon after, continued to hold the advantage upper stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner nearing midstretch then could not keep up with that
one nor contain the runner up, saved the show. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER dropped inside for room midway up the backstretch, moved back out for room
second turn, encountered further traffic in upper stretch, came out slightly for room as OUTLAW X. was steering in past the furlong marker, came into brief
contact with that one and finished up evenly. OUTLAW X. in the second flight off the inside, moved a bit closer before a half, continued in a forward position
second turn, four wide and inside the top two exiting that bend, was going evenly when in traffic approaching midstretch, came in slightly, brushed with
CHEROKEE TAKEOVER and also finished up one paced. HONOR MY SPEED broke alertly, raced with the lead pack into the first turn while widest in the
five path, cleared onto the backstretch while working way toward the inside, set the pace into the far turn, began to weaken when headed midway on that
bend. VIM AND VIGOR four wide in the first turn, raced in mid pack up the backstretch, began to weaken after four furlongs. LATE NITE MISCHIEF in the
main body early, was finished after five furlongs. GREELEY'S DEALER fell back after the start to trail and showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
ANGEL OF VERDUN angled in entering the first turn to save some ground, settled in the run up the backstretch, made a solid move three wide into
contention second bend, bid midstretch, kicked well clear. LAST OF THE NILE lacked early foot toward the inside, continued to be outrun second turn,
came three to four wide into the straight, rallied to be up late for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. CAVE CREEK floated out when prompting the
pace first turn, continued to race within striking distance, fell back a bit second bend, dropped inside nearing midstretch, gained the nod for the show while
not kicking on to annex the second spot. BROKEN PROPOSAL broke on top, got out into the first turn when showing the way, clear before a quarter, pace
middle half, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted for the drive, gave ground grudgingly in contending for the runner up position. CASHEW
last away, raced back, came five wide for the drive, lacking a closing response. COINMAKER carried out to be widest through the first turn, chased the
leader the middle half then gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
BIG ACE with the pace from the start, vied three wide into the turn, shook clear of the other speed by late in the bend, not threatened to the wire under a
steady right then left handed crop. LET'S GO RANDOM bumped at the break to be last away, lacked speed despite being asked for some run into the turn,
saved ground through the bend, second best while remaining along the inside for the drive. SILVER CHALICE bumped with the runner up at the break to be
tardy away as well, also lacked speed, five wide into the lane, rallied to be up for the show late. BRADSTREET in mid pack off the inside, raced three wide
through the turn, lacked a closing punch. DOUBLE BOGEY outrun in the early going outside, ranged up closer in the four path turning for home, flattened
out in the final furlong. SMOOTH RIVER fell back to trail after the start, was six wide when under encouragement out of the turn, failed to produce a
meaningful rally. MOURVEDRE with the early pace between foes, continued to vie early in the turn, was beginning to weaken late in the bend when put in
tight, checked up and continued to give way. KIT KAT KIDD with the leaders closest to the inside up the backstretch, was still contesting the issue when
getting out late in the turn putting MOURVEDRE in tight late in the bend, stopped through the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE RUN THROUGH LATE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CHROME BABY unhurried early along the inside, moved closer before a half toward the inside, idled along second turn, steered out four wide for the drive,
engaged the leader inside the furlong marker, wore that foe down while drifting in a bit late floating that same rival toward the inside. MACHINE GUN MAN
within striking distance off the inside, challenged outside the two leaders far turn, took command into the lane, responded when challenged by the winner
with less than a furlong remaining and proved stubborn to the end while being floated in. DRILLING REPORT closest to the early leader, advanced and
challenged between horses and inside the runner up second turn, proved no match for the top two the final furlong, clear of the others. EYE DEE KAY back
off the pace, moved out bit, four wide second turn, lacked needed closing response. HYPERBOLIST fell back to trail, came five wide turning into the stretch,
went evenly to the wire in lacking a serious kick as well. DREWHUSTLE rank at the start, cleared into the first turn, set the pace until confronted in the
second turn, gave way when headed.

Footnotes
ADIEU ACES last away, used four wide to rapidly advance into a forward position by early in the turn, dueled into the stretch while still out in the strip, pulled
away the final furlong under steady handling. EASY CHANCE away in good order, dueled early outside, second duel inside the winner exiting the turn, could
not match strides with that one the final furlong, clearly second best. CORN SOUP in mid pack while well off the inside, came five wide for the drive, rallied
past the furlong marker to reach closest to the top two a furlong out, proved no match for that pair, narrowly saved the show late. JACKIE MOON lacked
early foot off the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn, finished willingly to be gaining for the show. CALLEN FEELS GOOD went one paced three wide
most of the way, lacked a serious late kick. SWIFT N TRAFFIC broke back, lacked speed, five wide out of the turn, picked off a couple of rivals to improve
position, no real threat. CATINANDSCATIN also broke well behind the leaders, continued to lag for three furlongs, five wide out of the turn, showed some
belated interest to better his position. ETBAUER'S SECRET void of speed for a half, passed tiring rivals while not posing a threat. BERNIE SPECIAL broke
alertly, fell back into the main body, tired through the stretch along the inside. LAST NATIVE CAT in the second flight for three furlongs, had little left for the
stretch run. THA ILLEST DEAL moved up to duel inside the runner up for the opening quarter, began to give way before three furlongs. COTTONCLUB
SOLDIER was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
REAL CITY SPEED broke out, straightened, dueled up front along the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch while narrowly showing the way, continued
to hold a small advantage far turn, extended that lead when straightened for home, roused, held that same rival save late under firm handling. G VICTORY
broke inward but on top, relinquished the advantage to the winner into the first turn, pressed that one the two path onto the backstretch, dueled the next
three furlongs, chased that foe into the lane, could not get back to that one while edging away for the second spot. SNIVELING in mid pack for five furlongs
along the inside, moved closer while continuing to save ground through the second bend while moving closest to the top two, made a bid for the runner up
spot with a furlong to run, outkicked, clear of the others. JACI'S ROYALTY in the second flight early, continued in the second group while between foes and
a bit rank through the second bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. UNFATHOMED went one paced throughout while racing off
the inside. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN off a step slow, raced back, improved a bit while not posing a serious threat. MINNESOTA MIRACLE bothered at the
start, failed to menace. CHAOSMOS broke out, bothered rival, moved up a forward position after being righted, gave way after a half. MAGEEZ fell back to
trail after the start and was never a factor.

Footnotes
VODKA MARTINI broke with the leaders, took control soon after, disposed of the other speed exiting the turn, drew off steadily through the lane under a
moderate hand ride to win ridden out. GROSSE TETE IAN lacked any early foot, began to rally through traffic turning for home, finished willingly to annex
the place, no match for the winner. TWOFEXUSNEXUS away in good order inside, moved a bit closer in the second flight just off the inside late in the turn,
three wide for the drive, chased the winner in vain past the furlong marker, caught late for the runner up position. LOOKIN AT BETTY broke back, devoid of
speed for almost a half, steered out widest exiting the turn, finished well to improve position, too late to make an impact on the top three. MONOLITH
fractious prestart, broke back, lacked speed outside, five wide into the lane, also improved position with some late interest well out in the strip. PARTY
LITTLE BOY in the second flight through the turn, had little for the drive to come up empty. KNOT THE ONE broke well, dueled outside the winner for
almost a half and gave way. PRINCE COSMO one paced off rail. COLE'S SENSATION last away,lagged well back for four furlongs, picked off some tiring
rivals well after the issue had been decided. MECKES PRIORITY was never a threat. A FOOL FOR CARLOS forwardly placed for a half, stopped in the
drive. TOAST TO THE GIRLS was finished before a half in giving way midway on the, far back.

Footnotes
BLESSED ASSURANCE unhurried for a half while three wide, called on for some run into the lane, reeled in the leader past the furlong marker, drew well
clear under steady handling. NODAH pressed the issue up the backstretch from the three path, challenged on the outside turn, showed the way into the
stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clear of the rest. BANDIT'S PRIDE fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag far turn, angled out four wide
for the drive, rallied to the clear for the show. TRANQUILLA went one paced toward the rail in lacking a closing response. LUMINOUS FLIGHT broke alertly,
showed the way up the backstretch, steadily weakened through the lane. CUSTOM DESIGN pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, gave way
from between horses turn.

Footnotes
DRIFTING MELODIES bumped start, asked to keep up out of the gate, vied three wide into the lane, put a head in front before three furlongs, shook clear
when straightened for home then held the runner up safe under steady handling. SHOOTING STICK in mid pack early, slipped through along the rail to
improve inside of rivals late in the turn, chased the winner past the furlong, could do little with that one late, clearly second best. A. P. STYLE in mid pack,
improved through some traffic, just up for the show late. SHE'S THE SHERIFF broke a bit slowly, raced back early as a result, three wide into the lane,
slight bother, moved outside of some traffic a furlong out, displayed some late interest to narrowly miss the show. SUNSET FLASH broke back,devoid of
speed for a half, swung five wide out of the turn, finished willingly while too late. TERRI GOT A FRIEND broke out, was straightened to race in the second
flight outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing kick. OCEAN FLEET broke in good order, vied up front along the inside early, gave way into the
stretch. NIKLAUSIA fell back after the start and did not menace. AMELIES DREAMER bumped with the winner at the break, forwardly placed up the
backstretch outside, vied four wide into the turn, tired through the stretch. SWEET SASSICAIA off a step slow, lacked speed outside, four wide turn,
remained back. CAT HAIR FLYING flashed brief early foot between foes, stopped.
