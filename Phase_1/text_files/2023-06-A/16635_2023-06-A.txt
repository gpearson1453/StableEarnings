Footnotes
GONE SOMEWHERE, inside into the first turn, came across the path of MURDO while moving outside nearing mid turn, forcing that rival to check, pulled
his rider to force the pace three-wide on late backstretch, took a pressured lead outside on the final turn, opened up stretch, held well. ETU BABOU stalked
forced pace inside, rallied outside for place. SIDE STREET DAVE pressed outside early, forced issue between horses into final turn, gave way into the
stretch. G'S TURN stalked widest, finished evenly. MURDO lost his path on the first turn when the winner moved outside, checked, dropped back, passed
tired rival. C C'S KITTEN had inside speed under increasing pressure, gave way from midway through the final turn. The rider aboard MURDO lodged a
claim of foul against the rider of the winner for interference on the first turn. There was no change.
