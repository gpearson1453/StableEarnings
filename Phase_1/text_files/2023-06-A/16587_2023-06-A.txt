ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE saved ground while being forwardly placed, slipped through during the drive, caught POVERTY BAY at the eighth pole and then
was all out to best that one in a stiff drive. POVERTY BAY saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly leaving the quarter pole, responded when
challenged and just missed in a determined effort. JIN TONG was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, split rivals during the drive and finished
strongly. NAPOLETANO was off a step slow, then steadied shortly after the start when PESO came in, dropped back early, rallied seven-wide into the
stretch and was gaining late. PESO broke in then was close up during the early going, angled out to be six-wide entering the stretch but lacked a rally.
FIREWALKER was prominently placed to the stretch while two-wide and weakened.
