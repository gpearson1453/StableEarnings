Footnotes
MAD DOG N JOE led the field inside through the first turn, improved his advantage running down the backstretch, continued unchallenged on the final turn
and cruised home down the lane to win comfortably. JMR PURE SENSATION settled in midfield on the fence at the half, was on hold inside through the far
turn, angled four wide turning for home, found his best stride late and burst between foes late to capture the runner up finish. FORESTERS PRINCESS
stalked five wide in the early going, travelled in midfield four deep at the half, rallied three wide with three furlongs remaining and stayed on well to capture
third money. COPINSAY had a good position on the rail tracking the leaders down the backside, advanced mildly inside on the final turn, was looking for
room in upper stretch, shifted inwards to the rail at the furlong marker and was one paced to the wire for a minor share. TOURIST'S DREAM travelled at the
back of the pack between runners at the half, was ridden for more into the far turn, began to pick up the bit in the five path at the top of the lane and was
gaining slowly on runners crossing the line to be in the mix for a share in the end. HELL BENT stalked on the rail going into the first turn, settled behind
runners near the rear down the back straight, showed good late energy when finally clear at the sixteenth pole and closed well late to be involved with
multiple horses for the place photo at the wire. AWESOMECREST settled near the rear three wide in the beginning, rallied four wide in the second turn with
three eighths to go, was in with a chance for a minor share three deep at the top of the lane and levelled out in mid stretch. KITTEN'S BOY trailed the field
from the start, continued to see them all into the far turn, was urged five wide at the two furlong marker, angled out to the eight path for the drive but could
not get involved late. LARAQUE broke inwards to begin, had a good spot inside tracking the top pair down the back straight, was roused to go after the
loose winner three eighths from home, rallied briefly between runners at the quarter pole and emptied out in the final sixteenth. TARADAR was brushed at
the start, prompted the pace into the first turn, chased the winner down the backside and through the far turn, retreated on fence in mid stretch.

Footnotes
STORMY SILENCE broke well and quickly moved clear shifting in to dictate terms racing just off the rail, was put to urging in upper stretch and held sway.
TAQUANYAH settled off the pace inside, came out a path or so near the sixteenth pole and closed the gap on the winner but was only second best.
SWINGING MANDY settled toward the back racing off the rail, came out four wide for the drive then moved out further six deep for running room nearing the
furlong marker, finished well despite drifting in just a bit close to the wire while edging past rivals for show honors. SACRED DANCER rated inside early just
off the eventual winner, saved ground on the turn before coming out three wide at the top of the stretch, drifted out a bit in late stretch, needed more. LIVIN
ON LUV pursued the leader from outside a rival mid-division, moved out from three to five wide leaving the turn, was in a bit tight between runners and
steadied slightly just outside the finish while not kicking on as well as rivals. SWIRLING DANCER broke out a bit, stalked three to four wide, came up empty.
LINCOLNVILLE BEACH broke a step slowly and in tight, trailed racing inside through the turn, was never a threat. SUGAR IS GOLDEN raced outside well
back going four wide on the turn, was not a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO LATE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
CARA CARA broke in but quickly found her feet to lead the field inside down the backstretch, opened up on her rivals while in hand throughout the turn, was
kept to the task in the stretch and won quite comfortably at the wire. MOUNTAIN SOUND had a good view watching the leaders into the turn, was ridden to
go on midpoint on the , responded well to battle on for second money turning for home and began to pull away for the runners up share late. NEOLITHIC
NATION travelled three wide outside horses tracking the leader into the turn, was asked two furlongs from home, fought on for the place share in mid stretch
and was outfinished by inside runner for the place share. I'M SNOW ANGEL was brushed lightly to begin and trailed the field down the backside, rallied
three wide from last at the two furlong marker and was full of run in the final furlong to offer a good finish closing in to garner a small share. TAYLORMOON
settled five deep in the middle of the pack at the half mile marker, was urged just outside on the turn, started a mild rally in the three path in upper stretch,
shifted in to the rail at the eighth pole and ran evenly to the wire. CHIPOTLE PEPPER kept a close eye on the frontrunner down the backside, was ridden to
go after the lone speed at the quarter pole, chased in vain straightening out for the drive and weakened in deep stretch. SECRET GIZMO was away slowly
at the break to be near the rear on the rail in the early going, was coaxed for run at the three furlong pole and was not a presence running to the line. LADY
GABRIELLE was in a good spot inside watching the top two at the half, could not keep pace with others running throughout the turn and had no run to give
in the stretch drive. RUSHING THE SKY settled near the rear between runners in the three path down the backstretch, lost ground on the turn to her rivals
to trail into the stretch and was a non factor finishing to the wire.

Footnotes
KING ALFREDO stalked then pressed the leading pair from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, took over past the quarter pole, was quickly clear
by the head of the stretch, extended the advantage and was kept to the task. HEAT MERCHANT was forwardly-positioned stalking from outside, went four
to five wide on the turn, bumped with a rival at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but clearly second best. ADELAIDE COURT tracked in
behind the leaders racing just off the rail, shifted out leaving the turn seeking room, was forced out further by a drifting rival and was in tight appearing to
brush with foes, kept on to get show honors. POSTURING was encouraged along early then again midway on the turn racing between runners, finished up
well to just miss show. STOLEN MONEY stalked from between runners mid-pack early, went three wide on the turn moving out a bit leaving that bend, was
forced out further and made contact with rivals and steadied at that juncture, ran on. BENLION was in just a hair tight at the start, trailed early lacking
sufficient speed, swung ten wide into the stretch and kicked on mildly. SENSING HOLIDAY was encouraged along between runners three wide late up the
backstretch, moved nearer to the rail on the turn, ran on evenly. MR NARCISSISTIC was rambunctious behind the gate but got away well, settled into stride
dropping back off the leaders, raced outside four wide on the turn, came out eight wide at the head of the stretch, failed to rally. LAKE SHORE DRIVE
dueled inside, came up empty. HALF TO RELOAD prompted the pace then dueled with the inside foe two to three deep, drifted out several paths turning for
home, came up empty.

Footnotes
LADY URUS hounded the leader inside in the early going, took over to have a narrow lead on the rail turning for home, stubbornly dug in down the lane and
began to get the better of her challenger in the final eighth to pull away at the wire. SIGN OF BEAUTY was reluctant to load prior to the start, broke sharp to
have a slim lead down the backside, continued to engage with the winner on the far turn, bid between foes at the quarter pole and lost the battle for the top
spot with a furlong remaining to finish a clear second in the end. PRINCESSONAMISSION tracked inside behind the leaders at the half, continued to never
give up on the fence turning for home and determinedly finished to the wire to be a solid third crossing the line. PAINTED GLORY stalked near the back of
the pack with four furlongs left to run, was roused at the quarter marker and had good late energy to finish up well in the final furlong. ATTABE was situated
in midpack in the early stages of the race, three eighths from home was asked for more and offered a late finish between horses in the end.
KANTBACKOFF watched the front duo contest for the front running on the turn, posed a threat in the four path at the quarter pole and yielded four wide at
the furlong marker. BLUEBERRY FIELDS travelled near the back three wide between foes in the beginning, made no headway running on the turn and
passed tired runners in the stretch. ADMISSIBLE settled in the middle of this large field all alone rating well on the turn, angled three wide for the run to the
wire and faded in mid stretch. JANIS JOPLIN was in range of the leaders just off the fence through the turn, took closer order to the front pair at the top of
the lane threatening five wide two furlongs from home and weakened in deep stretch. PROUD SPEAKER stalked near the rear down the backstretch,
offered a mild turn of foot advancing on the rail early part of the turn, was in with a chance for a minor share three deep in upper stretch and stalled at the
furlong pole. MORNING RUN was allowed to settle in last in the early stages, roused on the fence straightening out for the finish and made little gain
running to the wire. LIAM'S AWESOME settled near the back four deep down the backside, offered little interest running throughout the turn, trailed entering
the stretch drive and galloped to the finish.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON was coaxed along in the early going, pursued from in behind racing two to three wide early on the turn moving out four deep late on that
bend, angled out in upper stretch, took aim on the leader and under stout urging drove by in the final seventy yards. MACLEAN'S POSSE settled off the
leading pair to stalk, advanced three to four wide on the turn, took charge at the top of the stretch, was clear in mid-stretch but outfinished late while clearly
second best. BOHEMIAN BOY was mildly encouraged forward to race just off the lead, pressed from outside up the backstretch to the turn, took over a
narrow lead from the five-sixteenths to the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed late kick. CLEAR DESTINATION settled at the back, fanned six wide into
the stretch, finished up with mild late gain. HAVE A SOUPER DAY lacked early speed, raced near but off the rail, improved position in the stretch.
CLAYTON chased in behind three to four wide on the turn, failed to threaten. KAWACATOOSE was coaxed forward inside to contest the pace, took the lead
soon after the start and set the tempo facing outside pressure up the backstretch into the turn, was overtaken midway on that bend, faded in the stretch.
RED RIVER REBEL pursued from outside going four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
THERE'S NO JOE took control from the onset, was relaxed on the lead setting the pace throughout the turn, was asked in mid stretch and had enough left
late to hold on to a diminishing lead crossing the wire. HICKSY was pinched soon after the start, regrouped to have a good trip behind the winner through
the turn, had his sights set on the winner turning for home and was gaining with each stride but could not get there in time. PROVEN STRATEGIES was
bumped at the start, travelled on the rail in hand through the turn in the third flight, rallied in upper stretch on the fence and finished up to be a clear third in
the end. DOWNY BOY settled on the rail in the middle of the pack on the rail running in the turn, weaved his way through the stretch and showed late gain
in the three path to get up for a minor share at the finish. NIAGARA SKYLINE settled four wide outside horses close enough to the pace down the backside,
was in with a chance five wide between rivals in upper stretch but could not find more late to be a threat at the finish. THE GREAT OZ sat three wide outside
horses tracking in the second flight on the turn, was in range in the six path turning for home and was one paced to the wire in the final furlong. PERFECT
CRIME had a stalking trip near the back, put in an early move around foes at the half, was in the mix for a share eight wide in the lane and levelled out with
a furlong to go. FARAWAY KITTEN was reined in on the rail to be shuffled back in the early part of the turn, rallied two wide off the rail around horses with
three furlongs to go, angled out nine deep for the drive and stalled in the final furlong. NIKOLAOU travelled on the rail near the back in the beginning, trailed
this field in the ten path at the top of the stretch and offered no finish running to the line. COMMANDER JOE stalked at the back of the field in the early
stages, never got involved and could not be a factor down the stretch. GRANDSON trailed the field after the start, offered little movement running on the
turn and made no headway in the eighth path to the finish. BRITISH ARTILLERY pressed the issue early on, was ridden between runners to keep position
three furlongs from the finish and stopped at the three sixteenth pole. STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING #5 THERES NO JOE AND #6 HICKSY SOON

Footnotes
KAUKOKAIPUU was among the leaders pressing the early pace inside just briefly, could not keep pace with the leading pair and settled in to track those,
saved ground on the turn, lacked room in behind foes leaving that bend, came out nearing mid-stretch, took aim on the dueling leaders and drove past late
under steady handling. PARAMOUNT PRINCE soon led from between runners to set the pace, was challenged by an outside foe into the turn and headed
by that one three furlongs out, dueled inside through the bend and stretch, was outkicked by a different foe but fought on to best the dueling partner for
place. POULIN IN O T attended the early pace from outside, applied more pressure into the turn taking a narrow advantage at the three-eighths, dueled
three wide through the turn into the stretch and fought on well but missed the place. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY was forwardly-positioned outside runners
stalking the leaders, was forced five to six wide through the turn, carried out just a bit in mid-stretch, kept on evenly to get up and round out the super. HEY
CUE was a bit fractious in the gate, chased off the leaders from between runners two to three wide into the turn, moved out a bit turning for home, continued
to drive out in mid- to late-stretch and needed more. COOL KISS settled at the back outside going four to five wide on the turn, moved out eight wide
entering upper stretch and continued to move out further, was finishing well but simply too late. ONE FOR CHAP switched outside foes racing in the back
half of the field early, advanced outside rivals moving out from four to seven wide on the turn, was carried out a bit further in the lane and ran on. PHILIP MY
DEAR was a step slow into stride and immediately angled in, raced between rivals at the back into the turn, came out seven wide by the top of the stretch,
ran on evenly. GRAN SPIRITED raced off the inside part of the course about three to five deep, went evenly and made no bid. KEEN FLATTER chased
from between runners in the second group three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. OPPOSITES ATTRACT chased while saving ground,
failed to menace. MOON LANDING got away a bit slowly and was also slow into stride, soon picked it up to advance inside up to the field until on heels in
behind rivals, saved ground near the inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
FOREST BUZZ took this field down the backstretch and into the turn setting the pace, was asked at the three sixteenths marker, responded well and kept
his rivals at bay in the final eighth for the victory. KINETIC STONE was nestled behind the winner on the fence throughout the turn, chased in vain the entire
stretch, could not threaten and had the settle for a clear second in the end. THEBACKSTRETCHDUDE leapt up a touch at the start, rated kindly on the rail
into the turn, began to pick up runners on the fence at the three furlong pole, shifted out between foes four wide at the quarter pole making a bid but could
not find more to threaten the top two at the finish. RAPID TEST settled inside near the rear in the beginning stages of the race, advanced smartly on the
fence through the turn, angled four wide at the top of the lane and finished up splitting foes at the sixteenth pole to get up for a small share. MENDELJOHN
(IRE) prompted the pace outside on the turn, was in the three path turning for home with a chance for the win but could not find another gear and faded in
the final furlong. JAMIESTA tracked three wide in between horses entering the turn, was in the mix at the quarter pole six wide and weakened in mid stretch.
HIGHLAND LIFE stumbled slightly at the break, travelled in midpack down the backstretch, lost ground to competitors on the turn and was never a menace
running to the finish. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY hopped at the start, stalked near the rear down the backside, could not get involved running on the turn and
made little impact through the stretch to the finish line. ROLLING HILLS settled four wide not far off the pace into the turn, could not match strides with the
leaders three furlongs from the prize and gave way at the top of the stretch. PUDDINGONTHERITZ was void of speed early trailing down the backstretch,
could not keep up with others on the turn and lost touch with the field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GREEN FLEET tracked from inside just off the leaders, came out five wide turning for home, bid at the furlong marker, cleared and held. LAPOCHKA was
reserved in the early going shifting in two to three wide early, began to receive encouragement three then four wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into
upper stretch, was gaining but too late. STEAK AND CHEESE stalked early while outside foes in the second flight three to four wide, took closer order up
the backstretch, launched a sweeping move to take command past the five-sixteenths, lacked the needed late kick. SALVATOR MUNDI was just a hair tight
between runners after the start, raced off the pace between foes about three deep, moved out a bit on the far turn put to urging, came into upper stretch
seven wide then tipped out further, ran on late to get up for fourth. DECIMATOR was lightly brushed at the start, settled mid-division racing inside saving
ground, came out a bit in upper stretch, ran on evenly. UNCLE BULL broke through the gate, got away alertly and moved clear, shifted in setting the pace
into the first turn, was prompted then overtaken by an outside rival and chased that one up the backstretch, retook the lead briefly early on the far turn but
was overtaken leaving that bend. JACK THE CAT brushed with a rival lightly while breaking a half-step slowly, rode the rail through the first turn racing at
the back, came off the fence for the far turn. CHANCEL moved forward outside the leader two to three wide to force the issue early up the backstretch,
began to drop back three furlong from home and weakened. DESOLATOR was caught four wide on both turns racing mid-pack, failed to rally. FINALIST
tracked up close racing off the inside, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
ENGLISH SHIRL hounded the pace under a snug hold outside in the early going, took control three deep at the quarter marker, opened up in mid stretch
and held on by a diminishing margin in the end. TRILLING SONG was away slowly to begin, stalking close to the back of the pack, continued to see the field
in the ten path at the top of the stretch and was full of run to the wire gaining with every stride to make it close at the finish line. WORRY LESS was
squeezed at the start, was asked for some run to get a good spot tracking behind the leaders entering the turn, was ridden to go after the front pair three
furlongs from home, continued to put in a game effort in the final eighth and closed between runners to be a clear third. HOLIDAY WITH AMY settled the
midfield between runners in the two path with a half remaining, waited behind horses looking for room in upper stretch, finally had a clear path three wide at
the sixteenth pole and got up for a minor role at the finish. MASON'S MUSIC travelled in the middle of this strung out pack three wide outside with four
furlongs remaining, was in with a chance for a piece of the prize in the eight path straightening out for the run to the wire, battled with the leaders in early
stretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. SIXTOFIVE settled on the rail in the middle of the pack, was ridden on the fence with three furlongs from home and
could not find another gear in the late stages of the race. VELIKIY tracked three wide just off the pace outside of rivals, posed a threat in the five path
turning for home and battled until the sixteenth pole giving way in deep stretch. WHISPER ME A SONG trailed the field down the backstretch, angled out to
the five path entering the long stretch and showed some gumption passing weary stragglers to the finish. MERITAMEN took command from the onset,
continued to dictate the pace on the turn, was collared by the winner at the top of the lane and retreated in the final eighth. TENDER SITUATION tracked on
the rail behind the frontrunner in the beginning, waited patiently on the fence throughout the turn, found a seam in the four path at the three sixteenth marker
but tired in the final furlong. SANDY GRACE stalked near the back on the rail in the beginning, saved all the ground through the turn and offered no finish on
the fence running to the wire.
