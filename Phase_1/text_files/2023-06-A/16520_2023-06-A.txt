was steadied when losing his path before running a sixteenth, continued along the inside through the turn, angled sharply in late turn when gaining
momentum, entered the lane from the five path when nearest the winner then angled in and was gaining while second best. NO MANCHES was in the two
path through the turn and into the lane and offered a mild gain for the place spot. NATIONS DREAM chased the pace from the three path through the turn

Footnotes
CHIROMANTE (IRE) set the pace under pressure down the backstretch, continued under pressure through the turn, cleared into the lane and slowly
widened to the end. WEST COASTER trailed the field while along the inside, waited behind along the rail into the lane, cut the corner and moved off the
inside, angled in then finished with good energy to be gaining. AZAMANA EMPIRE saved ground through the turn, came off the rail and into the three path
into the lane, moved three wide with an eighth to go and was gaining to the end. MRS. SPEAKER was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane
two wide with aim on the leader, continued closest to the winner with an eighth to go then hung. VOGELSANG chased then pressed the pace three wide
into the far turn, was a serious contender in late turn then weakened. HONEYTOWN chased the pace from the two or three path through the far turn then
tired. A STAR FOR CORA pressed the winner two wide through the far turn then was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
MIZZEN ASH was reserved while near the inside into the far turn, gained momentum under minimal urging, swung into the lane from the three path, quickly
caught the leaders three wide near the eighth pole, was shown the crop right-handed, urged left-handed near the sixteenth pole and swept on past. MISS
GOODBAR was reserved when off the inside, raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane, angled in near the eighth pole and moved up to just
get up for the place spot. GOSHEN chased the pace along the inside, bid into the lane from the two path, was on near even terms with an eighth to go then
could not keep up with the winner while losing the place spot late. AMERICA RULES was three wide through the first turn while in the back, continued off
the rail through the far turn then moved up in the stretch while in mid-track. LEAD PERFORMER set the pace along the inside while on a clear lead, dueled
into the lane until the eighth pole then gave way. WILD TAPIT was never a factor while saving ground. JOAN'S WAY outrun while off inside. SHADOW
BELLE chased the pace while in the two path into the far turn then was done into the lane. MOSE DEFINITELY chased the pace from the three path into the
turn and was done in mid-turn.
