LAUDA SPEED broke in front, set all the pace and edged clear under left handed urging. MASAI MAN never far back, rallied along the inside late and got
up for second. ZELIG stumbled inward bumping CHACO SPIRIT at the start, loomed boldly four wide on the turn then was outfinished. CUTLER vied for the
lead two then three wide and went evenly. MONTAUK COVE pressured the winner two then three wide and lacked the needed response. ADHHAR was no
factor. CHACO SPIRIT was bumped at the start, had speed for a half then weakened.
