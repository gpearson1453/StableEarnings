LIGHT FAST FEET lead the way into the backstretch, responded to the challenge from PAULINA'S STAR approaching the far turn, was roused into the
stretch edging away, and held under pressure. PAULINA'S STAR contested the pace leaving the backstretch, dueled through the far turn, was unable to
sustain the bid that was required and finished second best. THRILL OF THE NITE was under a strong hold early inside, chased the leaders through the
stretch and improved position. MOHAYMEN DAY steadied leaving the chute, moved up closer outside in the backstretch, chased four wide entering the
lane, and faded. SMILIN EVIE was never far back in the four path, and failed to threaten. VIVIEN'S CHARM tired early.

MIDNIGHT GARDEN hustled leaving the chute, shifted inside to saved ground, chased outside in the far turn, was under steady handling through the
stretch, rallied three to four wide, and held under a late challenge from ADDYDIDIT. ADDYDIDIT trailed the field early, moved up closer in the final turn,
angled out to the five path midstretch, loomed boldly late but was unable to get by. SHE LOVES WINNIN stalked three to four wide, and lacked the closing
response that was needed. GO MAMA rated off the pace and failed to threaten. DEFINITE PLEASURE set a pressured pace from between foes, inherited
the lead entering the far turn, was showing signs of wear near the three-sixteenth marker, and yielded. EDGE OF OKOTOKS showed early inside speed,
and gave way.

Footnotes
FLORAL sat in striking range outside, drove four wide off the final turn, drifted inward as she edged clear, and held. DANCE SHOES tracked inside, waited
briefly at the quarter pole then lacked running room, shifted out to the four path, and closed willingly but was unable to get by. MISSCZECH brushed leaving,
contested the early pace inside of MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER, was under attack into the stretch, and flattened. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER contended the pace
early, met traffic at the quarter pole and yielded. PLUM BLUE brushed away, and trailed throughout.

REBATE sat just off the pace, overtook the lead at the five-sixteenth pole, moved clear into stretch, and was kept to task under a confident hand ride.
VALENTINO ROSSA reserved off the leaders early, made a late bid to be second best. ALBERTA raced in close quarters entering the far turn between
foes, advanced quickly inside, and closed well. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL contended the early pace inside of REBATE, was unable to move on with the
eventual winner, and gave way in the final furlong. BEAUTIFUL CALL chased four to five wide in the backstretch, and lacked a kick. ANTIGUA BAY trailed
the field, and bid belatedly. GO AGARTHA offered little. PUNCH PERFECT saved to no avail.

COUNTRIFIED trailed early, circled the field into the lane, was brushed at the head of the stretch, and won driving. WAR GIANT sat midpack in the three
path, was roused at the quarter pole, launched a rail bid, and got up for the place. BURNLEY zipped to the front under a snug hold, responded to a looming
threat entering the final turn, drifted out through the stretch, and was caught in the final yards. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY rated just off the pace while three
wide, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole, drifted out brushing COUNTRIFIED, and weakened. MACHINE saved inside, and lacked a kick.
FLASHFORDANI was never far back, went three wide into the far turn, and lacked a closing response. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the stretch run but made no change after a review of the film.

BIG HUG jostled away, shifted out to the four path early, moved up willingly to challenge BOOTIFUL ROSE on the lead, and drove clear under light
handling. SUPER CARO broke out leaving racing wide through the backstretch, angled sharply to the rail at the head of the lane, rallied determinedly inside
of BOOTIFUL ROSE, but was out finished. BOOTIFUL ROSE broke inward bumping into BIG HUG, set the pace from just off the rail, was confronted at the
head of the lane by BIG HUG, and was unable to summon the rally required in the drive. MONOPOLIZE broke out leaving to trail the field, and closed well
late. EDDIE'S ON PATROL bumped away, saved ground inside, and came up empty in the drive. SOCIAL CUES broke alertly, stalked the pace while three
to four wide, and tired early.

Footnotes
INDEPENDENCE NEIGH chased outside, fanned four wide into the far turn, dueled outside of ICE BOX INDY under heavy encouragement, and inched
clear after a long drive. ICE BOX INDY showed the way through the backstretch, was joined by INDEPENDENCE NEIGH into the stretch, and was denied
after a game effort. AGENT C saved ground on rail was hustled outside in the final turn, and made a good late run locking down show. CHESTER SLEW
offered a late mild bid. CHARMING VINTAGE chased inside, and failed to threaten in the drive. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN showed good early speed, sat in
striking distance outside, was set down at the quarter pole, and faded. PUMP THE BRAKES offered a mild bid from the rail. KEEP YOUR COOL offered
little. CHRIS'S COMMAND chased the pacesetters, raced in traffic in the far turn, drifted out at the head of the lane, and gave way.
