Footnotes
ERIC THE SALESMAN tracked evenly through the backside emerging off a loose leader in upper stretch angling in then back out getting up in time. SLIABH
AUGHTY (FR) stalked the pace rallying to lead into the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch digging in near mid track being caught from the inside late.
FOREVER POE in close at the break lagged to the far turn firing into upper stretch being put in close a sixteenth out angling out late giving willing response.
WHISKEY MOMENT bumped at the break would track the pace to upper stretch lacking a late response there. TODAY MATTERS slow early had a modest
gain down the stretch. WICKED CHANCE played no factor. BAYTOWN JAKESTER hustled out set the early pace being passed into the far turn fading to
upper stretch. JOYFUL CANDY was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF FOREVER POE AGAINST THE RIDER OF ERIC THE
SALESMAN FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

evenly inside down the lane. CLASSY REY DE ORO tracked evenly through the turn into upper stretch lacking punch at the end. PORTIA'S HOPE chased
early then weakened on the turn racing evenly through the lane. FAST RIDE pressed then chased on the turn weakening in upper stretch. XCELLENTLY
