MILLIE G vied for the lead under a steady hand ride, then gained command heading into the turn, and held on well to prove best. CLEARLY COPPER
stalked the pace while two wide, was well rated along the inside of the bend, angled out two wide in the early stretch, then dug in to close fast for a gamely
second. GYPSAN chased the pace while three wide, was urging on the turn, then rallied mid stretch to close well. SPEAK SOFTLY vied for the lead from
the inside under a gamely drive then gave way in late stretch. CHAINSAW CITY settled along the inside, then bid on the turn and into the lane but it was too
little too late. THAROLITE was off slowly then chased the pace from the inside, rallied on the turn then flattened out in the final sixteenth. NATURAL TOUCH
was under a hard drive while stalking the pace while four wide into the turn, then flattened out in the stretch. KOLLYNS JULIE bid for the lead early, then

Footnotes
MUD ON MY BOOTS sped to a clear advantage shortly from the gate, set a well rated pace maintaining his margin to mid-stretch, weakened coming to the
wire but just held on in a blanket finish. TIZ BODHI BOY taken off the pace and allowed to settle into stride down the backside, cut the corner turning for
home and closed with a rush up the fence to just miss. TEXAN FARMER prompted the pace while well placed throughout, drifted wide in the lane while
steadily gaining on the pacesetter and surged in last few strides in a good effort. MR. VALENTINO rated in mid-pack and found his best stride late to make a
belated rally to hit the board. LAST FLASHY showed speed for a half mile to press the pace and tired down the lane. GOLD CAPO broke alertly,
immediately dropped to the back of the field and was never a factor. BINDING HEART well placed along the rail just tracking the early pace for a half mile
and weakened coming home.

strong to prevail in the end. FAST TRACK chased the pace from the inside, then menaced in the upper stretch to close well for the place prize. HEAD
OVER BOOTS raced close behind the field along the inside, was driving on the turn to rally in the early stretch and closed willingly. SALT N LIME dueled
while two wide into the turn, continued to dig in grudgingly down the the lane then gave way in the end. DIAMONDS N ACES raced in the middle of the pack
while two wide, was urging on the turn to rally in late stretch and closed well in the end. MORE THAN SHAKIN raced while two wide behind the pack, then
made a mild bid in the early stretch then closed at an even pace throughout the lane. SWIFT RED BIRD dueled from the inside, was in a hard drive
throughout the turn to gain the brief lead, was used up in the stretch and tired in the end. HAWKEYE GIRL raced while four wide, then drifted out nine to ten
wide leaving the turn and was no threat.

VICTORY FOR VETS stalked the pace from two wide to the turn, moved up three wide to engage the leaders at the quarter pole, cruised to a clear lead in
upper stretch and drew off to the wire as much best. MY BUDDY MEL rated in mid-pack off the quick early fraction, advanced through the turn to contention
and finished well to be second best. GOING TO SANANTONE tracked the leaders to the turn, gained ground while circling to the top of the lane, loomed up
in upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. DARYLS TRUMP CARD settled in hand well off the pace, saved ground and made a belated rally down
the lane showing good late interest. HE'S CHARMING slow early to be at the rear of the field and made a mild rally in the stretch passed tired rivals.
SPECIAL MEMORY broke alertly to be on the lead, dueled to upper stretch on the front end and gave way late in the lane. TOO INTIMIDATING sped up the
rail to duel on the lead and tired in upper stretch. SONNY BOB was hard to load, raced near the rear of the field most of the way and went evenly lacking a
response when called upon.

DOBBINS G was well rated while tracking the pace while two wide down the backstretch, was gaining ground heading into the early stretch, dug in gamely
and was up at the wire to prevail. FEARLESS PRINCE lead the way into the first to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive, cleared the far
turn, held on gamely down the lane but was caught in the end and was second best. DEANOS CAPE settled on the backstretch while two wide, was moving
up to menace on the far turn and into the home stretch but came up evenly. RIVER KAT pressed the pace setter down the backstretch while two wide, then
settled back along the inside throughout the far turn, rallied in the early stretch then flattened out in the end. KENTUCKY PEERLESS raced along the inside
in the middle of the pack, then bid on on the far turn and was no threat. LOUIS LE GRANDE settled along the inside throughout the first half, was in a hard
drive on the far turn, was used up and tired in the late stretch.

Footnotes
TATANKA sped to the lead immediately from the gate, opened a wide advantage for the first run down the lane, was well rated while maintaining a clear
lead down the backside, responded when engaged by several approaching the final bend, drew clear again and held the late closer safe. KAZAN (IRE)
rated near the rear of the field through the first two turns from between horses, gained ground into the far turn to be in striking distance of the leader while
angling out for the drive and closed well to be second best. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) stalked the distant pacesetter from the rail through the turns and down
the backside, moved to engage the pacesetter entering the far turn for the second time, threatened briefly but could not sustain the bid and finished evenly
to hold the show. SEDUCTIVE U S A raced three wide in the second flight through each turn, moved boldly down the backside to challenge for the lead from
four wide and flattened out turning for home. MOOJAB JR slow early to trail the field for the first mile and rallied passed tired rivals in the stretch while never
threatening. MIDAS CAT tracked the leader from the fence down the backside, made a brief bid and gave out turning for home. GOSPEL MUSKETEER
stalked the leaders for the first five-eighths of a mile and came up empty.

MORO'S BULL CREEK raced in the middle of the field while four wide, was gaining ground swiftly on the turn to vie for the lead heading in the stretch,
kicked clear of inner foes and held on gamely to prevail in the end. DEVITO tracked the pace from the inside, was moving up on the turn while splitting
rivals, rallied in the upper stretch from the four path to close belatedly in the end. BEYOND INFINITY vied for the lead while three wide, took command at
the top of the bend, then battled to keep the lead in the early stretch then gave way in the end. HOLIDAY RUN vied for the lead from the inside, was in a
hard drive throughout the turn then flattened out in the stretch. WINNY'SSPECIALSTAR vied from the inside early, settled along the inside on the turn, then
continued to race evenly throughout the stretch. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN settled while two wide, then bid from the five path on the turn and needed more in
the end. XANDER S settled along the inside, then bid mildly on the turn while three wide and into the stretch but came up empty. SPARRA raced while three
wide then bid on the turn and was no threat. WITT'S ROJO vied for the lead while four wide, was in a hard drive then dropped back on the turn and stopped
bid. HAKEEM'S DREAM off slow, then ducked in towards the rail and trailed throughout and was no factor.

Footnotes
PALATIAL TIMES stalked the pace from three wide, rallied into the turn to take control turning for home and drew clear as a convincing winner.
IMPLICATOR reserved early near the rear of the field, circled in the far turn and closed well to gain the place. DRIVEHAPPY tracked the leaders for three
quarters of a mile and rallied well down the lane but not enough to reel in the top two. MAHOMEY sped to the front to set a contested pace for five-eighths
and gradually gave way coming home. TIZ LIFE pressed the pace to the far turn, took a brief lead at the head of the stretch and flattened out late in the
drive. MAU MAU trailed most of the way as a non-factor. OLIVER went evenly without ever threatening and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
MIAMI MOONLIGHT saved ground throughout the first three quarters along the inside, then angled out five wide in the early stretch to surge down the lane,
dropped in deep stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. SPIN TO WIN was bumped at the start, then was well rated along the inside while tracking the
pace down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn to rally in the early stretch and was closing willingly just missing success in the end. DAWSON CITY was
bumped at the start, then tracked the pace from the two path, bid on the far turn and into the early stretch while four wide, rallied gamely then checked in
deep stretch and was best for show in the end. CITY NIGHTS vied for the lead between rivals, was in a hard drive throughout the far turn, then gave way in
the stretch. MOHAYMEN HOLIDAY raced in the middle of the field while three wide, made a mild bid on the far turn then closed well from the five path down
the stretch but it wasn't enough. KERAUNOS settled in the two path, then bid from the inside on the far turn, came out four wide in the early stretch and was
closing well but it wasn't enough. IT'LL DO vied for the lead from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far turn then tired in late stretch. FREEPORT
was in a strong drive to vie for the lead while three wide, was used up on the far turn, then weakened in the stretch. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in
regards to interference in the stretch drive. After reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish.
