Footnotes
KINGMEISTER was forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the decent fractions while well placed through the backstretch run, loomed along the
second turn, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, steadily advanced on IL CAPITANO into upper stretch, overtook that rival at the furlong
marker and assumed command under steady urging, kept to task to deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages. JACKS OUTLAW settled off of the
decent early pace while saving ground, moved closer along the second turn and saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch,
was outkicked by the winner in deep stretch and just held for second at the finish. OUR SILVER OAK settled in the second flight early on, tracked the pace
while outside of a rival through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide on the far turn, was roused three wide for the drive, ran evenly to the furlong
marker, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished in deep stretch, just missed for second and held for third. TABLE FOR TEN was unhurried in
the early stages, saved all of the ground to the second turn, offered a mild late rally in the drive and missed for the minor awards. IL CAPITANO showed
early speed and assumed command leaving the break, was a bit keen into the first turn and continued to be a bit hard to handle into the backstretch run, set
decent fractions while on a clear lead to the half-mile pole, was confronted by KINGMEISTER nearing the quarter marker, held the winner at bay to
mid-stretch, was collared by KINGMEISTER at the furlong marker and gave way in the late stages.

Footnotes
PERFORMATIVE broke alertly then took back to stalk the fast early pace, advanced along the bend and pressed BOLD TALKER to the quarter marker,
drew to even terms with that rival into upper stretch, took command nearing the furlong marker, drew off into deep stretch and was ridden out in the final
stages to be much the best. WAKES AND WEDDINGS tracked the fast early pace while three wide, inched closer approaching the quarter pole, was no
match for the winner in the stretch and ran on in the final sixteenth to be best of the rest. BOLD TALKER showed good early speed and took command in
the opening stages, set a quick pace into the turn, was pressured by PERFORMATIVE to the quarter marker, met that foe's bid into upper stretch, gave way
inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. THECHIEFHASTRICKS hopped at the start then lost his path
soon after the break and was away slowly, chased from the inside along the turn and did not factor in the drive. UPDRAFT chased the solid early pace,
raced outside of a rival to the quarter marker, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LADYWEARSTHERING showed speed and contested the quick early pace with CALLHERCONTESSA, shook free into the backstretch run and was well
handled through solid fractions to the half-mile pole, showed the way to the quarter marker, extended the lead into upper stretch, kept to task while on the
left lead into the final furlong and drew clear in the final sixteenth to prevail. A CROWN FOR KITTEN stumbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was
unhurried through the early stages, gained ground along the backstretch run and into the far turn, came in a bit tight while saving ground approaching the
quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, rallied at mid-stretch and came within aim at the furlong pole, could not keep pace with
LADYWEARSTHERING in deep stretch, was outkicked and held for second. DERRYGOOLIN was allowed to settle, maintained her position through the
backstretch run, raced two wide into the far turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker and waited a bit behind runners approaching the top of the lane,
was roused four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished for second, while clear in the
end for third. SWALL settled in the second flight in the early stages, tracked the solid pace while outside of a rival through the backstretch run, mounted a
three wide bid on the second turn, could not sustain that bid into the stretch and weakened in the drive. CALLHERCONTESSA was prominent in the early
running, disputed the quick pace into the first turn then took back to prompt the pacesetter through the backstretch run, kept attendance to
LADYWEARSTHERING to the quarter marker, chased the winner to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. EM N HOLL'S FIESTA stalked the quick
early pace from the inside, tracked the speed while inside of a rival through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, steadied off of a tiring
rival's heels in upper stretch, could not keep pace to the furlong pole and tired in the final stages. NOBLE HEARTED settled off of the fast early pace, raced
outside of a rival through the backstretch run, was steered three wide along the turn, could not keep pace into upper stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
COOL MOUNTAIN LAD broke out slightly at the break, was first into stride then ceded the lead to AWESOME SUMMER passing the five furlong marker,
shifted out to the two path at the half-mile pole then moved to challenge the leader on the turn, battled that stubborn rival down the length of the stretch,
gained a slight advantage inside the sixteenth and held on to the wire. AWESOME SUMMER bumped after the break with LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF, got
into stride then set a comfortable pace with COOL MOUNTAIN LAD in close pursuit, responded when challenged with three furlongs to go, held on gamely
to a slight lead in the final sixteednth but was bested in the final yards. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF broke out at the start, making contact with AWESOME

Footnotes
AIRKITA broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, contested the pace with MANY MARKETS into the first turn, was well handled through the
backstretch run and carved out decent fractions to the half-mile pole while pressured, shook free into the far turn, drew to a clear lead into the stretch, kept
to task under steady urging to deep stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held safely in a drive at the end to prevail. ZAFFERANA took back off
of the early pace, tracked the decent fractions while outside of a rival through the backstretch run, made a steady advance while two wide along the far turn,
was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, finished well inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and bested the rest.
NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE settled along the rail in the early running, saved all of the ground to the far turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker, angled
two wide for the drive, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was outkicked, while holding for third. BYE BYE BUGGSY was well placed in the
early stages, tracked the decent pace from an inside position through the backstretch run, gained ground along the far turn and tipped two wide for the drive,
was outrun by AIRKITA in upper stretch, could not muster a late response in deep stretch and was outfinished for third. COMPTONS HOUSE a bit slow into
stride early on, was allowed to settle while outside of a rival, improved position two wide along the second turn, was roused three wide into the stretch and
offered a mild late rally. HALLELUJAH BABY was unhurried, raced in the two path into the backstretch run then slipped to the rail approaching the far turn,
gained ground nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch, passed tired rivals in the late stages and did not factor. MANY
MARKETS was prominent in the early running and disputed the pace into the first turn, contested the decent pace with AIRKITA through the backstretch
run, chased that rival into the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the drive. RIVIERA SUNRISE settled in the second flight in the early
stages, raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, gained ground on the far turn while three wide and was steered four wide into the stretch, could not
keep pace into the drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LAGATHA was asked to show speed leaving the break and assumed command in the early going, set a fast pace into the turn, continued to show speed
along the turn and carved out rapid fractions to the quarter marker, spurted clear into upper stretch, maintained a clear lead to the sixteenth-marker while
kept to steady urging, shifted to the left lead when responding to the crop in deep stretch, kept to task in the final stages and remained clear to the wire.
JASMINE CHIEFTAIN was allowed to settle in the early running, raced outside of a rival into the turn, slipped to the rail nearing the top of the lane, closed
well in deep stretch, could not impact the winner in the final stages and held for second at the finish. BLUSHING BAY lacked early speed, saved ground into
the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, found her best stride late and missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. HAYDEN'S ANGEL was
forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the fast pace into the turn, kept attendance to LAGATHA while two deep along the bend, was steered into the
three path into upper stretch, could not keep pace with LAGATHA heading to the furlong marker and gave way in the drive. TURA LURA broke alertly then
lost the early lead to LAGATHA, chased that rival through quick fractions into the turn, lost ground while three wide nearing the quarter pole, could not
muster the needed response in the stretch and weakened. CODE RIBBON chased the fast early pace from the inside, lost ground approaching the quarter
marker, tipped two wide into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

BUSKER ALLIE was unhurried in the early stages, steadied while in a bit tight entering the first turn, was coaxed along in the two path into the backstretch
run, made a steady advance heading to the half-mile pole, continued that steady bid into the far turn and was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker,
came within aim nearing mid-stretch, wore down foes inside of the furlong pole, took command approaching the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in deep
stretch to prevail. CHEERFUL CHARM stalked the decent early pace while three deep on the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run while on
a snug hold, gained ground while three then two wide along the far turn, chased MISSING PENNY into the stretch, was outfinished by BUSKER ALLIE in
the final stages and was second best. MISSING PENNY showed good early speed and dictated terms into the first turn, set moderate fractions through the
backstretch run, extended the lead along the far turn and drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, was
overtaken by BUSKER ALLIE approaching the sixteenth-pole, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just holding for third in the
final strides. OAT MILK LATTE was crowded at the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the early pace while outside of a rival, was carried out along
the first turn and raced in the five path into the backstretch run, recovered and made up ground approaching the half-mile pole, raced two wide to the quarter
marker, lost ground into upper stretch, lacked the needed response in the drive, finished evenly in the final stages and missed for third. BLUE BREEZE was
allowed to settle, raced in the two path through the backstretch run, improved position heading to the half-mile marker, lost ground along the far turn, was
steered three wide into the drive and did not threaten. HAPPY IS was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace while two wide into the
backstretch run, kept attendance to the pacesetter to the half-mile pole, slipped to the rail entering the second turn, saved ground to the top of the stretch,
could not keep pace into the drive and gave way. JAYS ANGEL broke alertly and was hustled to be prominent early on, stalked the decent pace from the
inside through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the far turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in
the drive. JAZZY LOVE settled in the second flight in the early running, was hard to place along the first turn, bolted and carried out OAT MILK LATTE
heading into the backstretch run, was pulled up nearing the five-furlong pole and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
HOW ABOUT A FRESCA broke well and tracked the pacesetter to the turn, moved up under urging to challenge approaching the quarter pole, gained the
lead at the top of the stretch and ran on well under strong handling to hold the closers at bay while drifting in a bit mid-stretch. RAUCOUS TIZZY outrun after
the break, lagged through the first quarter mile, moved over towards the rail near the half mile marker then moved to the outside going into the turn, got into
contention while racing in the three path, moved out further to get around THREAD COUNT mid-stretch and ran on strongly to gain second. THREAD
COUNT held up in a tracking position in the early going, stayed out in the three path for clear run, made a nice sweeping move through the turn, came into
the stretch on the outside of a three horse fan contending for the lead, chased the eventual winner to the wire and was tagged at the wire for the place.
MADAME GAZELLE broke with the early pack, fell back a bit near the half-mile marker then was prompted to keep up while also being boxed through the
turn, had a clear path mid-stretch but was unable to must the needed response. WHATWASTHENISNOW broke a step slow then seized the early
advantage, held sway through the turn, was challenged near the quarter pole and gave way readily. OTTER POP broke out at the start, raced close up to
the turn while holding the rail position, began to lose ground with three furlongs to go and trailed the field home.
