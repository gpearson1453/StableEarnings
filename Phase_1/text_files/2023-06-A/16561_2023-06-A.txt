NATION OF FAITH stalked TEACHERSBUGSAROO while racing two-wide, responded during the drive and wore that one down in the final seventy yards.
TEACHERSBUGSAROO saved ground setting the pace but was unable to resist the winner late in a game effort. STREET MOGUL was brushed at the start
by SUPER CREATIVE, then was unhurried early, dropped further back on the turn, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally
without threatening the two two. SUPER CREATIVE broke out to brush, then was forwardly placed while saving ground but lacked a rally. QUALITY
GRANDSON was prominently placed to near the stretch while three-wide and weakened.

MISO FAST was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. MILEYS BLUECAT was reserved off the early pace, came three-wide
into the stretch and was gaining late. CODE CHARLIE hopped slightly at the start, then quickly opened a clear lead, saved ground setting the pace then
tired suddenly late while drifting out. CANDIED LUTE was never far back, moved up three-wide to offer a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out
during the drive. DEMOCRAT was prominently placed while racing between horses but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BAROSSA was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, angled out to come six-wide into the stretch, came out slightly during the drive bumping
with NEW EAGLE and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. MUNCEY was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing
the three-eighths pole and held on gamely during the drive. NEW EAGLE was prominently placed early while racing along the inside, steadied slightly while
in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out to come seven-wide into the stretch, came in slightly to bump with BAROSSA in the stretch and
finished strongly. WESTPHAL was never far back, moved up three-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole but lacked the needed late response.
CLAYTON DELANEY broke slowly to get away behind his field, then was unhurried, circled up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths pole and
then faltered during the drive. THE THIRD RING set the pace for five furlongs and tired. THE TRAINER OF NEW EAGLE LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST BAROSSA ALONG WITH A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS FILED BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WAS
MUTUAL INTERFERENCE AND MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PROVOST was allowed to settle in stride, rallied three-wide into the stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. LEPRINO broke
out to bump with EYE CANDY RANDY, then was reserved off the early pace, moved up along the inside on the turn and finished well for the place. EYE
CANDY RANDY was bumped at the start, then quickly opened a clear lead, set the pace to near the eighth pole while drifting slightly off the rail and held on
fairly well to earn the show. MAHI MAHI was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. UPPER ROOM saved ground
while being allowed to settle and went evenly. MAMACALLMEBOO dropped back early, while saving ground and failed to menace. PICK YOUR BID was
prominent early while racing three-wide and gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
RAAJIN RIBBON prompted the pace set by DECIMATE from along the inside and prevailed in a stiff drive. DECIMATE set the pressured pace racing along
the outside and held on gamely during the drive for the place. SILENT DECLARATION was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished well for
the show in a steady effort. LARSEN BAY dropped back early, angled out to come-three-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. MIDNIGHT
LUTER hopped in the air at the start tp get away behind the field, moved up along the inside on the turn to be forwardly placed but went evenly late.
BARBARIAN was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE dropped back early, wa
four-wide entering the stretch and failed to threaten.
