Footnotes
HURRY HURRY dueled for the lead two wide, led narrowly around the far turn, then drew off under a drive in upper stretch. SINGLE RULER broke inwardly,
stalked along the inside, angled to take aim outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole, pressed turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the
clearing eventual winner in upper stretch, then sustained his chase to gain place at the sixteenth pole. STREET SWAGG dueled for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, but was headed by that one around the far turn, faded in upper stretch and lost place at the sixteenth pole. IDRATHERBEBLESSED raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, got floated four wide before chasing the leading trio around the far turn, but gave way turning for home. REINVEST
rushed after a flat-footed beginning to press outside of the top pair approaching the backstretch, but faded around the far turn. GIROOVIN dropped well
behind the rest of the field early on and showed little. FIGHT FIERCELY laid off off the pace three wide, but weakened into the far turn and was eased
through the lane.

Footnotes
CHECK ENGINE LIGHT set the pace along the inside, showed the way while well in hand from a pair of pressing chasers around the far turn, responded
readily once set down entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch and widened while drifting out in the final furlong. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES settled far
back along the inside, gradually shifted off of the fence turning for home, tipped five wide while between rivals in upper stretch, rallied to offer a bid for place
in the final sixteenth and narrowly gained that position at the wire. HEART HEADED WOMAN tracked four wide, chased the leading trio from the three path
around the far turn, ran on in the four path in the lane to gain place at the sixteenth pole, embraced a challenge for that position from an outer rival in the late
stages and got nailed at the wire. STEEL RACER pressed two wide, prompted between horses into the far turn, but gave way to them approaching the five
sixteenths pole, yet kept on mildly to sustain a minor placing. HAMMERDONHAPPINESS laid far back two wide, floated six wide entering the lane and
stayed on mildly. BEST COAST stalked three wide, moved to press entering the far turn, but faded entering the lane and weakened between horses in the
final sixteenth while hanging on his left lead. TAKE SHAPE stumbled severely once the gates opened, shifted out while requiring multiple strides to regain
balance, trailed the filed in the aftermath, took the far turn in the five path, tucked down turning for home before shifting back out in upper stretch and moved
up. LITTLE SISTER SUE pursued from midpack two wide and lacked a bid. OVERINDULGENCE broke a step slow before coming under strong
encouragement to hustle forward for position, chased along the inside but tired around the far turn. SPICY ITALIAN laid off of the pace in the three to four
path and tired.

Footnotes
SEIZE THE NIGHT stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the pace setter entering the lane, bid in the final furlong, dueled while getting herded
outwardly entering the final sixteenth and wrestled an advantage at the wire. PROMISE KEEPER set the pace while remaining a bit off of the inner rail,
showed the way in hand around the far turn, dug in to resist SEIZE THE NIGHT's outer challenge in midstretch, shifted out as a duel commenced
approaching the final sixteenth, sparred gamely through the late stages but was nailed at the wire. ELEVEN CENTRAL prompted the pace two wide, but
required urging to sustain pressure in the three path around the far turn, yielded while getting floated out entering the lane and held show thereafter.
DECISION MAKER hit the outer part of the starting gate and spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the off, lagged behind, cut the gap nearing the lane and
failed to menace. DASH ATTACK bobbled outwardly at the start, tracked two to three wide, but chased in the four path around the far turn and weakened
turning for home.

Footnotes
LITTLE DIXIE stalked the leading pair from the three to two path, bid between them passing the five sixteenths pole, vied with a pair of outer rivals entering
the lane and inched away entering the final sixteenth. EAST SHORE tracked two wide, ranged up four wide around the far turn to offer a bid turning for
home, vied with an inner pair entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner before securing place. FAST GAL dueled for the lead
outside of a rival while in the three path, pressed that foe while remaining a path away from her into the far turn, gained an advantage as an inner rival bid at
the five sixteenths pole, vied between horses entering the lane as an outer foe joined the fray, fought on gamely through midstretch but yielded to those
rivals late. LADY WITH A CAUSE tracked along the inside, spun for home two wide, then gradually shifted out approaching midstretch before chasing the
leaders home. RED JEWEL broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, chased outside of rivals while being floated wider approaching
midstretch and lacked a bid. DOGWOODSMILLIEJANE broke a bit slow before taking light contact from an outer rival at the start, then failed to menace
from the two path. HONEYCOMB dueled for the lead along the inside, but was headed by a trio of outer rivals turning for home and weakened at the quarter
pole. LILY'S CREED trailed along the inside and got outrun.

Footnotes
CRACKALACKING prompted the pace two wide, bid and sparked a duel with five sixteenths to go, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch and clung to
it from his inner game counterpart through the final furlong. EMPIRE OF MY OWN set the pace inside of a pressing foe, dueled with that one turning for
home, fought on gamely after being headed in upper stretch, prolonged the war through the final furlong but was bested. SPARKLE OF HOPE broke slowly,
laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide turning for home, then four wide for clear sailing outside of the leaders entering midstretch and rallied to
gain show nearing the wire. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER stalked the embattled leading pair from the outside, but only managed to chase them through the
lane before getting outfinished by an outer rival for show. COEXIST trailed along the inside, shifted off of the inner railing in upper stretch and rallied
between horses entering the final sixteenth. BALL GOWN lacked speed while taking the turn in the four path, shifted out to the eight path in upper stretch
and moved up willingly. HALF A CHANCE leaned out while off awkwardly, pursued from midpack four wide, but floated to the six path entering midstretch
and tired on his left lead. COLORATURA broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the three to four path and failed to factor. BEAUXS ARTES chased along
the inside and faded around the turn.

REDEMPTION TIME laid off of the pace in the four path and between horses, rallied in the five path turning for home, tipped inwardly in upper stretch,
surged late while closing in on the clear leader late and reeled that one in at the wire. CREATE TROUBLE set the pace along the inside, dueled with an
outer rival around the far turn, kicked clear of that one in upper stretch, but tired in the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. SMILE MON pursued from
midpack in the three path, gained show in the four path turning for home, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, ran on to attempted a bid for place
approaching the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an inner rival for that position at that marker and settled for show. SINGLE DOT YAHT took a bump
from an inner rival at the start and lagged behind the field in the aftermath, gained ground in the two path around the far turn, had to pause and check on the
brakes behind foes at the quarter pole, swung out to the seven path entering the lane and rallied willingly for a minor share. MAPPER took a mild bump to
his hind quarters at the start, tracked along the inside, but failed to sustain position down the backstretch, then improved along the rail around the far turn,
but failed to menace through the lane. SCARAB broke out and bumped a foe at the start, prompted the pace two wide, dueled around the far turn while

LOVED prompted the pace along the inside, assumed command at the quarter pole and cruised away handily. TAKE A STAND saved ground far back,
gained entering the lane and split foes two wide at the sixteenth pole to gain place late. JAG WARRIOR bumped with rivals on both sides at the start,
stalked in the three path, chased the top pair around the far turn, sustained stride while hanging on her left lead, gained place in the final sixteenth but was
caught by an inner rival nearing the wire. JUBELLA broke out and bumped a foe at the start, then bumped with an inner rival around the first turn while
achieving a tracking position from the two path, pursued from the three path around the far turn before entering the lane in the four path, and ran on for a
minor share. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT set the pace outside of the eventual winner, but proved no match for that one nearing the lane and weakened in the
late stages. GUANA CAY bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path and tired. MY KENTUCKY GIRL got rank while
bumping with rivals on either side around the first turn clipped heels with an inner rival and steady hard in the aftermath, then laid off of the pace in the four
to five path before being eased up through the lane. LISETTE bobbled slightly at the start, then was slow into stride, lagged well behind and showed litlte.
CURRENT CLIMATE was squeezed before clipping heels with an outer rival around the first turn and was subsequently distanced.

UNIFYING tracked two wide and between horses, split the leaders to offer a bid at the quarter pole and drove clear in upper stretch. TOPSY tracked the
leading pair from the four path, ranged up four wide turning for home, but failed to keep pace with an inner rival in upper stretch and chased that foe home
well to prove second best. B G WARRIOR set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner leaving the three sixteenths pole and gave
way. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS laid off of the pace, gained in the four path and between horses turning for home, then stayed on through the lane.
FRIENDLYPERSUASION lacked speed in the five path, improved turning for home but failed to menace through the lane. PROMISE OF HOPE broke
outwardly, pursued from midpack along the inside but weakened turning for home. PADMA trailed in the two path and failed to factor between horses in the
lane. CONDENSATION broke outwardly, was urged along while off of the pace in the three path around the turn and made little impact. TELL ME WHEN
stalked outside of the leader while remaining a path away from that one, then weakened between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
DISARM stalked along the inside, chased under mild coaxing around the far turn, shifted three wide to take aim outside of the top pair nearing the final
furlong, surged up to a leading VERIFYING in the final sixteenth and drove past late. VERIFYING stalked two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, forged an
advantage in upper stretch, drove clear before being confronted by an outer rival in the final sixteenth and was bested in the closing stages. BO CRUZ set
the pace along the inside, dug in to resist an outer challenge turning for home, got headed by that one in upper stretch and gave way at the furlong grounds.
RAISE CAIN tracked three wide, chased outside of the leaders in upper stretch and yielded in the final furlnog. DENINGTON failed to factor from the two
path. GO SOLDIER GO broke slowly, trailed along the inside, pursued from off of the pace in the three path around the far turn and made little impact. KING
RUSSELL raced at the rear two wide and was outrun around the far turn.

Footnotes
MAHAAMEL tracked in the four path, bid turning for home, led entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, drifted outwardly in the final furlong as an
outer rival gave chase and held firm to the wire. PRESIDENTIAL settled far back along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, shifted out and rallied
five to six wide entering the lane, ranged up to take dead aim on the clear leader entering the final furlong, but was herded outwardly leaving midstretch and
fended off through the late stages. ALEJANDRO exchanged contact with an inner rival at the start, rated at the rear two wide, launched a rally in the four to
five path turning for home and sustained a charge to gain show entering the final sixteenth. EL ORIENTE (CHI) broke outwardly, laid off of the pace in the
five path, tucked down to the two path entering the far turn, then rallied to split rivals at the furlong grounds and stayed on for a minor share. KING'S
OVATION bumped an outer rival while off a step slow before being squeezed back between horses at the start, saved ground at the rear, shifted out four
wide entering midstretch and moved up between horses in the final furlong. ATTA BOY ANTHONY broke outwardly, dueled for the lead two wide, built a
clear margin approaching the eleven sixteenths pole, showed the way while remaining a bit off of the rail around the far turn, but was headed by an outer
bidder entering the lane and weakened. MAJOR BLUE dueled for the lead inside of a rival through a quick opening quarter, but failed to sustain the battle
entering the backstretch, staked into the far turn, chased entering the lane and faded through the final furlong. GHOSTLORE pursued from midpack two
wide, then four wide around the far turn, chased while getting outkicked by an outer rival nearing the lane and tired. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK tracked in
midpack along the inside, awaited racing room in the early half of the far turn, tipped to the three path and between horses turning for home but tired
thereafter. FLAGS UP made little impact from the four path. INTREPID HEART was floated outwardly by an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the
two path and weakened. BULLSEYE BUN chased in the three path and weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole.
