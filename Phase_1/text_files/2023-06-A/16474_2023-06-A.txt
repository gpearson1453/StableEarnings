BUNTY WINDERMERE stalked the pacesetter, commenced her bid nearing the quarter pole, dueled with WHATCHAMACLL, took over from that rival
passing the eighth pole and edged away under urging. WHATCHAMACALL set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled with the winner entering the
stretch, dug in gamely inside and held on late for second. MISPELLED MOOON was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, angled
out, rallied late and missed for second. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and rallied late outside. SEDONA
ROCKS raced off the pace with an inside trip and finished evenly. ATTACHED raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
GEM CAT broke open the gate prior, then was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and did not factor. DAHGO stalked two wide, came three wide into
the lane and tired. AIKEN TO BELONG was off a bit slow and outrun.

BOPPY O was bumped in the early stages, settled off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out for the drive, responded, closed willingly
outside, ran down TALK OF THE NATION in deep stretch and was clear under the wire. TALK OF THE NATION was bumped at the start, then bumped
again soon after, pulled and was steadied in tight entering the first turn, settled in a tracking position on the inside, angled out midway on the far turn, rallied
three wide into the stretch, responded, gained command, edged away, dug in gamely and then yielded to the winner. TURF KING (IRE) raced off the pace
between rivals, saved ground on the far turn, raced behind rivals in upper stretch, then rallied on the rail for third. SWAN LAKE pressed the pace early on,
vied two wide on the backside, dueled on the far turn, dug in to midstretch and weakened late. COSMIC SPECULATION set the pace on the inside, then
vied inside on the backside, dueled on the far turn and tired. PEOPLE FORCE raced three wide early, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and faded.

RERALLY dueled inside for command, battled it out heads apart with FINANCIAL STRENGTH through a prolonged duel, finally shook free from that rival at
the furlong marker, drew clear and pulled away late. DAD'S ON A ROLL settled off the pace, advanced two wide on the far turn, came three wide into the
stretch and rallied outside for second. FINANCIAL STRENGTH dueled two wide for the lead, continued in a long duel while racing outside of the winner,
battled to the eighth pole, then weakened late. STORMANDY bobbled at the break, raced three wide early, stalked the leaders, chased on the far turn and
had no rally.
