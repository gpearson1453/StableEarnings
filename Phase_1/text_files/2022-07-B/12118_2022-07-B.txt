GIZMO'S PRINCESS stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. FLECK was
well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. TIZ MY RIGHT set a pressured pace but
was headed on the far turn and gave way at the top of the stretch. MS SUEDOO was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no response. MARTINI SUE forced the early pace but chased on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

TOMCAT BLACK was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. HALF LIT tracked the leaders
from the outside, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner. DUKE OF MIAMI
was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. WILD RIVER WOLF had no speed and raced
evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. FINAL STRIKE forced the early pace but chased on the turn and
weakened through the stretch. FRAT PARTY was hustled early and had a slim lead on the turn but had nothing left.

HI HONEY was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was much the best. RIGHT MATTERS was off the pace, moved
up on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch finished well. TANGERINE TWIST was away alertly and set the pace but was headed on the
turn and faded. SEEDS OF GRANDEUR was unhurried early and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more.
ONLY BELIEVE was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SMART IRENE was hustled early
but chased on the turn and was empty. BELLE FEMME was in mid pack but lost ground on the turn and was not a factor.

AWESOME MINER stalked the early leader, forced the pace on the turn and with the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch held sway. BE THE
CHANGE was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. BALA FALLS was away alertly and
raced evenly on the turn but needed more. OVERBEARING had no speed, saved ground on the turn and was up for a share. SHAKOO MAKOO showed
speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace, trailed
the field on the turn and had no impact. BANGOR RIDGE was in touch early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

M C JACKHAMMER stalked the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. CORE tracked the
leaders from the outside, had a good position on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. OMEGNA was hustled
early and roused from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. ARTIE'S ALL IN was unhurried early, hustled
along on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. WONNEFRAC set the pace but was headed on the turn and had
nothing left. VERMONT HOLIDAY was off slow and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. GUS'S GAMBLE
was off slow and checked on the turn while all out. TATTRAN was off the pace and showed nothing while outrun. HOLD YOUR LIQUOR had no speed and

Footnotes
WINGS OF VICTORY was in touch, raced evenly on the far turn and with the lead from the six path at the top of the stretch drew off. PATIO PARTY forced
the early pace, dueled on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. MAXIMUM DANGER was up close and a factor on the far
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. PAPERBACK HERO was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but was no real threat.
PARTY OF NO set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but faded. QUIET WYATT was in range but lost ground on the far turn and from the
five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. MORE HARDER was well back and showed nothing while outrun.
