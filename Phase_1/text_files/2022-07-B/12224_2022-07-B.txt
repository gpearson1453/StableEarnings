CATS GOTTA CHANCE was roused to a pressured lead from the inside then inched away in upper stretch and held sway. HOT ARTIE vied for the lead
from the three path made a move in upper stretch but couldn't catch the winner. CHUCK NAZTY raced back early then steadily advanced from the four path
through the turn and flattened out. GUN WAR raced back or near the back in the two path but only passed tiring rivals in the drive. WEBCAM pressed the
pace from the two path and gave way at the eighth pole. ALL RISE UP bumped on both sides at the start then saved ground throughout but was not a
factor.

WE MISS GENO hustled along to duel with rival for the lead from the inside and dug in late to prevail. BULLAWAY dueled for the lead from the two path and
fought gamely in the stretch but was out kicked late. THREE BALL raced in the middle of the pack from the two path made a mild bid on the turn then made
a late run in the stretch to just be up for the show. NEW GOSPEL was positioned just off the pace on the inside angled out to four wide in upper stretch but
was out finished late. NEXTPORTOFCALL raced in the middle of the pack from the inside then moved out to two or three wide in the stretch drive to
improve position. CRIMSON TRACE broke well to vie for the lead from between horses to the half pole and faded. PERVASIVE raced three wide and was
not a serious factor. IMPUTED raced near the back and was not a threat. WILLY B was a little rank early but had no impact and galloped home.
