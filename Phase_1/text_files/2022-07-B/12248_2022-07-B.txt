VAL'S RIPTIDE away alertly, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under mild urging. KISS THE RED HEAD never far back, angled inside on
the turn, closed fast along the rail late and got up for second. KICHI KITSU chased the winner along the inside and went evenly. BOLD GINGER chased the
winner three wide into the stretch then weakened. QUIET LADY was fractious in the gate, trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals. LATE DATE was
no threat. LIL O. T. had speed between horses into the stretch then folded. KERRI'S MIRACLE hit the gate at the start and was through early.

with good courage two wide. CRIMSON LEGION saved ground and went evenly. SEEKING THE MONEY stalked the pace into the stretch then faded.
