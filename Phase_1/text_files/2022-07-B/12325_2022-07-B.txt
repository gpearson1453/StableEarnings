Footnotes
DIXIE GIANT broke sharp to lead, was well rated on the turn, opened up on the field turning for home and was not seriously threatened in the late stages of
the race. SEA SCOUT was allowed to settle in stride leaving the gate, advanced through the turn skimming the rail, shot through on the fence at the eighth
pole and had enough to hold for second money. GANCHO was near the rear outside down the backstretch, advanced four wide around horses on the turn,
angled out widest in the five path for his stretch run and was gaining steadily late just missing out on the place share. I'M A CHI TOO chased the speed
through the turn and was one paced down the stretch to get a minor award. CALL MY BANKER tracked outside through the turn in the four path, was
roused at the quarter pole to go after the leader and weakened the final eighth between runners. PRICELESS WILL was between rivals near the back
through the turn, attempted to angle out for a stretch rally and could not really get a clear path to offer a run down the lane.

Footnotes
TWISTER ALERT settled off the pace near but off the rail, began shifting out midway on the turn, fanned six wide into the stretch, struck the lead just past
the furlong marker and drove clear. TUDOR PEAK tracked inside, took closer order on the turn, found room on the rail in the stretch but was outkicked.
NORTHERN PASSAGE broke just a bit awkwardly but quickly recovered, was given mild hand-encouragement on the turn racing in the three path, shifted
six wide past the furlong marker, just got up for show. SACRED DANCER veered out clearing the gap lightly brushing a rival, allowed that one to go on with
the pace and switched out three wide, made a mild bid in upper stretch, lost show honors at the wire. FRAC TALES moved to the fore under some
encouragement from the break, was lightly brushed early, moved clear racing in the two path, was challenged turning for home and had no extra. ISLAND
BELLE lost the path at the break after starting just a touch slowly, lacked early speed and was never near enough to threaten. EXIT STAGE RIGHT stalked
from outside going four wide on the turn and within striking distance past the quarter pole but faltered and faded.

Footnotes
SECRETS TOLD tracked the pace just outside through the first half, engaged the frontrunner at the quarter pole, fought for the lead outside its rival for over
a furlong and was inching away late nearing the finish. GAYELETTE lost a bit of ground on the rail entering the turn, rated nicely behind runners through the
turn, commenced her rally on the rail into the stretch then angling out to the three path at the three sixteenth pole and was full of run late just getting up for
second at the line. DAWN PHAROAH broke alertly to lead, was headed entering the stretch, battled stubbornly inside with the winner for three sixteenths of
mile and tired close to the wire just missing out on the place. TRIZZEL TRAZZEL was near the back early on the fence, advanced between runners midway
on the turn, had a clear run in the five path at the top of the stretch and ran evenly for a minor award. BERAVINA stalked on the rail behind the pacesetters
through the turn, angled out to the three path to commence a bid at the quarter pole and weakened between runners with a furlong to go. BESSIE sat
outside near the rear after the start, was asked for run in the six path at the top of the stretch and offered no response. FOXY DIVA trailed from the break,
took closer order around the turn and was never a threat through the lane.

Footnotes
IMAGERY came out at the break, raced mid-pack between rivals heading to the turn, was corrected when appearing to awkwardly but briefly veer out at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch, took aim, closed with a flourish to get to the lead seventy yards from home and drive clear.
HALFINTHEWRAPPER set the pace inside racing in the clear, was outkicked but held the place. DANCING DOLL saved ground racing inside through the
turn, came out nearing the sixteenth pole while gaining steadily but missed second. SOUPER PECAN was in a bit tight just after the break, settled at the
rear, swung five wide into the stretch, ran on belatedly. SPARKLE SAMMY stalked just off the leader two to three wide, flattened out in the drive. OL'
BLONDIE advanced inside early on the turn, came into upper stretch two wide, flattened out. TAKE IT EASY raced outside off the leaders, fanned six wide
into the stretch and failed to rally. BABY MO chased briefly three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
ANAM CARA rated nicely on the rail behind three dueling runners up front, angled just outside to pass a tiring rival through the turn, dropped in to the fence
for the run down the lane and dug in the final sixteenth getting through to have its head in front at the finish. RIFLING fought for the lead outside through the
turn, battled down the lane getting her head in front with a furlong to go but could not hold off the fast charging winner with a perfect tracking trip up the rail.
I'M A BOURBON GIRL pressed for the lead between horses in the backstretch, put away her inside rival to lead mid turn but still was challenged by an
outside foe into the stretch, battled gamely between runners down the lane surrendering second nearing the wire and meanwhile not losing all that much for
the victory. STOLEN was away slowly to trail, began a rally outside of runners while six wide with a quarter to go and found his best stride late closing
fastest of all late. TITO'S CALLING broke out at the start, advanced inside of runners through the turn, split rivals at the top of the stretch and showed some
good energy to the finish. SENSATIONAL SARAH was roused outside of runners while mid pack on the turn, rallied mildly at the quarter pole for an eighth
and levelled out the last sixteenth. CANADIANSWEETHEART stalked mid pack outside runners early on, was ridden to keep up with a quarter to go and
stalled inside the last eighth. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO pressed the lead on the rail, began to weaken at the mid point on the turn and retreated inside
through the lane. BEAR SPEED saved ground while placed mid pack, backed away on the rail entering the stretch and offered little for the drive. FLAT OUT
ANGEL broke outwards on the start and was never a factor. ONE LAST FLING broke well, was in tight down the backstretch early, shuffled near the back at
the half mile pole and never became involved afterwards.

LINCOLNVILLE BEACH stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead just past the furlong marker, held while being kept to the
task. KERICS BEAUTY shifted in and saved ground racing mid-pack near the rail through the turn, came out at the quarter pole, was gaining too late.
GREEN GABLES stalked then vied outside three wide, came in a bit past the five-sixteenths while taking the lead, was headed in mid-stretch but kept on
gamely. OHEAVENS vied inside runners, came out just a bit past the five-sixteenths then altered out in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. HALO
STYLE steadily dropped back heading into and on the turn racing off the inside, came out a bit in the stretch and kept on late to improve position. MY GIRL
HOOTER settled off the pace, swung seven wide into the stretch, ran on with mild late interest. BENNY'S BUTTON contended between runners, checked
sharply past the five-sixteenths when squeezed, shifted to the rail in upper stretch and ran on. DAZZLING DIVA raced near the inside and was never near
enough to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BENNY'S BUTTON AGAINST BOTH
OHEAVENS AND GREEN GABLES ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
ENGLISH BISCUIT raced on the rail throughout, waited mid turn to commence her rally, steadied briefly entering the stretch, found room two off the fence
into the stretch and split rivals at the sixteenth pole to get up to win narrowly. LIDO KEY waited behind horses with a quarter to run, angled out to the three
path bumping an outside runner at the top of the stretch, got her head in front with a sixteenth to go but could not hold off the winner inside nearing the wire.
ANN OF CLEVES began circling runners midway on the far turn, rallied widest in the eight path turning for home, loomed outside at the eighth pole to
contest for the lead but could not quicken enough the last part to get up for the victory. MARAIS broke out on the start, tracked outside four wide down the
backstretch, was five wide turning for home in contention with multiple runners at the eighth pole and faded late to get a minor placing. MAKE NO MISTAKE
sat behind the two pacesetters for the better part of the race, angled out at the top of the stretch to challenge for the lead, was bumped by an inside rival
nearing the three sixteenth pole and levelled out in the final stages. UMNEYAAT saved ground on the far turn, was behind a wall of horses entering the
stretch, waited to find a seam to run and was one paced the final eighth. ENDORPHIN RUSH challenged for the lead inside for the first three quarters of a
mile, put away that outside rival only to be headed by multiple runners with a furlong to go and retreated in the late stages while on the fence.
HALLANVAARA trailed into the far turn, offered a brief run with a quarter of a mile to go, angled out to the eight path for the drive and stalled while widest.
BELLA NINA was asked on the far turn between runners and offered little response. BILLYJANE battled for the lead with another rival from the break, was
collared at the top of the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
WHO'S THE STAR was unhurried early shifting in to save ground on the first turn, still trailed late on the far turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, lost
the crop past the three-sixteenths pole but nevertheless under vigorous hand-urging launched a furious rally to drive past late. COLLECTIVE FORCE settled
mid-pack along the inside, continued to save ground on the far turn beginning to edge nearer, came out three wide about the quarter pole, gained second
from between rivals late. LIKE THE KING set the pace inside, was overtaken by a very wide rival about the seven-eighths, switched outside that one about
the five-eighths and in tandem moved well clear of the others, regained the lead just past the quarter pole, was clear into mid-stretch but caught and just
saved show honors. KEYFLOWER (FR) raced off the pace two to three wide early, was mid-pack into the far turn moving out from two to four wide on that
bend and dropped back, put to a drive in upper stretch going first out then to the rail to weave through traffic, gained inside late but missed third. MIGHTY
HEART broke well and moved out early then didn't appear to corner well drifting to the five path on the first turn, moved back in to pursue the leading pair
two to three wide through the second turn coming out four wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly. SIR SAHIB settled off the pace three to four wide early,
moved out from four to six wide on the far turn, went evenly to improve position. BRITISH ROYALTY was about mid-pack moving in from four to three wide
on the first turn, encouraged a bit leaving the far turn going two then three wide on that bend, failed to produce a rally. TOWN CRUISE was forced eight
wide on the first turn, moved to the lead about the seven-eighths still racing very wide, angled to the rail about the five-eighths, was overtaken in upper
stretch and weakened. CIBOLIAN saved ground but failed to rally. FROSTED OVER was forced seven wide early on the first turn, eased back and shifted in
four wide racing mid-pack up the backstretch, dropped back and faded. PRIMO TOUCH was forced out six wide on the first turn, moved forward and shifted
in chasing the leaders three to four wide, came up empty. THIS RACE WAS RUN AT AN ABOUT DISTANCE, FINAL CLOCKING WAS HAND TIMED,
FRACTIONS PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
THE HARD WAY led under restraint early, repelled a rival mid turn, opened up upper stretch and held safe while kept to the task. MENAGERIE stalked the
leader through the backstretch, bid midway on the turn, but was repulsed by the winner and was a clear second best today. HEKLA'S AURA stalked
between runners, remained into contention on the turn, but was no match for the top pair holding onto show stubbornly. COURTINGCOURTNEY trailed
between runners to start, encountered traffic at the quarter pole before finding a seam at the eighth and inching up late to just miss show. STOLE THE
RING settled off the pace, moved up between rivals in the four path turning for home and ran on evenly down the lane. ROAD MAP was three wide initially
in a stalking position, dropped back near the rear into the turn, floated to the five path top of the stretch and offered no threat to the finish. CLINK CHEERS
was nestled inside behind the leaders through the backside, still in range mid turn, but dropped back in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PRINCESS HALIME exchanged a light bump at the start, settled in behind the leading trio in the two path to stalk, advanced rapidly along the inside late on
the far turn coming out near the quarter pole, struck a narrow lead at the eighth pole and edged away under steady handling. FLOURISHING was intent on
the lead moving forward into the first turn and shifting in to dictate terms, was challenged by outside rivals late up the backstretch, fended off those to edge
clear again by the five-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but second best. GOLD FORESTER was forwardly-positioned inside heading to the first turn,
switched out to stalk two wide, edged closer to press between up the backstretch, could not kick on with the top ones but held show honors. SMARTY
ILLUSION was reserved inside well back of the leaders early, advanced inside on the far turn then angled four wide past the quarter pole, ran on with good
late energy. GORMLEY GIRL moved forward early then settled in behind switching out to stalk three wide, edged closer late up the backstretch, weakened
into upper stretch but kept on evenly to regain a position late. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA saved ground through both turns mid-pack, came out for the stretch
run and went evenly. PACENZA was unhurried early trailing the field racing off the inside, advanced outside foes four wide on the far turn swinging six wide
into upper stretch and ran on with mild interest. PHIL IN ECHO moved in two wide on the first turn, went three deep between foes on the far turn still well off
the leaders and failed to rally. I AM I SAID shifted in two to three wide into the first turn, continued from that position and weakened.
