THREE FOR THREE was unhurried around the first turn then steadily advanced up the rail through the final turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch
and wore down the leader to but just up. TULSA TIME set a pressured lead to set all the pace from off the rail and had no kick left in the final jumps to lose
the head nod. QUICKTRIP VAN was allowed to settle around the first turn and down the backstretch made a mild bid from the two path on the turn then
moved out four wide in upper stretch but couldn't match strides with the winner in the drive. MUCHO GIFTED pressed the pace from the two path through
the final turn and tired.

MONGOLIAN ROSE saved ground down the backstretch the angled out on the turn to be three to four wide in upper stretch to make a rally but was not
enough. WHO B DAT was last away and trailed through the turn moved out to three or four wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals in the drive. MISS
IZZY BEE went to the early lead from the three path and weakened in mid turn. PUT A BLING ON IT was fractious in the gate before they opened then vied
for the lead from the three path through the turn and faded. WILD SAINT was unsettled in the gate, raced back and was not a threat.

DALLAS GOLD was void of early speed while saving ground through the final turn moved out the three wide in mid stretch to have his best strides late and
drew clear. LAST CALL LEROY stalked the pace from the three path moved to engage the leader at the half pole then took the lead briefly at the eighth pole
to prove second best. AMBER WAVES went the the clear lead for a half then was challenged at the half pole and fought gamely for the lead to the eighth
pole but was empty in the final furlong. BUMPER POOL raced back down the backstretch was roused to make a mild bid going into the turn and flattened
out. SIGNSOFAWARRIOR tracked the leaders from the two path to the half pole and dropped back.
