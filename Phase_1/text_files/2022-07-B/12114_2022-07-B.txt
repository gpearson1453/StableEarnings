Footnotes
ROSES FOR ASHLEY chased outside to the stretch, rallied past late, going away. MS MERRABEL good position throughout is, tried hard all out for place
spot. SIS BOOM BOB set pace to deep stretch, oufinished for place spot late. KENDALL SPIRIT no speed to the stretch, ran on in the drive and finished up
well. ARISTA THE CAT raced evenly lacking the late response needed in the drive. TIZ BIZ broke slow from the gate, far back into the stretch, improved.
MISS SOVELIA raced well off rail throughout while never a menace. MISS UNDECIDED speed from inside to deep stretch, faltered in the late going.
GOLDEN RETRIEVER never a threat. STORMY CUT saved ground to no avail. SHADY BABY dropped far back.
