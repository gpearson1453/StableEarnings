Footnotes
HOLY EMPEROR led the field while saving ground around the firs turn, dueled while racing inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, and drew off
in the stretch. TROPHY DADDY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the far turn and was no match for the winner, chasing that rival home. SPHEROID stalked the leaders from the three path through the opening half mile,
began a bid while racing four wide around the second bend and chased the winner down the lane, no match for him. SOUTHERNER raced in the two path
around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn in the two path and was empty in
the lane. RY DONT LIE veered out entering the first turn and was checked hard into place by his rider, raced in the four path from there, pressed the pace
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and weakened in the stretch. U COMPLETE ME reared up leaving the gate,
trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and was no factor. ELUSIVE
D'ORO raced three wide around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and faded in
the lane.

Footnotes
VITA brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack
on the outside, began to improve position from the three path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch, and pulled clear in the final furlong.
SUSAN STRONG hit the gate leaving it, raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path
coming around the far turn and chased the winner home, no match for that rival late. FIANNA HILLS pressed the pace from the three path on the outside
through the opening half mile, moved up to challenge from the three path around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. DIXIE LOVING raced at the
back of pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane.
STORIED TRIP raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and faded
in the stretch. HONEST WOMAN brushed with the horse to her inside at the break, saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the
backstretch, began to drop back while racing on the rail around the far turn and tired from there.

clear in upper stretch and held that margin to the wire. SPIRIT SOUL raced off the pace in the four path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began
to improve position coming around the second bend and chased the winner to the wire. TAPPED OUT saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HELIOCHROME veered out
mildly at the break, raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the
two path and finished evenly. MY BOY SAM raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the
three path and was not a threat. DOUBLE PRIORITY saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch. FIFTYFIVE STRONG raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
between horses, navigated the far turn in the two path and faded from there.
