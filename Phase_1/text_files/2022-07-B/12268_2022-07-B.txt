Footnotes
MISS G G broke sharp, soon got clear while in hand, extended that advantage through the turn while still under restraint, not threatened through the lane
while never being asked for much to win in handy fashion. JACKIE FLASH off the early pace and the inside, asked for run three wide late turn, roused into
the lane, drifted in a bit past the furlong marker when making a bid for the second spot, drew well clear for that position while never a threat to the winner.
SILVER CURRENCY off a step slow, continued to lack speed into and through the turn, came four wide for the drive, rallied mildly while widest down the
lane to be clear of the others. MS. PRIESTLY broke out, was straightened to race closest to the winner for almost four furlongs, faltered toward the inside to
lose a couple of positions the final furlong. CUPID'S JOY off a step slow, failed to menace in remaining back. LATER LATERTIFFANY in mid pack for three
furlongs, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
WILD MALLORY broke well from the outside, cleared toward the rail, set an uncontested pace while under a modest hand ride and won geared down late to
be ridden out at the wire. GREEN MONSTER settled off the early pace along the inside, squeezed through a narrow opening inside of a rival along the rail
late in the turn, chased the winner into the lane, closed the gap on that one late and was clearly second best. GALAXY THIRTYSIX void of early foot inside,
moved out in the two path early turn, continued to race just off the inside into the lane, improved position inside of rivals while not a threat to the top two.
GABY'S PROMISE went one paced throughout while racing outside, failed to muster a closing response. SUMMERTIME BANDIT broke with the winner,
chased that one for three furlongs and gave way. VELVET ISLE fell back to trail after the start, continued to lack early foot, four wide into the lane, failed to
rally. ROARING QUINN was finished early, trailed home well beaten.

clear after a half, offered little resistance to the winner into the stretch to prove no match for that one, remained clear for the runner up spot. VANCOUVER

PRAY IDE SING broke well, dueled up front closest to but not on the inside, came in the two path exiting the turn as he was putting the other speed away,
remained clear to the wire under steady handling. QUANA DUDE closest to the dueling leaders, swung out four wide turning for home, long drive for the
second spot well out in the strip, determined, little late gain on the winner. GRACIDA in the second flight while saving ground, continued along the rail into
and through the stretch, outkicked for the runner up position. BROADWAY JONES last away, trailed for a half, saved ground into the lane, improved position
with some mild interest without posing a serious threat. HONOR MY SPEED dueled up front in the three path outside the winner for just over a half, had little
left for the drive. NO PLANS remained back in failing to menace while racing three wide. SR. CLARKY steadily faded.

Footnotes
SMOOTH COLLIERY outrun early along the inside, began to move far turn, angled out three wide when continuing to advance turning for home, outside bid
past the furlong marker, drove strongly clear. HOORAY AUSTIN last to leave, moved up to stalk the first flight three wide into the turn, floated out a bit to be
four wide into the lane by the winner, fell back off that one upper stretch, rallied late to be up in time for the second spot. TAPIZARS SECRET pressed the
leader from along the inside, fell back a bit in the turn, rebid nearing midstretch, proved no match for the winner late, caught for the second spot in the
waning strides. PRIZELESS narrowly set the pace in the two path, briefly vied between horses when challenged in midstretch then began to weaken.
SONOMA CRUSH fell back to trail, showed little while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BEYOND D'ORO tucked in when forwardly placed into the first turn, settled in the second flight in the run up the backstretch while continuing to save
ground, moved out and was three to four wide late in the second turn, challenged entering the stretch, drew out steadily while kept to pressure. CRIDER
CHASE three wide when with the pace into the first turn, angled in and dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, continued to vie into the lane, could
not match strides with the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the place. THINKING OF HER fell back to mid pack the opening quarter after breaking
alertly, remained settled in the run up the backstretch, between foes in the two path into the lane, bothered slightly by a drifting LIGHT AS A WHISPER just
inside the furlong marker, up late for the show. KAITLYN'S COURT last away, remained void of speed for a half, began to improve along the inside far turn,
continued inside and picked off a couple of additional rivals through the stretch while not a serious threat. LIGHT AS A WHISPER four wide into the first
turn, dueled two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, weakened from between the top two upper stretch while drifting out a bit in midstretch. LAKE
RUNNER lacked speed for six furlongs, was four wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not making much of an impact. MY REBEL GIRL
in the second flight well off the inside, three wide into the stretch, gave way in the run to the wire. KAPPA HILL was finished early, trailed home.

INTIMIDATION fell back trail after the start, continued unhurried into and through most of the turn, swung five wide into the lane, closed with good resolve
down the middle of the strip to be up in time in a well judged ride. SCRAPPY ARTIE with the pace along the inside, continued to vie through the turn, shook
off the other speed to be well clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner in the final strides while holding sway for the place. FIESTY FIST in the
second flight outside, came four wide and inside the winner into the stretch, could not keep pace with that one to the wire, not enough late for the second
spot. TRUE DEAL with the pace three wide four three furlongs and began to weaken. JR'S PACIFICO saved ground when outrun, continued along the
inside into the lane, moved out nearing the furlong marker to pick off a single tiring rival without making an impact. DANCIN WITH ANGELS vied up front
between rivals and outside the runner up, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
ENOUGH HEART broke sharp, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to duel into the turn, shook off that foe to be clear into the lane,
widened that advantage a bit past the furlong marker then held the rallying runner up safe late. LA JAZZ void of speed, came into the stretch in the two path,
steered out a bit for room and finished willingly to be up for the place and to be closing the gap on the winner in the final strides. STRONG CHICK in the
flight flight outside, came three wide out of the turn, steady grind late, could not contain the runner up while in time herself for the show. MO BELLA vied up
front along the inside, fell back and chased the winner upper stretch, continued to weaken to lose a couple of positions late. RESPECT ALL raced closest to
the dueling leaders up the backstretch and began to gradually weaken before a half. MAC LEGACY last to leave, void of early foot in trailing early, five wide
exiting the turn, picked off a couple of faltering rivals to improve slightly. MISS MIRACLE GIRL in mid pack early while outside, four wide turning for home,
had little left for the stretch run. TIME TO SLEEP broke back and was always outrun.
