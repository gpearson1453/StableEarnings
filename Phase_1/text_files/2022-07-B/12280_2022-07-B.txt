YO YO MAMA dueled for command from inside, battled through the turn and into the stretch, cleared with a sixteenth remaining and lasted over the
runner-up. IT'S SAUL RIGHT sat off the pace outside a rival, bumped with inner foe entering the turn, rounded the bend four wide, summoned a late rally
but missed. COCKTAIL PRINCESS off alertly to take the lead then dueled outside YO YO MAMA, fought with that rival to the stretch and weakened in the
final sixteenth. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY hit the gate but still came away fairly well, got bumped from outside entering the turn, moved into the two path
around the bend, kept on for a minor award but failed to threaten. ELEGANT SWAY was off slow and broke in, raced greenly up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend and advanced in the drive. MISS KALINE was off slow to begin, climbed while racing greenly early, took the turn two wide and
improved position. PAYTRICIA stumbled leaving the gate, took the turn five wide and failed to menace. HENNY ON ICE broke a step slow, was closest in
pursuit three wide on the turn, then weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
OVERDUE unhurried in the beginning and moved into the two path, angled out to the four path on the far turn, rallied outside the leader and drew clear late.
NILES CHANNEL broke well and took control early then steered to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, met the bid from BORDER TOWN on the
far turn, cleared at the top of the stretch, took an awkward step at the eighth pole and got run down by the winner in the final sixteenth. BORDER TOWN
forwardly placed four then three deep on the first turn, continued up close to the outside the leader up the backstretch, bid from outside around far turn, lost
contact into the stretch and stayed on to save the show. PROUD PEDRO (FR) reserved in the early going and steered to the inside, moved out on the
backstretch, went three wide into the lane and produced a mild rally for a minor award. TABLE FOR TEN bumped with rival entering the first turn, raced on
the inside near the back, coaxed on the far turn but had to wait briefly, lacked room from upper to midstretch, then tipped out and improved position.
RESPECT THE HUSTLE pulled and bumped early on the inside, continued to pull the rider along early on the backstretch, saved ground through the far
turn and could not rally when called upon. THRESHOLD raced off the rail in the early going, two then three wide on the second bend and also failed to rally.
COMRADERY (IRE) was off slow to begin, chased three deep then outside a rival on the first turn, stalked three deep on the backstretch, remained three
wide into the lane and weakened. VICENTE'S SHADOW bumped with rival and got put in tight between rivals entering the first turn, trailed two wide into the
stretch and made no impact. FOREVER MO bumped while pulling early, raced up close in the two path, tracked between rivals into the far turn, stayed two
wide into the lane and faded. BIG FISH stumbled in the beginning, went four wide into the first turn, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, stayed wide
through the second bend and was never a factor.

SQUARE DEAL chased the top trio from outside, bid four deep around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch and drew clear under right-handed urging.
BEAR CHUM (AUS) vied three deep up the backstretch, continued to battled outside rivals around the turn, fought on to the eighth pole and stayed on
gamely for second. CHARGE CASH went up to contest the pace inside rivals, fought with outside trio around the turn, could not match strides with the top
pair in the final furlong but kept on to gain the show. FACTS MATTER broke out, vied between rivals to the eighth pole, flattened late and got edged for the
show. PERFECTO AMOR chased three deep leaving the backstretch, moved in some then drifted out a bit on the turn, entered the stretch three wide,
moved out in the lane and needed to find more late. SMILEFORME bobbled a bit at the start, settled on the inside, eased out and came three wide into the
drive and improved position. HIGH HEATER chased between foes then got shuffled a bit early on the turn, kept on two wide to the stretch and could not
rally. BOB'S SNIPER chased on the inside, moved out in the stretch and lacked a rally. ACTIVE ACCOUNT broke a step slow, saved ground around the
bend and was not a factor. AROUND THE DIAL got forced out a bit at the start, raced three wide then lacked room past the five-sixteenths pole, came four
wide into the sturn and never responded to urging. IMA SAINT TOO off slow and broke in, moved out on the backstretch, came three wide into the drive and
failed to menace. REBEL WAR broke slow and came out in the beginning, chased six then five wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CALLHERCONTESSA got bumped both sides at the start, sped clear and moved to the inside, asked right-handed exiting the far turn and drew away.
SENSIBLE MOVE broke slow, unhurried on the inside, tipped out into the stretch and closed to gain the place. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY was off a bit slow to
begin, angled in on the first turn, looked to progress but lacked room on the far turn, altered to the inside and cut the corner into the stretch and summoned
a mild rally to get up for third. AVERY BLUE brushed with inner rival at the start, stalked the leader from inside, took aim two wide into the stretch but
faltered in the late stages. CANDY ON TOP sat off the pace on the inside, coaxed through the far turn, moved out in the stretch, lacked room in deep stretch
and could not regain momentum. INFINITE LOVE was rank in the early going and had to steady off heels, raced in traffic on the far turn, altered out and
came five wide into the stretch and kept on to improve placings. DON'T JU FORGET tracked three then four deep on the first turn, came four wide into the
stretch and weakened. JESSEBEAR pulled early on the inside, tracked between foes on the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide and weakened.
TRULY A MESS went two then three wide around the first turn, raced outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, urged three wide on the second bend but
lacked the needed response. PEACEHAVEN bumped leaving the gate, got put in tight and checked early on the first turn, traveled between runners then
started to weaken on the far turn and faded in the lane. BACKSTREET AFFAIR tracked off the inside, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

wide, lugged out in the stretch and weakened. KLEEN KARMA bumped leaving the gate, traveled two then three wide on the first turn then became rank
early, tracked between foes up the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and weakened. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN pulled a bit on the inside and had
to steady off heels nearing the five-eighths pole, tipped to the two path for the far turn, eased out and entered the lane four wide and could not rally. RACE

Footnotes
PEPPERMAN broke a step slow and got bumped at the start, went three to four wide on the clubhouse turn, moved into range up the backstretch, drew
alongside the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, quickly took over and cleared past the quarter pole, challenged by MONGOLIAN KINDOM in deep stretch,
drifted out and bumped that rival near the wire and held gamely. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM traveled along the inside near the back early, angled five wide
around the far turn, closed from outside and collared the leader at the sixteenth pole while drifted out, got bumped by PEPPERMAN nearing the wire and
could not get by. CHRIS FIX was off slowest to start, traveled four then three wide on the first turn, took closer up the backstretch, coaxed four wide on the
second bend and bested the rest. HULK dueled for the lead from outside around the clubhouse turn, cleared early on the backstretch, challenged by rival at
the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished command and could not keep up past the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane. TEX HANLEY bumped outside
rival in the beginning, tracked the pace from inside, urged through the far turn and could not offer the needed response. MONGOL SONG stalked the pace
wide through the first turn, moved up and was closest in pursuit entering the far turn, lost ground under urging around the bend, cut the corner into the
stretch and weakened. RYE RUNNER sat off the pace in the two path early, between foes in the middle stages, raced outside a pair of rivals at the
five-sixteenths pole, stayed off the rail to the stretch and could not rally. TAKE THE TWO TEN bumped both sides at the start, raced two wide at the back
early, trailed wide into the lane and never got involved. BENISSIMO went five then four wide around the first turn, traveled outside a rival at the back,
remained off the rail on the far turn and tired. KING ROB dueled for the lead from inside early, chased the leader up the backstretch, dropped back between
rivals on the far turn and tired.
