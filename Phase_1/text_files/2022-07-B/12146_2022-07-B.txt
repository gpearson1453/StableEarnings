NITRO TIME was away alertly to set the early pace and drew clear on the turn, then drew out in the drive to prove much the best under right handed crop
urging. SPEEDY MOONLITE stalked the pace three wide and proved to be no match for the winner but kept on to be clearly second best. RAILMASTER
was steadied slightly leaving the three eighths while four wide, then was three wide on the turn and was up for the show award while not being asked for his
best. KITTEN'S MAN chased the early pace three wide, then made a inside bid on the turn but flattened out, lost show award late. PAPA TONY was settled
and was five wide leaving the three eighths, then was not a threat. AMERICAN QUALITY was up close on the inside early and checked by the half mile
marker and lost a iron and was eased on the turn, walked off.

BEYOND THE BEND was rated along the inside early, advanced on the turn and eased out to make a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, hit the front
nearing the furlong marker and drew clear to prove best under a mild drive. READY AND RICH stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the
turn, hit the front leaving the turn but could not go with the winner in the final furlong, second best. GRAB THE GOLD set a pressured pace two wide and
then dueled for command by the quarter pole and faded in the drive. KITTEN'S SOLUTION pressed the pace on the inside and weakened. NO MORE TALK

STAY HYDRATED set a pressured pace while getting over to the inside, then dueled with TRENDING UP on the far turn and through the stretch, dug in
gamely to hold on under a drive. TRENDING UP was rated along three to four wide early, made a four wide move on the far turn, then dueled with the
winner to the wire but could not get by that rival, just missed. MIDNIGHT HAULER was well placed on the inside and lacked a late response, bested rest.
EAGLES CRY was between rivals on the first turn, then was rated along and again between rivals leaving the three eighths and checked then weakened.
RON DON SCORESE pressed the pace two to three wide and tired. THE RIDER ON EAGLES CRY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST TRENDING UP FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE, AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE REPLAYS THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS
DISALLOWED AND THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.
