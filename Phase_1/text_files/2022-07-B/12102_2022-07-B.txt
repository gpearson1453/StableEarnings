Footnotes
TWO PHIL'S led the field between horses up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and dug in gamely in the lane to pull clear. FREE
SOUL chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, launched a bid in upper stretch and chased the winner
home. INSTINCTUAL tracked the pacesetter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged while racing three wide approaching the
quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. CRAVENS pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and faded in the lane. CHI TOWN HUSTLER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
two path and was empty in the stretch. OCCASIONAL MOON trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and made up
some ground late while never threatening.

HOT BLOODED saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn, switched to the outside to began a bid approaching the eighth pole and pulled clear. KING VEGA (GB) steadied slightly while saving ground around
the first turn, settled at the back of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position from the rail racing around the far turn, bumped
extensively with SEVEN CHANNELS in midstretch, found racing room and gained ground late to the wire. SEVEN CHANNELS raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, had extended contact
with KING VEGA in midstretch and gained ground to the wire once clear of that rival. BUY ME CANDY raced in the four path around the first turn, chased
the leaders up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and finished evenly. MAX K. O. led the field while saving ground around the first
turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way on the inside around the far turn and gave way in the final furlong. JIMMY DAN hopped up leaving
the gate, trailed the field from the rail in the early going, navigated the far turn from the two path and never fired. HANALEI'S HOUDINI raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, came around the far turn in the three path, swung wider still entering the stretch and came
up empty from there. LAND MARK DEAL tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing
in the three path around the turn and tired further in the lane. BOTH A TRAINERS AND RIDERS OBJECTION OF FOUL WAS MADE BY THE
CONNECTIONS OF THE THIRD PLACE FINISHER, SEVEN CHANNELS, CITING INTERFERENCE BY THE SECOND PLACE FINISHER, KING VEGA

turn still in the two path, gained ground down the lane, bumped with GOGO SHOES at the wire and got up for the win in the final strides. GOGO SHOES
saved ground around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and dug in
gamely from there, drifting out late and bumping with DIDIA at the wire and getting caught in the final jump. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began to improve position while racing three wide around the far
turn, and was outkicked in the final furlong. UNRULY JULIE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, improved position mildly in upper stretch and was outkicked from there. NO MO LADY saved
ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, raced inside around the second bend and weakened late. PYTHONESS raced off the
pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane while never threatening.
FATE FACTOR raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, made a bid from the two path coming
around the turn and flattened between horses in the lane. OUT OF SORTS saved ground at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. LADY MACHO reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two
path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was not a factor.

the two path, was coaxed from inside rounding the turn, and held on for place. SOCIAL CHATTER rated from the four path, was driven along in the five path
at the top of the stretch, and improved for show. VIOLENZA raced in midpack from the two path, tipped out to the four path ath the top of the lane, but
finished evenly. GOIN' GOOD pressed two wide, was ridden along while two wide rounding the turn, but flattened in late stretch. MINAUN (IRE) raced from
well back between rivals and was no factor. RICHIES GREAT GIRL trailed into the stretch and was never a threat. RAKASSAH (IRE) stalked along the
inside but was empty heading into the stretch.

Footnotes
HURTGEN FOREST showed the way the entire way and was in command at the wire. KING OF TSAVO (GB) chased the leader throughout and was best
of the rest. PACIFIST settled off the pace for the opening mile, began to move up on the second lap and continued gaining through the stretch run. ROMP
raced at the back of the pack through the opening lap, began to improve position coming around the third turn and finished evenly. SA'AD (FR) raced off the
pace and passed tiring horses in the lane. CONNAGH'S QUAY chased the leader through the opening lap, continued pursuit of that rival up the backstretch
for the second time and weakened from there. PENICILLIN SUCCESS raced in the middle of the pack between horses and made no bid. MACHENBANK
(GER) raced outside in the middle of the pack throughout and came up empty. LOWCOUNTRY raced in the middle of the pack in the early going and then
tired. DANCE PANTS trailed the field throughout and was never a factor.
