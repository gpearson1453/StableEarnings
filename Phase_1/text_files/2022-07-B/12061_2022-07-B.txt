PRETTY ARIA away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid after the leader entering the
final turn while racing two wide, and finished determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to gain command in deep stretch and pull clear late. LASTING
LIGHT away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while under snug restraint, quickly advanced three wide soon after straightening down the
backside, overtook the pacesetter and opened a clear lead entering the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, but was no match for PRETTY
ARIA when collared in mid stretch, but proved clearly second best. THE KAT'S BACK settled off the early pacesetters while saving ground along the inside
entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, but finished two wide in the drive to prove
best of the rest. BAKZONE settled off the early leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
needed more late when unable to make a serious late impact. DEFINITE PLEASURE broke sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, controlled the pace from along the inside into the backstretch, was quickly overhauled approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong.

OUREVELADY settled off the contested early pave while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to bide her time well behind
the battling leaders in the run down the backside, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide from between rivals in
deep stretch to get up in time. VON DOM away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of WISE MARKET through the stretch the first time, continued to
set a pressured pace from just off the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, put away his pace rival leaving the turn, and just failed to
last. DEBATABLE settled well off the dueling leaders entering he stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to bide his time well off the
pacesetters in the run down the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing two wide in the
drive to get up for a share. ACE DEUCE broke sharply and tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail,
maintained his position into the backstretch while two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn to loom a danger leaving the turn, but
drifted six wide entering the lane, while losing that momentum, and finished six wide in the lane. WISE MARKET broke sharply and dueled for the lead three
wide from the outside of VON DOM entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, gave up the chase entering the lane, and faded in the late stages. The one mile split for this race was unavailable at

STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY broke sharply, but was allowed to settle well off the contested early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the
backstretch, began to advance smartly midway down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, swung five wide for the drive, and finished full of
run to prove best. TIME TICKER away well and chased the leaders three wide into the first turn, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, assumed control entering the lane, but was unable to fend off a late surge by STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY late in a game effort. BUNNY
rushed up from along the rail to vie for the lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into the final
turn, appeared to lose focus leaving the turn momentarily while surrendering the lead, but finished with late interest while re-rallying two wide in deep stretch
to grab a share. SHESBOURBONONICE away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of BUNNY in
the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep pace with that rival while racing two wide into the final turn, but battled on gamely late from along the inside
in a solid effort. PETERSON LANDING was pinched at the start and settled well off the leaders entering the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing one out from the rail in the drive. MILO'S COMMAND chased the leaders
four wide entering the first turn, before settling off the pacesetters while racing three wide in the run down the backside, rallied two wide into the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. WELLSLEY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, saved ground entering the final turn, but
failed to make a late impact. HONOR THE QUEEN lagged well back early while racing two wide entering the backstretch, was always well back, and was
never a factor.

FRANKIE MACHINE tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, engaged the pacesetter to force the issue two wide
entering the second turn, forced the pace from the outside of MCMURPHY in the run to the final turn, but the better of that foe entering the turn to open a
clear advantage, and widened his lead late under confident handling. MR. QUALITY broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time
while saving ground along the inside, held a tracking trip behind the dueling leaders in the run down the backside, launched his bid two wide entering the
final turn, was no match for the winner over the final furlong, but battled gamely to prove second best. JUST MAKE BELIEVE away alertly and stalked the
leader into the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, raced into a tracking trip three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the
rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to grab a share. COULTERBERRY unhurried early while dropping back to trail,
launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, but was left with to much to do late while finishing five wide in the drive. MCMURPHY away well and
rushed up to take the lead from the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match
strides with his pace rival approaching the final turn, and faded in the late stages. BODEGA was a step slow at the start, and settled off the early pace while
saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time well off the leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, but failed to make his presence felt late. KNOPFLER settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail through the
stretch the first time, continued to bide his time well off the contested pace in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to
respond when called upon over the final furlong.

DAPHNE tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, assumed
command entering the lane and quickly pulled clear. AMANDA lagged well off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, launched her bid two wide from well back entering the final turn, and closed with a rush one out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place
late. ALOBRAH rushed up from along the rail to assume command entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and outfinished late for the place. KLOEPATRA away well,
but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more
late while finishing three wide in the drive. VISENYA away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the leaders while saving ground entering
he backstretch, rallied smartly from along the indie through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late when called upon. MARYS TAPPIN
SHOES was unprepared at the start, and hopped leaving the gate, trailed the field into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, was well off the leaders
in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to overcome her early misfortune. Following the running of this race
the stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race, in particular to MARYSTAPPIN SHOES, after review they deemed that the horse dwelt at the
start and no change was made to the original order of finish

SUNGOLD BEAUTY away well, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the dueling leader while saving ground at the rail entering he backstretch,
launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and wore down a stubborn KOALA late to get up in time. KOALA away alertly and vied for the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of DEVINE DANCING in the run down the backstretch, disposed of that rival to take
control entering the final turn, but was unable to fend off a determined bid by SUNGOLD BEAUTY through the lane, while proving clearly second best.
DON'T TESS ME settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, was forced to briefly take hold when racing up on heels
leaving the turn, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive to garner a share. LIZZIES
GIRL was bumped off stride soon after the start and settle off the contested early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two out from the
rail entering the final turn, and finished evenly one out from the rail in the drive. GROOVY GIRL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied four wide
from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the lane without posing a late threat. DEVINE DANCING broke
sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of KOALA entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run to the final turn,
was unable to match strides with that foe entering the turn, and faded over the final furlong.
