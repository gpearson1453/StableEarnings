Footnotes
GABBYS BIG NOTION saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep nearing the top of the stretch, dueled
clear past the eighth pole and held on well. HEROIC DEED stalked into the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the
far turn, cleared second mid-stretch but couldn't improve on the winner. ON SPOT settled off the pace about the four path on the opening turn, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage four wide on the far turn and came along for third later yards. MY MIRACLE MAN
took the lead nearing the three quarter pole then moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught at
the rail toward the head of the lane then flattened inside the eighth pole. BOUBOLINO saved ground, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn near the rail and weakened into the lane. TIME TO WISH raced with the early pace three wide, but dropped back into the first turn and faded leaving
the five sixteenths pole. SKIP THE BULL raced with the early pace two deep while between horses, gave way leaving the half mile pole, was eased on the
far turn but walked off post race. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
LUNAR IMAGE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, took over toward the head of the
stretch and dueled clear later yards. DASHING CIRCLES contested the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch but recovered the advantage toward
the three eighths pole, kept the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught leaving the turn and remained a factor to late stretch before relenting.
WALK THE BANK raced well off the early pace, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and improved steadily at the rail on the far turn, eased to
the three path into the lane and finished evenly. MANKLIN CREEK saved ground racing well back, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on
the far turn and raced evenly in the lane. MAKE WAY settled off the early pace in the two and three paths, left the first turn outside and picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and passed tiring rivals. VITO ANDOLINI stumbled leaving the gate then saved ground,
gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened stride. MORE PLEASE raced with the early pace two deep, took a
brief lead into the backstretch but was met toward the three eighths pole and weakened midway on the far turn. THATS MY DUDE stalked from the three
path the first turn but was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
CENTERFOLD ANGEL stalked inside on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, then dueled through the
stretch to take the nod in the final yards. TORCH CARRIER stalked two deep into the first turn, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead
two deep nearing the head of the lane, dug in under steady stretch handling but relented the final yards. MAE SAI PRINCESS was pinched from tight
quarters into the first turn then stalked three wide into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, dueled
through later yards for third and just lasted. CLEARLY VISIBLE was unprepared at the break and raced well back saving ground, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled out into the lane, finished well and just missed third. COURAGEOUS GRACE rounded the first
turn about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. PEACEFUL WAY
rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure approaching the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the head of the lane and weakened the final
furlong. MORTAL STORM rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn outside and showed little response. DEVILISH BEAUTY rounded the
first turn in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn.

HURRICANE DIRECTOR engaged in close chase, took the nod two deep while between horses midway on the turn and dug in determinedly to earn the
nod. JESS FOR KICKS pressured the pace and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, dug in gamely leaving the turn but missed the nod under
the wire. SEE THAT GIRL was bumped then shuffled back at the break, gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path, was carried further
outward leaving the turn but came along for third the final yards. HOLY PINK chased, ran near the rail on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole.
CAN'T FIGURE chased the early pace inside, rounded the turn off the rail, eased outward leaving the turn and passed rivals. LA REINA SUSAN set a
pressured pace, was met and dueled at mostly even terms from the three eighths pole, entered the turn about the three path but drifted through the turn and
flattened the final sixteenth. MY BEST GIRL engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn about the three path and weakened into the lane. DIXIE DIVA
broke outward and made contact with See That Girl, gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the five and six paths of the turn and showed little in the
lane. PRINCESS MIA ROSE gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn and had little left.

Footnotes
PISTOL P took the lead soon after the start and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, dug in to the challenge of Divining Dancer leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and put that one away past the eighth pole, picked up the challenge of POLITICAL
DECISION late stretch and held on. The latter rated off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
turn in the three path, took over second mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner every stride. DIVINING DANCER stalked off the rail then challenged
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, but dropped back into the stretch and gave up second
mid-stretch. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground racing well off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail and flattened in the lane. BOP MARLEY showed little response. VIDMER'S COURAGE raced off the pace about the three path and showed little
response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
PERSONABLE rated close inside and raced at even terms with In The Limelight leaving the seven sixteenths pole, edged away from that one nearing the
quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold on. ONE NIGHT MIKE came away a bit awkwardly and made contact with Juba
Bound then stalked in the three path on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn
and finished well at the outside girth of the winner. ANGELA'S ROMEO settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the
four path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. JUBA BOUND was bumped lightly leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked
up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path then flattened in the lane. SCARE DEM raced well back off the
rail on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path but
showed little in the lane. KVELLION was hustled to contention while tapering in and stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole but gave way at the rail on the far turn. ACASHA'S INTUITION mostly saved ground. ORANGEBURG raced off the pace about the three path, gave
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. IN THE LIMELIGHT set the early pace inside, came under pressure toward the
seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms with Personable from that point, but dropped back toward the quarter pole and faded readily at the rail on
the far turn.
