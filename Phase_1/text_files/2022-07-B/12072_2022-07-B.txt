Footnotes
NEVER CHANGE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing three wide at the seven-sixteenths and floated
four wide midway on the turn, cornered four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining in tandem with NORTH POLE to issue a challenge
inside the final sixteenth and was just up in the very last jump to the wire. PSYCHIC INCOME established the front and showed the way in hand just off the
inside patiently handled until set down continuing in the two path into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in growing leg weary
under late threat from a pair and was nailed on the line. NORTH POLE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing in concert with NEVER CHANGE through the final sixteenth and missed at the end. MISTICAL CURLIN
reluctant to load prior to the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in near the five-sixteenths to rail and took the inside
route into upper stretch, then stayed on one paced to the finish. READYSEEKGO stumbled at the start, showed the way early on along the inside before
being headed for the front six furlongs out by PSYCHIC INCOME, settled along the inside tracking that rival in closest aim, came under coaxing near the
seven-sixteenths, faded through the turn and angled four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. KNOT THE ONE coaxed from the start, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. FIERY HEART coaxed from the gate, chased two
to three wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung three wide at the head of the stretch and
was eased home to the end.

Footnotes
CHLOE ROSE tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the three then four path on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead while
asked for her best in upper stretch, disposed of TEA OLIVE into the final sixteenth and held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. CUPIDS
GIRL broke a bit awkwardly and was off a step slow while brushing with a foe, raced at the rear under some urging, went two then three wide around most
of the turn, shifted five wide inside the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed determinedly but
was too late while clear for the place. TEA OLIVE contested the pace on the outside, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied two then three wide around
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging while under pressure, lost the lead to the winner under a drive in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead
into the final sixteenth and weakened while able to get the show. NEW YORK BANKER broke a half-step slow, was urged along towards the rear, saved
ground around the turn and improved position. THIEF OF HEARTS was hustled from the start, dropped back under urging with five furlongs to run then
moved out, went three then four wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. QUICK MUNNY broke out
and hit the gate then brushed with a foe, was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging while two then three wide around the turn, was driven
four wide into the stretch then moved further out and came up empty. CLOSING DEALS was hustled to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a foe,
lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back with five-sixteenths to run and faltered then was eased in the
final furlong but walked off.

crop into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, was headed by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought to the final forty yards and was

that bend, settled at the rear down the backstretch, angled out approaching the half-mile pole, was caught five wide into the far turn, dropped to the three

moved out, shifted from three to five wide around the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch and came up empty. B C GLORY DAYS went three then two
wide on the first turn, stalked outside down the backstretch, dropped back into the far turn, was urged in the two path around that bend and retreated.

three wide later on that bend, settled outside down the backstretch, dropped from the four path to the rail early on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive and failed to respond.

SHUTTERS broke a half a beat slow, came under a firm hold off heels of CUT THE CORD into the first turn briefly skygazing under restraint before settling
two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close
stoutly on the outside to overhaul the front seventy yards from home, then prevailed edging away at the end under his own power. FRONT LINE DANCER
saved ground near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong to take brief command before being overthrown by the top one and was along willingly for the place honors. BARREL OF QUESTS
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to the finish to
procure the show honors. CITIZEN K four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths on near even terms for the front outside a
pair, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and took over brief command near the sixteenth marker, then got collared inside that
station and was outfinished in the late stages. MARINARA SAUCED three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. SIMPLY saved ground at the tail of the field patiently handled until set down angled six wide into upper
stretch following the eventual winner and kicked on belatedly to the wire. SPETTRO three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, took over the front
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, then
weakened in the late stages. MR. KRINGLE chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for home and offered no
response. RALLY SQUIRREL three wide in pursuit, got ridden along with five-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. CUT THE
CORD chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. LITTLE MADDY
BROWN showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under pressure from a pair and yielded at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
FLAMINGO HAWK was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside of two foes then chased the pace, angled out near the half-mile, went three wide
around the turn, gained four wide into the stretch then took the advantage, drifted in under a right-handed crop while moving clear outside the furlong
marker, switched to a left-handed crop just inside that marker and widened under steady urging. ALCOOLS was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on
the outside then in the two path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted in some nearing the furlong marker and safely secured the
place while no match for the winner. IN SKY WE TRUST was hustled from the break, showed speed between horses then set the pace under pressure from
his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive near the three-sixteenths and weakened but was well clear for the show. LONG
TERM THINKING bumped hard with a rival at the start while brushing with another foe, was pinched back while in tight between horses, raced at the rear of
the field, went two to three wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. DOUBLE SHOT bumped hard with a rival at the
start then was squeezed back while in tight between horses, raced well back in the field, saved ground under urging around the turn, turned into the stretch
in the two path and was no factor. CHRIS AND DAVE showed speed between horses, dropped back while crowded a bit nearing the five-eighths, went to
three wide around the turn and tired. MUSICAL AMERICA broke in and brushed with a foe, was urged along on the outside, dropped back four then five
wide around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BABY YODA broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to collar the top pair a just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. ANSWER IN chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. SIBELIUS coaxed from the
start, pressed the leader from the outside three then two wide advancing to take command three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch
shaking off that pace rival under a drive, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to salvage the show honors.
NOVA RAGS hustled from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home, dug in rallying
between foes a furlong out, then kept on but was bested for the show honors. REINVESTMENT RISK coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide down
the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and came up
empty. RIVER DOG bobbled at the break and recovered to show the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from SIBELIUS to the outside, tucked
inside with seven-sixteenths to go, yielded at the three-eighths, began to fade near the quarter pole and followed SIBELIUS into upper stretch, then got
eased through to the finish. DISCO PHAROAH coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under brief coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got
eased up on and went five wide into upper stretch and was allowed to finish under his own power, then walked off.

Footnotes
IN ITALIAN (GB) leaned out at the start but came out in front, moved in while hustled to the lead, showed the way on the inside through sharp fractions,
controlled the action around the far turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, was challenged by the runner-up while under a strong
hand-ride in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and held under strong handling. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) was
taken in hand early then wrestled back while rank, continued rank along the rail through the first turn, moved out onto the backstretch then settled more
kindly on the outside, was roused two then three wide around the far turn, pursued the winner into upper stretch, made a brief bid outside that foe before the
furlong marker but was out-kicked while clear for the place. BLEECKER STREET bumped with a rival at the start then was pinched back in tight quarters,
saved ground at the rear, moved out on the final turn, reached the four path around the five-sixteenths, was roused five wide into the stretch and improved
for the show but lacked the needed winning kick. ROUGIR (FR) bumped with a rival at the start then was squeezed back between foes, traveled around the
first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, remained on her inside
lead under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, continued on her inside lead while drifting in some nearing the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at
that point and lacked the needed response. DALIKA (GER) was brushed in the hindquarters just after the start, established a forward position early, went
three wide around the first turn, tracked outside down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the final turn, dropped back into upper stretch and
came up empty. CREATIVE FLAIR (IRE) came out some at the start, was taken in hand off heels early then moved out, went around the first turn in the two
path, tracked the pace on the inside of an opponent, was asked while inside on the far turn, came off the rail into the stretch and faltered. THE MILE

Footnotes
MO STRIKE came away in good order, disputed the pace on the outside while in hand, vied in the two to three path while between foes on the turn,
responded well when asked for his best into upper stretch, dueled with ANDIAMO A FIRENZE into the final sixteenth then drew clear under strong handling.
GREAT NAVIGATOR was well placed just off the pace, came under urging along the rail on the turn, cut the corner behind the pacesetter into upper stretch,
moved out behind foes nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly to just get the place while unable to impact the winner. ANDIAMO A FIRENZE
tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three to four path on the turn, was asked for more near the quarter-pole, battled outside in upper stretch,
dueled with the winner to the sixteenth-pole and weakened then just lost the place while clear for the show. FORTE settled off the pace, was roused three
wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. CURLY JACK showed good speed, disputed the pace on the
inside of the winner, vied near the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. MAJOR DUDE
established position just off the pace, drafted in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved out while put to a drive, chased
into the final furlong and came up empty. ROMAN GIANT stumbled at the start and was last to commence, raced towards the back under urging, rounded
the turn in the three path and failed to threaten. PROVE RIGHT settled off the pace, was roused four to five wide on the turn and failed to respond.
VALENZAN DAY was reluctant to load, lost his footing at the start, was urged along at the back on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. BOPPY O broke in and brushed the inside of the gate, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and had nothing left. I'M WIDE AWAKE broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was asked five wide on the turn, came
six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. PUTTHEBLAMEONME broke awkwardly while losing his footing some at the start, went three wide on
the turn and was no factor.
