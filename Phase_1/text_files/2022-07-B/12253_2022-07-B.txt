Footnotes
THE POSER rated from the four path, was ridden along from the four path into the stretch, took the lead passing the sixteenth pole, and cleared late.
EASTSIDE COOL stalked in the three path, took the lead while drifting out slightly passing the eighth pole, and was caught late to place. GIGGING was
unhurried from the two path, was coaxed while tipping out to the four path at the top of the lane, and improved for show. SOROS pressed inside, was
hustled from the two path into the stretch, but finished evenly. MEDICINE TAIL set the pace from the two path, was cued inside at the top of the lane, but
yielded. MONEY RIDE tracked in the five path but never threatened.

Footnotes
JALEN JOURNEY raced in midpack from the four path, ranged up four wide at the top of the lane, and rallied to get up late. KADRI prompted the pace from
the three path, took the lead while two wide coming into the stretch, and ran on but was caught late to place. FAST BOB trailed from the inside, was ridden
from the four path around the turn, floated into the six path in upper stretch, and improved for show. BUBBA GRUMP set the pace, was coaxed from inside
rounding the turn, but faded in the stretch. SPANKHURST stalked from inside, was driven between rivals into the stretch, but was empty. BASQUIAT raced
from well back in the three path and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BLESSED ARION chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch, improved
position between horses, drifted out slightly coming into close contact with STRIKE ME DOWN near the wire and just got the bob. STRIKE ME DOWN raced
off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, drifted in, bumping with REED KAN in
the process, continued to drift in, coming into tight quarters with BLESSED ARION and battled to the wire to just miss. PALIO raced off pace on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and gained ground steadily on the rail in the final furlong. REED KAN stalked the leaders on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn, was forced into tight quarters and bumped by STRIKE ME DOWN near the
eighth pole and chased on to the wire. TAPE TO TAPE hit the gate leaving it, recovered to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from
the two path around the turn and down the lane and gave way in the final strides. LOVE YOU MUCH trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, switched to the outside in upper stretch and passed tiring horses from there. EQUULEUS raced off the pace between horses, navigated the
turn from the three path and improved position mildly between horses in the lane. LONGSHADOW raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
came around the turn in the two path and made up some ground between horses while never truly threatening. TRUST OUR JOURNEY led the field on the
inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened late. CLINT MAROON (GB) tracked the leaders
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE
chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. AN OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE RIDER OF
HORSE FIVE, STRIKE ME DOWN, CITING INTERFERENCE FROM HORSE EIGHT, BLESSED ARION, NEAR THE WIRE. A SECOND OBJECTION
WAS FILED BY THE RIDER OF HORSE TEN, REED KAN, CITING INTERFERENCE BY HORSE FIVE, STRIKE ME DOWN, NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE.
UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGES TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
RONSTADT stalked off the rail, bid three wide into the stretch, and drew clear. POLSAR rated inside, saved ground while being coaxed rounding the far
turn, and ran on from the three path for place. CIVICS CLASS led rounding the first turn, was overtaken into the backstretch and pressed inside, was cued
inside in upper stretch, and held on to show. SMALL FIELD broke out and bumped Canyouhearmenow, raced in midpack from the three path, floated into
the seven path in upper stretch, and improved position. B G LEE was in midfield between foes, floated into the five path coming into the stretch, and finished
evenly. MAILMAN'S A FLYER chased from the three path, was ridden along while continuing to race in the three path coming into the stretch, but flattened.
CANYOUHEARMENOW was bumped at the start, moved up four wide in the first turn to set the pace, but yielded at the top of the stretch. ITS MR POPPI
TO U steadied into the first turn, was well back in the four path and no factor. SKY STYLISH hopped at the start, trailed and was no threat. DIVINAS
CONNECTION stalked four wide, was ridden in the six path coming into the stretch, but was empty.

OEUVRE was sent to an early lead between horses, showed the way under a hold while saving ground around the turn and drew off under a drive in the
lane. RICHIES GREAT GIRL pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and chased the winner to the wire,
just managing to hold second. STOP WAR stalked the leader on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn and chased the leader down the

entering the stretch, was forced out further near the eighth pole and gained ground mildly from there. TROBAIRITZ raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and was outkicked while finishing evenly. GERRI B trailed the field
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced four wide around the turn, angled in entering the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RED KNIGHT steadied after the start to avoid the fallen rider, rated from inside, bid four wide in upper stretch and forged clear late. ANOTHER MYSTERY
steadied before the turn to avoid the fallen rider, raced in midpack from the three path, was three wide into the stretch, and held on for place. SNAP
DECISION stalked from the rail, waited for room rounding the far turn, tipped into the five path passing the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on for show.
ROYNE chased from inside, saved ground rounding the far turn, floated into the three path in upper stretch, and improved position. BAKERS BAY stalked in
the two path, was ridden from the four path at the top of the lane, but flattened. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY raced in the three path, was shuffled back while
three wide around the far turn, tipped into the five path at the top of the lane, but was tired. ALWAYS ABOVE trailed off the rail, swung into the seven path
for the stretch, but was one paced. THE HAPPY GIANT steadied after the start, was well back in the three path and no threat. LA LUNE (GB) set the pace
inside but yielded coming into the stretch. CELLIST pressed from the three path, was hustled two wide into stretch but faded. NATHAN DETROIT clipped
heels shortly after the start and lost the rider. AN INQUIRY WAS HELD FOR THIS RACE TO LOOK AT NATHAN DETROIT LOSING THE RIDER AFTER
THE START BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO MISPLACEMENT OF THE STARTING GATE THE RACE WAS RUN AT AN ABOUT DISTANCE.
