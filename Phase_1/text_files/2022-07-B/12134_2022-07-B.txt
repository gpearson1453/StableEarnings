then passed rivals without menacing. VICTORY IS OURS moved to engage the winner before half a mile then stopped on the final turn. TEQUILA JR saved

KNOCK OUT KID held a pressured lead outside, shook loose into the lane and widened under steady coaxing. SIZZLING ROMA stalked the dueling
leaders three wide and finished gamely for the place. REITERATE forced the winner along the rail to the stretch and faltered. BOCA ROYALTY broke
slowest, chased inside, angled out in the lane with a mild rally. TERPEYE raced wide off the leaders then lacked a solid rally. ISABELLA SMILE trailed early
then passed fading rivals. ANGINETTI was urged just of the pace inside then began tiring on the turn. BELLA G saved ground and raced far behind
throughout. DIAL A LADY raced between rivals down the backstretch and stopped.

EIGHT DANZAS well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid to the front nearing the quarter pole and eagerly drew away under moderate urging. SWAN
POINT far behind early, advanced wide on the final turn but was no match for the winner. WILD DELIGHT led inside under pressure then faltered through
the stretch. GINGERS WISH trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival. POWWA OF LOVE prompted the pace outside for five furlongs and stopped

PHILADELPHIA BELLE pursued the loose pacesetter, edged away after the half and remained well clear under mild urging. JADES GELLY dropped back
early, advanced near the inside with late energy to gain the place. SENSE A MILLION lacked speed racing wide then continued willingly to the finish.
DISCO DEJA VU quickly moved clear inside, was collared midway on the turn and tired. CARTOUCHE raced inside behind the pacesetters and came up
empty in the stretch. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN lacked speed outside and was never in contention.
