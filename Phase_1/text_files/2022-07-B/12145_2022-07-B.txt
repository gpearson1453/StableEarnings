Footnotes
RACY JAYCEE saved ground while in the two path then spilt rivals in late backstretch to rally five wide on the far turn, gained command in late stretch and
held on well to the end. SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT pressed the leader while two wide, was in a hard drive entering the final furlongs, then menaced mid stretch
but could not catch the leader. CHIKARA stalked the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive on the backstretch then continued to race even
throughout the final furlongs. INCLUDING ELLIE chased the pace while five wide then bid on the far turn and was closing well in the stretch but it was not
enough. HOLY CREED chased the pace while four wide then made a mild bid in the stretch and was no threat. THREEWICKEDWISHES was unhurried
early then rallied while three wide on the far turn but came up evenly in the stretch. FROSTY FLIRT raced while six wide on the backstretch then rallied on
the far turn and was no factor. SENORITA COMETA broke slowly at the start then settled along the inside to bid five to six wide in upper stretch but was no
factor. RED HOT MOON chased the pace from the inside then dropped back heading into the far turn and failed to menace. BEBOP BABY set the pace on
the first turn into the back stretch then gave way at the top of the far turn and was no menace.
