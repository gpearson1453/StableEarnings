the lead on the inside and dug in gamely in the drive but gave way grudgingly late, second best. GOTTEMINABIND vied for the lead on the outside, then
was between rivals on the turn, angled out in the drive and faded, bested rest. MOONSHINE SURFER was off very slowly, made a inside middle move on
the inside on the backstretch to be in contention but weakened. CAIRO SKY chased the pace four wide and tired. ROYAL DE BE stalked the pace three
wide early and tired.
