Footnotes
BLESSED WITH LUCK was unhurried while near the inside, moved into the three path entering the far turn when gaining momentum, caught the leader
approaching the quarter pole, cleared outside the eighth pole and widened. MELTDOWN raced three wide through the first turn to gain the lead into the
backstretch, raced on a clear lead into the far turn, was joined by the winner in late turn, could not keep up through the lane and finished tired while still clear
for the place spot. EGOMANIAC settled off the pace to chase throughout and was never a threat while settling for the show spot. CARTE BLANCHE chased
the pacesetter down the backstretch, bid into the far turn while in the two path and was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole. FINAL CALL was outrun while
in the two or three path through the far turn. CHOCOLATE BUNNY pressed the early pace into the first turn then steadily faded.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED FOX chased the two rival duel into the turn, moved from the two to the three path entering the turn, bumping with another, continued in the
three path through the turn while moving closer, bid three wide into the lane, bumped with GINGADONTCHAKNOW when straightening in the lane then
continued on with good energy to be well clear late. WRAPPINJUSTICE raced in the two or three path through the turn to follow the winner into the lane,
dropped to the rail and stayed on well to just get up for the place spot at the wire. GINGADONTCHAKNOW set the pace through the turn while two wide,
shook off challenger into the lane, leaned out while entering the lane to bump with the winner then yielded to that one inside the eighth pole and lost the
place spot at the wire. LIZZSAIDNO was bumped and forced out a bit entering the turn, raced in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the
four path and lacked a closing response. INDY LITES vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane then weakened. EMPIRE
DANCER saved ground and lacked a bid. SAHARA PRINCESS was always last while in the two path and never menaced. AFTER A STEWARD'S
INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STRETCH RUN AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #6 LIZZSAIDNO AGAINST THE RIDER OF #5 UNBRIDLED
FOX CONCERNING THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE NO CHANGE OF ORDER WAS MADE.

Footnotes
HAZY COMMAND chased the pace from the three path through the turn, lost some ground straightening into the lane, began gaining momentum inside the
eighth pole then was steadily closing ground late to just get up from the five path. OFF WE GO set the pace while in the two path through the turn, widened
into the lane, had her largest lead with an eighth to go, appeared to be a winner nearing the sixteenth pole but could not hold the winner safe. RISATA
bobbled at the start, raced in the two path through the turn when never far back, continued in the two path into the lane, could not gain on the top two while
saving the place spot. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and missed the show spot
while not a threat. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL chased the pace along the inside into the lane and faded. AUCTION FEVER was always last while near the inside.

Footnotes
QUEEN CHARMAINE set the pace from the two path while under pressure from a pair of rivals, shook off one rival into the far turn, continued with a short
lead into the lane, cleared inside the eighth pole and held. NO MORE FAKE NEWS tracked the pace along the inside into the lane, cut the corner and bid
when straightening in the lane, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go then could not advance further while staying on for the place spot. ELUSIVE
JUSTICE pressed the pace while two wide through the far turn, came into the lane from the three path with aim on the leaders then could not gain inside the
eighth pole. DANCE MONEY was taken up and lost some five lengths on the first turn, raced off the rail into the far turn and lacked a closing bid. MORE
APPROVAL raced on the lead into the first turn, was getting out and checked in mid-turn, dropped back several lengths into the backstretch, hustled up to
contend for the lead into the far turn then tired. FLIRTY DANCER was taken up on the first turn when another rival impeded advancement, lost some six
lengths, raced in the three path through the far turn and tired. MISS FORT was near the rail through the far turn and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
ME AND CHILI chased the two rival duel throughout while moving into the three path through the turn, was asked for more entering the lane while in the
three or four path, caught the leaders outside the eighth pole, cleared and widened while gearing down late. BELLA'S PRAYER vied for the lead from the
outset while two wide, continued on near even terms into the lane, was edging past dueling challenger when passed by the winner, hold no offer for that one
but kept on well to be well clear for the show spot. WIRE THE CASH vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane then gave way but
lasted for the show spot. NATES HEARTTHROB brushed at the start, raced in the three path through the turns when in mid-pack, came into the lane from
the three path and lacked a closing kick. KNIGHT'S MOVE saved ground through the far turn and never was a factor. BONNE CHERE never a factor while
in the two path through the turn and entering the lane from the four path. WHAT NOW DARRELL chased the four path down the backstretch, entered the far
turn from the four to the three path and faded. CIELO BLU steadily faded while saving ground.
