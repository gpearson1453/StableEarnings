Footnotes
RUM RAISIN tracked the early speed, took command at the half mile to open up through the quarter and began tiring the last sixteenth just holding on for
the win. LA PRINCESSA POLLY sat behind the pace outside through the backstretch, commenced her rally while four wide on the turn and was wearing
down the winner the last eighth of a mile just missing the victory. KEYSTONE LAW was stalking between runners throughout, roused mid turn and showed
some good energy in the stretch winning the battle for show money. CLIFF'S HEAD circled runners five wide on the turn to contend turning for home and
levelled out in the late stages just losing third at the wire. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS broke a bit slow, settled near the rear between runners early and could
not offer a finishing kick through the stretch. TERRIFIC LADY had a sluggish start, sat behind the early pacesetters through the backstretch, was shuffled
back on the turn and never threatened down the lane. SHESALOOSECANNON showed speed early, was headed at the half mile pole and retreated
through the stretch while on the fence. FREE CARRYCOMB broke in at the start to trail and never got involved.

Footnotes
ICE FLOE stalked mid-pack along the outside, went four wide on the turn edging a bit closer late on that bend, struck the lead outside the furlong marker
and kicked clear then held safe while being kept to the task. MUMBLEBEE stalked two to three wide between rivals into the turn, angled five wide out of that
bend, ran on evenly to get into second then just held the place from a closing BETTABE SWIFT, who broke awkwardly tossing her head, settled at the rear,
went three then four wide on the turn swinging seven deep into upper stretch, was gaining but too late and missed second. CARLA'S HONOR raced off the
pace outside a rival, went two to three wide on the turn, came out near the furlong marker, won the battle for the minor award. I AM I SAID received some
early encouragement racing inside into the turn, came off the fence later on that bend then moved out further near mid-stretch, needed more. J M R
GEMMA stalked three wide, edged closer to the leader leaving the turn without much urging, took the lead briefly at the three-sixteenths but could not kick
on. TOUCH OF ROUGE broke a step slowly then moved forward inside heading up the backstretch to track the leaders, came up empty. TAPITURE WAY
broke outwardly and steadied then was rushed inside to set the pace in the clear, came off the fence leaving the turn and was overtaken, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
SHE'S A DREAM took command early, was well rated through the turn, repelled a brief challenge at the quarter pole and drew away the last eighth. HIT
AND RUN chased the speed through the turn, was between runners entering the stretch losing second and rallied back inside to regain the place award.
INTO TOURING was allowed to settle near the back, angled out turning for home in the five path to close belatedly getting up for third. CALLE OCHO
stalked just outside the pacesetters on the turn, entering the lane offered a brief challenge to the winner only to be repelled at the eighth pole and faded
losing the place and show placings the last sixteenth. ENDORPHIN RUSH was between and behind runners entering the stretch looking for a seam, took
the rail path mid stretch and was in a bit tight nearing the sixteenth pole and evened out in the late stages. IN MY OPINION trailed through the turn, was
angled out for a clear run at the quarter pole while in the six path and could not offer a strong finishing kick. GIZMO'S B F F took a tracking position on the
fence early, was ridden mid turn to keep up and retreated through the field in the stretch.

Footnotes
BUTTERED TOAST was forced in a bit after the break bumping with a rival then in turn being bumped by that one and steadied slightly, settled well back
inside, drifted out leaving the first turn then was guided back toward the rail, moved out while advancing on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch,
took aim and under steady handling drove past late. GREY SOCIETY settled mid-pack two to three wide, moved out while advancing on the far turn, came
six wide past the quarter pole, struck the lead about the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. TICKLE HER TOE brushed a rival lightly after the break, moved
forward and clear to set the pace inside on the first turn, was pressured up the backstretch and far turn, came off the fence a bit turning for home, turned
back that rival but was then overtaken by near the sixteenth pole and settled for show honors. BRIENNE OF TARTH came in after the break bothering
rivals, was forwardly-placed tracking inside, ran on evenly. GRACE ON THE GREEN broke outwardly, moved in two to three wide into the first turn racing
just off the leaders, pulled between foes up the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, came out just a bit in upper stretch and ran on. SONET'S NAME
was brushed lightly after the start, stalked two to three wide early, applied further pressure up the backstretch, weakened in the stretch. LITTLE FIRE settled
toward the rear two to three wide drifting out four to five deep coming out of the first turn, moved back nearer inside, continued well back two to three deep
on the far turn, moved out five wide in upper stretch and improved position. SWEET BOMBOLINI stalked three to four wide, came out and bumped a rival
near the furlong marker, weakened. READY CANDY broke a step slowly and steadied slightly at the start, angled in and steadied again to avoid inside
rivals, went three to five wide on the first turn, advanced outside five wide up the backstretch and far turn, was bumped and checked at the eighth pole and
not persevered with thereafter. TRILLING SONG was bumped into the rail after the start, raced inside and failed to menace. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT SHORTLY AFTER THE START AS WELL AS AN INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN ON THE
LATTER BUT WITH REGARD TO THE FORMER BRIENNE OF TARTH WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED TENTH BEHIND TRILLING
SONG FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
AMALFI SKY chased the early pace, took control entering the stretch and battled on the through the lane inching away the final sixteenth for the victory.
HELL N WILD assumed command after the break inside, was headed outside at the quarter pole by the winner and fought on throughout the stretch giving
away stubbornly late. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE stalked mid pack outside in the beginning, rallied turning for home while contesting for the third place award
on the outside just getting up for the nod at the wire. MILLENNIUM FORCE sat just behind the pacesetters inside on the turn, could not challenge the top
two finishers down the lane but battled gamely inside through the stretch giving away late to lose the show money. JILLI MARIE trailed early, looked for a
path to rally while behind runners through the lane but could not find room until nearing the sixteenth pole. ROMAN D'ORO saved ground throughout on the
fence and could no offer rally down the lane. AUBRIETA raced wide throughout the turn and was empty for the stretch run.

HAPPY VALENTINE stalked outside the second flight, began to advance four then five wide on the turn, engaged a rival in the stretch putting a head in
front, dueled with that one and edged away late. DOLCE SOPRESA stalked four wide, bid in upper stretch, dueled inside the winner but was only second
best. FEARLESS ANGEL went three then four wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch then moved back out in mid-stretch and ran on with late
interest. ZANA moved forward inside to duel for the lead, had no extra. FEDALINE dueled outside, lacked the needed late kick. TRICK AND TREAT chased
in behind in the two path, went evenly and made no bid. FLYSOFREEASHLEEB settled well back two to three wide, fanned six wide into the stretch and ran
on mildly. SHARP AZA RAINBOW shifted in racing well back two to three wide, came out about the eighth pole and ran on. DIOSA CATRINA moved out
four wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. LOKI'S LIGHTNING chased briefly inside and steadily retreated. CHROME'S ANGEL was
forwardly-placed three wide between rivals in the second flight, came up empty.

FOREST DRIFT took command early, was unchallenged through the turn and had enough left late to hold on at the wire. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) was
rated on the rail through the turn, waited inside for a clear path down the stretch and angled out at the eighth pole to just miss while running well late.
DANCE RHYTHMS trailed inside at the start, saved ground throughout and rallied up the fence to get up for third place. IMAGERY was allowed to settle
near the back, angled out to the seven path widest turning for home and closed belatedly to get a minor share. BILLYJANE was just outside mid pack
through the turn, tried to rally behind runners down the stretch but could not find enough to reach contention. GAMBLING CAT near the back early, angled
out to the six path for the drive and passed tiring foes. MARAIS stalked three wide outside on the turn, roused at the quarter pole but offered no finish for the
run through the lane. SPARKLE SAMMY hopped on the break, was between runners chasing the leader into the stretch, steadied briefly at the eighth pole
and faded. STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING #2 CARDIO PRINCESS AND #4 SPARKLE SAMMY AT THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN NO

COLLECTING FLATTER was reluctant to load, moved forward inside to set the pace, was clear three furlongs out, raced just off the fence turning for home
and put to a drive past the quarter pole, held a rival at bay under steady and solid urging. SPEEDY RIVER bobbled after the break, attended the pace from
outside the winner, put to urging moving out four wide leaving the turn, could make no headway but was second best. DAMASO was fractious behind the
gate and a bit hard to load, settled off the pace, went two wide on the turn, chased the leading pair home but was no match while clearly best of the rest.
STATE OF MIND chased inside, dropped back leaving the turn but kept on to pass a tiring rival. CAHIRA'S BLESSING stalked the leading pair three to four
wide, dropped back and came up empty in the stretch.

SWIRLING DANCER showed good speed on the outside, shook loose through the turn, was challenged on the outside at the eighth pole and determinedly
hung on at the wire. PLEASURE'S GOLD tracked nicely around the turn, rallied at the quarter pole to contest for the lead into the stretch but could not get
by the winner the last eighth of a mile. PEMBERLEY trailed at the start, circled runners six wide mid turn to loom boldly at the top of the stretch, could not
sustain her run to factor for the win but finished up well enough to be a clear third. MEET THE SOPRANO put in a mild run between runners mid turn and
show good interest late to get a minor share. FIRST ROUND PICK was mid pack on the rail to start, offered a brief run through the turn and stalled while
between runners running to the wire. VEERY hopped on the break, contested for the lead into the far turn, gave way at the three eighths pole and backed
away through the field in the stretch. DIXIE MORNING was ridden on the rail through the turn to keep up and offered little while inside down the lane. VERI
UNIFIED tracked just behind the pacesetters down the backstretch, quickly retreated through the the turn and was not persevered with through the stretch.

Footnotes
MILLIE GIRL switched off the inside early, moved out further from two to four wide on the turn racing in behind foes and closer turning for home, shifted in
once in upper stretch, put to strong and steady urging and got up late inside. DANCE WITH DESTINY stalked in behind racing two to three wide, moved out
four wide late on the turn commencing a bid, struck the lead by the quarter pole while drifting in a bit, was clear in mid-stretch but outkicked. LIVIN ON LUV
stalked from mid-pack, moved out from three to five wide late on the turn, was within striking distance in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. INDY
CHAMPAGNE shifted in tracking inside, came out in upper stretch at the three-sixteenths and ran on. LADY BREW raced off the pace two wide on the turn,
was in tight at the quarter pole then tipped out for room, ran on. MEDAGLIA MO attended the pace inside, steadily weakened. ASHWICKEN shifted in up
the backstretch tracking inside, moved out four wide coming past the half, floated seven wide into the stretch, came up empty and was not persevered with
late. MOET MONET broke a step slowly, trailed racing off the inside, was never near enough to threaten. FIRST FROST forced the pace three wide, faltered
and faded.
