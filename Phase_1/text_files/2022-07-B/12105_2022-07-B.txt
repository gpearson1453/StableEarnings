Footnotes
BALLOT INITIATIVE chased the pace from the three path down the backstretch, continued in the four to the three path through the turn when moving
closest to the leader, bid into the lane, quickly cleared when straightening then was kept to the task to the end. AVENDORE was in the two path through the
turns when never far back, came into the lane from the four path and slowly gained while being guided closer to the inside. ENCHANTING LUCILLE chased
the pace from along the inside into the lane and lacked a response. MRS. K hustled off to clear by several before the first call, continued with a clear lead
through the turns and gave way once headed into the lane.

Footnotes
TAPPINTOTHEBEAT pressed the pace into the turn while in the four to the three path, bid approaching the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the lane then
widened to the eighth pole and was kept to the task. SAVEDBESTFORLAST chased the pace through the turn while in the two to the three path, came into
the lane from the four path with momentum and chased the winner home while finishing well clear of the others. WICKED JUSTICE was in the two path
through the turn while unhurried, came into the lane from the five path and offered a mild gain. TAP N TWINE set the pace along the inside into mid-turn
then gave way entering the lane. KATIECAN'TKEEPUP close up early while in the two path, settled back to chase through the turn and into the lane and
lacked a bid. MUDDY BOOTS was off awkwardly, stepping to the inside, rushed up to contend before the first call then faded. SHES MY TREASURE never
a factor while in the three path through the turn.

Footnotes
ORO AZTECA vied for the early lead while in the three path, cleared into the turn, widened entering the lane, was shown the crop inside the eighth pole and
was geared down late. AZZARO STEEL raced nearest the rail through the turn and into the lane, stayed on well through the final eighth and was just up for
the place spot after dueling for that position late. GOOD SUGAR pressed the winner from the three path into the turn, chased that one into the lane, could
not threaten the top one through the final eighth and just lost the place spot at the wire. DANANG was near the inside through the turn, came into the lane
from the two or three path and offered a mild late gain. COMPLEX JUSTICE brushed and stumbled at the start, raced in the three or four path through the
turn and into the lane and lacked a bid. RAMPAGE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was a factor. G AS
IN GEORGE was always last while in the three or four path through the turn and into the five path into the lane.

CHOCTAW BINGO stalked the early pace in the three path, bid at the half-mile mark in the four path to challenge for the lead, was clear in the stretch and
held sway under steady handling. FIRESIDE KITTEN stalked the pace inside, settled at the three-quarters pole, bid in the four path on the far turn and
rallied late. GET N TIPSY dueled inside in the two path, then begrudgingly gave way in the stretch. BLOODY MARY MORNIN saved ground to no avail.
NATIVE LION was off slowly and hopped at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, then faded in the stretch. CANDY'S DREAM dueled outside of a rival
in the three path and then gave way nearing the stretch.
