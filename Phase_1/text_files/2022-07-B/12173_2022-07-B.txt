LOW DOSE sprinted clear to set the pace and held safely while ridden out. MIDNIGHT BABY settled off the pace, failed to rally and finished second best.
BELLE MY BELLE was checked after the start, never far off the pace, lacked a bid and earned show. TOP REFERENCES showed speed to the turn, fell
back and finished evenly. NAUGHTY NOT NICE broke slowly, raced inside, was steadied along the backstretch and showed little. DYNAMIC WOMAN was
not a factor. Hand timed.

Footnotes
FINAL FINAL was unhurried early, saved ground, rallied into the turn, dueled through the stretch, was in tight along the rail late and proved best in a long
drive. GO FOR A RIDE pressed the pace towards the outside, challenged into the turn, dueled through the stretch, came in late under right handed urging
and was outfinished in a good effort. WE'RE JUST SAYIN was reluctant to load, unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied on the turn, closed willingly
and was gaining fast late. n. PAYNTER'S BOY bumped at the start, vied inside to the turn, swung wide, continued to duel between horses to mid stretch,
faltered and lost position. NORTHERN QUEST broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, raced evenly and failed to menace. JEDI WARRIOR was not a
factor. OSTINI bumped at the start, vied between horses, stopped into the turn and was not urged thereafter. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning
the stretch drive. No change was made. Hand timed.

Footnotes
JANERO ROSE dueled inside to mid stretch and drew clear. DAZZLING MIST dueled two across to mid stretch, was unable to sustain her bid, fell back and
held for place. SPEEDY GIGI stumbled at the start, stalked the pace, lacked the needed late response and failed to gain. SPICY SOMMELIER was never
far back, lacked a bid and was outrun. QUEENS RANSOM broke awkwardly, raced inside and failed to rally. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM was not a factor.
BIG WAVE BETTY got away alertly, raced inside, showed speed to the turn and stopped. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE trailed the field. Hand timed.
