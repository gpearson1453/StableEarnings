GRAN MANNA stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command approaching the stretch and drew off with complete authority. WILEO
PROCEED raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but finished with good energy.
ALLERGIC TO LOGIC broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. EMOTIONAL INTEL was away in good
order to press the pace while racing three-wide and gradually gave way. ROYAL QUEEN settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished evenly in the drive. STORM N GOLD lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MAMIE'S WARRIOR showed brief speed
and weakened. JASMINE WHO was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
