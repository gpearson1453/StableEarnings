BE LIKE ME raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, turned
back a challenge by BEST ONE YET through the turn, and held that rival safely at bay late to prove best. BEST ONE YET broke sharply and tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, loomed a threat leaving the turn,
but was no match for the winner in the late stages, while proving clearly second best. BLING IT ON HOME settled at the back of a compact field while racing
one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to get up for a share.
SUNBURNT away alertly and tracked the pacesetter from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

BELLAROO stalked the leaders at the back of a compact field while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, commenced her bid while well
in hand from along the rail entering the final turn, tipped off the rail and quickly collared the pacesetter entering the lane, and drew clear late while drifting
five wide. TEXAS HUMOR tracked the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final
turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. LIVING SKY broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, shook off her pace rivals leaving the turn, but
was unable to fend off the closers in deep stretch. SKY FACTOR away well and pressed the pace three wide in the run down the backstretch, continued
three wide through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. ANAAMY away alertly and dueled for the lead from between rivals in the run down the

CERTIFIABLE broke sharply and vied for the lead from the inside of HEART OF TEXAS entering the first turn, continued to set a pressured pace from the
inside of that rival through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, sprinted clear of that foe to take control entering he final turn, and widened
her advantage through the final furlong while proving much the best. DONE THAT tracked the leaders through the first turn, before dropping well off the
pacesetters in the run to the second turn, continued with a four wide trip in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, before altering five wide
for the drive and finished willingly to get up for the place late. HEREVERYWISH away well, but was allowed to settle well off the early leaders while racing
one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, raced into a stalking trip entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, but needed
more late while finishing along the inside in the stretch drive. HEART OF TEXAS away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of CERTIFIABLE
entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering
the final turn, and weakened in the late stages. GIFTED GREY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make a
serious impact.

SLOOP JOHN B tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch,
advanced from along the rail midway to the final turn, to challenge for the lead entering the turn, took control midway through the turn, and held the closers
safely at bay late. MISS THE HYPE stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, held her position into the backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped off the rail in mid stretch and finished willingly to get up for the place. VALUE DANCER dropped back to
trail in the run to the first turn, improved slightly in the run through the stretch the first time, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and
finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. Y VEE R vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace
in the run down the backside, was collared from along the rail by SLOOP JOHN B entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival through
the turn, and faded in the late going. BARBERRY BANDIT away alertly and vied for the lead from the outside of Y VEE R entering the first turn, battled with
that foe into the second turn, before conceding the lead through the turn, began to drop back in the run down the backside, and had little to offer late.
HAPPYTOMAKEYOURDAY settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, drifted off the rail entering the

this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident entering the second turn. After review it was deemed that HAPPYTOMAKEYOURDAY caused

Footnotes
SILVER ARROW settled well off the early pace while saving ground along the inside through the stretch the first time, launched her bid three wide entering
the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive to prove best. CAROLINA GENT broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, eased into a tracking trip entering the second turn, re-engaged the pacesetter from along the rail entering the final turn and quickly assumed
command, but was unable to fend off the late move by SILVER ARROW while holding the place. JACK DON'T DRINK settled well off the early pace while
racing three wide entering the lane the first time, rallied four wide through the final turn, and found his best stride late to get up for a share. EASTERS
MEMORY settled well off the early pace while racing four wide into the stretch the first time, advanced from the outside soon after entering the backstretch
and loomed a danger through the final turn, but was unable to sustain his early bid in deep stretch. SOLANDER away well and tracked the leaders into the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more late when called upon. HARBOUR
STORM away alertly and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position in the run
to the final turn, raced two wide through the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. EH TEE EM settled well off the early pace while
racing two wide into the stretch the first time, trailed the field in the run down the backside, and failed to mount a late bid. DONEGAL BOY dueled for the
lead two wide entering the first turn, sprinted to a clear lead entering the second turn, was quickly overhauled entering the final turn, and stopped badly over
the final furlong.

ACCEPT NO OTHER vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, eased into a stalking trip for the run down the backside, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide from between rivals to be up in time. DON WITH THE WIND dueled for the lead two wide through the
first turn before sprinting to a clear lead entering the second turn, controlled the pace in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside through the final turn,
and just failed to last. TRAPALIS unhurried early while trailing the field into the stretch the first time, launched his bid four out from the rail entering the final
turn, and closed fastest of all five wide in the drive to just miss. BETTIN' MAN away alertly and tracked the leaders through the first turn while saving ground
at the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly from between rivals in the lane to just miss, but was crowded and clipped
heels and fell just past the wire. A TREE OF LIFE away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. NORTHERN KID stalked the
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but
needed more late when called upon. STAY ALL NIGHT broke sharply, but settled well off the early pacesetters while racing three wide entering the lane the
first time, was always well back, and failed to respond when called upon. BARNEY GOOGLE stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while
saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. TUXEDO lagged well off the early pace while racing
two wide entering the stretch the first time, was always well back and failed to make an impact. TUXEDO lost his rider shortly after the wire.

JUST JIMMY away well and vied for the lead from the inside of VALUABLE COWBOY entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of that
rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival leaving the turn, and held FLORIDA GATOR safely at bay late to
prevail. FLORIDA GATOR away alertly, but was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove second best. COUNTRY COWBOY
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to get up for a
share. VALUABLE COWBOY broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of JUST JIMMY in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with that foe leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. VANCOUVER'S
HUNTER settled mid pack behind the battling leaders entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon.

Footnotes
ARIKARA away alertly and dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, took control and
quickly opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while drifting four wide in deep stretch. OSTRACIZE
settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly from
along the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. WIDE AWAKE settled off the early pacesetters while racing three wide entering the backside, rallied
two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to garner a share. WANDALITA broke sharply, but stumbled mid way through
the first turn and briefly lost her action, settled well behind the leaders in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but needed
more late. NOTHINGBUTSUNSHINE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make a serious impact. TOBESUNNY
away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, was
unable to keep tabs on her pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
