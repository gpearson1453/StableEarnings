GOTIGER SPECIAL unhurried early, closed with a burst of speed in the four path through deep stretch and was along in time. FAST CALL sped to a
daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. HE'S A BELIEVER trailed into the turn then closed
some ground late while widest in the six path. SUNNY BEAST chased the pace and went evenly. EXONERATED PREZ well placed, failed to respond.

FARMHAND dueled for the early lead two wide, shook clear nearing the turn, drifted in a bit when asked with a right handed whip nearing the eight pole and
prevailed under strong handling. ACESKINGSANQUEENS unhurried, loomed boldly along the rail in upper stretch, lacked room nearing the furlong marker,
shifted out to the two path and finished with good courage to gain second. ANGEL'S SOUPERSTAR stalked the pace thee wide and finished determinedly.
BUILT LIKE TARZAN matched strides along the rail with the winner for a quarter, dropped back before the turn, shifted out, came on again three wide in
upper stretch then failed to sustain that bid. RIGOLETTO trailed.

WINE ME UP BABY away alertly, set all the pace and finished full of run to win going away. CAT'S RHYTHM chased the winner in the two path and held on
for second two wide. STAR MABEE had a mild late rally inside rivals. JETTIN PEGASUS never far back, moved closer four wide on the turn then failed to
sustain that bid. FORTUNATE GINA stalked the pace from the three path, suffered an injury midway on the turn, pulled up and was vanned off.
