CATCHYASOON Set the pace in hand while along the two path, opened up in the lane without asking and was under wraps through late stages to win
easily. BOURBON'S HOPE Tracked four wide early, three path on the turn and finished well. LITTERBOX Unhurried four wide, continued wide into the lane
and closed well. TRAPPE THE DREAM Lagged back four wide, three path on the turn and failed to threaten. REGALITY Broke awkwardly, gained inside on
the turn, lodged a bid inside and then weakened. HIT BY A WAVE Saved ground while in tight at the seven-sixteenths pole, checked, continued inside and
tired. NEVER EVER HOME Well placed five wide early, four wide into the turn and tired. AWESOME BID Tracked along the three path early and then was
done on the turn.
