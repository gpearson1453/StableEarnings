WORTHY OPPONENT prompted the early pace along the inside, made the lead nearing the turn then widened the balance of the trip under strong handling
to win as much the best. AFLEET O ME bore in at the start bumping rivals, settled close up, offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch and finished
clear for second. STORMIN SELLY chased the early pace in the seven path and faded in the stretch. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY failed to menace. DASH OF
FIRE was bumped then in tight at the start, trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals. NOSEY POWER had brief speed. ZAROSHA also bumped and
in tight at the start, was no factor. KID VAN was bumped and forced inward at the start, set the pace in the six path for five sixteenths of a mils then stopped.

CALI DREAM unhurried early, closed rapidly nearing the top of the stretch, split rivals near the three sixteenths pole, was bumped by her stablemate, made
the lead late three wide and drew clear. HIGH FIRE trailed into the stretch, shifted out to the seven path before the furlong marker then rallied determinedly
for second. MARKET SUCCESS with the second flight in the five path, loomed boldly three then four wide into the stretch and was outfinished. EDGE OF
NIGHT failed to menace. MOBIL LADY also with the second flight, surged quickly along the rail to make the lead at the top of the stretch then came up
empty. TOTALLY OBSESSED sprinted to the lead two wide midway on the clubhouse turn, sped well clear before a half, set the pace to the top of the
stretch, drifted out bumping her stablemate and was used up. CIRCUS RINGS set the pace into the clubhouse turn, chased the pace in the four path into
the far turn then stopped.

good courage. CANT BUY COOL set a pressured pace along the inside, drifted out under left handed urging entering the stretch to the nine path then
faded. NEVANS had speed into the turn then weakened. KETTLE KING was no threat. EL MEZCALITO had brief speed. GRAND STRATEGY offered a

Footnotes
SAMMY'S SMILE unhurried early, closed with a burst of speed under left handed urging in the six path through the stretch and got up in the final strides.
CRYPTO COPY chased the early pace along the inside, shifted three wide on the far turn, rallied to make the lead in deep stretch and just missed hanging
on. RUMBLE STRIP RON close up, surged along the rail through the far turn, made the lead before the quarter pole, set the pace until deep stretch then
was outfinished. HOPPY GILMORE failed to menace. WILDCAT EXPRESS away alertly, opened a daylight lead soon after the start, widened while getting
fast fractions before a half, maintained control for nearly six furlongs then was used up. MUCH TIMES TWO was void of early speed and passed tiring
rivals. KINGDOM DIAMOND bobbled at the start and was no threat. WEEKENDER settled mid pack and was through after a half. DEXQUIRE bobbled at
the start and was through early.
