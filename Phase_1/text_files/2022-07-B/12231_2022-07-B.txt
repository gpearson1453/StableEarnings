TARGET VISION chased the early pace on the inside, was coaxed along on the turn and eased out to make a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole and
shook clear leaving the turn, then was challenged by the sixteenth pole and dug in gamely to hold on. T J'S FIRST was reserved early on the inside,
advanced on the inside on the turn while being coaxed along, swung out four wide leaving the turn, made a bid to go on even terms for command by the
sixteenth pole but hung late while drifting out. PAT HAND GIRL was reserved three wide early, dropped to the inside on the far turn and advanced by the
quarter pole, angled off the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. VIOLET SHADOWS set a unchallenged pace on the inside and was
headed at the top of the lane and weakened. EL CALIENTE LADY chased the pace three wide and weakened. BODE'S CONNECTION was allowed to
settle early, made a middle move and was three wide by the quarter pole and came five wide into the drive and was empty.

Footnotes
PLATINUM QUEEN was well rated while three wide in hand, made a three wide move nearing the quarter pole and drew clear in the final furlong to prove
best, driving. DREAMIT vied for the lead on the inside dawdling along, shook off that rival on the turn and then was confronted by the winner and proved to
be no match for that rival, lost whip in the lane, second best. TOP TEN DUCHESS was settled on the inside, eased off the rail and was between rivals
leaving the turn and then finished willingly to be along for the show award. GIFTED TALENT was reserved on the inside, came five wide into the drive and
had a belated rally. AVERI EVER AFTER was rated along the inside and weakened. GOLDEN ARTIST vied for the lead outside a rival while three to two
wide, then weakened in the drive. LEUDEAL broke in the air, then made a three wide middle move and tired.

TIME was well placed on the inside, tipped out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid but was outfinished late. REPLETE stalked the pace and made a
four wide bid on the turn and drifted out through the lane and kept on one pace late. CATHOLIC GUILT pressed the early pace three wide and faded. FIRST
