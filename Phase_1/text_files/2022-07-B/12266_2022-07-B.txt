MISSION KEY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, chased on the turn, rallied inside rivals entering the stretch, took over and pulled away under
urging. BLACK LIMO vied inside for the lead, dueled with DO THE HONORS on the backside and far turn, drifted out wide at the quarter pole carrying out
that rival, then dug in through the lane and held second. DO THE HONORS was bumped at the start, vied outside for the lead, dueled into the far turn, was
carried out very wide by BLACK LIMO turning for home, then continued evenly through the stretch run. SWATH raced off the pace inside, chased on the far
turn and lacked a rally. DIAL HIM UP was outrun early and did not factor. CAVE MAN was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, went three
wide on the far turn and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry, BLACK LIMO was disqualified and placed third for interference at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
THE ZIP FACTOR tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied between rivals in upper stretch, then battled
heads apart with MAGIC WIZARD through the final sixteenth and prevailed determinedly. MAGIC WIZARD raced off the pace inside, made a three wide run
on the far turn, rallied outside rivals turning for home, dueled with THE ZIP FACTOR in the final furlong and dug in gamely outside to the finish. TAPPED
OFF raced off the pace inside, advanced on the far turn, angled out four wide entering the stretch and rallied outside. RUTHENIAN was off a bit slow, raced
off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail. MAYBE IT'S TIME set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far
turn, dueled inside rivals entering the stretch, dug in, then weakened. TWO STEP DANCE raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the rail, off the pace,
came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HENDERSON stalked the pacesetter, chased between rivals on the far turn and tired. DISTORTED TIMES
stalked two wide, chased three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and tired. KERANOS steadied at the start, raced off the pace and did not
factor. MERCURY TEN raced off the rail, off the pace and faded. MO WINE PLEASE was outrun. GORDO'S CHOICE raced off the rail, off the pace and
was outrun.

Footnotes
ILLUSTRIOUS , tracked the leaders around the first turn, in no hurry down the backstretch, dove past the pace setters nearing the three eighths pole, took
quick control, came home under an easy hand ride. RUNNER , reserved energy early on, running at a very comfortable gallop down the backside, asked for
best stuff around the turn, made up ground through the stretch, clearly second best. STALKING , showed good early pace along the inside, stayed inside
while just off the leader, put the pressure on the leader around the turn, could not keep pace with with run away winner to the outside, held on for the show
money. DEJOHN speed away from the gate, moved up around the first turn while three wide, took the lead into the far turn, came under pressure nearing
the quarter pole, could not stay with leaders weakened lane. RAMIRIN broke very awkward, stayed well off the pace down the backside, could not make any
headway , outrun.
