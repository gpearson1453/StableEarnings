Footnotes
ROYAL TAP broke alertly, gained command just prior to the quarter pole, hugged the rail around the bend and inched away in final furlong. LEDOUX WHAT
IT DO trekked three wide along the backstretch, rated within striking distance at upper stretch, but proved no match for winner in final sixteenth. JEANO
flashed early foot and led the field along the backstretch but was unable to fend off the top pair in final furlong. TIZ STRONG showed interest in early
command, dropped back to second flight entering the bend, and weakened in the closing strides. FAMILIAR DREAM trailed from outset and failed to
threaten.

DEDE'S TRICK was unhurried through opening half, advanced on pacesetter long backstretch, then circled three wide near the three sixteenths pole and
drew off in final furlong. BELLAS KITTY pressed the early pace from a two path pose, rated close up between foes at the quarter pole, and got the nod for
place over CAT TALE BREEZE , who led the field from outset through the half while saving ground, but failed to sustain the bid in closing stages.
SCORNED LOVER settled in behind early front runners and tracked three wide through the midway point, but tired in crucial stages of contest.

on pacesetter along the backstretch, rated close up at upper stretch s the inner rival of three, then was outfinished in final furlong. MORO CHARLIE rushed

PIPPA'S PROSPECT earned the score with a strong late kick after advancing three wide along the backstretch and rating two wide at upper stretch.
MANDONA loomed off the heels of pacesetter through the opening bend, gained command before the quarter pole, was on even terms as the inner rival at
upper stretch, then was outdueled in final sixteenth. DA COACH'S WIFE flashed early speed and led the field around the first turn but was unable to match
strides with top pair in closing stages. MOONSHINE PRINCESS passed a tiring rival after coming away tardy and trailing the field in early strides.
SQUEAKY BOOTS steadily faded after pressing the early pace from a three path stance.

TROY OUNCE gained command at first stride and led every step of the way while steadily widening the margin for a gate to wire victory. STACCATO
settled into mid pack and travelled the widest of all around the bends then rallied mildly and earned the place with late interest. MY CALL improved placing
along the inside after being unhurried in the early stages. POP CULTURE pressed the pace while trekking the two path through the opening half before
tiring in the closing portion of contest. WRITTEN PERMISSION broke alertly, rated in the second flight, trekked three wide at the midway point, then rapidly
retreated in closing strides. ALARM SYSTEM trailed throughout.

YOU SEXY BOY was unhurried along he backstretch, came under rousing inside the quarter pole, and rallied four wide in homestretch for the score.
WESTPORT rated in the second flight around the bend, swung to three wide at upper stretch, gained brief command mid stretch and was edged at wire by
rallying rival. SERENDIP RULER trekked the two path and rated close up around the bend, led between calls, but was outfinished in closing sixteenth.
ORNERY AS HELL broke alertly, rated up front through the turn, and was outkicked by top trio in closing strides. RUMBLING THUNDER settled into mid
pack and took a three path journey around the bend before lacking a needed rally in final furlong. HUNTER'S LEGACY came away slowly and showed late
interest. MUCHO BLING saved ground to no avail. MISS TYRO came up empty after trailing the field early and angling out at upper stretch. SELLING
SHORT steadily weakened and failed to menace.

MUNI MUNI SLEW loomed three wide through the first bend, led the field in unison at the quarter pole, was between rivals at upper stretch and shook clear
of rival in homestretch for the score. COVINGTON QUALITY stalked the early pace around the opening bend, saved ground around closing turn, rated close
up at head of lane, but was otfinished in final strides. LIMBO'S PROMISE held on to the show after settling into mid pack and trekking four wide through the
first turn, closing the gap on the leaders along the backstretch, and rating three wide at upper stretch. TIMELY REPLY closed with a rush to improve placing
after being unhurried and trailing the field through the midway point. REACH THE CIRCLE faded rapidly after flashing early foot and leading the field while
saving ground. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR lacked a late bid after showing reserve and saving ground early. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND failed to threaten from
a back rated stance.

TAG ME awaited options and settled into second flight around the first turn while trekking three wide, gained command in the final bend and shook off
challenging foe in final sixteenth for the score. GRUFFANDTOUGH showed reserve in the early stages before swinging wide at upper stretch and rallying
for the place. MAJOR GRIFFIN rushed from outset to lead the field in unison into the homestretch, but faded rapidly in closing strides. FLAT OUT
AVENGER was unhurried and chased the pacesetters through the midway point, then rated three wide at upper stretch and just missed the show with late
interest. I CAN'T TELL YA trailed the field and tucked to rail to save ground through the opening half before responding to urging and finishing with strong
strides to be gaining on leaders at finish. PARABELLUM travelled widest and lost ground to front runners. OUTCASHED flashed early speed and led the
field around the first turn before eclipsing in the crucial portion of contest.

TOMMYHAWK showed reserve and saved ground around the opening bend, came under rousing along the backstretch and rallied strongly to run down
leader in final furlong. FLY TO THE BANK hustled from outset and set the pace in concert as the outer rival of two abreast through the half, had a clear
advantage at upper stretch, but was unable to fend off the late rally of TOMMYHAWK in final strides. GRAND ROYALE settled into second flight and chased
the front runners from a three path stance, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch and finished willingly to procure the show. CRAZY LOVER

Footnotes
GOSPEL CARLOTTA was unhurried in the early stages before angling out to four wide at upper stretch and running down the leader in final sixteenth for
the victory. LEMONS IS GONE set the pace in early going from a two path stance, led the field at upper stretch, and was unable to ward off the late
charging rival. GUAPA CHICA loomed boldly in mid pack through the halfway point, angled out to three wide at upper stretch, locked into the multi rival
stretch duel, and was outfinished by top pair in closing strides. IZANAMI settled into second flight, trekked three wide early, tucked to save ground around
closing bend, then was outdueled in final furlong. LILLY BELLE travelled widest through both bends and lacked a serious bid. RUBY BE JUDGED rushed to
gain first command, saved ground, then steadily retreated inside the quarter pole. ROSE OF EKITA failed to threaten from a trailing position.
