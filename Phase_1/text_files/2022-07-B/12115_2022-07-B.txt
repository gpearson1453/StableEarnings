Footnotes
BEACH HOUSE dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and edged clear in the stretch.
EXPECT OURS dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, gave way with a furlong to go and chased the winner home. OIL ON CANVAS
raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path, switched outside in upper stretch and gained ground late. MOON
OF LOVE (IRE) stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and finished evenly between horses. MADAME
CLAUDE bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn
in the three path, swung wider into the stretch and finished evenly. PALMGIRL chased the leaders between horses in the early going, saved ground around
the turn, raced into traffic and steadied slightly in upper stretch and was empty from there. CHECK THE GRADE raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, began to improve position from the two path around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. PLATINUM FROLIC tracked the pace setters
on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the lane. RAISON D'ETAT
GIRL was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field the entire way around the oval and was not a factor.

impressively. HUMOR SENSE set the pace from inside, was coaxed while continuing to save ground inside rounding the turn, yielded in upper stretch to the
clear winner, but held on for place. WILMA MANKILLER chased while two wide, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but flattened late to show.
DANDELION stalked from the inside, saved ground while ridden along rounding the turn, but was tired. ACTION ROSE prompted the pace three wide, was
hustled along while floating into the five path coming into the stretch, but was empty. PHLOX was slow into stride and trailed throughout.

inside, bid between rivals coming into the stretch, opened up slightly passing the eighth pole, but was caught late to place. MINT GAME rated while two
wide, tipped out into the five path in upper stretch, and ran on to show. TOM HAGEN was keen early and pressed two wide, fanned three wide into the
stretch, but evened out late. SUPER E chased inside, was ridden from the two path rounding the far turn, but flattened. LA HARA (IRE) set the pace inside,
was roused from the two path at the top of the lane, but faded. I AM THAT I AM trailed into the stretch and never threatened. LEFTY COMMING raced from
well back inside and never factored.

MARGIE'S KITCHEN led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn and into the stretch and held
that margin to the wire. RENAISSANCE (IRE) tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and chased the
winner home, the best of the rest. OUR STRONG VOWS raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn, switched to the outside in
upper stretch and gained ground late to the wire. ISLAND PHILO trailed the field up the backstretch and around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch
and gained ground late on the outside to the wire. SILVERY RILL tracked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground
around the turn, raced in tight quarters and steadied near the quarter pole and finished evenly from there. STILL MY BABE stalked the pace setter on the
outside in the opening stages, raced in the three path around the turn and weakened between horses late. DIFFERENTBUTOK raced off the pace on the
outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and came up empty in the lane. SWEET ANNABELLA chased the leader between horses up
the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to tire from there. AN OBJECTION WAS FILED BY THE
RIDER OF HORSE FOUR, SILVERY RILL, CITING INTERFERENCE BY HORSE SIX, RENAISSANCE, NEAR THE QUARTER POLE. UPON REVIEW,
NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED. DUE TO

Footnotes
EAMONN trailed the field around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid approaching the eighth
pole and gained ground on the inside late to just get up in time. CANNON'S ROAR saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, dueled down the lane and was collared at the wire. BIZZEE CHANNEL tucked in to chase the
leader while saving ground through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn, dueled down the lane and was caught
late to just miss. ENTERTAINMENT led the while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn and
tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SANCTIFIED raced in midfield while two wide, was hustled between foes rounding the turn, tipped into the three path at the top of the stretch, and rallied.
BREAKWATER raced in midpack from inside, tipped into the six path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. CATCHTHISWINNER set the pace, was roused
from the two path into the stretch, but yielded late to show. DOM GERVASIO was well back and inside, swung into the six path in upper stretch, and
improved position. BUDDY BUDDY stalked while two wide, was roused inside at the top of the lane, but finished evenly. GUARANTEED SPECK was
hustled along in the four path, was ridden from the six path at the top of the lane, but evened out late. LONG STORY rated from the three path, shifted
inside in upper stretch, but was one paced. PHAROAH'S FURY tracked inside, saved ground around the turn, but flattened. CHARMING COUNCIL was
well back while two wide and no factor. HELL'S KITTEN pressed two wide, was ridden three wide into the stretch, but faded. ABENDEGO prompted the
pace from three wide but was empty into the stretch. LUCKY HERB trailed throughout.
