Footnotes
BREAKFAST RIDE set the pace under pressure from inside rival, put away that one at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought with the runner-up around the far
turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away. AMERICAREDWHITEBLU stalked the top pair from off the rail, challenged the winner around the far turn,
could not kick on with BREAKFAST RIDE in upper stretch and kept on to secure second. CONUNDRUM tracked three to four wide around the first turn,
remained off the rail to the stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. CLUB CAL settled along the inside early, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch,
traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally. RIMPROTECTOR was off slow from inside, trailed three wide into the drive and passed tired
rivals. PAPALE broke slow, climbed along nearing the first turn, raced outside a rival near mid-pack in the middle stages, coaxed along through the far turn
and failed to menace. ECONOMICAL coaxed from the gate and pressed the winner from inside, lost contact with that rival near the seven-sixteenths pole,
dropped back on the far turn and tired. R DOC raced off the rail outside rivals into the first turn, traveled three deep at the three-eighths pole, gained
positions on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
FAST BUCK vied for command from inside, held a short lead through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and won the bob over the runner-up to prevail.
GREGORY'S PRIDE sat off the pace inside rivals, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane, launched a late bid and lost the bob at the wire.
PARTY GAME (IRE) showed early speed between rivals then chased the top trio leaving the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and gained the
show. CLAYTON DELANEY chased between foes early, tipped out on the turn then angled back down to the two path, finished willingly through the lane
and earned a minor award. MAC DADDY TOO pressed the pace three deep then vied between rivals around the bend, lost contact with the winner in upper
stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth. I'LL STAND TALLER raced five deep off the pace early, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, steered to the
inside around the turn and improved positions in the stretch. ELUSIVE TREAT (GB) was off a bit slow to begin, got boxed in on the turn then steadied near
the quarter pole, moved out in the stretch and failed to rally. RAGING WATERS came away last, trailed early on, steadied behind rivals on the turn, swung
out and improved position in the stretch. FINALLY HERE was forwardly placed five deep early on, chased five wide into the stretch and lacked further
response. TIME TO PARTY was up close early outside a trio of rivals, vied three deep around the bend and weakened down the lane. DETROIT CITY
chased six deep early, remained wide into the stretch and could not rally. CEES GET DEGREES tossed his head and came away a bit slow, checked
between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole, got put in a bit tight past the quarter pole and failed to menace.

SINGLE ME OUT. SINGLE ME OUT chased along the inside then two wide into the stretch, tipped out in the drive, rallied outside the winner and missed.
BIG FLAME was off slow to begin, went two wide into the turn, angled out and entered the stretch five wide, closed well and was gaining on the top pair to
the wire. FUNKENSTEIN broke cleanly then dropped back, saved ground while trailing into the stretch, then came with a belated rally and rounded out the
superfecta. PYEONG CHANG broke well and pressed the pace three deep then outside the leader, fought with PRIANO around the bend, could not kick on
nearing the furlong grounds and weakened late. K P D DAY broke a step slow and dropped back early, went four wide into the turn, exited six wide and
failed to menace. BIG SCOTT DADDY had early speed between rivals, got put in tight and was shuffled past nine-sixteenths pole, chased two then three
wide on the turn and weakened. STRUT TO THE WIRE raced in mid-pack early, navigated the turn three then four wide and faded.

got run down by the winner late. CHEDDA CASH got bumped from outside at the start, tracked four wide into the turn, angled down to the inside around the
bend and rallied to get up for third. SMOKIN CHEENA dueled for command from outside, failed to keep up with DANZING CAT at the top of the stretch and
got edged for the show honors. ONE SMOKIN' RITA came away awkwardly and a bit slow to begin, stalked the top pair three wide to the stretch and lacked
a bid in the drive. THE REIGN SONG chased the dueling pair outside a rival well off the rail, rounded the turn five then four wide and failed to respond when
called upon. ROSIE ANN RULES broke a step slow, coaxed from off the pace early on, traveled along the inside then tipped to the two path and failed to

BELLAMORE raced near the inside on the clubhouse turn then moved out, went between rivals and bumped with FREEDOM LASS at the five-sixteenths
pole, went four deep into the stretch, rallied outside the runner-up and drove past to prove best in the end. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked outside a rival,
bid three deep at the three-eighths pole, took over with a quarter mile left to run, cleared in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner late. MACADAMIA
(BRZ) stalked the pace from inside, coaxed into the far turn and went between rivals, steered back to the inside at the top of the stretch, rallied along the
fence and gained the show. CHARGES DROPPED settled in the two path early, raced between foes on the backstretch, crept closer nearing the far turn,
came three wide into the drive but could not summon the needed late kick in deep stretch. FREEDOM LASS exited the chute three wide, raced outside
rivals outside the backstretch, bumped with the winner at the five-sixteenths pole, chased five deep late on the turn and needed to find more in the furlong
grounds. CALIFORNIA KOOK was off slow from inside, reserved in the early going, coaxed two wide then angled out into the stretch and failed to make an
impact. FREEDOM FLYER stalked the leader from outside, challenged with three furlong remaining, took over at the five-sixteenths pole then lost command
at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. TOURNESOL settled off the pace and moved to the inside, got floated out by CALIFORNIA KOOK leaving
the far turn and failed to menace. FLYING TO THE LINE sped clear and steered to the inside, received a challenge from a pair of rivals at the three-eighths
pole, lost command and the five-sixteenths, chased the leaders past the quarter pole, had his path taken and checked hard at the top of the stretch and was
not persevered with after. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH MACADAMIA
(BRZ) CAME IN AND TOOK THE PATH OF FLYING TO THE LINE, IT DID NOT ALTER THE OUTCOME OF THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH AND
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
ANACAPA vied for the lead inside rivals early, cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, got pressured by KEYCHAIN GIRL to the outside in the drive and held
that foe at bay. KEYCHAIN GIRL vied four deep up the backstretch, chased the leader around the bend and took aim three wide into the stretch, bid from
outside but lacked the needed late kick to get by. BELLE CHERIE was off a bit slow to begin, angled down to the inside chasing behind the leader, saved
ground through the turn, could not summon a rally in the stretch but stayed on to hold the show. INFINITE EMPIRE was off slow to begin, chased along the
inside then got put in tight and was shuffled back at the half-mile pole, traveled two wide into the stretch and kept on to earn a minor award. TOO BOSSY
stumbled badly leaving the gate, advanced four to five wide on the turn but flattened out inside the furlong grounds. SNIP hopped slightly and took up
behind rival at the start, lacked room on the turn, angled out and raced five wide into the stretch and finished with a mild rally. ASCENDANCY dropped back
early, raced outside a rival, came three to four wide into the stretch and improved position. ABOVE SUSPICION broke a step slow then became rank briefly
soon after, raced at the back on the inside and never got involved. WAITING ON WENDY bobbled at the start, went up to vie three deep, chased the leader
three deep into the turn, lost ground three wide on the turn and faded. WEEMISSGRAMMY vied between rivals early, dropped back on the turn and tired.

Footnotes

Footnotes
KID CORLEONE pressed the pace from outside, took over at the three-eighths pole, cleared rivals from both sides with a quarter mile left to run and drew
off in the furlong grounds. MURRAY raced in range off the inside, chased four wide into the lane, could not threaten the winner in deep stretch but bested
the rest. EXAULTED was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried early on, advanced five wide on the turn and rallied for the show. GOOD VIBES ONLY stalked
outside the top pair, took aim three wide into the stretch but flattened in the late stages. PATRON D'ORO became fractious in the gate, was off a bit slow to
begin, moved into a stalking position, coaxed two wide into the lane and lacked a late bid. COSMO raced in mid-pack off the inside and failed to respond
when called upon. HOUNDSTOOTH broke a bit slow, traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail into the drive and proved no menace. CLEM LABINE
steadied inside a rival early, traveled near the inside then angled out leaving the turn and failed to make an impact. EL DIABLO ROJO raced three deep at
the back early on, traveled outside a rival on the turn and could not rally. INDULGE raced four then three deep at the back, got floated out leaving the turn
and was never a factor. CODE DUELLO bobbled leaving the gate then recovered and was sent for the lead, set the pace under pressure up the
backstretch, lost command at the three-eighths pole, could not keep up with the leader nearing the quarter pole and tired down the stretch. RECALL AND
RELOAD was off slow to start, raced between foes at the back, entered the lane two wide and had little left for the drive.
