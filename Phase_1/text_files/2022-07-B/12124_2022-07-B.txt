up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and flattened out. LIMONATA set the pace on the inside and faded the final

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN PARK well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off inside
the furlong marker. OVER IT rated inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled out and was carried out four and five wide into the stretch,
then made a steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. GOLDEN OAK unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then closed well late and got up for the show. LEGIO allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. WHOOPS ran evenly, inside. KOOSMAN well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then drifted in and
faded into the stretch. WILD ENOUGH hopped at the start, sprinted to a clear lead, then faded in the stretch. PER RULING #22093PI FROM THE

Footnotes
BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. BOOMIN
GOOSE fractious in the gate, dwelt at the start, moved up inside through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the place.
LAUDERDALE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and edged up for the show. RED CAT (CHI)
rated back in the early going, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. SHAKEDOWN mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch and flattened out. COOPER'S
CRESCENT stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and
faded. FAST FIRE was no factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO CHANGE
