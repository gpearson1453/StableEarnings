Footnotes
RICKI TORNADO good position to far turn, bold three wide run dug in gamely to prevail under stout handling. THEJIGISUP just off leaders, chased to duel
stretch with a late lead but run down on the wire. VAMOS ANTONIO tracked outside, pushed on hard into the stretch, led late but outgamed to the wire.
KEEN ON YOU no speed to far turn and only improved position while widest into the stretch, no real threat. PASSIONATE LUCK saved ground throughout
to no avail. MIDNIGHT ALIBI sprinted to the front, led to far turn but gave way readily. MS. LINA tried to keep up, gave way from the half and dropped back
readily.

BLUE BONZAI unhurried early, moved up outside, battled hard to prevail late. MONKEY ZONE saved ground to half, split horses going into the far turn then
again past the quarter pole, rallied into the stretch run once again splitting horses late but just missed in a gallant effort. SARGEANT BARGER rushed
outside first turn, dueled at the half, clear past quarter pole but weakened in the final furlong. MY HOT TODDY not sharp at the break and only improved
position while no real threat. SCAT SHACK speed from inside, dueled to the half, gave way in the stretch. INHERENT POWERS wide run to far turn, could
not keep up and faltered back. ZERO TO ONEHUNDRED in tight first turn, never a real menace throughout. CONGRATS FOR GLORY through early,
stopped. TRADEOFF raced rank around first turn and never a factor throughout.

Footnotes
MY BEST SIDE chased leader to the turn, took over in the stretch, drew off to dominate late. LOVE YOU GOODBYE sprinted clear to the front, overtaken in
stretch, bested rest. LADY POWER no speed from the gate, rallied from quarter pole for show spot. SCOOBY ROO chased top pair to the stretch,
weakened in the final furlong. LA LA ANGEL failed to menace. MILWAUKEE CAT through early, dropped back. WACKER'S GIRL never factored
throughout. APPEALING SENORITA broke slow, always outrun.
