Footnotes
FABS was quick to begin to set the early pace while racing in hand down the backstretch, built a long lead while never being asked and was an easy winner.
ARIANA VALENTINA was coaxed along early to chase Fabs early on, raced off the inside in the stretch and was no match for the winner.
LIFESAWINDINGROAD broke awkwardly, then veered to the outside at the start, angled in down the backstretch, raced near the inside at the quarter pole
and was no threat for the top pair to race along for third. BIG EYE JOY stalked the and weakened while racing towards the outside. WINDY REIGN broke
awkwardly, rushed from the inside to lay up close early and was done early.

handling. REFUND RIGLER showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. FRONT DANCER chased the the

the far turn, was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. MASTERFUL ONE was off slowly, raced along the inside around the far turn
through the stretch and had no rally. LUCKY FOR SHORE was hustled from the outside to lay up close, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch
and weakened. SUMMUM NOOR dropped back early, raced five to six wide into the lane and had no late rally. SKATING DATE raced off the early pace,
was three deep near the quarter pole, angled five wide and never threatened. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and

early on, raced two wide in the drive and kept willingly to the wire. AWARD NOMINATED was off slowly, raced four to five wide and moved up late. CAUSE
A STIR was unhurried early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough. RECYCLE stalked the pace from the outside, raced

Footnotes
FIRSTCADETE stalked the pace from the outside, took command past the three eighths pole and held gamely in the drive to remain clear under strong
handling. WALL settled to the back of the pack early on, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. PAY THE KID
was unhurried early on, made a good outside bid in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. ONLYAMATTEROFTIME tracked the early pace and
weakened while racing near the inside in the drive. MY FRIEND LINUS settled towards the back of the pack early on, checked sharply near the three
eighths pole, continued to race from the inside and had no late rally. CHARLIE THE GREEK stalked the pace, raced in tight near the three eighths pole,
swung five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. TOM TERRIFIC showed good early foot to set the early pace and gae way.
