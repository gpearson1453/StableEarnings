Footnotes
REMAIN ANONYMOUS came inward at the start then was hustled, set the pace on the inside while under pressure from her outside, shook clear along the
rail on the turn, extended the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into the stretch, responded well when shaken up around the
three-sixteenths, drew off while kept to the task under a brisk hand-ride into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement while much the
best. INVALUABLE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, chased three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch under a
drive and secured the place while no match for the winner. MELTING SNOW made light contact with a foe at the start, was urged along towards the back,
moved in outside the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out while passing foes in the
vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and just got up for the show. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE was well placed just off the pace, came under urging along the rail on
the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and tired then was denied the show while under less
encouragement then the foe that caught her for that position. BUSTIN BAY bumped hard with a rival at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch,
dropped back in the four path around the turn and capitulated. CADEAU DE PAIX was fractious in the gate, dropped back after the start then settled on the
outside, angled in outside the half-mile pole, saved ground around the turn and was no factor. GRUDGE bumped hard with an opponent at the start, was
urged along on the outside, dropped back with a half-mile to run, went three wide on the turn and faltered.

WHISTLER'S HONOR settled just off the inside through the first turn before racing in pursuit three then four wide from mid pack, came under coaxing near
the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a pair a furlong out, had the rider pause and apply a stiff right rein when lugging in a
sixteenth out just when seizing command, then prevailed going away at the end under his own power. YOUR MISSION two to three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and closed well to just get up for the place honors over a pair on the wire. MR.
CONNECTICUT bumped at the start by BIONDI who broke outwards a step, chased three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command through to the sixteenth pole, then fought on to just
preserve the show honors on the line. BIONDI dueled in hand along the inside of RUSH TO HONOR, came under light coaxing through the far turn and
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat from a trio and was collared at the sixteenth marker, then got out-finished in the
late stages. BERNARDINO broke in a step at the start bumping URAGANO against pressure inside from BIONDI, raced just off the inside in aim of the top
pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths tucked along the rail, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late going.
URAGANO a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got bumped between foes at the start, settled unhurried three then two wide near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and made no headway. RUSH TO HONOR shied in a step at the start
following the inwards progress of BERNARDINO, raced forwardly placed three wide into and through the first turn knocking heads while in hand through that
bend and down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. KINGDOM ON PAWS grew a bit rank under the restraint of the rider past the stands and into the first turn, chased along the inside

JUST LIKE THIS was forced in at the start then bumped with a foe, recovered to press the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn,
gained the lead just inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear at the quarter-pole, drifted in while extending the advantage into upper stretch, was given one pop
of a down-turned crop outside the furlong marker, widened while kept to the task under a solid-hand ride to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while
much the best. OFFUTT COLE went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead just inside the
five-sixteenths, moved out while losing touch with the winner in upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead under a right-handed crop just inside the
furlong marker, went back to the proper lead under a left-handed crop around the sixteenth-pole and safely secured the place. INSPIRED MISCHIEF was
jostled in the hindquarters at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and tired while able to hold the show.
PAPI ON ICE was bumped at the start and forced into the hindquarters of another rival then pinched back, trailed under urging, saved ground around the
turn and failed to threaten. SUPPRESSOR broke in at the start, chased the pace on the outside then four wide around the turn and faltered. MARCO POLO
was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and had nothing left. CRYPTO CAUSEWAY hit the inside of the gate hard and was off a half-step
slow, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path around the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
JUULSTONE forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn, attended the leader to the outside under a rating hold until given some rein to work
with nearing the five-sixteenths, advanced on the leader to take over when set down spinning three wide at the quarter pole, then edged clear under a drive
kept to task. GOOCH GO BRAGH chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to
secure the place honors. AL'S PRINCE broke out a step at the start under coaxing and bumped AMEDEUS MUSIC, chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and ran on to the finish to procure the show honors. BORN A GAMBLER tracked two to three
wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and flattened out in the final furlong. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB)
saved ground near the rear of the field patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, then passed tired rivals in the drive. LORD
OF WAR coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and had no kick. BAIL OUT got
bumped at the start by SEIZING THE DREAM, who broke out a step, then got pinched out after the break due to pressure from both side and altered in to
settle along the inside just off the pace, remained along the rail coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and tipped three wide into upper stretch, then
offered no response. TONAL IMPACT just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. SEIZING THE DREAM broke out a step at the start bumping BAIL OUT, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs
out, angled three to four wide or home and offered no rally. AMEDEUS MUSIC broke awkwardly at the start then got bumped by AL'S PRINCE, who broke
outwards, chased two to three wide before tipping four wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and made
no impact. THE MAN TO SEE chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went five wide at the head of the stretch, tired. BALI'S SHADE
coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way rated along the inside under the watchful eyes of JUULSTONE but facing little pressure
from that rival until three furlongs remained, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat to the outside, yielded the front along the inside at the
quarter pole, then tired in the stretch.

DANZIGWITHTHESTARS brushed with a rival at the start then came under coaxing, was taken up while in tight between horses early, saved ground around
the opening bend, was reserved under stout restraint towards the rear, went two then three wide on the final turn, was roused late on that bend, rallied six
wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. BARRAGE went three wide on the first turn,
was reserved off the pace, traveled three wide around the final turn, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, came five wide into the stretch, rallied to make a
bid into the final furlong but missed while just able to get the place. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR bumped lightly with a foe at the start, moved in towards the
rear, rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved towards the back, went three wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, came
five wide into the stretch then moved further out, gained outside into the final sixteenth, came in under a right-handed crop and bumped with STRAW INTO
GOLD late and just missed the place while up for the show. GHOST GIANT settled on the inside, came under urging late on the backstretch, saved ground
through the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, steadied while lacking room behind the leader as that foe moved to the two path at the same time outside
the furlong marker, continued to steady some then found room between horses when COTTON was pulled in to give relief just inside the furlong marker,
made a bid between rivals outside the sixteenth-pole and just missed the trifecta. STRAW INTO GOLD brushed with a rival leaving the gate, was taken in
hand early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved against the rail down the backstretch, came under coaxing on the final turn, moved to
the two path into the stretch, angled out at the three-sixteenths then moved further out around the furlong marker, gained on the inside of GRAPE NUTS
WARRIOR into the final sixteenth, was jostled by that foe late and just missed the superfecta. RUSE established a forward position early, went around the
first turn in the four path, tracked on the outside, was given his cue in the four path on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper
stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was collared and weakened. SARATOGA FLASH went three then two wide on the first turn, settled in
fourth position, was asked while inside to the two path on the far turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. QUIET OUT EAST
bumped lightly with a foe at the start then was corrected with a tug of the right rein, moved in towards the rear, saved ground around the first turn, was
reserved at the back, rounded the far turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch then was asked near the three-sixteenths, lacked room behind
traffic in the final furlong and lost his best chance at the minor awards. COTTON showed good early speed, set a quick pace on the inside under pressure,
was asked on the far turn, lost the lead while coming off the rail in upper stretch, was pulled back in to give room to GHOST GIANT just inside the furlong
marker and gave way. REGAL SPEAKER went three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused two to three wide around the far turn,
checked off heels turning into the stretch and had nothing left. BAR FOURTEEN was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside in the three
path, was asked on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was taken up while getting swallowed up in the vicinity of the furlong marker and
tired.

tipping four wide just past the three-eighths and commencing and advance on the top pair to sweep to the front four wide at the quarter pole, swung six wide
straightened away into upper stretch, came under a right handed crop and shied in nearing the eighth pole when going clear and was geared down in the
late stages to prevail comfortably at the end. I AM THE CASH MAN coaxed from the start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors, safe from the rest.
FOREVER WICKED chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the wire.
CORKMAN broke in at the start brushing the near side stall, chased along the inside coming under coaxing tipped to the two path at the seven-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside for home and improved position by tired rivals. WILL E SUTTON hustled from the gate, chased four wide from just off the pace,
advanced in tandem with AMERICAN PURE and tucked three then two wide between foes taking over the front with three-eighths to run, knocked heads
with AMERICAN PURE and was overhauled when taking the inside route into upper stretch by the eventual winner, then tired to the finish. AMERICAN
PURE stumbled at the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn before tipping five paths off the inside down the backstretch to advance into
contention nearing the half mile pole, tucked four then three wide bidding into the turn for command and knocking heads with the aforementioned rival when
overtaking DONTBELATE as a pair at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch displaced as a pair and tired. ROMAN EMPIRE coaxed from
the start, chased three wide, tipped four then five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths through the far turn, went six to seven wide into upper
stretch and faltered. DONTBELATE three then two wide through the first turn forwardly placed, raced just off the inside in aim of the leader, drifted out five
furlongs out to the three path and was corrected, took over command half a mile from home and tucked to the inside already under threat, yielded with three
furlongs to go, angled four to five wide for home and folded. JADE'S DREAM showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside, came under pressure five
furlongs out and yielded the front half a mile from home, got coaxed along the rail through the far turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, gave way
to the finish.

restraint while crowded inside the five-eighths, steadied off heels near the nine-sixteenths, was hard held passing the half-mile pole, went around the turn in
the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, steadied while lacking room from that point to outside the furlong marker, altered to the outside into the final

four wide around the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong, came in at the sixteenth-pole and bumped with a rival then missed the show. ARTOS

Footnotes
CITY MAN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from mid pack, got set down angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied among a host of rivals to
take command a sixteenth out, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. ATONE coaxed from the start, tracked three wide from just off the pace patiently
handled until let out spinning five wide for home, dug in under a drive heads apart for command to the sixteenth marker and was along willingly to just
procure the place honors over a rival on the line. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was slightly tipped out late to give SET PIECE some clearance from running into the rear of
ATONE and just missed for the place honors on the wire by a bob of the nose. GET SMOKIN coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide forwardly
placed through the opening bend before advancing on the leader to take narrow and brief command five furlongs from home, got headed once more near
the half mile pole, applied pressure to the leader through the turn three wide, swung four to five wide for home, took back command a furlong out among a
host of foes and was collared a sixteenth to the finish, then got out-finished in the late going. SET PIECE (GB) saved ground at the tail of the field, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three then two wide into upper stretch, tipped out three then four wide looking for a seam and was in behind foes
coaxed along until gaining clearance a sixteenth out, improved position nearly getting off the heels of ATONE but was given space late by PUBLIC SECTOR
in the shadow of the wire. MIRA MISSION just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST coaxed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside,
got set down spinning three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. SANCTUARY CITY chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SCUTTLEBUZZ four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing in the two
path at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide for home and had no rally. CLEAR VISION just off the inside in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. YES AND YES bobbled awkwardly at the break, showed the way rated under a firm hold
early and was headed for the front by GET SMOKIN five furlongs out, came under coaxing to retake command and showed the way under intensifying
pressure through to the quarter pole when let out spinning just off the inside, yielded the front straightened away and tired.

Footnotes
KHALI MAGIC was urged along off the pace, moved out outside the nine-sixteenths, chased four wide around the turn, made a bid while five wide into upper
stretch, gained the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under good handling. MOSIENKO bumped with a rival at the start, went clear early,
showed the way in the two path through the turn, was set down in the three path into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong
marker and proved no match while just able to hold the place. WAILIN JOSIE stumbled at the start, was coaxed along at the rear, passed the half-mile pole
under a tight hold, was roused three wide on the turn and improved position to get the show. THINKING IT OVER was bumped on both sides at the start,
tracked outside down the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, dropped to the rail under a drive at the quarter-pole and tired. OK HONEY bumped
with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. VALLARAND was urged along between
foes, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path and also came up empty. ROSSA VELOCE was well placed just off the
pace, dropped back while saving ground around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and capitulated. PRETTY CLEVER was hustled from the
start then urged along at the back, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. SHESAWILDJOKER charged the front of the gate just prior to the start,
hit the gate and broke open the stall doors ever so slightly before the rest began to open, had the stall doors completely open about the same time as the
rest, lunged and was taken up while slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and had nothing
left.
