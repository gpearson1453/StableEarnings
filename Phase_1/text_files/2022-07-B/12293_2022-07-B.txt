CODETOWIN raced in range then given cue three to four wide late on the turn, took over the lead a furlong out and edged away under firm handling. DATA
STORM tugged a bit racing up close along the inside into the turn, sat patiently awaiting a clear path at the head of the lane, tipped three wide and captured
place. HERITAGE PARK raced up close then moved up to challenge SAMS TUNE for the lead at the quarter pole, vied for the lead then got overtaken by
the winner a furlong out and got edged for place. SAMS TIME set the early pace, came under attack from HERITAGE PARK at the quarter pole, vied into
the lane then weakened in the final furlong. RIDE RICHIE RIDE raced off the pace, urged three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. AMERICAIN JOEY
raced in the back, chased four wide around the turn and failed to threaten.

DIXIEMAGIC sped to the lead at the start and dictated terms by a comfortable margin around the turn, came two to three wide into the upper stretch and
pulled away from the filed racing in hand. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY chased along the rail around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and ran on for
second best. MAMBO GIRL was off slow at the start and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then angled three wide and prevailed for a share.
JILL'S LEMON DROP was forwardly placed soon after the start, chased after the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive. RUDIANO hustled
up out of the gate, chased the leaders around the turn and offered no late bid.

LAKE RADIO broke in and came away slowly at the start, quickly hustled up into contention, dueled inside of CHICAGO CHROME around the turn then
shook free, came under right handed pressure at the head of the lane, responded gamely, turned back the bid from BOLD COWBOY and held firm. BOLD
COWBOY tracked the top pair two to three wide around the turn, hustled up two to three wide into the lane and cleared second best. ROCKET HOTSHOT
lacked speed and raced in the back, came five wide into the lane and gathered a share. CANONIZE saved ground around the turn, briefly gained position
along the rail past the furlong marker then flattened out. CHICAGO CHROME dueled outside of the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive.
ROAD BIBLE raced in range three to four wide around the turn then faded in the lane. BALI STAR was not too far back midway around the turn then
retreated turning for home.

Footnotes
ALEX'S STRIKE was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced in the back, picked up the tempo near the inside mid-way around the turn, shifted four to
five wide into the lane, rallied determinedly and got up to finish on equal terms for the win. BROADWAY PETE tracked the top trio around the turn, inched
up along the rail and took over a slim lead a furlong out, edged away on top and just lasted to finish on equal terms for the win. ACE GILFORD dueled inside
of SHIP BOSS around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane the got collared a furlong out and weakened. SHIP BOSS dueled outside of ACE
GILFORD around the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. BROADWAY coaxed three to four wide around the turn and had no late
response. SWAGGY GEORGE raced up close three wide around the turn then faded. TOO LATE was not too far back in the early going then steadily
retreated past the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
KNOCKER DOWN vied inside of rivals for the early lead then shook free leaving the turn, came under right handed pressure along the rail in upper stretch,
had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. HEROIC SONG vied with KNOCKER DOWN for the lead around the turn, could not move on with winner
turning for home and just lasted for place. CHOOS UR ADVENTURE tracked the top trio into the turn, roused three wide at the head of the lane and just
missed place. TURFY lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four to five wide into the lane and improved position. SUN SQUALL coaxed three wide
around the turn, angled inside at the head of the lane and offered no late bid. COCO BRAVADO chased the top flight four wide around the turn then gave
way. GAMBLER ROCKET raced three wide in striking distance around the turn then tired in the drive. KILGORE weakened off the second flight mid-way
around the turn and continued to tire in the lane.
