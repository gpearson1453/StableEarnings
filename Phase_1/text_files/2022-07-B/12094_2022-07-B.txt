Footnotes
METROS LIL POLLIE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. STORMY DAME broke sharply to race
closest to the winner throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. LEAP YEAR NIGHT settled just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. PRETTY PEPPY raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. ROCKETT'S RED CITY was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. JOJO'S GIRL lacked early
foot, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. CANDY TRACK was off slow, lagged far back throughout and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
CHARLIES HURRICANE broke sharply to duel for the lead with RAGTIME RYTHM while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
three-sixteenths marker and drew off through the lane with complete authority. DESTINY WHO lacked early speed, angled out into the stretch and finished
with good late energy to gain the place. TUTTA TERLINGUA chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. BAND OF
GLORY showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished well. MARILYN MONEYROLL settled off the
leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ARRANGED VOWS raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. RAGTIME RYTHM was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
CHEESE TRAY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead into the
stretch and held off the closing THUNDER DOME to prevail. THUNDER DOME was taken back at the break, saved ground through the second turn,
remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady rally. B A CHAMPION sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way
grudgingly in the drive. ON A WARPATH chased the pace of B A CHAMPION while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. STORMIN FAST raced
four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. NO PASA NADA was
void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ELLIOT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and
did not reach contention. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SALTIE FIRE was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and drew off. QUIEN ES
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with good energy. REINING
PESOS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. CHAMPITO disputed the pace from
between foes for a half and gave way. MANOSO vied for the lead from the inside for a half and gave way. WRAPPED lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. F S POSITRACK went wrong soon after breaking from the gate, was pulled up and vanned off.
