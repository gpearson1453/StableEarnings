Footnotes
PURSUING PACE broke slowly, swung outside entering the backstretch, moved up four deep around the turn, challenged for the lead outside KEYS
DISCOUNT in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and drove clear. KEYS DISCOUNT stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three wide
leaving the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgdingly. CALIFORNIA FLIRT , in the two path inside horses entering the far turn, was
taken to the three path at the head of the lane, moved outside and offered a mild rally. CROSSLAND , two wide chasing the pace down the backstretch and
around the far turn, weakened through the stretch. CURTEIS lacked speed, circled the far turn four wide, was fanned five deep turning for home and passed
tired rivals. STEADY EDDIE sprinted clear approaching the first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way the final three sixteenths of a mile.
BUSHWICK BRUISER , outrun, move to the four path turning for home and failed to rally. FROG PRINCE hugged the inner rail in a striking position around
the far turn and gave way. CALL ME VIVIAN , along the inner rail down the backstretch, was shuffled back approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
RIDGEPOINTE broke a step slow, quickly recovered and cruised up outside to engage BRAWNDO near the half mile marker, disputed the pace under
confident handling, seized command heading to the quarter pole, was roused clear in upper stretch, widened a bit while under a strong drive inside the
furlong grounds then held sway. YO NESSROUNDONKERN rated forwardly outside a rival stalking the leaders, entered the lane about three wide, edged
up in mid stretch, shifted in, switched over to his correct lead with a sixteenth to go and finished gamely to the inside of the winner. BRAWNDO set a
pressured pace towards the rail, ceded to the winner leaving the five sixteenths, stayed on willingly to the sixteenth marker then faded.
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO had speed then chased to the inside of rival mid turn, angled four wide for the drive and offered a mild response. JACKIE A
dropped back off the early pace, swung wide for the drive but failed to muster up a rally.

MUCHA MEZQUINA stalked the pace down the backstretch and in the two path around the turn, swung outside in mid stretch, closed and was up in time.
BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained a short lead entering the stretch, remained on the lead in mid stretch and
gave way grudgingly. CLAIRE'S DARLING bore in about a sixteenth of a mile after the start, set a pressured pace along the inner rail, lost the lead
approaching the stretch and faded in the drive. GENNIE HIGHWAY lacked speed, looped four wide on the turn, was fanned to the seven path in mid stretch
and had a mild rally. BEHIND THE COUCH , steadied when pinched back near the five eighths pole, chased the pace to mid stretch and flattened out. MA
DE TAW , checked in tight quarters along the inner rail near the five eighths pole, passed tired horses late. POLISHED GAL , fanned to the six path in mid
stretch, failed to menace. PERFECT DIRECTION , steadied in tight quarters near the five eighths pole, chased the pace, drifted out in mid stretch and
weakened. OLIVE KAT , steadied in tight quarters near the five eighths pole, steadied when shuffled back along the rail entering the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
DAT DARES GOLD rated close up while two wide, eased out a bit past the five sixteenths, moved to engage the leader nearing the lane, took control with a
furlong to go and drew clear under a solid drive. SICK PACK SARA cleared early and set a rated pace towards the inside, braced for the challenge
approaching the stretch, fought on to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly while clear of the rest. STAY OUT chased three wide while in the clear leaving
the three eighths, shifted four wide for the drive, moved up a bit near mid stretch then failed to seriously kick on. RAN CHAR was steadied back from
between rivals early, saved some ground into the lane but lacked a rally. R TRUE SENSATION chased the leader three to four wide, wandered outward a
bit entering the lane and faded. ELOQUENT LADY was sent up inside after breaking a bit sluggishly, steadied nearing the half mile marker, angled out then
drifted out through the drive.

Footnotes
POWER BACK stalked the pace, gained the lead outside BORGOBYTHESEA leaving the far turn, was challenged on his outside by BENNY HAVENS in
upper stretch, turned back that one and drove clear. BENNY HAVENS , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four deep, reached contention in upper
stretch and hung. CALL ME PLUCKY lacked speed, raced five wide leaving the far turn and rallied mildly. FERMAT trailed for six furlongs, raced six deep
entering the stretch and passed tired rivals. AMENDED , jostled between horses leaving the starting gate, raced inside rivals in the stretch and finished
willingly. BRYCE CANYON , a forward factor along the inner rail around the far turn, weakened in the drive. JOHNG saved ground around the far turn,
moved out turning for home, worked between horses in the stretch and weakened. TOE CURLIN' KISS , four wide the far turn, was outrun.
BORGOBYTHESEA set the pace along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. CELTIC TREASURE was no factor. SAINT MARCO , a bit rank
entering the first turn, raced three wide both turns and faltered.

Footnotes
PREPAREFORTAKEOFF dueled inside a pair of rivals, grimly maintained a slim advantage battling past the three sixteenths, had her rider briefly drop the
rein soon after, recovered and spurted clear under a drive, wandered outward a bit in deep stretch then held sway. PEACHY WEACHY tracked the dueling
leaders while outside a rival, moved up four wide to loom in upper stretch, gave hard chase past mid stretch and churned on to earn the place.
JERUSALEMA , sluggish from the gate, edged up nearing the turn and was urged along while saving ground, angled five wide into the lane, straightened
and closed steadily. JOE MIKE JIM stumbled at the start, regrouped and moved up outside rivals in the opening furlong, contested the pace three deep into
and around the turn, stayed on to battle between runners past mid stretch then faded. SENSON dueled a long way between runners, kept on past the eighth
pole and faded. JACKIE THE JOKER had speed between then steadied leaving the chute, dropped in to chase the duelers but came up empty. MISS
CHAMITA failed to menace.

Footnotes
PIE KILLER came in at the break, stalked the pace under patient rating, saved ground around the far turn, eased out to the two path entering the stretch bid
for the lead outside GASTOWN BABE in mid stretch and drove clear. GASTOWN BABE made the early lead in hand, set the pace along the inner rail, was
challenged in mid stretch, continued willingly but was out finished. BATYAH , outside horses down the backstretch, raced three wide around the far turn and
offered a mild gain. BOURBON WILDCAT saved ground around the far turn, remained inside horses through the stretch and lacked the necessary late
effort. I'M BLUSHING , three wide the first turn, circled the far turn four deep and came up empty in the stretch. GLOWSITY chased the pace two wide to the
stretch then faltered. IRIE EMPRESS , brushed leaving the starting gate, trailed.

Footnotes
CAGED PIXIE edged up early and raced in range of a contested pace, chased the three pronged battle while four wide mid turn, shifted out a bit wider into
the lane, kept on grinding under pressure, drew alongside the leader inside the sixteenth pole, dueled and just got up. KOBE'S GIRL prompted the pace
three deep, moved up and dueled from the far turn to the quarter pole, shook clear past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted, battled valiantly inside
the winner through the final fifty yards but just failed. MEJORAMIGA took over between rivals early and briefly went clear, was joined from both sides
leaving the far turn, fought on and held a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, failed to go with the leaders leaving the three sixteenths and faded. POLICE
WOMAN , up close while saving ground, was sent through along the rail to dispute the pace, sparred to the three sixteenths, continued willingly a sixteenth
further then weakened. MANITOULIN ISLAND , off the pace, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a bid. GLIDE , three wide pursuing the pace, faded.
CAPTURE THE FIRE broke slowly and was outrun. BIZZY BIZZY gave early chase off the rail and faltered.
