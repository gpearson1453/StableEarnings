Footnotes
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE pressed the pace from the rail, gained a short lead into the far turn, held gamely in the drive to remain clear under a strong hand
ride. IT'S ALEXUS tracked the pacesetters, moved up menacingly along the rail but was unable to reach the eventual winner and held place. TALA showed
the way into the backstretch, was overtaken by EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE into the far turn, chased through the stretch and evened out. MADE FOR MORE
stalked the pacesetters in the three path, and failed to threaten in the drive. FLASHY BIZ stumbled leaving the chute and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ITSMYDAY shifted out to the three path leaving the opening turn, sat just off the pace, moved up alongside INDEPENDENCE NEIGH at the quarter pole to
challenge the lead, rival took a narrow advantage late stretch but refused to go down without a fight and won the nod. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH was
quickest to the turn then secured a inside position, responded gamely to challenge from ITSMYDAY into the lane, match strides under steady urging and
was narrowly denied by the nose in the final jumps before the wire. LAST OF WAR stalked three to four wide, dropped back in the final turn, and rallied late
for show. CONTE ROSSO trailed early, and was bested late for show.

Footnotes
ALL THAT GOLD broke well then contended the early pace inside of KENTUCKY LEGEND, match strides in the final turn, moved clear and then held under
a late drive. DOC COPE unhurried away, swung out four to five wide into the lane then closed determinedly and missed. KENTUCKY LEGEND fractious in
gate, contested the early pace, dueled through the far turn outside of ALL THAT GOLD, and had little left in reserve for the drive. RAVINA LANE fanned five
wide into the opening turn, chased into the stretch and failed to menace. HIGH KELLY SONG rated well off the pace, and passed tiring. OUTLAWED IN
TEXAS was outrun then was eased.

DREAM COACH hustled away then sat just off the pace, was headed into the lane, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. KISS AWAY unhurried
early, advanced inside in the final turn, angled out to the five path, and finished gamely to just miss. VICTORY AT LAST stalked three wide, loomed boldly at
the head of the lane, and was outkicked. SANSOME raced wide through the backstretch, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, drifted out in the final
turn, and passed tiring. GREAT VISION vied inside for the early lead, was overtaken at the quarter pole and yielded. BEAUGATTI raced wide in the
backstretch, chased outside in the far turn, and failed to menace. TOLUI sat in range while four to five wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
RYANWATER reserved off the dueling pacesetters, closed the gap quickly in the far turn then went in pursuit of ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER, took over at
the head of the stretch and won driving. RED CHOCOLATE gained closer order in the final turn, closed gradually and got up just in time for place.
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER vied outside of BON PRIX leaving the chute, dueled through the backstretch then inherited the lead into the far turn, flattened
in the stretch and was caught late. BON PRIX vied inside of ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER, was unable to move on with rival and faded. TANGERINE TAXI
broke poorly, and showed interest late. ADMIRAL VANNGO mild late interest. DURITZ lacked early speed and was outrun.

INTENT TO STRIKE dueled inside of SAVED BY ZERO, gained a slim lead into the stretch, and drove clear. SAVED BY ZERO vied for the early lead,
dueled through the turn outside of INTENT TO STRIKE, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and finished evenly. MAJESTIC CAFE sat in
striking distance of the dueling pacesetters, rallied through the stretch and got by late for show honors. JULIUS THE GREAT lacked early foot then was
bumped away from the gate, chased from the rail through the final turn, and lacked the kick needed. FROBISHER BAY settled outside, shifted inside
approaching the quarter pole, and was unable to improve position through the drive. ADRIEN'S AURORA was outrun. BURNING LOVE chased the early
pacesetters, and faded.

SOUTHERN WARLORD contested the early pace between rivals, gained the short lead into the far turn, turned back challengers at the head of the lane and
stayed clear under a strong hand ride. DAD'S LEGACY showed early speed but was outsprinted to the opening turn, hustled three wide at the quarter pole,
loomed boldly into the stretch but was unable to reach the winner and finished with good energy. IRISH TRICK stalked five wide in the backstretch, fanned
four wide leaving the final turn, and lacked the rally required. BOOKIE raced wide through the backstretch, responded to encouragement into the stretch and
closed well. DREADNAUGHT angled in to the three path leaving the backstretch, shifted outside brushing SIR BRONX, and rallied late stretch. SIR BRONX
reserved off the early pace, circled into the lane, was brushed and offered a late rally. NEVVARE trailed the field, and passed tiring rival late. COMMON
