Footnotes
SHE TAKES FLIGHT soon had the lead, showed the way in hand just off the inside, lengthened command when let out along the rail on the second turn,
floated out when roused entering the stretch and kept FOREVER MESA at bay under steady handling. FOREVER MESA broke a half length slower than the
rest of the field, advanced from inside, angled outside with five furlongs left, progressed three wide on the second turn, fanned outside SHE TAKES FLIGHT
for the stretch run, moved clear for second and only make up minor ground on the leader in the late going. MISS KITTY PIE pressed SHE TAKES FLIGHT
early from outside, gradually angled in through the second turn, took the rail into the lane, failed to make up ground but was unchallenged for third. BEING
CREATIVE angled in on the backstretch, was just off the rail taking the second bend and lacked a stretch bid. MATLE VALLEY chased from off the rail,
angled in some with two furlongs to go, gained the rail at the head of the lane and had no late rally. LEA'S DREAMER steadily faded from inside. There was
a stewards' inquiry into FOREVER MESA'S start but no action was taken after their review.

LA GUERRERITA was sent up to vie for the early lead from inside, moved clear on the bend, put to urging leaving the turn, widened command then held
sway under steady handling. FRIEND chased from inside, angled out for racing room through the turn, lost considerable ground five wide entering the lane,
closed well and caught WEEKEND PASS for second. WEEKEND PASS moved to the inside nearing the turn, rallied in the stretch, had second with a
sixteenth left, also came up too late to gain the win and was narrowly outfinished for the place. HEY MA vied for the lead from outside on the backstretch,
did not keep up three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and flattened out. VIVA VIOLENCE displayed early speed between rivals, came
into the lane from path three and wore down the last furlong. BELLS OF JOY raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch but gave way four
wide on the bend.

STUMP was sent to vie for the early lead between rivals, was two wide through the bend, rallied the last eighth and edged ahead for the lead with seventy
yards to go. BEL BIMBO raced in contention from outside from the beginning, lost ground four then five wide through the turn, rallied belatedly the final
furlong, came up short but caught R H SMOAKEM for second. R H SMOAKEM contested the pace from inside, moved ahead on the turn, gradually drifted
out as he began to wear down the last furlong and was outfinished. AMERICAN SUCCESS settled well back early, picked up his pace along the rail on the
turn and found best stride too late the final eighth. PEACOCK MAN boxed in behind the early speed on the backstretch and turn, got through four wide
entering the stretch, advanced between rivals and also rallied belatedly. RIPE ATTACK displayed early speed from outside, was three wide taking the bend
then gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
LADY AT BLAME floated out some to bump AMARI S. leaving the chute, was prominent between rivals, advanced three wide on the turn, was forced out by
G MONEY LIV upper stretch and bumped by the latter, edged ahead midstretch then shook free under vigorous urging inside the final sixteenth. G MONEY
LIV gradually angled in as she vied for the early lead, moved ahead from path two on the turn, drifted out some upper stretch, bumping LADY AT BLAME,
did not relent after losing the advantage but gradually wore down the last sixteenth. REINA DE LA ROSE broke alertly, disputed the pace just off the inside
on the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail on the bend, angled outside LADY AT BLAME upper stretch, was no match for the top pair but was
unchallenged for third. AMARI S. bumped leaving the chute, raced in contention running widest on the backstretch, lost considerable ground through the
turn and had no late bid. MY LADY SLEW broke a bit outward then ducked in, bumping ARCTIC TEARS, was straightened, hustled up to be a factor from
inside but gave way before finishing three furlongs. ARCTIC TEARS was bumped and forced inward leaving the chute, soon far back, chased from just off
the inside and was never a factor. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER was a contender between horses on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
LAUDA SPEED shared the early lead from outside, edged ahead three wide on the bend, was bumped and forced out some upper stretch, battled the rest
of the way and held off TETSU. The latter was kept close between rivals, advanced on the turn, was put to hand urging nearing the quarter pole, drifted out
slightly to bump briefly with LAUDA SPEED upper stretch, fought gamely while still under hand urging just inside the latter but did not have enough in the
waning yards. WILDWOOD SECRET, fractious in the gate, broke inward, crowding those inside him, contested the pace two wide, gained the rail nearing
the end of four furlongs and slowly wore down through the stretch. DIAMOND MAXIMUS was steadied back from crowding at the break, lost ground four
then five wide through the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. STALLONE forced inward at the start, was prominent just off the rail on the
backstretch, had the rail on the turn, altered out four wide nearing the final sixteenth and could only make up minor ground in the waning yards. D' YANK
raced in contention from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, altered out widest upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late.

Footnotes
TURBINADO rated toward the outside on the backstretch, took over four wide on the turn, angled in some leaving the bend, was put to urging in the stretch,
steadily drew away and was kept to task to the finish. THAT KHENNY was hustled to contest the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on
the turn, swung out leaving the bend, came into the stretch from path four, took over second inside the final furlong then could only just hold his position late.
SHANGHAI SILVER also hustled along early, was prominent just outside THAT KHENNY, retreated into the bend, swung out five wide for the stretch run,
rallied belatedly and narrowly missed second. CO CONSPIRATOR chased from inside, commenced his bid leaving the turn, altered out as SNOOZER came
out inside the last eighth, was blocked with a sixteenth to go, altered in some when a path opened seventy yards out and was closing in for third near the
wire. FUTURE VISION chased from outside, lost ground five wide through the bend, angled in for a clear path upper stretch, was forced out to stay clear of
CO CONSPIRATOR inside the final eighth and also showed late interest. SNOOZER displayed early speed between horses, was two wide on the turn, no
match for TURBINADO when set down for the drive, began to wear down inside the last furlong and drifted out then lugged back in as he gradually yielded.
BOURBON TEDDY prominent between rivals, gave way three wide on the bend.
