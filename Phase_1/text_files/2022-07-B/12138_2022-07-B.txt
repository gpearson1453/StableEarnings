SO GO MY LUCEILLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted out a bit entering the stretch and lasted under a strong hand ride.
HIGH CUPPER trailed early, advanced three wide into the stretch, was forced out and brushed at the top of the stretch, surged in the middle of the
racetrack and just missed. OPULENT never far back, closed four wide into the stretch, was brushed and forced out past mid track at the three sixteenths
pole then was steadily gaining ground late. DANCING GRACE within striking distance, saved ground through the turn, altered course outside the winner to
the seven path entering the stretch causing a chain reaction of brushing to her outside then finished evenly. LADY ABRIL chased the winner in the three
path into the stretch, was forced out by DQNDING GRACE at the top of the stretch brushing with rivals then weakened. NANA ROZE was no threat.

FRONT CIRCLE broke sharply then quickly opened a daylight lead, turned back a challenge from EASY EYES nearing the quarter pole, edged clear, drifted
out late and just lasted. TIVIS never far back, rallied determinedly in the six path through the stretch and just missed. AUNT BEE settled four wide, moved
clover three wide into the stretch then leveled off two wide. ULTRA RAYS chased the winner early, dropped back on the turn then came on again late three
wide. EASY EYES chased the early pace, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the quarter pole then came up empty.

got up in the final strides. WOODLAND WALK away alertly, set a rapid pace along the inside until deep stretch, drifted to the five path and just missed
hanging on. AHIMELECH pressed the pace two wide and finished with good courage in the six path. OBIWAN offered a mild bid along the inside into the
stretch then leveled off. CHANNEL FURY unhurried early, closed some ground late widest. SHE'S PURE SILVER trailed.

Footnotes
GRAY ROYALITY never far back, rallied determinedly under left handed urging through the deep stretch and was along in time. ROSE KNOWS broke in
front, was headed briefly before a quarter, regained command, shook clear on the turn, maintained control until the final stages then couldn't hold off the
winner. LEWD trailed into the stretch, swung wide and found her best stride late in the seven path. WICKED GOOD unhurried early, closed some ground
late in the two path. MY D'VALENTINE was no factor. AWESOME WONDER stalked the pace for a half then gave way. TWILIGHT VISION was no threat.
STORMY BELLA rushed up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, pressed the pace into the turn then stopped.
