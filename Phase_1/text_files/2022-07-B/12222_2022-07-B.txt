Footnotes
EMICRACK (CHI) ceded the lead content to stalk, went three to four wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch taking the lead a furlong out, drew clear and held
safe. FORESTER'S TURN settled off the pace outside, took closer order four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch, won the battle for
second while not threatening the winner. HONEY WON'T settled off the leaders, went three to four wide between foes on the turn, came into upper stretch
five wide, was outfinished for second. BAY OF RUM was urged from the break, dueled outside a foe two wide, took a narrow lead past the quarter pole
drifting three to four wide into upper stretch, was collared by the furlong marker and weakened late. VELOCE raced in behind mid-pack two wide into and on
the turn, came out a path or so in the stretch, was in a bit tight in late stretch and not persevered with the final seventy yards in behind foes. DYNAMITE
KARMA shifted in and advanced up the inside on the turn, came out two to three wide in upper stretch, failed to rally. WENJACK was coaxed forward,
dueled inside, gave way. KEEN SAMURAI thrashed around in the gate as the stalls opened and lost the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED ALL RUNNERS HAD A FAIR BEGINNING AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
LUCKMAN was rated near the back of the field to start, began to advance around runners while on the far turn angling out four wide at the quarter pole and
was full of run in the stretch drawing off at the end. JUSTIN'S WAY was fanned five wide into the first turn, was roused at the three eighths pole advancing
well through the far turn, split runners mid stretch to take command but could not hold off the late closer on the outside. WAVE BABY chased the pace
inside down the backstretch, was in tight between runners at the three sixteenths pole, had to wait for room entering the stretch and found a seam late to
finish up strongly. EAGLE CHIEF was allowed to settle near the back early, commenced his run three wide outside runners on the far turn to bid at the top of
the stretch and was gaining steadily late to be in a three way photo for the place award. NEWPORT AGENT stalked between runners mid pack throughout
and finished with some late interest to get a small share. WHERE'S NEAL broke inwards to start, chased the pace in the early stages, took command at the
quarter pole was headed at the eighth pole and gave way between runners. FULL SCREEN tracked inside down the backstretch, was in tight quarters at the
three eighths pole to be shuffled back through the far turn and offered a mild rally to pass tiring foes through the stretch. SILVER SMOKE broke in at the
start, took command into the first turn, was headed at the quarter pole and gave way inside the last eighth. LOBBY BAR commenced a five wide rally on the
far turn outside the winner and stalled down the lane. AWESOMECREST trailed into the first turn and never reached contention. BLAST IN THE SNOW was
fanned four wide entering the first turn, tried to rally between runners into the stretch and retreated. KIDDIE HOLIDAY stalked inside throughout, was roused
on the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK settled off the pace switching off the inside up the backstretch, began to move three then four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six
wide and was bumped near the three-sixteenths, bid outside just after that incident and dueled till late when inching clear under strong urging. AMALFI
COAST switched out early stalking mid-pack in behind rivals and outside, went three wide on the turn, was bumped into a foe at the top of the stretch,
dueled inside the latter rival but was outfinished while second best. LA LIBERTEE was unhurried early shifting in and settling at the rear, advanced two wide
on the turn, came out in mid-stretch and ran on for show honors. BOARDROOM switched out a bit in the early going, tracked from between runners, went
two wide on the turn, angled four wide and bumped a foe coming out of that bend, ran on evenly in the lane. ARTIE'S PRINCESS was stoutly urged forward
at the break, moved clear and set the pace racing just off the rail, was challenged past the three-eighths racing on or just off the rail, weakened in the
stretch. DYNASTY OF HER OWN stalked the early pace outside, edged closer to press two to three wide into the turn, bid at the quarter taking a narrow
brief lead between calls then was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. LORENA broke on top, shifted in and was soon overtaken for the lead, was in
tight quarters and steadied just slightly along the rail past the seven-sixteenths, failed to rally.

Footnotes
TOO MUCH TALK waited patiently behind runners on the turn, lost his path in early stretch ,angled to the inside and finished on the fence strongly to inch
away nearing the wire. GASTON advanced five wide on the turn, was fanned eight wide turning for home, took command mid stretch but could not hold off
the inside closer. LANGSTAFF ROAD pulled his rider to the lead through the turn, repelled an early challenge entering the stretch, gave way at the three
sixteenth pole but fought on in the late stages to be third. MAGNIFICENT MARIO tracked just behind the leaders through the turn, took command at the
quarter pole, was headed while between runners at the eighth pole and weakened late losing third. HE'S GOT SOUL was behind rivals at the quarter pole
waiting for a seam to open and when clear could only offer an even finish to the wire. FLAWLESS RULER was shuffled back to the rear on the turn while
inside and passed tiring ones late in the stretch. STRONGER TOGETHER rated at the back early on, angled outside through the turn going widest in the ten
path for the drive and was never involved. MIDNIGHT ARKLE was stalking behind runners on the turn waiting for room, found a path into the stretch and
when asked had no response. BODACIOUS BIZ trailed early on, was angled out to the nine path for the run down the lane and could not become a factor.
UNDER SURVEILLANCE broke out at the start, challenged the pace inside early and had no finishing kick to offer through the stretch. DOMINANT
DESTROYER pressed the pace between foes early, was ridden turning for home and stopped the last eighth.

Footnotes
DAY TRIPPER got away alertly and angled to the rail then when a rival was intent on the lead ceded it to that one being taken hold of and switching off the
fence content to track in the two to three path, let that rival get away up the backstretch, swung four wide into the stretch, took aim and gained steadily under
urging to get up late. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) settled inside in a forward position but off the leading pair, came out two wide leaving the first turn, continued
to race evenly up the backstretch, advanced some on the far turn, swung four wide out of that bend then moved out further, gained belatedly to share the
place. BOHEMIAN BOY was intent on the lead and moved clear while shifting in heading to the first turn, set the pace racing off the inside, extended the
margin to and early on the far turn still racing several paths off the fence, was still clear into mid-stretch, drifted out late and was caught. MEYER settled
outside rivals stalking the leading pair two to three wide early, went three wide on the far turn, ran on evenly. MEN ON THE HILL (IRE) was forwardly-placed
while being guided nearer inside soon after the break, was still caught three to four wide around the first turn, settled mid-pack going three wide on the far
turn, came out a bit in upper stretch and kept on evenly. DESOLATOR altered outside the aforementioned in the early going, raced in behind that one and
others three to four wide, came out in upper stretch, showed some late interest to improve position. SHANGASSAH settled well back three wide and in
behind runners, continued three wide on the far turn with much to do but gained late near but off the inside. RON'S GIZMO broke a step slowly then moved
forward inside under mild coaxing, was within range inside the second group into the far turn but was empty for the stretch. TIMESKIP was caught four to
five wide around the first turn outside of rivals, continued four wide on the far bend and failed to rally. BREAKING ALONE settled while shifting in racing last
but one early two to three wide, moved nearer inside and saved ground on the far turn but was not able to menace. BURNING MAN was in tight at the start,
settled at the rear, moved off the inside late on the first turn, continued toward the rear two to three wide on the far turn, and was never a threat. LION
KINGDOM was about mid-pack two to three wide early, dropped back and faded in the lane.

ONE FOR CHAP took command from the start, opened up at the quarter pole, was challenged at the three sixteenths by an outside rival and hung on while
drifting outwards mid stretch. AWESOME BOURBON pressed the pace early, lost some ground to the leader on the turn, rebid the leader again turning for
home and was pushed out through the stretch running determinedly and holding onto second. VENTI waited at the top of the lane for a clear run, angled to
the inside to commence his rally and just missed getting up for second. BRITISH ARTILLERY was in good position early tracking the pacesetters, loomed
into contention with a quarter mile to go but could not gain on the front runners late. ENJOYTHESILENT rated near the back and made a mild rally in the six
path through the lane to garner a small share. CURLIN'S GHOST brushed the gate at the start, trailed early and found his best stride late running between
horses. J'ADORO rated mid pack between horses, was roused at the top of the stretch and ran evenly the last eighth. CANDY STREET stalked mid pack
between runners early, was asked at the quarter pole and could not offer a finish. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE was mid pack stalking on the rail, ridden at the
quarter pole and could not gain down the lane. TREJO was four wide through the turn, angled out widest entering the stretch and had nothing for the drive.
SUNYANI lost ground through the turn to trail and could not recover. UNCAPTURED MOMENT hopped slightly at the break, was asked early on the rail to
keep inside position through the backstretch and faded in the stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING #7ONE FOR CHAP AND #8 AWESOME

SIR FOR SURE settled off the pace outside three to four wide early, advanced on the leaders still three then four wide on the far turn, angled out five wide
past the quarter pole leaving that bend and bumped a rival in the process, got the jump on that one to take the lead just outside the furlong marker and held
sway under steady handling. HALL OF DREAMS settled two wide off the pace, switched out to began an advance outside rivals three wide up the
backstretch and into the far turn, gradually shifted out later on that bend while making up ground, was bumped leaving the turn, recovered to run on but
could make no headway on the winner while clearly second best. CAUSIN' MAYHEM moved forward rapidly intent on the lead racing just off the rail and
facing pressure from an outside foe, edged clear of that one up the backstretch but was then again challenged on the far turn, kept on in late stretch to save
show honors. DUKE OF LOVE bumped a rival at the start but recovered quickly, tracked in behind the leaders inside on or just off the rail, lacked room late
on the far turn in behind the leading pair, attempted to squeeze between three wide in upper stretch but found the hole closed, exchanged a bump and
steadied then altered out and ran on well late but missed show honors. DANCIN IN DA'NILE bobbled ever so slightly at the start but moved forward and
pressed the pace three wide into the first turn, allowed the rival to edge clear up the backstretch, took closer order to bid about the five-sixteenths still three
wide and with a narrow advantage, came out a bit nearing the eighth pole and bumped with a foe, weakened thereafter. THE MINKSTER was pulling early
against rider's restraint three to four wide off the leading pair, made a mild bid in upper stretch then evened out. LAC MACAZA broke a bit awkwardly then
settled well back two to three wide, showed mild late interest. GUARD OF HONOUR saved ground inside early, moved out two wide on the far turn, failed to
rally. BILL NEEDLE shifted in on the first turn, dropped back and tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

Footnotes
HADDASSAH broke sharp to lead, was unchallenged through the turn, repelled a minor bid at the eighth pole and when asked drew away the last sixteenth.
DUN DRUM rated well sitting third throughout the first half, offered the winner a brief challenge nearing the eighth pole, was repelled but ran on well to the
finish to be a clear second. A THREAD OF BLUE sat outside of rivals while running three wide tracking on the turn, angled outside of horses through the
stretch and close belatedly getting up for third nearing the wire. THEREGOESJOJO broke inwards at the start, chased the winner through the turn and
levelled out in mid stretch to settle for a minor award. PALAZZI was roused at the quarter pole, angled outside of runners through the stretch and showed
some good late energy passing tiring horses. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION tracked the pace inside down the backstretch, roused mid turn to offer a mild rally
into the stretch and faded between runners the last eighth. HENLEY'S JOY was mid pack stalking in the beginning, saved ground through the turn and could
not gain on runners down the lane. ARTURO TOSCANINI (IRE) was near the back early on, offered a mild rally between runners midway through the turn
and could not make an impact through the stretch. ENGLISH CONQUEROR was near the back and could not get into contention. BOX N SCORE trailed
early and was never a factor. MAMBOINTHEFOREST was ridden outside rivals through the turn and had nothing left for the drive.

Footnotes
MOIRA settled off the leaders two wide early, advanced between foes into the far turn moving three wide on that bend and inhaling rivals quickly and at will,
struck the lead at the quarter pole, was put to a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker although already well clear and continued to draw off under
steady handling. SISTER SEAGULL settled three wide off the leaders, came four wide into upper stretch, angled in once in upper stretch for room then back
out a bit weaving through rivals and rallied to secure second while no threat to the winner. SAHLABIYA broke in and bumped with a rival but recovered
quickly to gain forward position, pressed three wide, led briefly near the five-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch but saved show honors. SOUPER FLASHY
tucked to the rail early saving ground settling inside, went two wide on the far turn lacking room briefly turning for home, angled out in late stretch and kicked
on but missed show honors. PIONEER'S EDGE was a bit rank in behind and outside rivals early when taken back and guided in three to four wide,
advanced outside three to five wide on the far turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. SWOOP TO FINISH switched out early racing two wide about mid-pack and
outside a rival early, went three to four wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. MACCOOL'S GIRL was bumped and in tight at the start then urged
forward tracking the pace two to three wide, was within striking distance three deep to the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch. BIZYMALINE raced
mid-pack three to four wide early, dropped back on the far turn, angled out seven wide in upper stretch and passed some tired rivals. CURLIN CANDY was
unhurried early shifting in to save ground on the first turn, advanced inside foes into the far turn moving out two then three wide on that bend, angled to the
rail in upper stretch and could not kick on. LOADED VIXEN broke outwardly then moved forward to set the pace racing off the rail, was pressured up the
backstretch, gave way along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
WAKANAKA (IRE) tracked outside just off the pace through the turn waiting to move, pounced quickly circling runners to lead entering the stretch, opened
up at the eighth pole under a hand ride and was kept to the task at the finish. FEV ROVER (IRE) took command shortly after the break, set the pace
throughout the turn on the fence, was headed at the quarter pole, tried to respond to the outside challenge but was in tight, steadied briefly mid stretch and
had to angle outside to try to re rally and battled late to hold second. MUNNYFOR RO settled near the back to begin on the rail, angled out turning for home
in the five path and ran on well closing outside of runners to just miss getting up for the place money. SEASONS broke out a bit to start, rated nicely behind
runners down the backstretch and through the turn, waited for room into the stretch and found a seam at the three sixteenth pole but could not offer enough
late settling for a minor role. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE tracked the pace outside on the backstretch, offered a bid at the quarter pole between runners and
could not quicken enough with the top two and faded the last eighth. YOUENS was allowed to settled at the back early, angled outside in the six path
turning for home and could not offer a closing finish to contend at the end. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #3 FEV ROVER AGAINST #7 WAKANAKA(IRE)

Footnotes
MR. AGRO settled off the pace in behind, went two to three wide on the turn, had room to advance into upper stretch, struck the lead at the sixteenth pole
and edged clear under steady handling. MYSTIC POINT settled mid-pack, advanced between runners about the three-eighths, went three wide on the turn,
bid nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked. ACTION POINT chased from outside, went three wide on the turn gaining on the pacesetter, struck the
lead about the quarter pole, was outkicked in the drive. CAUSES TROUBLE broke out and bumped a rival then quickly moved clear to dictate the pace
shifting in to race on or just off the rail, was challenged leaving the turn, weakened in the stretch. WICKED CRAZY raced mid-pack to the turn, moved out
and began to advance four then five wide, made a mild bid in upper- to mid-stretch then evened out. MY REDEMPTION settled in the back half of the field,
went three wide on the turn, belatedly ran on. COUSIN ROB made a mild advance past rivals three to four wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch
and weakened. SILVER SIGNATURE saved ground inside racing toward the rear, lacked room turning for home then angled out drifting ten wide, passed
tired rivals. CHOCOLATE RUN chased in behind, shifted in, saved ground on the turn, dropped back and faded. ASCOT BAY chased outside going four
wide on the turn, tired. WHERE'S NED was bumped at the break, went three wide on the turn racing off the pace, failed to menace. RELOAD TIME saved
ground, tired in the stretch.
