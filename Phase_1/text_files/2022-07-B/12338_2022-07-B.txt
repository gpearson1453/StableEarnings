Footnotes
AUCTION KINGDOM raced inside horses for six furlongs, swung outside in upper stretch, drifted in a bit approaching the eighth pole, bid for the lead and
brushed with PRINCE OF CAPS near the sixteenth pole and narrowly prevailed. PRINCE OF CAPS showed speed in the two path around both turns,
opened up in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole, brushed with the winner near the sixteenth pole and just missed. GHOSTLIGHTER , along the
inner rail most of the race, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and finished willingly. READY REWARD , three wide around the first turn, circled the far turn
four deep, floated to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. EMPHASIZE lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and passed
tired ones. EXPRESS PHAROAH , four wide the first turn, moved up in the three path on the far turn and steadied in traffic behind the top two in midstretch.
SEVILLE ROW , four wide the far turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA raced near the inner rail
most of the trip and was outrun. FIVE STAR PHIL showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. An objection by the rider of PRINCE OF
CAPS against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch drive was not allowed. An objection by the rider of EXPRESS PHAROAH against the winner
for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
ALOTTACENTS pulled his way forward towards the inside of the leader early on, steadied near the five eighths and shifted out to stalk, was put to a ride
pursuing TALL ORDER near the three eighths, closed in and engaged that one from the outside near the quarter pole, poked a head in front soon into the
lane and dueled past the three sixteenths, was headed while between runners leaving the eighth pole, battled back under strong handling, regained
command in deep stretch and held firm. QUINCY CAFE rated off the early pace while saving ground, eased out and gained between rivals mid turn, shifted
out five wide to make a run in upper stretch, rallied under left handed asking to take the lead with a furlong to go, dueled outside the winner but wasn't quite
good enough. GENERAL J R steadied behind ALOTTACENTS when that one angled out near the five eighths, regrouped and edged closer while saving
ground past the five sixteenths, had ample room along the rail and progressed in upper stretch, bid inside rivals in mid stretch then flattened out. FUN
LOVIN CRIMINAL broke a bit slowly, lacked speed, saved ground under asking in upper stretch and got past tiring rivals. COMPLETED STORM stalked
three wide, circled four wide making a bit of headway in upper stretch, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. TALL ORDER cleared
early, set a moderate pace under rating, raced two wide while pressured into the lane, stayed on a bit longer then gave way. Following an objection by the
rider of GENERAL J R alleging interference through the backstretch run, ALOTTACENTS was disqualified from first and placed third

Footnotes
PRINCESS PITA saved ground around the turn while patiently handled, angled out in mid stretch, bid inside the sixteenth pole and drew out a hand ride.
DETERMINED HOPE lacked speed while well off the inner rail around the turn, angled to the five path in mid stretch, remained on her left lead until deep
stretch and rallied mildly. POINT WELL TAKEN , well placed on the turn, was three wide entering the stretch and flattened out. WINKED , two wide around
the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch and weakened in the drive. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER , shuffled back soon after the break,
raced between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. THE HAUNTED ROOM , wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch and was not a
factor. CUMULONIMBUS was outrun. SEAP , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. VIVI MY LOVE showed speed along the inner rail and
faltered.

Footnotes
KRACHENWAGEN had a shoe repair in the paddock, broke alertly then took command between rivals in the opening yards, spurted clear into the first turn,
secured the inside and set a rated pace, came under a ride once feeling pressure near the five sixteenths, kicked away while guided off the rail in upper
stretch, was kept to a drive and held firm. GHOST STALKER settled in the clear soon into the backstretch, saved ground advancing to the far turn, eased
out near the three eighths and continued progress to the quarter pole, dropped back to the rail in upper stretch and kept on willingly to gain the place. IT'S
GAME TIME , four wide into the first turn, advanced outside a rival into the far turn and set his sights on the winner, took closer order to have aim past the
five sixteenths, failed to kick on while under heavy pressure in mid stretch and faded. HAYNE'S FEVER stalked two wide, was under asking to go on into
the far turn, dropped back and shifted wider for the drive. LOST MY VOWCHER was taken four wide around the first turn, edged up nearing the five eighths,
chased off the rail into the far turn but failed to kick on. ALBERTANO lagged back and never got involved.

Footnotes
LUKIE DOOKIE lacked speed, commenced his move four deep around the far turn, swept to command in upper stretch, was under brisk urging and drew
out. NIGHT BOSS , rated along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out to the three path mid way on the far turn, angled to the four path approaching
the eighth pole and rallied. BROWN DELIVERS stalked the pace racing along the inner rail, challenged for the lead inside horses in upper stretch and
weakened the final furlong. ICANDOTHAT , a forward factor in the two path down the backstretch and around the far turn, took aim on the lead in upper
stretch and weakened. HEY BOSS lacked speed, bumped with SMARTHUMOR mid way down the backstretch, was taken to the five path in mid stretch
and passed tired rivals. SMARTHUMOR lacked speed, bumped with HEY BOSS near the five eighths pole and was not a factor. RIP IT opened up on the
backstretch, raced in the two path turning for home and tired. FIRST FORCE , along the inner rail on the far turn, gave way in upper stretch. BOOKER T
trailed.

NO MORE MASK tracked two wide under a light hold, responded when put to some left handed asking in upper stretch, went after the leader soon after,
dueled, took command inside the sixteenth marker and edged clear late while ridden out. UNREQUITED LOVE sprinted clear early, set a rated pace
towards the inside, came under some pressure into the lane, dug in when confronted, fought on from mid stretch to inside the sixteenth marker then gave
way grudgingly. BACI , bumped at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out then edged up between rivals in upper stretch and kept on
willingly to slowly gain. MISS OLD BAY , three to four wide stalking the pace, came up empty. HUFFLEPUFF bumped with a rival at the break, saved
ground and faded. BRUNELLA , three wide stalking the pace, shifted wider for the drive and gave way.

AUDACIOUS QUALITY bumped with MEGAYACHT leaving the starting gate, was rated along the inner rail down the backstretch while stalking the pace,
eased out to the three path in upper stretch, drifted in slightly approaching the finish, closed courageously, got up at the wire, pulled up lame and wsa
vanned off. PRAIRIE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. SARANAC (FR) lacked, raced inside foes turning
for home, rallied and was steadied behind the winner in deep stretch. SOULMATE swung to the four path leaving the far turn, was within striking distance
and flattened out. MEGAYACHT bumped with the winner leaving the starting gate, moved to the three path between horses entering the stretch and came
up empty. MR. D'ANGELO , three deep both turns, lacked a rally. BROKER'S REWARD stalked the pace outside horses and gave way. An objection by the
rider of SARANAC against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
PEACHY WEACHY , off the pace and off the inside, was under a solid ride past the five sixteenths as a duel went on up front, came five wide into the lane,
leveled off under stout left handed asking inside the furlong grounds, kept on determinedly and overtook SOFIA'S SECRET in the final strides. SOFIA'S
SECRET , three wide in attendance early on, emerged in a duel outside TEXIAN leaving the far turn, battled on a slim lead past the five sixteenths and into
the lane, edged away slightly inside the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but just failed to contain the winner's charge. TEXIAN edged up towards the rail
leaving the chute and engaged CHAMPAGNE SISTER for the lead, poked a head in front past the five eighths then got caught up in a pace scrum with
SOFIA'S SECRET, stayed on to dispute the pace to the sixteenth marker then faded. CHARMING WAY broke slowly then steadied when put in close,
regrouped and angled in to advance, was within range stalking around the turn, shifted out three wide soon into the lane with her sights on the duelers,
chased but lacked a solid finish. GLOWSITY came out at the break tightening a rival, raced between runners early, chased three wide around the turn but
lacked a rally. CHAMPAGNE SISTER broke sharp and cleared off in the initial strides, was joined from both sides heading to the five eighths, sparred into
the turn, failed to keep pace past the three eighths and weakened.

SURREAL FANTASY , urged to the early lead after bumping with GOGO CHANEL leaving the starting gate, set the pace along the inner rail, was
challenged by GOLDEN EFFECT in upper stretch, responded to rousing and drew away. MARY JANE CHROME lacked speed, was three deep entering the
far turn, moved to the inner rail at the head of the stretch, remained along the rail and rallied. GOGO CHANEL bumped with the winner at the start, circled
both turns three wide and rallied outside rivals. GOLDEN EFFECT stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the two path leaving the far turn, bid
for the lead in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. MAGNIFICENT PEARL stumbled leaving the starting gate, hugged the rail on the far turn and
showed late interest. EISWEIN raced along the inner rail the first turn and was done on the far turn. DOTADA was no factor.
