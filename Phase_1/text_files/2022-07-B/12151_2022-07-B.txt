Footnotes
REPEAT THE HEAT was well rated on the lead, began inching away at the quarter pole, opened up quickly when asked mid stretch and won comfortably at
the wire. WELL ACTUALLY tracked the pacesetters on the rail, made a bid at the top of the stretch, ran on well down the lane while drifting inwards to hold
on for second money. TUFF RAGS was away slowly to trail, started his run between runners on the far turn, split foes entering the stretch finishing well just
missing the place award. STAR SCHOLAR saved ground throughout on the fence, commenced a rally turning for home on the rail, was steadied just inside
the eighth pole while in tight quarters and ran evenly afterwards. BROADWAY SKY chased and pressed the winner until the quarter pole where he began to
weaken and retreated through the stretch. SPRING MOUNTAIN tracked between runners, was roused on the far turn and offered no finish while in the five
path through the stretch. DIXIE BOUND broke a bit slow, was three to four wide throughout and never was in contention. STEWARDS INQUIRY
INVOLVING #1 STAR SCHOLAR AND #3 WELL ACTUALLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN #3 WELL ACTUALLY BEING
DISQUALIFED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
CLASSIC QUEEN waited behind the pacesetters through the turn, angled out to the three path to pounce on the leader and when roused quickly opened up
to win comfortably at the end. TENPENNY NAIL broke inwards to start, trailed the field going into the turn, began advancing past runners at the quarter pole
and angled out to the five path for a clear stretch run getting up for second late. SKIPOVER took control after the break, led until upper stretch stretch where
she was collared, fought on stubbornly till the finish just giving up the place share nearing the wire. DREAMS AND SCHEMES chased inside down the
backstretch, lost position going into the turn and rallied mildly on the fence down the lane showing some good interest late. JIMMY IS A BREEZE tracked
the pace outside, took command at the top of the stretch to lead briefly and stalled the final eighth. ROOKIE COURT stalked mid pack outside of horses,
loomed outside mid turn and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. MILWAUKEE BAY broke in at the start, near the back early and never became a factor.
WANNA PLAY trailed early inside and never was involved. FLEEKA stalked between runners through the backstretch and retreated on the turn.

Footnotes
VIVID VIXEN was bumped at the start, settled about mid-pack racing three wide, advanced between foes three to four wide coming past the five-sixteenths,
came out a bit further in upper stretch, struck the lead past the three-sixteenths, pulled clear late. CAPPY was forwardly-positioned between rivals early but
soon eased back and tucked in behind content to track near the inside, tipped out coming into the stretch to be three to four wide and commencing a bid,
could not kick on with the winner but held the place. TURF AND SURF settled off the leaders two wide, bided time till upper stretch then angled out for
room, was gaining too late and missed place. SPIRIT DANCE stalked from outside three wide, moved to the lead nearing the five-sixteenths, was collared in
upper stretch and had no extra late. AWESOME STREET settled inside off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and ran on with mild late interest. INTRO
was bumped hard from both sides at the break, settled at the rear racing off the inside, swung five wide into the stretch, ran on mildly. BROKEN
PROPOSAL bumped the outside rival at the start, chased two to three wide, failed to rally in the lane. ASTONISH switched out heading up the backstretch,
went three to four wide on the second turn, failed to rally. KIMONO KATE tossed her head a bit at the start, was kept outside three to four wide early, went
four to five deep on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. MAKES SENSE TO ME bumped a rival hard at the start, pursued the leaders four wide,
came up empty. ROYAL CHROME bumped the inside rival at the start, set the pace racing near inside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
CALL HER JOEY was allowed to settle early trailing on the fence, began to circle runners midway on the turn, angled out to the five path in the stretch for a
clear run and just got up at the wire in a well timed finish. MACHISIMA hopped at the break, chased the leader through the backstretch, took command at
the five sixteenth pole to open up in early stretch but could not hold off the outside closing winner in the late stages. SAN NICOLA STAR chased between
runners to the half, angled out to the three path to bid at the top of the lane and could not quicken enough through the stretch to threaten the top two
finishers. TEXT ME UP was just outside runners tracking mid pack at the half, asked through the far turn and ran on in the stretch to get small share in the
end. MUSKOKA LADY was in a good tracking position inside on the backside and had no finishing kick through the stretch. FLAT OUT VIXEN stalked mid
pack early on, was roused on the far turn and passed some tiring rivals down the lane. STORMY DERBY DAY was four wide on both turns and never got
into the race. COCOTARA took command soon after the break, was headed at the five sixteenth pole and folded in the stretch. GLOVANNA saved ground
throughout, was ridden on the turn and had little for the stretch run. MAMITA'S CHICA trailed down the backstretch and could never get involved.

GOLDEN VISION tracked in behind the leaders racing just off those ones and about two wide, moved to the rail past the quarter pole, bid inside in
mid-stretch, struck the lead about the sixteenth pole and edged clear. HARD EDGE vied inside a rival early but racing off the fence, moved clear after the
opening quarter, was rejoined by other rivals outside late on the turn, dueled with a rival in the two path in upper stretch, held off that foe but was outkicked
by the winner. MS VANCOUGAR was up close racing inside, moved out three wide leaving the turn commencing a bid, fought on gamely but could not get
past for the place. AFLEET KATHERINE stalked outside, advanced four to five wide on the turn while being asked for more coming to the five-sixteenths,
had no extra for the drive. HELLO FRIENDS contested the pace from outside, was within contention three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch.
SILENT CAUSEWAY raced just off the leaders, was within striking distance three to four wide between runners early on the turn, dropped back and shifted
in late on that bend and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
RIDE THE WIND was behind horses waiting for a path to open up at the quarter pole, found a seam at the eighth pole and split runners in the four path just
getting up nearing the wire for the victory. STORM GAUGE stalked between runners in the beginning, started a rally in early stretch and took the lead at the
sixteenth pole and was caught very late just before the wire. LADY MAEVE (IRE) advanced through the turn while three wide, assumed command while in
the five path at the quarter pole and was outfinished in the final eighth while holding onto third. IS THERE A FOREST was behind runners entering the
stretch on the rail and angled out in the late stages in mid stretch to finish outside of horses with some interest. STUNNING RIVERS broke out to trail early
and showed some late interest in the final eighth to finish up well. SHELLY THE ROCKET contested outside with another rival for the lead on the turn, was
headed turning for home and faded between runners in the stretch. PESARO was inside battling for the lead through the turn, collared at the quarter pole
and weakened on the fence through the lane. CAPTIVATING ART tracked just behind the pace through the turn and had no finish in the stretch.

Footnotes
THESKYISTHELIMIT bumped a rival at the start, settled just off the inside racing well off the leaders, swung eight wide turning for home, rallied strongly to
get up late. DIXIEWISH stalked the pace going five wide on the turn, struck the lead past the three-sixteenths, was clear coming to the sixteenth pole but
was outkicked. EXECUTIVE EFFECT was bumped into a rival at the start, raced off the pace four wide into the turn, moved out six wide late on that bend,
drifted in a bit in upper stretch, kept on well. HONOR AND DIGNITY was bumped at the start, tucked in while settling well back off the leaders, went mostly
four wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch and gained late. MIA'S AUTHORITY vied outside rivals three deep, outlasted those two but had
no extra for the new challengers in the stretch. INFINITE PASSION had her head turned and the starter holding her as the gate opened, straightened her
head but was still slow to leave the stalls, settled at the rear, swung nine wide into the stretch and gained late. LILLZ HOPE chased two to three wide
through the turn, came out five deep turning into the stretch and failed to rally. PRINCESS SOLITAIRE moved out from three to five wide on the turn and
was never able to menace. BAYSVILLE vied inside a three-pronged battle for the lead, weakened in the stretch. SILENTANDDISCREET chased in behind
just off the leaders two to three wide, came up empty. P. S. RISING STAR saved ground racing mid-pack, came out to pass a tiring rival past the furlong
marker but was never near enough to threaten. SASSYWITHATTITUDE vied between runners, drifted to the rail in mid-stretch and faded. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED INFINITE PASSION WAS NOT PROVIDED A FAIR BEGINNING AND WAS DECLARED
A NON-STARTER WITH MUTUELS REFUNDED.
