Footnotes
BOLD MISTRESS bobbled a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, vied for the lead into the turn, disputed the pace with BLUEBERRY MUFFIN into the
stretch, outdueled the runner-up in the drive and edged away in the end to prove best. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly, contested the early pace to the
turn, dueled with BOLD MISTRESS through the turn and into upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner in the final stages but was best of the
rest. CLEAR WIN was forwardly placed into the turn, lost ground midway through the turn and chased the top pair into the drive, was outkicked in the stretch
run and held for show in the end. ENGEE OMBEE chased the quick opening pace, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a late rally. BREAKFAST
BALL lacked early speed and was unable to threaten in the stretch run.

Footnotes
COUNTING CARDS settled just off of the early pace, saved ground through the turn while racing evenly, made a good late rally inside of the final furlong,
split rivals inside of the sixteenth-marker and made a final push to win the head nod at the wire. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL rated off of the early pace, made
contact with MORE BUBBLY leaving the three-furlong marker, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, gained ground in upper stretch, continued that
advance through the final furlong, led inside of the final sixteenth and was nailed on the line for the win, while holding for second. MEET THE SHERIFF was
sent for the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, felt pressure from the runner-up in the final sixteenth and then
from the oncoming winner and was edged out for the win and place, while clear of the rest for third. HANDR'SDREAM vied for the early lead, tracked the
pacesetter through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. MORE BUBBLY broke alertly and showed early speed, lost
position on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

JAN JAN CAN bobbled at the start and was a bit slow into early stride, was steered outside of rivals into the turn, loomed four wide midway through the turn,
battled with the runner-up into upper stretch, shook free in the final furlong and drew clear in the late stages in the first career win for the rider. ST. ANNIE'S
INDY broke alertly, contested the early moderate pace, met the bid of JAN JAN CAN leaving the quarter marker, was unable to match strides with that rival
through the final furlong and was outfinished, while besting the rest. GOOD TIME DOLLY tracked the moderate early pace, came four wide approaching the
quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch but stayed on to earn the nod for third. WICKED SUNSET chased the moderate pace, lost ground in upper
stretch, was not able to muster a late rally and was just edged out for third. TRAFFIC STOPPER was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace,
set moderate fractions through the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. RACHEL'S LADY lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn and was not a factor.

early pace, gained ground along the rail on the turn, was unable to sustain that bid in the drive and gave way in the final furlong. OBVIOUS bumped

Footnotes
HERE COMES RALPHIE settled just off of the early pace, came in tight leaving the first turn and took back through the backstretch run, was roused on the
far turn, angled out at the head of the stretch, overtook the leading pair inside of the furlong marker and drew away while in hand at the end. RUNNING
LUCK was forwardly placed and attended the moderate pace, advanced on the second turn, dueled with DANCE LADY into upper stretch, was overtaken by
the winner inside of the furlong grounds and was outfinished, while holding for second. DANCE LADY bumped ALISO BEACH leaving the break, was sent
to the early lead and set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted by RUNNING LUCK nearing the quarter pole, battled with that rival
into upper stretch, could not match strides with HERE COMES RALPHIE in the final stages and gave way, while just saving third. SUE ETTAS GHOST
stalked the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground outside of rivals on the far turn and did not produce a late rally. ALISO
BEACH was bumped at the start by DANCE LADY and was off a bit slowly, was not far back through the first half-mile while just off of the pace, lost ground
on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. MOONSHINE CAT bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going, came
three wide through the second turn and did not offer a late bid.

Footnotes
KNOCKOUT BERT threw his head at the start but recovered to be close to the quick early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, made a steady bid
through the stretch run and wore down the leading pair in the final stages to prevail. EXCESSIVE CAT broke alertly and showed good early speed while
contesting the pace, set quick fractions to the quarter marker while pressed by ZERO BUCKS GIVEN, dueled with that foe into upper stretch, was
confronted by the winner nearing the furlong marker, met that bid to the final sixteenth but was edged out at the end, while holding for second. ZERO
BUCKS GIVEN broke out at the start and bothered MCGEORGE, pressed the quick pace through the turn, dueled with EXCESSIVE CAT into mid-stretch,
was unable to match strides with the top two in the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for third. TEXAS LONHRO bobbled at the
start, chased the quick pace, lost. ground on the turn and was unable to offer a late rally. MCGEORGE was bothered at the start by ZERO BUCKS GIVEN
and was off slowly, chased from near the rear through the turn and was not a factor. TOMMY SPECIAL chased the pace to the turn, lost ground while four
then five wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DARNQUICK broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set a rapid pace through the turn while extending the lead, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off
in the final furlong. PAPAPIFAS chased the fast early pace, lost ground on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the
final stages but stayed on to secure the place. PERFECTIONISTIC chased the early pace, gained ground on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and
lacked a late rally, while just missing for third. JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR was off slowly, trailed through the turn, improved position in upper stretch and was
not able to offer the needed late response. STORMY SAMURAI stumbled at the start and was hustled to be close to the early pace, lost ground on the turn
and into upper stretch and tired in the final stages. BIG DUKE chased the quick early pace, lost position on the turn while three wide, angled out to go four
wide into the drive and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MOUNT PELLIAR was crowded at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, steadied in tight quarters entering the second turn, swung
out to mount a four wide bid into the drive, confronted LIL MIRACLE MAN inside of the furlong marker, gamely dueled with the runner-up to the wire and
determinedly prevailed at the end. LIL MIRACLE MAN was hustled leaving the break and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions while prompted
through the backstretch run and into the second turn, shook free from the pressing rival in upper stretch, was confronted by the winner inside of the furlong
marker, dueled with MOUNT PELLIAR to the final yards and was gamely bested, while well clear of the rest for second. UNION WAVE stalked the early
pace from midpack, advanced four wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong, while holding safely for third. SALTO
DE TIGRE settled just off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground from an inside path on the far turn, came within
aim in mid-stretch but flattened out in that effort in the final furlong. NUESTRO ENGREIDO bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, stalked the pace
while three wide on the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, advanced in upper stretch to come within aim nearing the furlong marker but
could not sustain that run and weakened in the late stages. HARBOR SKY settled off of the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, maintained
position through the half-mile pole, lost position on the second turn while four then five wide and was unable to offer a late response. LEMON ZINGER
hopped at the start and was hustled to be close to the early pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, prompted the solid pace to the second turn, lost
ground in upper stretch, remained in contention to the furlong marker and faded in the final stages.
