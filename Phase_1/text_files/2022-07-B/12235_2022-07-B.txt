edged up in the final strides. MARK THE MOOSE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was no match, while clearly
best of the rest. JINGLE BELLS unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, weakened late
and held show. CREATIVE CHOICE stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch and
flattened out. HARD TIMER unhurried early, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. BIG FRANK well placed and
outside, faded through the second turn. CHOCOLATE PHILLING broke awkwardly and lost the rider at the start. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE

Footnotes
RICHARD HOOTY void of speed, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drew off late. NORTH
CAROLINA well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a
short lead, then shook clear late and was no match for the winner. HUNTIN' THE RUT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. OLD FORTY FIVE never far back, gained position on the two path through the second
turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened. TIZ SNOW well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and faded. TARQUIN was no factor. PITON well placed, faded after a half.
