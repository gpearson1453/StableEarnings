Footnotes
COUYONS CAUSE brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the early going, saved ground around the turn, swung wide
entering the stretch and kicked clear in the final furlong. THEO D'OR brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn four wide and chased the winner home from there. HELAIRE raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening three eighths of a mile, began a bid coming around the turn, swung out to the five path entering the stretch and gained ground on the
outside to the wire. DEMON HUNTER dropped back to chase the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, dropped
back entering the stretch and tired while drifting mildly in late stretch. LUCKY MOON DOG dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while
saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. SALUTE NOW dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and faded in the lane. HEZA SEXY ZONG brushed with the horse to his outside at the start, dropped back to trail the field up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a factor.

dug in in upper stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile. AUTOCRATIC was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field through the
opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late. CAPE TOWN
WILLY chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and flattened in the lane. REAL BRAVE stalked the
leader on the outside in the early going, moved up to press the pace from the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch.
