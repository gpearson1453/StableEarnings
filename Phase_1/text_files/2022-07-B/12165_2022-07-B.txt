RUNNING RIGHT BY U tracked the leaders on the inside, moved up midway on the turn, lacked room along the rail from the quarter pole to the eighth pole,
then angled out, closed willingly, got up late and was in hand the final strides. JERSEY GREGG dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, inched away
in upper stretch, dug in gamely in the final sixteenth but was no match for the winner. LONG LEGS dueled three wide for the lead, dueled on the turn,
weakened in the stretch and held for third. STARSTRUCK NOTION dueled between rivals for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. ISLAND SPIRIT raced
three wide off the pace and did not factor. BURN EM was off slowly, raced off the pace, moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane and faded.
WORD FOR WORD raced off the pace inside and was outrun.

at the start, raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, bid and was outkicked. MYSTIC DREAMS pulled early
on the inside, advanced two wide on the backside, chased on the far turn and lacked a bid. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS tracked on the inside in the early
stages, chased on the far turn and weakened. ANNAGANGSTA stalked two wide early on, bid between rivals on the backside, dueled inside on the far turn

Footnotes
TIZ A PRINCE set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, kicked away and was kept to the task. FOOD BANK
HELPER raced off the pace inside, advanced inside, rallied two wide into the stretch, closed well but second best. NOBLE CONQUEST trailed the field,
moved up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and got up for third. SHIMMERING LEROID jumped tracks in the
course nearing the first turn, stalked the leader, chased on the far turn and weakened in the lane. ANGELI BLU raced off the pace between rivals, chased
on the far turn and closed belatedly. ORIGO raced off the pace between rivals, steadied entering the turn, raced inside on the far turn and had no rally.
SURFING had a three wide trip and tired. TEMPESTUOUS tracked on the inside, then chased two wide and faded. YAH HUH raced three wide off the pace,
four wide on the far turn and gave way.
