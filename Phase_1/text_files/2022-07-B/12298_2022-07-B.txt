Footnotes
TRAGICALLY QUEWICK broke inwards to start, tracked the pace just outside, engaged the leader at the eighth pole and fought on well through the lane
drawing away late. PUGIN took command soon after the start, was headed by the winner on the outside mid stretch and battled on just giving away nearing
the wire. TOO LEGIT stalked inside throughout, waited on the fence around the turn, shot through the opening on the rail and ran on well to the finish
holding onto third. WHISKEY VICTOR broke near the back between rivals to start, was ridden at the quarter pole between foes and showed some late
energy in the stretch winning a battle for the minor placing. PRIDE AND PASSION stalked at the back in the early stages, advanced around foes while going
four wide through the turn, loomed into contention at the top of the stretch and stalled on the outside in the final eighth. PEPPERONI was bumped on the
break, settled near the back down the backside, angled out widest for the run turning for home and never threatened. YZERMAN tracked the pace running
three wide on the turn, was roused to keep up at the quarter pole and retreated between runners in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BRUTALITY settled inside, moved out leaving the first turn three wide, advanced three then four wide on that turn, struck the lead in upper stretch and was
clear by mid-stretch, just held under steady handling. SOCIAL JUSTICE exchanged a light bump at the start, raced outside the second flight stalking, went
two to three wide, came out a bit in the stretch and kept on gaining slowly and steadily but missed. SON OF MY FATHER moved clear easily with an
uncontested early lead, shifted in to dictate terms on or just off the rail, was outkicked by the top pair and just held show honors. SOCIETY EXPRESS was
bumped lightly after the break, was rated inside, came out for the stretch run, gained mildly but missed third. SUMMER HARRY stalked from outside two to
three wide, made a mild bid past the quarter pole, flattened out in the drive. CHOICE PLAYER had light bumps on both sides at the break but was relatively
unaffected and moved forward to track from inside in behind the leader, came up empty. MR. COMMISH bumped lightly with the outside then inside foe at
the start, raced three to four wide early, shifted in while trailing into the second turn, tired.

Footnotes
SKINNY DIPPIN tracked behind the pacesetters down the backside, angled out for a clear run entering the stretch in the three path, took command at the
three sixteenth pole and was kept to the task till the wire. IVICTORY trailed into the first turn, rallied between runners at the three eighths pole, angled to the
rail turning for home and closed well inside to be second. SALADA stalked inside behind the pacesetters to begin, was roused mid turn, angled out entering
the stretch rallying in the four path and finished evenly to be a clear third. DUSTY'S CHANCE was shuffled back to trail while outside of runners on the far
turn and picked up tiring rivals through the stretch. YOU THRILL ME broke out to start, stalked on the rail near the back, was roused through the far turn and
could not be a factor down the lane. POSITIVE chased the pace in the early stages, was ridden at the three eighths pole, briefly lead at the quarter, was
collared turning for home and faded in mid stretch. SHAZEEN hopped at the break, was six wide through the first turn, made a brief middle move down the
backstretch and had nothing to offer for the drive. TERRIFIC LADY took the lead into the first turn, was headed at the quarter pole and backed through the
field in the final eighth.

Footnotes
SOCIETY JOE brushed a rival lightly at the start, pressed two wide into the first turn then moved to the fore on that bend, allowed the inside rival to gain the
advantage to start the run up the backstretch, re-engaged at the three-eighths to duel, was headed by other rivals in mid-stretch but was resurgent late to
get the nod. TRINITY GOLD settled inside off the pace, edged closer turning for home, lacked room in upper stretch then found it between rivals in mid- to
late-stretch but just missed. MUROMEC stalked from between runners early, advanced three then four wide on the far turn, kept on late and just missed in a
blanket finish. GENDRAGON exchanged a couple light bumps at the start, settled three wide early, fanned four then five wide on the far turn, was gaining
but too late. HIT THE POINT saved ground tracking inside just off the leaders, came out three wide past the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch taking a
narrow lead by the furlong marker, flattened out and was outfinished. STOP THE HUMBUG exchanged a light bump at the start, was unhurried early shifting
in two wide, continued near inside on the far turn, lacked room near the furlong marker and checked, altered out thereafter and ran out of time. CRYPTIC
CREED was lightly brushed at the start, vied inside moving clear up the backstretch then dueled a bit on the far turn before weakening in the stretch. FIFTH
SEASON bumped with a rival at the start, was forwardly positioned stalking outside three wide early, came up empty.

Footnotes
SAME AGAIN DOC broke sharply to be in front, surrendered the lead to an inside rival entering the far turn, rebid outside to reclaim the lead nearing the
eighth pole and was starting to draw away at the wire. GRAND GIZMO was brushed at the start, tracked the leader on the rail down the backside, took
command into the far turn, was headed on the outside at the eighth pole and could not offer any resistance in the last sixteenth for the win but held on
willingly to be second. ALL TIME CLASSIC tracked the frontrunners just outside at the half, loomed in the three path around the far turn, could not quicken
enough turning for home to threaten the top two finishers and levelled out late holding on for third. MAYOR OF ESSA was off to a poor start, trailed down
the backside, advanced around runners five wide through the far turn and was gaining outside through the stretch. NORTHERN CONQUEST was brushed
at the break, waited behind horses into the far turn, tried to keep up to the frontrunners at the quarter pole and was one paced down the lane. MIGHTY
PELE was four wide into the first turn to trail and could not get involved afterwards. PAINTING THE MOON was near the back early, roused through the far
turn and could never offer a charge. BLACK BOGANDA was outside mid pack to begin, made a brief move in the backstretch and retreated through the far
turn.

Footnotes
GRAN SPIRITED settled outside a rival off the pace, raced two to three deep into the turn, fanned five wide out of that bend, engaged in a long drive and
steady bid to just get up for the nod. SOONER LUNAR vied between runners early then pressed the leader two to three wide through the turn, kept on
gamely in late stretch but just missed. KEEN FLATTER vied inside rivals up to and on the turn, came out a bit leaving that bend, drifted a touch in late
stretch while battling on, yielded grudgingly only late. FAST'N SEXY was forwardly-positioned early, settled just off the leading trio content to track, found
room inside in the stretch but could only kick on evenly. NATURAL ENERGY was just a bit hesitant at the gate, forced out several paths at the break, raced
off the leaders inside a foe near the rail, came out three deep past the three-eighths, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, ran on. CONFUSING broke outwardly
forcing rivals outward, attended the early pace outside, went three to four wide on the turn dropping back heading into upper stretch and lacked the needed
late kick. CALUSA DONNIE broke a step slowly and was forced out several paths at the start and spotting the field a couple lengths, trailed and never
produced a rally.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO was well rated on the front end, went unchallenged down the backside through the far turn, opened up at the top of the stretch and held on
for the victory. DANI'S VICTORY waited inside behind the front running winner throughout the race, angled just outside at the top of the lane to challenge for
the win and was gaining steadily on the winner but just could not get there in time. MIRIAM'S SKY settled near the back on the break, was ridden at the
three eighths pole to get involved, angled out to the four path turning for home and closed belatedly getting up for third. JEGOS FIRE was headstrong
between runners to start, lost ground on the far turn to trail on the fence, and ran on well on inside through the stretch just missing out on the show award.
DOCTOR UPTOWN trailed into the first turn and backstretch, advanced outside on the far turn, angled out five wide turning for home and ran with some late
interest in the late stages. FIRST SPRING chased the pace while three wide early, was asked between runners at the quarter pole and came up empty in
the stretch. DR. SHANE was four wide going into the first turn, waited three wide down the backstretch, advanced outside on the far turn to contend and
stopped down the lane.

Footnotes
ALLPAIDUP settled off the leaders, advanced while moving out from three to five wide on the turn, struck the lead just past the furlong marker and edged
away under steady handling. LOAD ABROAD stalked from outside three to four wide through the turn, made a mild bid in upper- to mid-stretch, was
outkicked but held the place. TOUCH OF ROUGE broke a step slowly, shifted out to go two to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and
gained too late. A. A. SWEET CHILLI moved forward and clear while shifting in to dictate terms on the front end inside, saved ground on the turn, weakened
past the eighth pole. BABY DRIVER broke a half step slowly, went two to three wide on the turn advancing past a rival, altered course inward past the
sixteenth and finished with mild interest. CORA raced outside four wide mid-pack through the turn and ran on evenly. TAPITURE WAY broke a half step
slowly, was coaxed forward chasing the pace two to three wide in behind through the turn, flattened out in the stretch. SHISHKA stalked outside three wide,
failed to produce a rally. FLAWLESS PINK broke a step slowly, was encouraged along in the two path on the turn but failed to menace. FLAT OUT
FABULOUS tracked up close inside early, dropped back tired.
