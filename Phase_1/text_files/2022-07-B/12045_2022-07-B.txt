POPS AWESOME rallied four wide on the turn, assumed command in the upper stretch, drew off past the eighth pole and extended the lead under mild
urging. OUR VALLEY was slow early, advanced inside, got through along the rail on the turn, led briefly, was no match late and finished second best.
YOU'RE MY BOY KAT was hustled along to vie to the turn, dropped back, finished evenly and held safely for show. GABE'S MONSTER trailed the field and
passed a tiring rival. DALE'S ADDICTION vied two across to the turn and stopped. Fractional split of 57.40 was removed. Hand timed.

Footnotes
CALIBOGEE ducked in at the start, assumed command three across on the backstretch, drew off on the turn for a long lead and just lasted.
HAVEULOSTYOURMIND was never far off the pace, closed steadily, was wearing down his rival and gaining fast late. AUDACE was impeded at the start,
saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn to threaten, hung late and lost position. HIGH FLYIN TIGER held a good position, angled out on the turn to be
widest in the drive and lacked the needed rally. THE THIRD RING vied inside early, gave way into the turn and dropped back steadily. AUTISM SAVANT
vied two across, was through early and stopped. SMOOTHING IRON broke slowly, was taken wide, was not asked, was eased and walked off. Hand timed.
