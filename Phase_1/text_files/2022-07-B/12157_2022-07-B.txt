EROTIC was forwardly placed from the start, moved up to engage the leader entering the backstretch, took the lead after a half drew clear and maintained a
safe advantage. KEEP ON DANZING was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied five-wide the final quarter mile and finished strongly. SHIFTY DANCER
prompted the pace from along the outside, was four-wide the final quarter and finished well. PROUD LION was prominent throughout while saving ground
and finished evenly. BLOOD RED MOON was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN saved ground
setting the pace for a half mile and tired. HAWK'S RISING hopped in the air at the start, dropped back and trailed.

going away. BRILLIANT BIRD saved ground setting the early pace under pressure from Please Me, opened clear after three furlongs then drifted out slightly
entering the stretch, was unable to resist the winner but continued on well for the place. MISS SUPER SAINT was unhurried early, came four-wide into the

wide, dropped back after three furlongs and then chased Brilliant Bird to the stretch and weakened. BEST OF SHOW broke in to bump Please Me at the
start, then dropped back and failed to seriously threaten while saving ground.

asked and finished well for the place. KISS RIDE GOODBYE dueled for the lead from along the outside, drifted out to be four-wide leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and held on fairly well late. NOUMEA saved ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through during the drive and finished in a
mild rally. CLOCHARD STREET was forwardly placed early, lacked room in traffic nearing the half mile pole, angled out and finished willingly. AMERICAN
ROYALTY dropped back early and failed to menace.

CROOKED FINGER RAY saved ground setting the pace and was ridden out to increase his advantage. MILORDS OATHKEEPER was never far back while
saving ground, slipped through in the stretch and finished well. HEY SEQUOIA was unhurried early, moved closer while racing along the inside on the turn,
angled out for the drive and finished fast. STEPHEN JAMES was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide, dropped back on the turn then came
five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. ATTA BOY BILLY prompted the issue for three furlongs while racing two-wide and tired. THE PRESS raced
four-wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

YOU'RE THE CAUSE dropped back after bumping at the start with Summanus, rallied eight-wide into the stretch and was up with a rush in the final strides.
MISCHIEF ROAD stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up to split rivals nearing the three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead leaving the eighth pole
and just failed to last. WHATSTHEDIFF saved ground while being unhurried, moved up closer on the turn angled out for the drive and finished fast.
SUMMANUS bumped at the start with the winner, then moved up along the outside, was carried out six-wide leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished
willingly when cleared. STYLISH ELEGANCE dueled for the lead from along the inside for five furlongs and tired. SYZSLAK was forwardly placed from the
beginning, came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. AFTER THE CANDY prompted the pace while racing three-wide, drifted out leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and tired. MAN IN BLACK vied for the lead from between horses for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
ATLATL unhurried early, moved forward along the outside on the turn came six-wide into the stretch, caught Ghostfinder nearing the eighth pole and proved
best in a stiff drive. GHOSTFINDER saved ground setting the pace, settled in the stretch with a clear lead, responded when challenged by Atlatl and missed
in a hard drive. ASSURANCE was in tight along the inside for the opened half mile, steadied nearing the three-quarter pole and again nearing the half mile
pole, found room nearing the stretch to offer a bid but lacked the needed late response when clear. MOON CIRCUMFERENCE dropped back early, rallied
four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. PERFECT BLEND prompted the pace for six furlongs from along the outside and weakened. LUCKY
CHAMP lacked early speed, came four-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. NUMMY NUM was forwardly placed for five furlongs while racing
three-wide and tired. HAVARTI GOLD stopped after showing brief early speed.
