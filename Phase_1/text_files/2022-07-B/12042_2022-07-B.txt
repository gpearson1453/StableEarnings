Footnotes
BLUE WILDCAT was a bit slow into early stride, rated off of the pace into the turn, angled out and was asked for run leaving the quarter marker, gained
ground in upper stretch, overtook the runner-up inside of the final furlong and proved best in the end. HER PERFECT VISION broke alertly and took
command of the early pace while in hand, set solid fractions through the turn, edged away in upper stretch, was confronted by the winner inside of the
furlong marker and could not hold that one off in the final stages but was second best in the end. DERRYGOOLIN was off a bit slowly, recovered to be close
to the pace into the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter pole and did not produce a late rally. AMAAZA was up close to the early pace, lost ground while
three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
STRENGTH OF AUTISM broke alertly and took command of the early pace, set solid fractions while well rated through the turn, held rivals at bay through
the stretch run and prevailed in a drive at the end. MY BUCKET LIST was shuffled at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed to the turn, rallied outside of
rivals nearing the top of the lane, gained ground in upper stretch and could not reel in the winner in the final stages but was best of the rest. SMOKIN' HOT
came in tight in the early going while close to the pace, shifted out to go three wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and was
outkicked in the final furlong, while just holding for the show. SLEW'S JOY kept close attendance to the early pace, advanced on the pacesetter on the turn,
stayed on into upper stretch but weakened in the final stages. PASSION OF JOE'S chased the early pace from the inside, ran evenly through the turn, lost
contact in upper stretch and stopped in the final furlong.

MADE THE TEAM was sent to the early lead, was well handled while setting solid fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead along the far turn
and into upper stretch and pulled away in the final stages. TAM'S TIME settled off of the early pace, saved all of the ground into the second turn, improved
position nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in upper stretch but stayed on to prove second best. THE LONNA RANGER was shuffled back at the start
and was away slowly, raced outside of rivals while off of the pace in the early going, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn but flattened out in that
effort in the drive while holding safely for third at the end. DANNY MICHAEL was allowed to settle, lacked speed through the backstretch run, gained a bit of
ground along the second turn but could not muster a late response. AFRICAN PRINCE stalked the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch
run, lost ground on the second turn and tired in the stretch drive. ROYAL HEART was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the solid pace through the
backstretch run, lost ground on the far turn, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the final stages and walked off under his own power.

MINOSO tracked the early fractions, gained ground from an inside position on the turn, chased in pursuit in upper stretch, made a late surge in the final
sixteenth and was determinedly up in time to prevail. POTENTE ALBA broke alertly and contested the early pace to the turn, took a narrow advantage
nearing the quarter marker, maintained that slim lead into upper stretch and was just tagged in the final strides by the winner, while holding for second.
BETITO showed early speed and contested the pace through the turn, battled on into upper stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong, while just
holding for the show. GOBSMACK chased the early speed, came in tight nearing the quarter marker and lost ground into the drive, rallied in the final furlong
but could not find the needed late response. THAT'S BIND BABE chased the pace, came outside of rivals nearing the quarter pole to be four wide into the
stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final stages, while just missing for the minor awards.

Footnotes
CORSICAN was away in good order and sped to the early lead, extended the advantage along the turn while setting quick fractions, kicked clear in upper
stretch and drew off in the final furlong. RHODIUM RUNNER was hustled leaving the start and was close to the early pace, lost ground to the winner on the
turn, could not match strides in upper stretch and was no match for the winner in the end but stayed on to be best of the rest. CLASS PROOF rated off of
the quick early pace, made a four wide move on the turn to improve position, was outkicked in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. DRUMADOON
broke in at the start, chased the quick pace to the turn, came in tight and lacked room midway through the bend, shifted out at the top of the stretch and was
outfinished in the end, while just missing for show. TOM'S MOON was bumped leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked speed through the turn,
came three wide into the drive and did not mount a late response. SPLIT ACES broke out at the start, was forwardly placed in the run to the turn, ran evenly
to the quarter pole while saving ground, was outrun in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BANDEENA broke alertly and set the early fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, inched away on the far turn and into upper stretch and
drew clear in the final furlong. SHE'S SO PRETTY stalked the pace from midpack, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground while
three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked in the drive but stayed on well to be best of the rest. CASINO GAMES saved ground while settling off of
the pace, mounted a two wide bid into the stretch run, was outkicked in mid-stretch but held safely in the end for third. ESCAPE THE CITY (GB) was off a bit
slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, improved position on the far turn, continued that advance in upper stretch but could not sustain that bid in
the final stages and flattened out in the end. BLUSHING BAY settled off of the solid early fractions while three wide, maintained position through the
backstretch run, was outrun in upper stretch and gave out in the late stages. MOMMY ROSE showed good early speed and prompted the solid pace
through the backstretch run, lost ground while four wide on the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TIZ VICIOUS was sent in hand to the front, set solid fractions through the turn, quickened nearing the quarter marker and extended the lead into upper
stretch, drew away in the final stages and won easily at the end. DOUBLE THE GOLD was away a step slowly but recovered to be close to the early pace,
lost ground to the winner along the turn, was outrun by TIZ VICIOUS in the drive but stayed on to hold for second in the end. WICKED BLUE was taken
outside of rivals in the early stages, chased from the rear to the turn, came three wide to the quarter pole while trailing, was outkicked in upper stretch and
did not offer a final bid in the late stages but kept on to be an easy third. LOVER BOY TOM bobbled at the start, tracked the solid pace to the turn, came
three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. ONE LAST THOUGHT chased the pace from the rail and did not
produce a late rally in the stretch.
