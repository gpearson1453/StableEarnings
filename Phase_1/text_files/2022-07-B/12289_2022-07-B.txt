Footnotes
WAR AND ROSES stalked the pace, was four deep around the turn, gained the lead outside foes in mid stretch and drove clear. CLASS WIZARD , fidgety
in the starting gate, broke slowly, raced in the two path around the turn, swung to the five path near the eighth pole and rallied nicely.
BELIEVEINROCKNROLL saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace, drifted out near the eighth pole and weakened. SOLAR SHIELD , along
the inner rail most of the trip, raced evenly. SYNCOPATED bumped with BARCO DE SUENOS leaving the starting gate, swung to the five path in mid
stretch and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. DOC ROCK disputed the pace in the two path between horses and weakened. WEST VIRGINIA BOY lacked
speed and passed tired ones late. EPIC RISE , four wide on the turn, was not a factor. GLASTONBURY bore in leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace
three deep around the turn and gave way in the drive. BARCO DE SUENOS , pinched back after being bumped and forced in by GLASTONBURY leaving
the starting gate, was distanced.

Footnotes
SWEET TALIA , towards the inside and not far back, eased out and was coaxed along to advance between rivals past the five sixteenths, steadied in traffic
nearing the lane, swung out four wide soon after, leveled off under right handed asking past mid stretch, forged to command outside FORTES with about a
sixteenth remaining and eagerly drew away. FORTES rated forwardly while two wide, took closer order past the three eighths, went on the attack with a
quarter to go, was roused clear in upper stretch, kept on past mid stretch, failed to contain the winner leaving the sixteenth pole but stayed on with some
effort to save the place. CANDY CORNER rated off the pace and off the inside, moved up mid turn, shifted out five wide for the drive and finished willingly.
MIDDLE ISLAND leaned in at the gate at the break forcing her to be away last, regrouped and pulled her way forward three wide into the turn, bid three
deep nearing the lane, chased past mid stretch then faded. RATIONALMILLENNIAL prompted the pace towards the rail, eased out approaching the stretch,
edged up between runners leaving mid stretch, had her rider lose the whip soon after and came up empty. SALTY SAUL drifted in at the break, corrected
and vied outside a rival, spurted clear into the turn, dropped in to set the pace, was joined nearing the quarter pole, stayed on a sixteenth longer then faded.
HARPER'S DO , forced in some at the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
DR RAGS saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, was behind horses in upper stretch, swung to the four path in mid stretch, closed outside foes,
led late and drove clear. HINDENBURG , three wide around the turn, advanced outside horses to bid for the lead near the eighth pole, finished well but was
no match for the winner. SCINTILLIO prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained a short lead in upper stretch and gave way inside the top pair.
FROG PRINCE lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. PLAYING GOLD worked
between rivals in the stretch and passed tired ones. CALLYOURIGHTBACK , five deep on the turn, angled out for the drive and passed tired horses. I'M
JUNETEENTH showed speed along the inner rail and weakened the final furlong. MASTER OF MANHATAN raced along the inner rail on the turn and was
not a factor. LAMARKABLE , in the four path on the turn, lacked a rally. CASA GRANDE , well off the rail turning for home, weakened and drifted in near the
eighth pole.

FAST LOADED had speed between runners then was deftly rated back off the leaders leaving the five eighths, tracked the embattled quartet leaving the
three furlong pole, got through along the inside entering the lane as BAHAMA CHANNEL wandered outward, responded to right handed asking and spurted
clear with a furlong to go, kept on under steady hand coaxing through the final fifty yards and prevailed. BAHAMA CHANNEL broke outward, corrected and
took command inside, set a pressured pace towards the rail, drifted out entering the lane, wandered out well into the track while pursuing through the final
sixteenth, kept on gamely and had his final lunge fall just short. EXCALIBUR , five then four wide early while in range, moved up four deep to bid mid turn,
pressed outside rivals and was carried out into the lane, straightened and chased widest leaving mid stretch, was floated out by BAHAMA CHANNEL near
the sixteenth pole, altered in and kept on trying. ONE TWO KID stalked the pace four then three wide, bid between foes mid turn, was carried out a bit
entering the lane, chased between runners past the three sixteenths but came up empty in the final furlong. MAMAIGOTTHIS dropped off the early pace,
raced removed from the rail into the turn and failed to respond. HE'S NOT CURLY , three then two wide early, pressed the pace outside BAHAMA
CHANNEL, fought on between runners leaving the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. Following an objection by the rider of
EXCALIBUR, BAHAMA CHANNEL was disqualified from second and placed third for causing interference in the stretch. An objection by the rider of ONE
TWO KID against BAHAMA CHANNEL alleging interference in upper stretch was not allowed

Footnotes
CLAIRE'S DARLING rated in closest pursuit of the leader while saving ground, responded when put to pressure soon into the lane, closed steadily towards
the rail, took command a sixteenth out, kicked clear then held sway under a drive. GENNIE HIGHWAY , brushed at the break, drafted back off the pace
while saving ground, angled out mid turn, circled five wide under pressure into the lane, closed steadily past the furlong grounds, lost momentum as her
rider misjudged the wire for several strides, got re engaged late and finished well to nab the place. SHACKABOOM sprinted clear early, opened up a long
lead, set the pace under a light hold around the turn, came three wide for the drive, remained on her left lead, dug in when confronted nearing the sixteenth
pole then gave way grudgingly. NELLYSFORD drifted in at the break and brushed with a rival, edged up off the rail into the turn, chased two wide, made
progress under pressure heading to the sixteenth marker and churned on. POLISHED GAL , in mid pack three wide, was under a ride circling into the lane,
advanced inside the eighth pole and kept on trying. ALL ABOUT KATHERN lagged well back, saved ground into the lane, shifted out through the drive and
had belated action to bridge the gap. CAROLINA ICE , in tight at the break, raced well back around the turn, swung wide and had a mild kick. WILDCATTIN
, in close at the break, was hustled up heading to the turn, chased towards the inside and gave way.

MAID THE JOURNEY rushed up along the inner rail to take the lead near the five eighths pole, remained along the rail throughout and drew away under
urging. MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU , two wide around the turn, chased the winner and was not good enough. SPITBALL saved ground around the turn,
remained near the rail in the stretch and failed to rally. RAPID RESPONSE chased the pace while three wide around the and gave way. BAPTIZE THE BOY
raced in the three path on the turn and was not a factor. AIR ON FIRE , four deep around the turn, faltered and drifted out late.

Footnotes
AIN'T DA BEER COLD had speed then rated back off the leader and shifted out nearing the backstretch, settled in a stalking spot three wide outside rivals,
took up serious chase when scrubbed upon past the three eighths, closed in on the embattled leaders then shifted out a bit entering the lane, kicked clear
under left handed asking in mid stretch, spurted away a bit under strong right handed encouragement near the sixteenth pole then held firm. CROUCHELLI
settled well back while saving ground, moved up while towards the rail in upper stretch, altered out leaving the eighth pole, split rivals and finished up
willingly to gain the place. OUTLIER was sent up early to contention, prompted the pace outside BIG LAKE, moved alongside that one leaving the far turn,
dueled to the three sixteenths, gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards and saved the place. SILENT MALICE lagged well back, commenced a run off
the rail leaving the three eighths, came four wide with continued progress into the lane, churned on but was out kicked for the show. DIXIE DRAWL , outside
EXCELLORATOR while stalking the pace, took closer order while under a ride between rivals past the five sixteenths, shifted out in the lane then faded late.
BIG LAKE broke on top despite a stumble, regrouped and took control inside, was shadowed through the backstretch run, dueled under asking from the
three eighths to upper stretch, failed to kick on leaving the furlong grounds and gave way. EXCELLORATOR saved ground while not far back, gained under
a solid ride mid way on the final turn, never really got clear sailing from the head of the lane, shifted out and faded. TATTOOED , in the clear past the five
eighths, raced three wide into the lane and gave way.
