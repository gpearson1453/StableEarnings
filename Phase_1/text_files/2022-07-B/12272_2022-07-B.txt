was kept to the task. PRECISION PRADO hopped at the start, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and edged up for
the place late. CROSSTOWN GIRL rated back through the first turn, saved ground through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then weakened

GAGE HAS A GRAY pulled to the lead into the first turn, drifted out through the turn, straightened setting the pace just off the rail, then dueled the final
furlong and held the advantage gamely. AULT rated back through the first turn, saved ground through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader
into the stretch, then dueled with that one the final furlong and lacked the needed late kick. YADI allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled
out in the stretch and had a mild gain. HONOR COLLECTION mid pack, saved ground through the turns, angled out four and five wide in the stretch, made
a steady gain and missed the show. CABERTOSS well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into
the stretch and weakened. ST. PADDY'S DADDY ran evenly.

DORISTO tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. JACKSON STRONG
well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was no match for
the winner and held the place. MUTASHABEH allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path and had a mild
late gain. BAD PAY stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. TITHED unhurried, looped up four wide through the turn to gain position, then had no rally. SILVER TOKEN mid pack, moved up
three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. SQUIRREL set the pace on the inside and faded in the stretch.
