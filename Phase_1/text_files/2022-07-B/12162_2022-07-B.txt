ANGELS CASTLE stalked off the rail, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail rounding the far turn, dueled for the lead later
yards and held on well. WEST VIRGINIA PAM rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and drafted EYE OF THE NEEDLE at the rail on the far
turn, then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. The latter took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met mid-stretch and flattened later yards. TINA'S
SONG settled off the early pace about the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but showed little response. REVEIRS MINUTE dropped well
back and loped around while saving ground.

Footnotes
SUPERSTASIA stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms toward the quarter, contested the edge in the
three path of the far turn, drifted approaching the head of the lane but dueled clear past the eighth pole and held on well. FORT ZANNA settled off the rail on
the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved at the rail rounding the far turn, took over second mid-stretch and finished evenly. PRACTICAL
KITTY settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and came along
for third under the wire. STOPWATCHSONNY rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met toward the quarter
and raced close at the rail on the far turn, but weakened past the eighth pole. BUNNY PRINCESS saved ground racing well back. SKIP TOWN was never a
factor. COOKIE DUNK DUNK raced off the pace inside, was eased approaching the three eighths pole and walked off sore.
