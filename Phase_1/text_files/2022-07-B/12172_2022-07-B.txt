Footnotes
KLIMTOGLORY was bumped at the break, sat behind the pacesetter through the turn while on the rail waiting for an opening and angled out mid stretch to
come with his late surge to get up for the win on the last jump. TREBUCHET stalked outside of horses early, loomed into contention turning for home,
assumed the lead at the three sixteenth pole and stubbornly tried to repel the challenge of an outside closer just missing the victory at the wire. SUPER
HEADLINE broke in at the break, took command leaving the chute, was collared nearing the eighth pole while inside and hung on for third money. I AM
RESILIENT was bumped at the start, stalked between foes then angled out mid turn to offer a mild rally and evened out in the late stages. BODIE trailed in
the beginning, tried to advance four wide around runners through the turn and stalled down the lane. MISTER M V P chased between runners throughout,
was steadied at the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
KOSMONAVT was bumped lightly a few times at the start, moved to the rail while forwardly-positioned into the first turn, came out three wide later on that
bend to stalk the leader, commenced a bid three wide on the far turn, struck the lead turning for home, edged clear and was kept to the task. COPINSAY set
the pace racing off the inside, was challenged on the far turn, kept on but was second best. LATE SURGE broke outwardly and about a length slow, angled
to the rail and was unhurried at the rear early, advanced inside up the backstretch and on the far turn, came out turning for home and then further in upper
stretch, ran on and held show honors. SUMMER SHANDEE moved out four wide heading to the first turn, shifted in to save ground on the far turn and was
ridden along but with much to do, ran on mildly inside but missed third. CAM WOOLLEY bumped with a foe at the start, settled last but one two to three
wide early, ran on. CONQUER HIM had some bumps at the beginning and about the seven-eighths entering the first turn going three to four wide on that
bend and up close stalking the leaders, went four to five deep on the far turn and failed to rally. MY BOY CHRISTIAN was fractious in the gate and had to be
reloaded, steadied on heels heading down the stretch the first time, soon after moved out when in tight and bumped a rival entering the first turn, continued
relatively close up two to three wide, was asked past the seven-sixteenths but had no response. BLUE SNOW bobbled into a rival at the start, was floated
five wide into the first turn then angled in three deep on that bend, came up tired.

EMBRACE MY UNCLE tracked the pace inside early, took to the outside through the backstretch, assumed control at the quarter pole and had enough in
reserve down the lane to hold off any challengers. COLEYVILLE broke out at the start, tracked inside behind the pace through the backstretch and the far
turn, angled out for a clearer lane at the eighth pole and quickened late to get up for the place award in a photo. FINALIST set all the pace, was headed at
the quarter pole by the winner and fought on stubbornly while inside to hold on for third money. HYPERFOCUS was brushed at the start to trail early,
offered a rally outside at the three eighths pole and was widest through the lane battling for a minor share. JUAN PABLO was three wide throughout, roused
on the far turn to contend entering the stretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS chased the leader into the first turn, was
between runners through the backstretch, retreated on the far turn and offered little for the drive.

BIG WARDEN was urged at the break to set the pace, challenged by an outside rival on the turn, deposed of that one and kicked clear in the stretch under
steady handling. MR. DE saved ground inside, gained late to capture the place. WHERE IS ESSA steadied on heels early up the backstretch, moved out a
bit on the turn then came out further at the top of the stretch bumping a rival about the three-sixteenths, kicked on late and bumped another rival nearing the
wire while getting up for show late. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY stalked the pace from outside, moved to challenge three wide on the turn, dueled then
weakened in the stretch and lost show. CHUNKY MONKEY was bumped at the start, pursued the pace from between rivals, could not kick on in the stretch
and was bumped nearing the wire. DIXIE'S FLATTER was bumped into a rival at the start, was ridden along at various points while racing off the inside,
failed to menace. PRIMORDIAL FEAR bumped a rival at the start, was just off the leaders, went four then six wide on the turn, failed to threaten. IT
WORKED pursued the pace three to four wide, came up empty.

MORNING THOUGHTS broke inwards, stalked between rivals mid pack on the backstretch, was ridden on the turn and rallied through the stretch splitting
horses at the eighth pole to inch away nearing the wire. ROOKIE RADAR broke in to start, was near the back behind a wall of runners at the three eighths
pole, advanced just outside of horses on the turn and angled out at the eighth pole for a clear run gaining late just getting up for place. MAGIC SPIN battled
between foes through the turn, assumed the lead at the three sixteenth pole and fought on well in the late stages losing the top two placings just before the
wire. CONDITIONAL broke outwards leaving the gate, took command on the rail in the turn, was headed at the three sixteenth pole and ran evenly late to
hold on for a minor share. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER was four wide outside runners stalking on the turn, loomed up at the quarter pole and stalled the final
eighth. DOINGGOODTROUBLE trailed early, was very wide entering the stretch and never reached contention. SUPREMEACTION was squeezed at the
break, took the lead leaving the chute, was headed into the turn and had nothing for the stretch run. FIFTY THREE broke out at the start, was ridden on the
rail through the turn and retreated down the lane.

LAST AMERICAN EXIT settled inside at the rear, swung eight wide into upper stretch, rallied strongly late to just get up. BODE'S TIPSY raced outside the
eventual winner well off the leaders, swung widest to be nine deep in upper stretch, rallied strongly but just missed. MACLEAN'S POSSE tracked up close
inside, came out leaving the turn and in upper stretch, made a late bid between rivals but was outfinished. TIO MAGICO stalked from between runners
early, edged closer on the turn, bid two to three wide, struck a narrow lead in mid-stretch and led late but was outfinished. SANDY BAY chased outside
three to four wide, dropped back on the turn and in upper stretch, came out a bit in mid-stretch and kept on well late but was outkicked.
THREEFIFTYSEVEN shifted in, advanced inside on the turn but evened out thereafter. SWOT ANALYSIS moved clear and shifted in to set the pace inside,
steadily weakened. SOUP AND SANDWICH raced outside off the pace going four to five wide on the turn, ran on in the stretch. SPEEDY HANS tracked
inside foes but off the rail, moved out a bit and was unable to menace.

Footnotes
ALL CANADIAN showed good early speed to take command, was challenged briefly by an outside foe midway on the turn, repelled that challenge and
opened up through the quarter to the eighth pole and had enough late to hold on for the win. SOUPER CLASSY tracked the early pacesetters through the
turn, was between runners entering the stretch and ran on gamely splitting foes to get second money. FOUR ACES HIGH stalked the pace on the rail,
angled out at the quarter pole and finished up well outside just missing out on the place award. HANDCARVED chased outside early, pressed the winner at
the three eighths pole and levelled out in the late stages of the race to hold for a minor placing. BIG EXECUTIVE was in tight between runners down the
backstretch, steadied at the five eights pole and through the turn and was not persevered with through the stretch. COMMANDER TOM trailed early and
was not a factor. SOUPER RIVER broke sharp and was reined back on the fence going into the turn, was steadied inside nearing the half mile and again
mid turn and never reached contention afterwards. MAAKWA appeared to lose his action entering the turn and quickly retreated through the field. BEYOND
BORDERS was advancing around runners mid turn and appeared to take a misstep and fell losing its rider.

Footnotes
CANDY OVERLOAD settled well back racing outside a foe, fanned seven wide into the stretch, took aim, rallied strongly to the fore a sixteenth from home
and drove past and clear. HAVE A SOUPER DAY settled off the leaders, swung out five wide turning for home, rallied to get up for second. TAKE A
CHANCE set a swift pace in the clear racing inside, weakened in the stretch. EPILOGUE settled at the rear inside, advanced past foes two wide in the
stretch and gained mildly to improve position. CONCEALED CARRY raced in the back half of the field off the inside, swung six wide into the stretch, evened
out in the drive. CREATE AGAIN pursued the pace outside three to four wide, had no late kick. STORMY SOUL chased from inside and failed to rally.
MALIBU SECRET chased from between runners early going two to three wide on the turn and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
MR CROWLEY took the lead going four wide around runners at the half mile pole, opened up entering the stretch, repelled a brief challenge at the quarter
pole and won going away late. RACE FOR PINKS held the lead briefly down the backside, was shuffled back a few positions on the rail into the turn, angled
out at the top of the stretch to mildly challenge the winner but could not gain through the lane and held well to be second. BOUND LUCKY settled mid pack
on the turn between rivals, angled out between horses in the six path turning for home and finished on end getting up for third. CHANCEL was on the fence
pressing for the lead around the turn, gave way to the winner at the quarter pole but still tried to run on through the lane and held on for a small share.
HADDASSAH'S DEVIL broke in at the start, was near the back while saving ground through the turn and was passing tiring rivals through the lane.
HIGHLAND SOCIETY was away alertly to track the pace between runners, advanced between horses entering the stretch but could not offer a run in the
last eighth. SUMMER SUNSET was outside of horses running four wide stalking in the second flight, angled out turning for home in the seven path and had
no finish. DROP A CARIBOU had the lead in the early stages, was headed and battled between runners into the turn, then began to weaken at the three
eighths pole and backed away on the inside through the stretch. ADELAIDE COURT was mid pack between runners down the backstretch, roused on the
turn and offered little for the drive. DR CHAPPELL stalked near the back through the turn, made a brief rally into the stretch and weakened the last eighth.
RIGHT TO STRIKE trailed early and was never involved. UNION COLONEL threw its head at the break, was five wide on the turn and could not get into
contention.
