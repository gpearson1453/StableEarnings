APPOINTED STAR saved ground setting the pace, responded to pressure and maintained a safe advantage. ONEFINEDAY vied for the lead from along
the outside, drifted out during the drive and held on well for the place. LIFE'S EMOTIONS was allowed to settle in stride while racing three-wide and was
gaining some ground late. LOVELY HUSSAR was unhurried early, moved up to come four-wide into the stretch, drifted in during the drive and finished
willingly. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL dropped back early, moved up along the inside on the turned, checked running up on Her Royal Duchess nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and went out to bump Guided by Angels, recovered to rally along the inside in the stretch but was in tight and lacked room the final
seventy yards when Lovely Hussar came in while suffering a rough trip. GUIDED BY ANGELS was forwardly placed early, was bumped hard nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and forced out by Ashley Beautiful and was unable to recover. HER ROYAL DUCHESS stopped after showing brief early speed. The
stewards conducted a review into the running of the race, but made no change in the order of finish.

DONTKISSNTELL was allowed to settle in stride early, raced three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch, caught You Go Girl in deep stretch and
prevailed narrowly under pressure. YOU GO GIRL set the pace from along the inside, drifted out slightly entering the stretch, responded when challenged
and lost a tough decision in a game try. LETS DECLARE PEACE was never far back while racing between horses, came three-wide into the stretch and
finished willingly. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch and then hung. MS LYNN
dropped back early and failed to seriously threaten.

placed form the start, rallied three-wide the final quarter mile, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place. OVERLY FAST saved ground on the
turn, angled out to come 4-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. MR. MISCHIEF was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and gained
some ground late. CURLING SECRET dueled for the lead from along the inside for a half mile and tired. EARS TO US hopped at the start to get away

Footnotes
SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was unhurried early, improved his position racing along the inside on the turn, angled out four-wide in the stretch and finished with a rush
to win going away. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY broke out, then moved up to duel with Windribbon for the lead from along the outside, shook clear entering the
stretch but was unable to resist the winner and just held on for the place. SPITTIN IMAGE saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to come three-wide
into the stretch and finished strongly. FIVE STAR GENERAL was allowed to settle in stride, moved up along the outside on the turn, was carried wide by
Heredia Boxer nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly when clear. FANTASTIC DAY dropped well back early, trailed to the field to the stretch, angled
out six-wide and finished full of run. KINGMEISTER saved ground while being unhurried, angled out for the drive and found his best stride too late. HOUSE
OF LORDS came three-wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. WINDRIBBON dueled for the lead to the stretch from along the inside and tired.
HEREDIA BOXER was prominently place early, got out nearing the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes

STANLEY RYDER saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch, could not reach the winner but finished well for the place.
PEQUENO MONTE saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished fast. INQUISITION broke awkwardly to get away
behind his field, rallied four-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI saved ground to the stretch, angled out for the
drive but lacked a rally. SMOKE AND BURN came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HASHTAG BAE saved ground setting the pressured
pace for three furlongs and tired. WHATSITTOYA was prominent for a half mile while racing two-wide and gave way.
