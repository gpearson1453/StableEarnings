Footnotes
LOOSE GOOSE settled comfortably to stalk the pacesetter, moved up two wide to challenge on the far turn, put a head in front turning for home, pulled
away under energetic handling and was ridden out. STRASBOURG was sent to the front between rivals entering the first turn, set the pace, showed the way
into the far turn, dueled with the winner at the quarter pole, was no match, then dug in gamely inside to earn the place spot. CRACK THE CODE raced two
wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and finished evenly. BOUSSAC was a bit reluctant to load and fractious, then off slowly and a bit awkward, rank
entering the first turn, settled off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and had no rally. CHANGING THE KARMA pulled early and was steadied in tight on
the rail entering the clubhouse turn, then raced off the pace inside and gave way.

Footnotes
SHARP AZA TACK dueled outside of POWER ATTACK in the opening furlong, then took charge and sped away, responded when roused turning for home,
drew off, widened and was ridden out. POWER ATTACK dueled inside for the early lead, then stalked, chased the winner on the turn, could not threaten
that rival and dug in through the lane to earn the place award. BART'S DREAM raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn and rallied mildly on
the rail. JEREMY'S JET chased on the inside, chased on the turn and weakened. FERRARI KID chased between rivals early, came two wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. DANGEROUS RIDE was pinched back and steadied at the start, then outrun. RUN HAPPY PAPPY chased three wide and faded.

for the place spot. PUNK ROCK GIRL bobbled at the break, chased two wide early, chased the leaders on the turn, came three wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. TE AMO raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. TWYLA raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and

Footnotes
SWING LOW trailed the field, moved up three wide entering the far turn, came two wide into the lane, closed willingly inside, ran to the front at the sixteenth
marker and drew clear. GOD IS LOVE pulled close up early on the inside, then stalked two wide, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, rallied between rivals in
the stretch and dug in for the place spot. GUN FOR SUCCESS set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled past midstretch, dug in
and was outkicked. READY TO FLY raced off the pace, four wide on the first turn, moved up four wide on the far turn, bid entering the stretch and then
weakened. FATIMA'S BLESSING raced off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. KARL CARES raced off the pace, had an inside trip and lacked a
rally. WILLY MC stalked close up three wide, bid two wide on the far turn, chased and tired. SUPPLY CHAIN was off a bit slow, had a three wide trip racing
off the pace and faded.
