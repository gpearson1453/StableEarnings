Footnotes
STARTWITHABANG rated outside a rival early on, edged up to take aim into the far turn, bid three wide outside TARGE approaching the stretch, seized
command soon after, was roused clear near the three sixteenths, widened under a drive then was geared down through the final seventy yards. TARGE
pulled her way clear leaving the chute and set a rated pace off the inside, dropped in towards the rail entering the turn, came under pressure once collared
past the three eighths, ceded to the winner in upper stretch, kept on with effort through the drive and was clear of the rest. SO GRACIOUS stalked inside,
dropped back some nearing the turn, eased out through the final furlong and continued trying while coming back to narrowly get the show. DIAL EMMA
REILLY , well back early, moved up three wide into the lane, kept on to mid stretch, flattened out late and was edged for the show. LIGHTFOOT MISS , off
the pace while saving ground, angled four wide under asking into the lane but lacked a rally.

hugged the inner rail on the far turn, swung outside in upper stretch and lacked the necessary rally. SCHOOLYARD BULLY , three wide the first turn, was
four deep on the far turn and failed to rally. CAIRO BOOGIE , three wide the first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch and weakened. MAKE WAY ,
taken to the inner rail after sprinting clear entering the backstretch, faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
BROTHER CONWAY edged up between foes early, gained a nice stalking spot three wide off the embattled leaders, came under pressure mid turn, bid four
wide outside the HOWARD'S ROCK soon into the lane, gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, met the outside challenge of NEVER SATISIFIED a
furlong out, exchanged a brush, rebroke to go clear from that rival and edged away under a drive. NEVER SATISFIED rated off the rail while not far back,
moved up between runners into the turn, circled four to five wide making progress into the stretch, advanced to be on near even terms with a furlong to go,
drifted in briefly under right handed asking and brushed with the winner, flattened out but remained clear for the place. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY lodged a
rail bid to engage HOWARD'S ROCK near the five eighths, dueled on a short lead into and around the turn, ceded command with a quarter mile remaining
but stayed on willingly. ICY MINISTER lagged back, angled five wide under a ride into the lane, straightened and had belated action. HOWARD'S ROCK
cleared early and set the pace off the rail, was hooked from his inside after a quarter mile, sparred, reclaimed a brief lead nearing the lane, could not resist
the winner past the three sixteenths and weakened. STREET LAMP saved ground early and failed to make an impact. GOLDEN GULLEY rated behind foes
early, came under a ride while saving ground mid turn but failed to respond. GRUNDER'S CALL , four deep forcing the early pace, failed to keep up into the
turn and retreated.

Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and was kept to his business in the drive. SAMUI SUNSET , in the three path
leaving the far turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. UNCLE ANDREW saved ground around the first turn, swung to the three path leaving the far
turn, moved up to second in mid stretch and continued willingly. PRETTY GOOD YEAR broke slowly, circled foes on the far turn, swung to the eight path in
upper stretch and passed tired foes. MISSIN THE BIG DOG , along the rail the first turn, raced between horses in the stretch and weakened. UP AGAINST
IT was no factor. GUNSLINGER (IRE) , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way. MOKHEEF was outrun. RESIDENT LIBERAL raced along
the inner rail on the far turn and was not a factor. BARDOLINO chased the pace outside the winner and gave way. SASSY KING was outrun.

Footnotes
RAD PAISLEY , confidently handled while contesting the pace inside of rivals early on, edged clear under rating nearing the lane, responded when asked
inside the three sixteenths and steadily widened under a drive. BIG TALL DAWG , between rivals early, dropped in and edged up along the rail around the
turn, got through to loom in mid stretch, failed to kick on with his stable mate but kept on willingly to save the place. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , three deep
nearing the half mile pole, took to rating then advanced three wide nearing the quarter pole, lacked a solid run through the final eighth but did continue with
effort. MAGIC MULE broke a step slow, raced off the pace two wide, shifted out in the drive and churned on. ABUELO PAPS lagged off the pace and raced
four wide leaving the far turn, angled six wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. RAISE A SPEIGHTS , three deep vying early on, pressed three wide
outside the winner nearing the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and weakened. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN stumbled badly at the break, moved
up four wide mid turn, chased into the lane then faded. HE'S ORIENTATE bobbled a few strides from the gate, held a slim advantage dueling between
runners past the half mile pole, ceded the lead soon after, chased and tired. LOVED AGAIN , along the rail with some early pursuit, failed to go on nearing
the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
CAVALIER CUPID broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, hugged the inner rail, was under urging in the drive and always maintained a clear advantage.
JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT lacked speed, was four deep leaving the turn and rallied outside horses. PUPPYMONKEYBABY saved ground around the turn,
angled to the two path in mid stretch and finished evenly. EPIC IDEA , well placed in the three path on the turn, failed to rally. FOGGY DREAMS raced in
the two path on the turn, swung out in mid stretch and was no factor. CATCHING THE WIND , in the two path chasing the winner around the turn, gave way
approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
SHOULDA HAD IT , in hand three wide stalking a contested pace, took closer order past the three eighths, responded when asked in upper stretch and
went after the leader nearing the furlong grounds, dueled, wrested a short lead inside the sixteenth marker then went clear at the wire. ROCK AND
FELLERS (ARG) drifted in at the break, corrected and took a slim early advantage, was joined from his inside and dueled with CONFUSION BABY BOY,
brushed with that one past the five eighths, edged clear past the five sixteenths, came under a ride soon into the lane, braced for a challenge nearing mid
stretch, sparred inside the winner then gave way grudgingly. CONFUSION BABY BOY came out a bit at the break and caused some bumping, moved up to
the inside of ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) nearing the five eighths, brushed with that one and disputed the pace, ceded the advantage leaving the far turn,
stayed on to force the issue around the turn, gave hard chase from the quarter pole and continued with effort to the wire. JAMMIN STILL , forced in some at
the break, advanced four wide leaving the far turn to gain a chasing spot, circled four wide into the lane, remained in touch to mid stretch then flattened out.
CAMP PENDLETON , in tight at the break, saved ground chasing the leaders, eased out in the drive but lacked a solid finish. ALBERTANO , bumped and
steadied at the start, dropped well back early on, shifted out through the drive and had belated action. THE GREAT DANSKY , in close at the break, edged
up between rivals to be in range into the turn, was asked off the rail mid turn and faded.
