by the furlong marker, then kept LIL LATIGO safe late to prove best. LIL LATIGO was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive and closed well
on the outside to be clearly second best. SALTIE FIRE tracked the early pace on the inside, then was shifted out on the turn and made a mild bid three to
four wide but flattened out. WINNIES OWN dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
RELIANT set a pressured pace on the turn and then was roused leaving the three sixteenths and drew off to prov much the best. I'M A GIRAFFE pressed
the early pace and was on the inside on the turn, was shuffled back on the turn, then came again willingly to be clearly second best. MIDNIGHTONTHENILE
chased the pace five to four wide and weakened, bested rest. HAUTE LADY stalked the early pace four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn, then
drifted out leaving the turn and was empty the final furlong. MISS LUCKY LADY was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and offered a belated
rally. CALI lacked a rally. HALEY WHO chased the early pace and was three wide by the quarter pole and weakened. LEAVE IT was on the inside and was
through early. K P MCCOVEY COVE was off slowly and failed to menace.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE IDEA came from between horses to go up and press the pace three wide, made a bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew
clear by the furlong marker and widened the margin to prove best under a drive. MINE THAT STAR was well placed and behind the pace setters on the turn
in the pocket, made a inside run leaving the turn but flattened out late, held place award. MR PAYTIENCE prompted the pace four wide and kept on but
needed more late. SLY was reserved early, came wide into the lane, had to steady to avoid horse being eased by the furlong marker and then had a late
rally. SWEET RIVER BAINES was allowed to settle, then was three wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE was allowed to
settle early, made a five wide move on the turn and weakened. CERNAN made a six wide move on the turn to move into contention the was pulled up by
the furlong marker and eased, vanned off. MIDNIGHT SPLIT set a pressured pace on the inside and folded. BURNZ DA BOSS chased the pace on the
inside and stopped.

Footnotes
ALLIE'S PAL dueled for the lead on the outside and made a three wide bid on the turn and slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. OVERTIDE
dueled for the lead inside of the winner and kept on willingly to be clearly second best. SHAME ON BEA was off a step slowly, then chased the pace and
was four wide on the turn, then was slowly gaining late, bested rest. QUICK TO FUSS was settled on the inside and then had to check hard around the
three eighths, shifted out and came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. RANGER MOLLY was off a step slow, then drifted in entering the turn
causing a rival to check up, then advanced three wide and lacked the needed rally. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was off slowly, then showed some late foot
while being no threat. WISHFUL WON lacked a rally. GRACEANNE was not a factor.
