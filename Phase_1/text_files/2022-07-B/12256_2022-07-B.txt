rail while pressed, kicked clear some at the top of the lane, battled and finished well. TRIGGER PULL Bothered by the loose horse at the three-quarter pole,
checked, forced the issue after that, chased into the lane, came back to challenge and finished well. DUCK POND ROAD Checked nearing the quarter pole
while in tight, altered out four wide after that, in hand along the three path, two path on the last turn and weakened. LE GROS BILL Well placed along the
two path, saved ground on the last turn and tired. LIGHTNING ROB Three path into the backstretch, trailed along the rail after that and tired. NO LIME

CAPE COD GEM Away best, showed the way along the rail with a lengthy lead and was ridden out proving clearly best. UNCLE VIC Tracked along the two
path, three path into the lane and finished best of the rest. GOD BLESS AMERICA Broke sluggishly, unhurried along the rail and then made a late bid
inside. GONNA BE DANCING Well placed four wide early, three path on the turn and tired. SUPPORT THE CAT Broke sluggishly, two path on the turn and
failed to threaten. SEA URCHIN Broke slow, four wide into the turn and tired. THUNDERING MARCH Ducked out at the start, saved ground on the turn,
was outrun. MAX FOR SHORT Broke slow, bore out into the turn, four wide out of it and tired.
