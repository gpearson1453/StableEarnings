Footnotes
TERRIFIC INDY stalked the pacesetter from a two path stance through the turn, was roused at head of stretch and wore down that rival in the final sixteenth
for the score. BAD AT LOVE hustled from outset and led the field through the bend from an inside pose, then was outdueled in the stretch duel. ROCKIN
RONI came away behind all rivals, angled out along the backstretch to advance on leaders, then trekked widest of all through the turn and rallied mildly for
the show. GODDESS OF WONDER was nipped for the show by rallying rival after giving chase from between rivals. NANA FAITH GLORY saved ground to
no avail.

Footnotes
STEPPIN SHEP broke alertly and set the early pace in tandem as the inner rival before inching away in the closing quarter for a clear victory. CANDY
BARON settled into the second flight while trekking three wide around the bends, advanced to challenge the front runner along the backstretch but proved
no match and finished second best. FROGGY failed to sustain the bid in the closing stages after pressing the pace from a two path pose through the
opening half. THE UNION FOREVER showed reserve and settled into the two path while chasing the pacesetting duo, then lacked a needed rally to
improve placing. NOMOREMRNICEGUY failed to menace while trailing from outset.

Footnotes
CHIM CHIM GEMINI chased the early pacesetter along the backstretch as the lone rival in second flight, tucked to the rail to save ground through the bend,
then slipped by on the rail and drew clear in final sixteenth for the score. DESTINY'S LOVE hurried from outset and established a ground saving stance and
first command, led the field at upper stretch but was caught by late charging rival near the sixteenth pole and forced to settle for place. HEY ROXY broke
alertly, rated mid pack, trekked the two path around the bend, and finished evenly. HELLO SUNDAY lacked a closing bid after giving chase to front runners
from between foes. SARAHS HOME settled into second flight, rounded the turn as the widest of three abreast and lacked a needed rally in final furlong.
RACHIE RACH failed to menace while trailing the field.

Footnotes
CHERISH THE DAY showed reserve around opening bend, moved to three wide inside the quarter pole and trekked that line around closing bend to circle
front runners and lead the field in final sixteenth for the score. DO ME A FAVOR tucked to save ground shortly after the break, maintained an inside stance
to upper stretch before angling out and rallying strongly in final furlong to earn place honors. GOSPEL GINA rushed from outset and led the field from outset
while saving ground but failed to fend off the late charge of top pair in final furlong. ON A SHOESTRING pressed the early pace from a three path pose,
gained command around the closing turn, led the field by slight advantage at upper stretch, but faded in closing strides. DA BEST WIFE EVER rated mid
pack through the opening half before tiring in the crucial stages of contest.

Footnotes
LONESTAR CHROME hustled away from outset and established an inside pose, set the pace in unison through the half and shook off all rivals in late
stages for a clear score. GRANITO DE ORO settled into the second flight through the opening bend, advanced along the backstretch to press the pace
through the half from a three wide stance, maintained that track through the closing turn and fended off rivals to secure the place. BORN TOUGH forced the
early issue from a three wide pose in the early strides, tracked two wide at upper stretch, but failed to match strides in closing sixteenth and was forced to
settle for the show. OFF AND BACK lacked a needed rally to improve placing to end a wide journey. SWAY BACK WHEN settled in behind rivals in the
early going, saved ground throughout and failed to gain on leaders in crucial strides. TECUMSE RED broke alertly, rated close up around the first turn and
steadily faded thereafter.

HIGH COST OF LIVIN was pulling away from rivals at the finish to end a ground saving, gate to wire victory. RIVER LIBERTY settled into second flight and
chased the front runner while trekking the three path, locked into a stretch for the place, and won that duel for the honors. WIREWIREWIRE chased the front
runner from a two path pose, rated in second flight throughout, and was nipped for the place after dueling in the homestretch with RIVER LIBERTY for the
place honors. AFLEET OKIE lacked a needed rally after settling into mid pack and angling out at upper stretch to no avail. SEXY RAGS failed to threaten
from a back rated position. SEE WHAT'S WHAT established a ground saving stance and failed to menace.

HES BIG CHIEF showed reserve from outset, traveled widest of all around the opening bend, circled rivals along the backstretch, locked into a duel at upper
stretch and shook off that foe in final sixteenth for a clear score. MAHOMEITE hustled from outset and established a ground saving stance, rated close up
through the opening half, locked into a stretch duel with HES BIG CHIEF, but was outdueled and proved second best. UNCLE O. G. stalked the pace from a
two path pose, rated close up along the backstretch, was forced to check just inside the quarter pole, and held on to the show in the end. GOSPEL DANDY
stumbled at the break, trekked the four path early, chased rivals through the half, and passed a tiring rival in late going. BENT TO WIN flashed early foot
and led the field through the opening quarter before steadily tiring in the crucial strides.

TOWN DRUNK hustled from the break and established first command and a ground saving stance, led the field through first call, was briefly headed near
the quarter pole, then came again and inched away in final furlong for the score. HOODOO BROWN settled into second flight through the opening half while
trekking three wide, closed the gap on leaders along the backstretch, maintained the three wide position around closing bend and proved second best in the
end. SMOOTH OPERATOR was unhurried in the early strides while saving ground, then angled out at upper stretch and rallied mildly to get the show.
HUNTER QUICK stalked the pace from a two path pose early on, gained brief command nearing the quarter pole, then rapidly faded in crucial stages.
KAT'S HITMAN trailed throughout and failed to threaten.

RAGAN'S JET stalked the early front runner from a three wide stance around the opening bend, gained command nearing the quarter pole, then drew off in
final furlong for a clear score. SNOWTRICK was unhurried and trailed the field through the half before circling rivals and earning the place with a furious mid
track rally. POLLY TIZ settled into mid pack and gave chase while trekking the three path, rated four wide at upper stretch and finished willingly. LA
MORENA gained mildly and improved placing in the late going to end a ground saving trip. SWEET MARY M came up empty and failed to sustain the bid
after stalking the early pace and leading the second flight at upper stretch. OKIE FRONT settled into mid pack as the inner rival around the opening turn,
rated three wide at upper stretch, and weakened in final furlong. CASINO QUEEN retreated rapidly after pressing the early pace from a two path position.
JUSTABOUTRIGHT travelled widest in the early stages before tiring in the crucial strides.

Footnotes
ACERTIVE MISS shared the early lead as the outer most rival of three abreast, then kicked clear in final strides for the honors. EVENING STORM got up for
the place after showing reserve early and swinging three wide at upper stretch. JESSIE'S VALENTINE pressed the pace from a two path pose, rated along
the inside at upper stretch then was nipped at wire for the place. SUNDAY'S VISION broke alertly, rated close up through the half and tired in closing
stages.
