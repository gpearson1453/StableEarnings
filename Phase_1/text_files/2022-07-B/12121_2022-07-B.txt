POST CLOSE stalked the early pace on the inside, then made a three wide bid on the turn, drew off in the stretch to prove much the best, driving. MAU
MAU was reserved early on the inside, came four wide into the drive and rallied well for the place award, no match to the winner. CAP ROCK MINER set the
pace towards the inside and was headed by the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. GUITAR SLIM was void of early speed and lacked a rally.
LUCKENBACHER chased the pace three wide and tired.

NAVAGATIONALBEACON stalked the early pace and made a three wide move and quickly drew clear, then drew off to prove much the best while being
ridden out. DON'T LOOK ETHEL was bumped at the start, then settled early two wide and finished willingly to be clearly second best, no match to the
winner. YES I'M A LADY was taken back early four wide, then was three wide on the turn and had a belated rally. CAJUN ACES was allowed to settle on
the inside and passed the tiring rivals. CANDY'S STORY stalked the pace four wide and weakened. WITCHY DEVIL was sent up the inside to set the early
pace and was headed on the turn and gave way. HOUSTON MIRACLE was outrun early while wide and never factored. CHATAIN'S EAGLE was bumped
at the start and failed to menace.
