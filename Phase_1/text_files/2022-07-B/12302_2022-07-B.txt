Footnotes
MAGIC GLASS was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight racing four deep on the backstretch, continued under patient handling while shifting
outside traffic racing into the turn, was fanned five wide midway through the bend, responded in upper stretch while coming under left handed pressure and
produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage from COUNTESS OF CAIRO to go clear nearing the wire. The latter joined the pace three deep in early
stages, pressed the issue racing into the turn, shook clear on the bend while angling to the inside, held sway on a commanding margin past midstretch but
couldn't contain the winner. MANHATTAN CHERRY tracked off the first flight inside foes in the opening stages, ducked out leaving the seven sixteenths
marker crossing the path of RUN BAMBI RUN, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter three deep to the lane but lacked the needed closing response.
RUSSIAN TOTHE WIRE, off a step behind the leaders, was prompted to a position tracking just off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, continued in
that path between foes losing position entering the turn, was held up in tight quarters momentarily racing into upper stretch, then shifted to the six path and
continued with late interest to gain some position. MO SMOKING was urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch and steadily faded
into upper stretch. KAMIKAZE BLUE, off slowly, was settled last while angling inside on the backstretch and never gained contention. LATEST
ATTRACTION broke inwards bumping RUN BAMBI RUN, was urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch and gave way racing into
the bend. FACCIA BELLA tracked off the first flight three wide between foes under light rating on the backstretch, jumped over RUN BAMBI RUN dislodging
her rider leaving the seven sixteenths marker, but was collected by the outrider following the race and walked off the course under her own power. RUN
BAMBI RUN, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, lost her path, then clipped heels with MANHATTAN
CHERRY entering the turn, falling to the track dislodging her rider but walked off the course following the race under her own power. FOLLOWING THE
RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE TURN AND DISQUALIFIED MANHATTAN CHERRY FOR
INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER LAST.

Footnotes
CANTERBURY GOLD broke readily shifting out at the start, set the pace a bit off the rail between call racing to the first turn, conceded the lead to attend a
rival's pace racing to the backstretch, moved readily when given her cue to wrest the advantage racing into the far turn, responded when called upon
nearing upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. THAT WOULD BE NICE was rated stalking just off the first flight
to the backstretch, was roused to advance on the leader nearing upper stretch but failed to gain terms with that foe while proving best of the others.
TANTIMA, off a bit slowly, tracked the leaders outside foes from just out of striking distance to the far turn, shifted out to the four path racing into upper
stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. GIVE EM SHADE angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved
ground to the lane but had no closing bid. REESE C shied avoiding the eventual winner at the start bumping CLARE CRESCENT, was reserved last to the
backstretch, then switched outside nearing the lane to pass some tiring rivals. ALL SING BABY, reluctant to load, drifted out racing into the first turn settling
off the second flight and never proved a serious threat. CLARE CRESCENT, bumped, then squeezed back at the start, was urged to gain the lead while
angling to the rail racing into the first turn, set the pace into the backstretch, gave way abruptly once headed by the winner racing into the far turn, drifted out
into the stretch and was gathered up by her rider through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BOB'S ALL IN, reserved last a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, split rivals after a half while being prompted to contention, angled to the rail racing
through the far turn, came through inside the pacesetter when presented an opening in upper stretch to challenge for command and wrested a clear
advantage late under firm encouragement. CANDY COVE, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the far turn, moved to challenge
that rival nearing upper stretch, continued to contest the issue three deep to midstretch and prevailed for the place honors late. DYNAMIC RULER broke
sharply, was urged setting the pace on a clear margin along the inside to the backstretch, dueled for command leaving the far turn while shifting off the
inside and yielded to the top pair late. MR. WHO, caught four wide racing through the first turn to the backstretch to track outside foes in second flight,
continued to make brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but had no closing bid. CONQUEST COBRA was rated between foes to the backstretch
and continued evenly into the stretch. LOLLY EXPRESS tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, was urged in brief pursuit of the
leaders to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM dropped out early.

Footnotes
WANDA STRONG, brushed at the start, raced three deep gaining terms with the leaders in the opening stages, angled to the rail racing through the first turn
tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position closing the gap on the leader racing through the far
turn, tipped outside that rival racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest command and go well clear under pressure.
CERULEAN switched outside a rival in the opening stages, was urged to gain a clear advantage on the first turn, set the pace along the inside through the
far turn to upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. WALK SOFTLY tracked off the second flight three wide in the opening half, then continued
willingly three deep between foes in the closing stages to prevail for a share. RATTLEME broke readily to gain a forward placing along the rail in the opening
stages, switched out on the first turn tracking the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to the far turn but came up
empty racing into the lane. WINTER MUSIC was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled inside on the far turn but had no
closing bid. DELUSIONAL DREAM, reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but made no
impact. BONES AND ROSES angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane. INNOVATE
settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT proved no factor.

Footnotes
WARRIOR BOSS raced three deep to the first turn while being rated off the first flight, continued outside a rival on the backstretch in that position, was
prompted to advance three wide on the far turn to wrest command racing into upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin under firm handling. CANDY
WOMPUS was settled last to the backstretch, switched outside rivals racing into the far turn gathering momentum, circled foes four wide wide into upper
stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. RUNAWAY READY was urged along the inside disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn,
lost position to the winner racing into the lane, then shifted out in the closing stages to prevail for a share between foes with a second effort. NORTH ARM
BAY tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, then continued evenly three wide between foes into the stretch. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA
was urged prompting the pace outside a rival to the backstretch, edged forward to a clear advantage leaving the far turn but faltered in the drive. OUT
RUN'M tracked the pace inside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch but gave way after a half. MAGIC REVOLUTION was rated off the second
flight along the inside, saved ground on the far turn and faded into the lane.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CURRENT was guided to the inside while being rated just out of striking distance tracking the leaders to the backstretch, tipped off the inside
while moving to striking distance nearing the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the far turn advancing on the leaders between rivals, wrested the
advantage in upper stretch and kicked away under firm encouragement. LOOKIN SO LUCKY was settled last along the inside to the backstretch, saved
ground on the far turn gathering momentum, tipped out entering upper stretch, then split foes three deep in the closing stages to prevail for the place
honors. SUMMER DAY tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance in tandem with the eventual winner
while caught five wide racing through the far turn, couldn't match the top pair in the drive but continued well enough to earn a share. KALLINIKI tracked off
the first flight just inside the eventual winner in the opening half, tipped off the inside nearing the far turn, briefly awaited an opening between foes nearing
upper stretch, then shifted to the rail while continuing with an effort to gain some position. MISS HARD KNOCKS, forwardly placed three deep attending the
pace in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes in that path racing through the far turn but came up empty leaving midstretch. BADGER KITTEN
tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, conceded some position under patient handling nearing upper stretch and continued evenly
four deep between foes late. IN THE RED was settled into stride racing a bit off the inside in the opening half, switched outside foes on the far turn, was
fanned five wide into upper stretch but made no impact. DISTORTED VIEW, in touch between foes prompting the pacesetter in the opening half, edged
forward racing into the far turn disputing the issue to upper stretch but gave out once headed by the winner. STARS OF BLUEGRASS, reserved along the
inside to the backstretch, saved ground gaining position on the far turn, was shuffled a bit in traffic racing into upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick.
HUNTER'S MAGIC settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. PLUMA was urged along the inside disputing the
pace from the outset to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN PINE joined the pace outside rivals leaving the chute, went clear into the first turn while shifting in, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn,
drifted out racing through the stretch but held sway to the end under firm encouragement. DEVOTED TO YOU, forwardly placed between foes, then along
the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside the leader, continued with a steady bid to challenge the leader nearing the lane but proved only
second best. WHERE'D THE DAY GO tracked the pace outside foes in second flight, advanced on the leaders three wide through the far turn to upper
stretch, couldn't close the gap on the top pair but prevailed for a share. MYSTIFIER, in touch with the leaders in the opening stages, was eased off the pace
racing into the first turn to track between foes, was caught in close quarters momentarily racing into the far turn but continued evenly between foes to late
stages. THIRSTY KISS broke out bumping at the start, was reserved between foes to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch but
made no impact. SAINT CHARLES broke in, bumping a rival, shifted to the inside while being steadied nearing the first turn, continued inside foes to the far
turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. STAR OF STARS, caught four wide racing into the first turn, shifted in crossing the path
of MALIBU CHANNEL on the first turn, continued three deep tracking off the second flight racing to the far turn, then faded into the lane. MALIBU
CHANNEL, caught in close quarters three deep between foes racing to the first turn, was steadied, then was rank racing through the first bend, settled out of
striking distance and continued evenly three wide between foes to late stages. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN, reserved along the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch but had no closing bid. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, bumped from both sides, then knocked back at the start, was caught wide racing to the backstretch
and proved no threat. EDGIE REGGIE switched outside rivals avoiding traffic racing through the first turn while settling in the last flight and never proved a
threat. HOLDENTIGHT, prompted to a forward placing along the rail, was steadied off the pacesetter while ducking a bit racing into the first turn, tracked the
leaders inside foes to the far turn, came up empty racing into upper stretch and was taken up in the closing stages. GOLDEN TRIBUTE, caught wide racing
to the backstretch, dropped out early.

Footnotes
SWEET HONOR was rated off the second flight three deep in the opening stages, was prompted to advance, then abruptly steadied between foes when
losing her path to CIRCULODEGANADORAS entering the bend, shifted out four wide on the turn while coming under pressure to advance and rallied to the
front in time under firm handling. SECOND GRACE, forwardly placed five wide attending the pace on the backstretch, shifted inwards entering the bend to
advance on the pacesetter three deep into the stretch, moved to challenge for command in late stages but was outkicked. TIZ WONDERFULLY, urged
between rivals, then along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the bend, edged clear into upper stretch but couldn't fend off the
top pair late. CIRCULODEGANADORAS tracked off the first flight six wide on the backstretch, angled in sharply racing into the turn crossing the path of the
eventual winner, then continued between foes just off the inside to the lane but had no closing bid. COUGER tracked off the first flight between foes in early
stages, was held up avoiding tight quarters entering the bend, then shifted to the four path racing into the stretch while finishing evenly. IKNOWYOURFACE,
urged between foes pressing the pace, gave way into upper stretch. BONITA RAPIDS settled outside foes in early stages and proved no threat. LADY
PHYLLIS made brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes and gave way into the turn. MAD TABBY, off slowly, was settled along the inside and never menaced.
FLYING BUSINESS flashed brief pace four wide between foes but gave way early.

Footnotes
NORTHERN WOODS angled inwards to gain terms with the pacesetter while pulling against restraint in the opening stages, prompted the issue to gain a
narrow advantage racing into the far turn, continued a bit erratically into upper stretch but edged forward and grudgingly held MARQUEE RIDE to the end
under firm encouragement. The latter was rated between foes tracking just off the first flight to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch
advancing inside the winner to challenge for command midstretch but was outkicked. SHINBORO, forwardly placed three wide to the backstretch tracking
just off the leaders, moved to press the issue in that path on the far turn and flattened out in the drive. BEHAVIN MYSELF settled outside a rival in the last
flight in early stages, advanced to contention four wide through the far turn into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. TOP DOG settled along the
inside early and failed to menace. SHATTERED DREAMS angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight and emptied out early.
HERECOMESTHEHAMMER broke sharply, pressed the pace along the rail from the outset to the backstretch and gave way after a half.
