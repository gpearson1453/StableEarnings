Footnotes
SHE'S KEEN broke so fast she lost her footing slightly, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace on the inside, responded well when asked coming
to the quarter-pole, extended the advantage in the two path while accelerating into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the
three-sixteenths, swapped back to her inside lead just inside the furlong marker and maintained a safe advantage while placed under a hand-ride to the
wire. FOREVER AFTER ALL broke in significantly at the start, went two then three wide around the opening bend, settled outside on the backstretch, was
given her cue in the three path on the final turn, chased outside of two foes into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place while unable to impact the
winner. INVENTING raced between horses in the two path into the first turn, dropped to the rail later on that bend, was rated while saving ground, came
under urging just inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner under a drive into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. AUNT
NAUGHTY was bumped hard at the start, went three then two wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the
far turn, chased between horses while still on her inside lead in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while remaining on her
inside lead to the wire. CINQ SOUERS broke in and bumped hard with a foe, went around the first turn in the three path, settled on the outside, was urged
along in the three path on the far turn then driven four wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. AMENSET bobbled at the start then was forced in,
dropped back against the rail while crowded by FOREVER AFTER ALL early, settled on the inside, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
LITTLE LINZEE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside getting set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong from home, dug in under growing threat to the outside and held on gamely to prevail. SOUFFLE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside through, got put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch under a drive, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final
furlong steadily gaining on the outside but was repelled to the finish. FANCYPANTS JULIANA three then two wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong out, then kept on
to preserve the show honors unable to keep pace late with the top pair. SHOWEMYOURHEELS got bumped solidly at the start by MOONAGE DAYDREAM
due to pressure from FRANKIE C and was forced to steady in behind SNOWY EVENING when that rival broke outwards taking over her lane, conceded
three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing
near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and showed good courage kicking on belatedly to the wire. MOONAGE DAYDREAM got
bumped solidly at the start by FRANKIE C and in turn bumped SHOWEMYOURHEELS before glancing off SNOWY EVENING who was breaking outwards,
chased three to four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish.
SLOW DOWN SUMMER stumbled at the start and came under coaxing to show the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing before being let out
taking the inside route at the quarter pole, dug in under threat from a host and was collared a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. BAD
SAMARITAN broke in awkwardly hitting the near side stall at the start and getting away last conceding four lengths to the front, raced greenly and erratic
early on darting quickly to be three to four paths off the inside before settling a bit better nearing the turn, raced greenly into the turn displaying some
climbing action while under light coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.
FLEETFOOTED coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, angled four wide into
upper stretch, dug in and weakened to the finish. SNOWY EVENING broke out at the start taking over the lane of SHOWEMYOURHEELS and trading a
glancing blow with MOONAGE DAYDREAM, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and
tired. FRANKIE C took and awkward step and balked inwards at the start bumping MOONAGE DAYDREAM solidly into SHOWEMYOURHEELS and
conceding a length to a length and a half to the front herself, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch
and tired.

down once straightened for the drive, responded well when put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and held under vigorous urging. LOST IN ROME was moving his head around at the start and broke a step slow, moved into third position
under urging, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and failed to overtake that foe while
clear for the place. AUBURN HILLS was sent hard to get the lead then showed the way with a clear advantage, vied inside on the turn, was asked under
heavy threat from the winner at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and weakened while clear for the show. SOMEBODY was hustled

TWO FOR CHARGING chased along the inside down the backstretch and into the turn until tipped to the two path near the five-sixteenths as CAPLETON
backed up along the rail, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge taking
command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. OCEAN'S RESERVE broke out at the start taking over the lane of the slow
breaking FULL COMPLEMENT, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and rallied to take
command at the three-sixteenths, inched away under a drive getting directed out three paths to look the aforementioned foe in the eye inside the eighth pole
and was collared at the sixteenth marker, then ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. CURLIN'S WISDOM stumbled at the start and
recovered to chase three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show
honors. SINFUL DANCER stumbled at the start and recovered under hustling to duel from the two path with CAPLETON to his inside, shook off his main
pace rival at the seven-sixteenths and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole under growing threat, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
confronted along the inside, yielded command with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the finish. COMPROMISER chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. FULL COMPLEMENT broke a beat slow without
incident, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three then two wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled out four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. DEVIL BOY got carried out a path at the start by OCEAN'S RESERVE who broke outwards,
chased four then three wide under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went six wide for home and tired in the stretch. CAPLETON coaxed from the gate,
dueled inside of SINFUL DANCER getting shaken off by that rival when under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
folded. PLEASE NOTE DUE TO AN ISSUE WITH A HIND SHOE CAPLETON RAN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY.

FEARLESS shifted from the rail to the three path around the first turn, moved out down the stretch for the first time, rounded the second turn in the two path,
was urged along passing the seven-eighths, shifted out under urging inside the three-quarter pole, was hard ridden in the three path around the final turn,
gained under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid coming to the sixteenth pole and got up under prolonged and strong urging to prevail. ORIGINAL
INTENT went three to four wide around the initial turn, moved out down the stretch for the first time, advanced to contest the lead passing the wire for the
first time, continued on the pace on the outside while in the three to four path, was urged along around the final turn, floated nine wide into the stretch before
being finally corrected by the rider with some left-rein pressure coming to the three-sixteenths, dropped behind LONE ROCK in the process, chased outside
into the final furlong, re-bid while well out in the track outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the winner to the wire and missed while clear for the place.
LONE ROCK was asked some leaving the gate, went to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, was urged along on the final turn, spun four
wide into the stretch, led under a right-handed crop into the final furlong, maintained a slim advantage to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while well
clear for third money. PORTOS dropped from the two path to the rail around the first turn, settled at the back while saving ground, came under urging before
the five-eighths and failed to respond. SHOOGER RAY TOO went three to four wide around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in
the two to three path around the second turn, dropped back under urging with five furlongs to run and retreated. THE MILE AND A HALF FRACTION WAS

prove much the best. THIN WHITE DUKE was taken in hand while briefly off heels early, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path,

the turn, gained five wide into upper stretch then took a short lead, led under a drive into the final furlong then was collared and weakened while clear for the
show then was vanned off after the race. IMMORTALIZATION broke out and bumped with an opponent, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied
along the rail on the turn, was headed at the five-sixteenths, spun off the rail into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and tired. LEGENDS

urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved out around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. BOSTON TEA

two then three wide around the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to get the lead inside the
three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. PIONEER SPIRIT was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the
outside, chased four wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. TIDE OF THE
SEA showed early speed, raced inside around the first turn, showed the way off the rail down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the far turn, lost
the lead inside the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into the final furlong and also proved no match for the winner then just lost the place while able to
get the show. OFFLEE NAUGHTY dropped well behind early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, gained three wide into

first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn, turned into upper stretch in the two path, chased behind foes into the
final furlong and weakened. RODERICK showed speed on the initial straightaway, went three wide around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the
outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated.
