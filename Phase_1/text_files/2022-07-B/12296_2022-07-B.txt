Footnotes
WICKED BLUE rated off of the early pace, gained ground while trailing on the second turn, was set down for the drive, split foes in mid-stretch, struck the
front nearing the sixteenth-marker and held safely at the end. QUE SERA SIR RALPH settled off of the pace, was roused four then five wide on the second
turn, advanced in upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages by the winner but kept on to secure second. PERSEVERANCE kept close attendance to
the early pace then dueled on the front end through the backstretch run and into the far turn, lost position in upper stretch, re-rallied and was outfinished in
the drive, while holding safely for third. EL TENAMPA was allowed to settle, made a three wide move nearing the quarter marker to come within aim, battled
with HAKUNUI to mid-stretch and flattened out late. HAKUNUI was sent to the early lead, dueled on the front end through the backstretch run, continued
that duel with PERSEVERANCE into the far turn, battled into upper stretch but could not hold off closing rivals and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
STAN THE HOT MAN was sent to the early lead, shook free from a pressing rival along the backstretch run, was confronted by PLAISIR nearing the quarter
marker, dueled with that rival to mid-stretch, exchanged several bumps with PLAISIR through the final furlong and determinedly won the nod on the wire.
PLAISIR stalked the early pace then advanced on the backstretch run, confronted STAN THE HOT MAN on the second turn, battled with that rival into
upper stretch, exchanged several bumps through the stretch with STAN THE HOT MAN and was gamely bested at the end, while clear of the rest for
second. TABLE FOR TWO stalked the pace four wide, gained ground on the second turn, was outkicked in upper stretch, was able to gain a bit of ground
on the top two in the final stages and was clear for third at the end. VINNIEBOB was up close to the early pace while saving all of the ground, lost position
on the far turn and weakened in the stretch run. RESERVENOTMET hopped then ducked in at the start, lagged through the first half-mile, was eased
through the stretch run and walked off under his own power. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE BUMPING INCIDENTS IN THE STRETCH
INVLOVING STAN THE HOT MAN AND PLAISIR, AND IN A MAJORITY DECISION THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE
TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT showed early speed while in hand, set reasonably quick fractions while pressed through the turn, shook clear in upper stretch,
drew off in the final furlong and was hand urged to the finish. MISTICAL SURPRISE lacked early speed, lost contact on the turn, gained ground in upper
stretch and made a good late rally to get up in the final strides for second. COUSIN NIECEY chased the pace, gained ground nearing the quarter marker,
was outkicked in the drive and was just edged for second in the final strides, while clear for third. PETE'S INFERNO was up close to the early pace, pressed
the pacesetter through the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. SLUMBERING BEAUTY was off a bit slowly, chased the
pace three wide through the turn and was outrun in the stretch.

MAJESTIC OOPS showed early speed and was up close to the early pace, advanced on the pacesetter on the turn, stayed within range in upper stretch,
vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and kicked away in the late stages. MATCHLESS chased the moderate early pace, came three wide to the
quarter marker while improving position, was outfinished in the stretch run but stayed on to hold safely for second. JERSEY STAR was hustled between
foes leaving the break and set the pace to the turn, was confronted by the winner nearing the quarter pole, held that rival at bay to mid-stretch and gave way
in the final stages, while clear for third. GENTLE JULIA chased the early pace, lost position while along the inside on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch
and did not offer a late rally. DANZING ROAD was off a bit slowly and lacked early speed, came three wide to the top of the stretch and was not able to
make a late impact.

Footnotes
MISS UNION broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, was set down for the drive, extended the lead in mid-stretch and
was ridden out in the final stages to be much the best. DULCE EMMA tracked the solid early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, was outkicked by the
winner in upper stretch and was no match for that rival in the late going but stayed on to be second best. CODE RIBBON chased the early pace to the turn,
came five wide to the quarter marker while running evenly through the turn, could not make headway on the top pair in the drive but passed tiring rivals in
the final furlong to get up for third. CARASYNTHIA ran close to the early pace and pressed the pacesetter through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and
tired in the final furlong. ORISSA lunged at the start then broke in and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground four wide nearing the
quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the late going.

Footnotes
BENGAL TIGER was fractious in the post parade, brushed LIGHT UP leaving the start, was asked for early speed and won the break, set solid fractions
through the turn, opened to a clear lead in mid-stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up but was kept to task to prevail at the end. EXQUISITE
LEGACY stalked the solid pace from the inside through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch to BENGAL TIGER, was able to close into that rival's margin in
the final furlong but could not reel him in and was second best in the end. IRISH WAHINE was a bit slow into early stride and trailed field to the turn, gained
ground nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, found her best stride late and was an easy third in the end. LIGHT UP was brushed at the
start, tracked the solid early pace, maintained position while three wide and up close through the turn, could not keep pace in the drive and weakened in the
final stages. LION'S LAIR stalked the early pace, lost ground four wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. NENE
ROMANO chased the pace outside of rivals, lost ground five wide on the turn and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BRITE TAN was hustled leaving the break and was forwardly placed early on, tracked the pace to the second turn, lost ground to FANTASTIC SECRET in
upper stretch, responded to firm handling in the final furlong and was up in the final strides to secure the win. FANTASTIC SECRET was sent leaving the
break and set the decent early pace, extended the lead in upper stretch to draw clear into the final furlong, was all out in the final yards and was nailed on
the line for the win, while holding for second. FIRE DIAMONDS was unhurried in the early stages, maintained a two wide path into the second turn, gained
ground in upper stretch, finished well in the final furlong and was not able to reel in the top pair but was clear for third at the end. MISS FLAWLESS (FR)
settled off of the early pace while not far back, came four wide into the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn to come within aim,
was outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a final response. BLUSHING BAY stalked the decent early pace, lost ground along the second turn and was
unable to produce a late rally. NICOLE GRACE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the opening stages, saved ground while
trailing into the second turn, shifted out to go three wide into the drive and showed good late interest while unable to threaten in the end. GRIGORO tracked
the early pace, lost ground on the second turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.
