Footnotes
DARK HEDGES tracked the pacesetter in early stages then roused three wide entering the lane, rallied to the front in the final sixteenth and edged away.
HIS GIANT sped to the lead out of the gate and held clear around the turn, hustled along two wide entering the lane, continued with the advantage a furlong
out then got overtaken late. SACRED OATH rated midpack along the inside then angled out leaving the turn, launched a three to four wide at the head of
the lane and ran on to secure a share. SUN SQUALL was forwardly placed in early stages, saved ground around the turn then gave way. HOLDING FAST
raced off the early pace, came two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. FIVE O ONE was not too far back in the opening quarter, flattened along
the inside around the turn and failed to kick on in the lane.

encouragement. LEGENDARY GIFT was forwardly placed in early stages and chased three wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and dug in
gamely to capture place. DIAL IT UP A NOTCH chased in close range around the turn, came two wide into the lane, ran on with interest and got edged late
for place. WINZE was not far back in early stages, saved ground on the turn then retreated. RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL chased three wide around the turn
and faded through the lane. RIVER VENUS stumbled awkwardly at the start and trailed in the back.

Footnotes
WELLER ROGUE was well rated siting off the embattled duo through the backstretch, picked up the pace around the turn, swung four wife into upper
stretch, dug in determinedly three wide and drove clear. SAW THE SUNRISE tracked the top pair through the backstretch then launched an inside bid with
three furlongs left to run, vied with CYCLONE MESA into the stretch, shook free in the final furlong then got overtaken by the winner. CYCLONE MESA
dueled for the early lead with WAKE UP ANGEL, briefly shook free then took on the challenge of SAW THE SUNRISE past the three eighths pole, fought
back into the lane then gave way in final stages. MALIBU BAY BREEZE raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. BLUEGRASS FLIGHT failed
to move into contention. TIK TOKER was never involved. WAKE UP ANGEL dueled for the early lead then pulled up around the turn and got vanned off
after the race.

LION HEART LEGEND vied inside of OL RED for the lead in opening stages, continued to battle for command into the lane, held a slight edge along the
rail, dug in gamely and prevailed. O'L RED dueled outside of LION HEARTED LEGEND in early stages and battled on into the lane, exchanged head bobs
with aforementioned foe in final strides and just missed. OLD TRAFFORD rated off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, edged closer then tipped
three wide and surged to the wire. COLD SNACK THIRTY raced in contention and chased three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the lane and ran on
evenly. THEGREATGENERATION raced four wide near midpack at the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and failed to kick on. FLY FIRST CLASS
chased three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. BOO BE RIGHT briefly vied for the lead then chased around the turn and tired in the drive.
BRADDOCK raced in the back, came three wide into the lane and had no response.

LANCELOT N ELAINE tracked the leader in opening stages then advanced to challenge PRAIROE WOLF for the lead around the turn, dug in gamely under
firm handling, shook free approaching the furlong marker and held clear. TEQUILA was unhurried and settled in the back of the pace, picked up the pace
late on the turn, came five wide into the upper stretch, finished strongly and captured place. PRAIRIE WOLF set a pressured pace in early stages then took
on the challenge of LANCELOT N ELAINE around the turn, vied into the upper stretch then yielded a furlong out and finished on equal terms for show. IT'S
ALL ABOUT JOE rated off the early pace, chased four wide around the turn, given cue entering the lane, responded, rallied and got up to finish on equal
terms for show. JUST JOHNNY hustled up along the inside around the turn, saved ground into the lane and lacked a rally. FORGIVEN was forwardly placed
soon after the start, chased the top pair around the turn then came up empty in the lane. COBYMEISTER showed brief response in early stages then
steadily retreated. WIN IN THE CITY launched a three wide bid mid-way around the turn, briefly gained position then retreated.

REBEL RISING set a pressured pace in early stages and held a slim lead over KAYLA around the far turn, saved ground turning for home, responded under
pressure, widened to a commanding lead and finished ridden out. KAYLA vied for the lead with REBEL RISING on the first turn then pressed the pace up
the backstretch, continued in striking range around the far turn, failed to move on with the leader in the upper stretch but stayed on and finished clearly
second best. AUTUMN ASPEN stalked the top two leaders up the backstretch then urged four wide into the upper stretch and churned on for a share.
RAISIN RAISIN broke out and bumped with BOGMONEYHUNNY at the start, rated off the early pace, urged inside around the final turn and had no
response. BIGMONEYHUNNY was a step slow the got bumped outward at the start, was a bit keen while rated around the first turn then settled, had no
response when called upon and steadily retreated.

then evened out. TOUGH COMPANY rated off the pace, made a move late on the backstretch gained closer contention around the far turn, raced in traffic a
furlong out then angled in and ran on evenly. WILLTOBELUCKY lacked speed and trailed in the back, saved ground then came three wide into the lane and
had a mild improve. PINSON dueled for the lead around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle into the upper stretch then came up empty
