going away. COMMAND SGT MAJOR was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up three-wide to join the leaders nearing the half mile pole, took the lead
in the stretch but was unable to resist the winner late. DYF saved ground stalking the pace, steadied nearing the half mile pole in traffic, dropped well back,
angled out during the drive and was making up ground late. IRISH TERRIER dueled for the lead from along the inside into the stretch and weakened slightly
late. CANDIED LUTE vied for the lead from between horses to the stretch and tired. PULPITS POWER was forwardly placed to the stretch but lacked a

Footnotes
LE TUB was never far back while racing along the inside, slipped through entering the stretch, took the lead and gradually drew clear. HEAT SEEKING
LETA was unhurried early, rallied three-wide into the stretch angled in during the drive and finished strongly. QUEEN BREEZY was allowed to settle while
racing three-wide on the turn, came 5-wide into the stretch then drifted in slightly nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally. BLOWING BAYOU
prompted the pace while racing two-wide, was carried out by Judicial leaving the three-sixteenths pole, was briefly in tight nearing the eighth pole and
finished willingly when clear. JUDICIAL saved ground setting the pace, drifted out nearing three-sixteenths pole and tired. SLEEPY SUE was forwardly
placed while racing between horses for a half mile and gave way. The stewards conducted a review of the race, but after viewing the films made no change
in the order of finish.

RED NOON RISING unhurried early, moved forward along the outside on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and finished with a rush to be up in the
final strides. MEAN SHARON set the pressured pace while saving ground, responded to pressured and just failed to last. DANIEL THE DREAMER was
allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and was making up some ground late. MISS KITNESS vied for the lead racing two-wide while in
hand, but lacked a response when called upon. LAKER JET dropped back early while saving ground, slipped through to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole
and then flattened out. JUSTA POPPIN came three-wide into the stretch and was not a factor. TEASPOON OF PEPPER dropped back early and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
FEATHER INTHE WIND saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly leaving the three-sixteenths pole and was fully extended to just last. LUTES LIL
GIFT saved ground stalking the pace, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly to just miss. TAM TRICKY prompted the pace from along the
outside, but lacked the needed late response. N P FORTY broke out, then dropped back, came five-wide into the stretch and found is his stride late. SHARP
CURVE raced three-wide on the turn, came in nearing the eighth pole and failed to threaten. SACAGEWEA was carried out at the start by N P Forty, then
raced four-wide on the turn to improve her position and then was taken in hand late. IT'S CURLIN TIME saved ground throughout, moved closed during the
drive then steadied when Sharp Curve came in and finished willingly when clear.
