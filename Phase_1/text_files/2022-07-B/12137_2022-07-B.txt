Footnotes
DOWN ROYAL was reserved while saving ground and traveling comfortably, moved out after fence seven, went four wide around the final turn, chased the
runner-up into upper stretch, moved in inside the furlong marker and closed well to get up in the final strides. CHIEF JUSTICE (GB) saved ground while
rated under a tight hold, was taken up some landing over fence seven, made a bid between foes around the final turn, moved clear outside the quarter-pole,
drifted out in upper stretch, led to the final strides but was caught while able to get the place. FRENCH LIGHT (FR) hit fence one at the rear of the field, was
unhurried at the back, came under strong urging on the final turn and finished willingly for the show then was vanned off in distress after the race.
HISTORIC HEART (IRE) was reserved off the pace in the two path, stumbled landing over fence seven and failed to respond. REDICEAN (GB) was rated
off the pace, had the rider adjust his left iron after landing over fence five, led over fence seven, vied between foes on the final turn, dropped back outside
the quarter-pole and tired. IRANISTAN raced up close while jumping okay, led over fence five, was urged along while inside on the final turn and faded.
PISTOL WHIPPED (IRE) showed in front early, struggled over fence three, jumped out badly and lost position over fence five and faltered then was pulled
up on the third turn before being vanned off while reported to have bled.

Footnotes
MARIAH'S FORTUNE broke out a step at at the start trading a bump with BACKED BY GOLD, who broke in a step, chased just off the inside until tipped
three wide at the five-sixteenths under coaxing, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the leader to the outside and
seized command just outside the sixteenth marker, then inched away kept to task. BACKED BY GOLD broke in a step at the start trading a bump with the
aforementioned foe, prompted the pace of U CANT HANDLE THIS from the outside three then two wide advancing placed to coaxing to take over the front
with three furlongs to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, ran on well clear of the rest for the
place honors. HOLIDAY JAZZ hustled from the gate, darted out from along the inside to be six paths off the inside with six and a half furlongs to run, chased
five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals while never
threatening the top pair. U CANT HANDLE THIS hustled from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from BACKED BY GOLD
to the outside, had that rival advanced and was headed for command at the three-eighths while coaxed along, cut the corner into upper stretch in retreat
and weakened. INFRINGEMENT seven paths off the inside early on, tucked five wide at the five-eighths before making her way four then three wide into the
turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and continued to tuck in to the two path, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact. BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
AUNT VIRGINIA broke out and bumped with a rival, settled on the outside, tracked four wide around the turn, was roused coming to the quarter-pole then
came five wide into upper stretch, pursued the runner-up on the outside while under a drive into the final sixteenth, gained determinedly late and got up to
narrowly prevail under strong handling. IZEAMALIBUMOON stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path around
the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was roused into the stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied in the shadow of
the wire while clear for the place. CHIARA was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the
quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. GALLEY HEAD was recalcitrant behind the gate, bumped with a
foe while forced out at the start and was off a bit slow, was urged along while last but one, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch,
drifted out under a left-handed crop around the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. WHITE HOT was hustled to the lead, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside while challenged on the turn, lost the advantage to the runner-up outside the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong
and tired. SEA MONSTER hit the outside of the gate at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide while
asked late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out, swapped back to her inside lead near the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the
needed response. SEEMS TO WHISPER was carried out at the start and off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, angled in at the back under urging, saved
ground around the turn, came off the rail into the stretch and failed to threaten.

edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS hard held forwardly placed just off the inside early on,
tracked the leader just off the inside until tucked to the pocket half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. INSTINCTIVE chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide
for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. OUT OF SIGHT chased along the inside, got let out tipped three wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. SWEET FRANNY LU along the inside through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive and was out-finished. A BIT
O'IRISH SASS three wide through the first turn, raced forwardly placed under rating three then two wide, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper

Footnotes
LEAVE NO TRACE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide around the turn, gained to take the lead in the five
path into the stretch, kicked clear while moving in some around the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage under a right-handed crop into the final
furlong, was kept to the task into the final sixteenth then eased up late while much the best. STELLAR LADY was urged along off the pace, went three then
four wide around the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. U GLOW GIRL disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied
along the rail while still inside those opponents on the turn, was asked for more inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and
weakened but held the show. DARKNSTORMY was sent hard from the start, raced off the pace under urging, went four wide around the turn, lugged in
nearing the furlong marker and failed to threaten. OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS hit the inside of the gate at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four
wide on the turn, moved out in the final furlong and was no factor. WHATCHAMACALL was backed out of the gate then reloaded, pressed the pace on the
outside of two foes, vied in the three to four path around the turn and tired. NUMERO SEIS showed good speed, contested the pace loosely between
horses, vied in the two path while still between horses on the turn, dropped back under the crop into upper stretch and capitulated. CALLIE'S PASSION was
hustled from the start, moved off the rail while ridden along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to respond. SHAYMYNAME was
taken up with a tug of the left rein after the start, raced at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and never reached contention.

HAPPY FARM three wide in aim of the leader, advanced on that rival from the three-eighths to get on near even terms when spinning four wide into upper
stretch set down for the drive, dug in knocking heads through to near the sixteenth marker when taking command, then edged clear to the finish kept to task.
ARISTOCRATIC coaxed from the gate, vied briefly before emerging with sole command lightly coaxed along just off the inside, came under increasing
pressure from the outside by the aforementioned foe through the turn and went three wide at the top of the stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to go,
dug in clinging to the front and was collared just outside the sixteenth pole, ran on clear for the place honors. WENDELL FONG coaxed from the start,
chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors.
SHADOW MATTER hustled from the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened
in the late stages. COPPER TOWN hustled from the gate, showed brief speed along the inside, came under light coaxing taking the inside route into upper
stretch, tired in the drive. PRINCE JAMES two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home,
made no impact. MAGNIFICENT CHROME five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and

SMASH TICKET established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and held on to prevail. BETSY BLUE got bumped at the start by
HONEY MONEY, who broke outwards then got bumped again solidly by ELOQUENT SPEAKER due to pressure outside from MISCHIEVOUS DIANE and
conceded three lengths to the front, chased four then three wide from near the rear before advancing to mid pack through the latter portion of the turn under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, closed well through to the finish showing good courage to threaten for it all late but missed with
too much to do. SHORT SUMMER DRESS coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and ran on to preserve the show honors. PIECE OF MY HEART

then five wide down the backstretch, continued in the overland route through the turn coaxed along at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and
kept on to the finish. SECRET LOVE four to five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. MISCHIEVOUS DIANE got bumped at the start by PIECE OF MY HEART and in turn bumped MOVIE MOXY into ELOQUENT
SPEAKER against pressure inside from HONEY MONEY bumping out BETSY BLUE, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide for home and weakened. ELOQUENT SPEAKER got bumped between foes at the
start conceding three lengths to the front, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FAR AWAY LOVE (ARG) chased three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.
HONEY MONEY broke out at the start bumping BETSY BLUE into pressure coming inwards from PIECE OF MY HEART and MISCHIEVOUS DIANE,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, spun three wide for home and made no impact. MOVIE MOXY got bumped between foes who
each came her way and was pinched back at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front, raced seven paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then four wide through the turn, continued four wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
BLINDING LIGHT pressed the pace of RUGGED UNION from the outside three then two wide, took over command just outside the quarter pole and got set
down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under challenge a furlong out, rebuffed that rival to inch away in the late stages
and prevail. SUPER QUALITY coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, offered up a bid latching on the aforementioned foe a furlong from home, then got repelled to the finish while clear for the place honors.
JURKOVEC three wide in pursuit, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch
and kept on to secure the show honors. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and improved position to the finish. RUGGED UNION cut the pace along the inside under pressure from BLINDING LIGHT to the outside, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. KOBE'S LEGACY chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. BIG WOO chased just off the inside under a
ride from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, made no impact. NAKED AND FAMOUS four then three wide just off the top pair, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.
