MORE HONOR vied to the turn, drew clear and extended the lead while ridden out. CHEF was void of early speed, bid along the rail, closed steadily and
got up for place while no threat to the winner. PARLEY STREET raced close to the turn, lacked the needed late rally and was clearly best of the rest.
HARROVIAN showed speed to the turn and flattened out. THEY'RE GRRREAT showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

a further rally and was no match for the winner. UPTOWN RHAPSODY bumped and was crowded at the start, was never far back, put in a steady effort and
earned show. LIP'S OF WINE broke out and bumped at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. JOY IN THE BATTLE pressed the pace to the turn,

MISCHIEVOUS EFFORT set a pressured pace, swung wide leaving the turn and drew off in the drive under mild urging. STOLEN HALO raced close to the
pace, was taken outside, swung wide leaving the turn, bid, hung and finished second best. LADY M pressed the pace, was carried out on the turn, bore out
through the stretch and held for show. FACE OF GRACE advanced inside on the turn to get within striking distance, lacked a response and failed to
threaten. SHE'S BLUE DIAMOND had brief speed only. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA was not a factor. SWEET LADY LANA showed little. SHE'S BLUE
DIAMOND raced for purse money only. Hand timed.
