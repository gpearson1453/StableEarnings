CLASSIC LEAH sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace and maintained a safe advantage. QUEEN BREEZY was prominently placed while
racing four-wide and finished well to earn the place. BLOWING BAYOU was close up from the start while racing two-wide, lacked a late response but
finished willingly. WILLING TO BURN was bumped at the start by Le Tub, then was allowed to settle while racing along the inside, angled out for the drive
but lacked a rally. LE TUB broke out to bump Willing to Burn at the start, then moved up to be forwardly placed for a half mile and gave way.

MISS KITNESS broke in a tangle to get away behind her field, rushed up between horses to prompt the pace while two-wide, took the lead nearing the
sixteenth pole and gradually edged clear. DANIEL THE DREAMER was unhurried early, improved her position along the inside on the turn, angled out for
the drive and finished fast. MEAN SHARON bobbled slightly at the start, then moved up to set the pressured pace racing along the inside, but was unable to
stay with the winner late. CLOCHARD STREET settled in the middle of the field, came four-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. TOP HAT HIGH
JINKS stalked the pace while racing three-wide but lacked a response when called upon. TEASPOON OF PEPPER dropped well back early and failed to
seriously threaten while saving ground.

Footnotes
SADIE'S SNOWSTORM prompted the pace while racing three-wide, took the lead leaving the quarter pole and was ridden out through the stretch to
increase his advantage. LASSIE CAT was allowed to settle in stride early, rallied five-wide into the stretch, could not reach the winner but was clearly
second best. FIRST TIME PLAYER vied for the lead to the quarter pole while racing two-wide, was unable to stay with the winner but held on fairly well for
the show. ALY'S NATION was off a step slow, then saved ground while being unhurried, angled out for the drive and found her best stride too late. STEEL
NERVES disputed the pace from along the inside for a half mile and tired. SHIRL'S HOUSE showed brief speed from between horses and gave way.
HELLS CROSSING dropped back early and was not a factor.

GABBY HAYES set the pace racing in hand while slightly removed from the inside rail and maintained a safe advantage. MAYHEM AND CHAOS prompted
the pace while racing two-wide, angled in for the drive and finished well. AMERICAN BUDDHA hopped at the start to get away behind the field, then moved
up three-wide to prompt the issue but lacked a late response. NORTHERN BLEND was close up early while in tight racing along the inside, steadied
nearing the three-eighths pole trying to get out and gave way.

Footnotes
MO CONNELLY was closed up while racing three-wide, caught the leader in deep stretch and proved narrowly best under pressure. I AM YOURS saved
ground while being allowed to settle in stride, angled out nearing the eighth pole, split rivals and finished strongly to just miss. AWESOME DAZE saved
ground setting the pressured pace, dug in during the driver but was unable to hold off the top two late. LA POPIS was reserved off the early pace, moved up
four-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid, then flattened out and finished in a dead-heat with Moscow Lady for fourth. MOSCOW LADY raced
between horses early, was shuffled back and steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out to come five-wide into stretch but was unable to
recover and ended up on even terms with La Popis. SARA'S FINALE prompted the pace from along the outside for a half mile and tired.

pace, angled out for room entering the stretch but was unable to reach the winner in a good effort. UNSINKABLE MOLLY B dropped back early, saved
ground and was making up ground late. JACANA was bumped at the start then unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally.
SUDDENLY WINNING broke in to bump Jacana, moved up between horses on the backstretch, offer a 3-wide bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened
out. WEGOTTODRINKING showed early speed while racing four-wide and gave way before going a half mile.

BAIN stalked the pace racing along the inside, angled out nearing the stretch, offered a bold bid nearing the eighth pole but was unable to get by the winner.
BOBBY BUCKETS was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished willingly. LOVE THAT KID improved his position racing long the inside nearing
the stretch, angled out late and finished in a mild rally. HERMISTON was prominently placed while racing four-wide but lacked a rally. DANNY ZUKO was
climbing early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. VALIDATE bobbled at the start and failed to menace.
