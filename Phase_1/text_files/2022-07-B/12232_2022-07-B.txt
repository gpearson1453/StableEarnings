SWEET BELEN broke sharply clearing the field widening the lead through the turn into upper stretch showing full of run there under vigorous hand urging.
TANTARA well back early showed life nearing the quarter pole cutting the corner to upper stretch responding along the rail there saving place. SUPER
DONNA G unruly from the paddock was coaxed onto the track, once settled was sent hard pursuing through the turn angling out after being dispatched by
the winner in upper stretch hanging late to miss place. LEGENDARYS FIRST raced evenly off the pace to upper stretch finding no rally in the two path
there. ALGODONAL was never involved.

SWEET TASSA pressed to lead early edging clear on the turn moving in the three path upper stretch angling out past mid track under left hand urging
holding rival gamely late. NORTHERN TRANSIT pressed early chasing on the turn vying hard in upper stretch moving out as the leader angled bearing
down late to no avail. MILLIE chased early then dropped off the leaders on the turn racing evenly in the three path down the lane to hold the others well
safe. CONSERVATVE VALUES was never involved. AWESOME EVIL reared up briefly missing the break. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF
NORTHERN TRANSIT AGAINST THE RIDER OF SWEET TASSA CLAIMING INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN WAS QUICKLY
DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

MILTON rallied on the turn racing four wide into upper stretch vying evenly the final eighth. GATTO MARRONE chased the pace through the turn then wore
down in upper stretch. NO TOLERANCE was always outrun. DAHTESTES HERO showed early speed taking a stutter step near the half mile pole pressing
through the turn wearing out in upper stretch.
