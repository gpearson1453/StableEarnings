Footnotes
COJO away cleanly, not asked for speed and easily cleared paceless field, continued clear through the turn, entered stretch cleared, asked right handed
and held safely under a diminishing lead. JOURNEY CAKE away cleanly, settled for a tracking off the rail position, continued off the rail on the turn, spied
leader throughout on the turn and entered stretch in the four path, asked and responded while gaining on the leader to the wire. SURPRISE FASHION off
slow, settled for a three wide stalking position on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn and into the stretch in the five path, asked in the stretch
and rallied well to miss second. SHARP WARNING away well and hustled for speed early, failed to go on with the leaders and had to settle for a stalking in
between position, continued in between on the turn and bid along the inside entering the stretch, asked and outfinished in the lane. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF
stalked along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, began to lose ground late in the turn and failed to respond in the lane.
