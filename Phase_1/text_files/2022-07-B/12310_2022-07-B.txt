under a drive and held on under steady handling. ANAITA settled off the early pace, advanced from path three on the turn, made a strong move under
urging the last furlong, took over second inside the final sixteenth and came up short for the win. REINA DE LA ROSE broke alertly, was settled back, rallied
from inside in the stretch, gained second inside the final furlong, altered out for a clear path with a sixteenth left and was outfinished for the place. G
MONEY LIV was sent to set a pressured pace from inside, did not stay with HALLIE'S RAINBOW on the bend, angled outside that one with two furlongs to
go and flattened out the last eighth. BACKSTAGE BAMBI chased from inside, came off the rail some for the stretch run but had no late bid. LITTLE

LORI ATTACK broke alertly, soon shared the lead from outside, took over when asked two wide on the turn then steadily opened up under a drive in the
stretch. SILVER EYES pressed running widest, progressed three wide on the bend, rallied in the stretch and caught SWEET FRAULEIN for second late.
SWEET FRAULEIN soon vied for the lead between rivals, did not keep up from inside on the turn and gradually wore down the last eighth. TENSE
prominent from the beginning, advanced two wide on the turn and found best stride too late between rivals the final furlong. MOON PIES IMAGE moved
toward the inside midway on the backstretch, lost ground four wide through the bend, weaved out and in a couple times in the stretch but showed a
willingness to run the last eighth. MORNING LINE NEWS steadied behind traffic briefly leaving the chute, was just off the inside on the turn, fanned out
some for the stretch run and had no late bid. BUGSY'S WAVE RYDER disputed the pace from inside but gave way on the turn.

BEING CREATIVE rated from outside, picked up her pace after a half mile, came into contention on the second bend, angled in nearing the end of six
furlongs, gained the lead upper stretch and drew away under a drive. SHINE DOWN was bumped hard at the start then bumped with LEA'S DREAMER,
quickly recovered to gain the lead, lengthened command on the backstretch, stayed off the rail into the second bend, drifted out badly leaving that turn and
entering the lane, lost the lead as she drifted out further upper stretch, held a straight path the last furlong and proved easily second best. AMARI S. raced in
contention from inside, failed to keep up two wide on the second turn, gained third midstretch then could only maintain her position late. LEA'S DREAMER
bumped after the start, soon trailed running widest and only passed a couple tired rivals the last eighth. MY LADY SLEW prompted the early pace from
outside, had the rail on the second turn and flattened out for the stretch run. ARCTIC TEARS broke inward, bumped hard with SHINE DOWN, was settled
inside, swung out some for the drive and failed to have a significant response.

Footnotes
YOU'RE IN COREY caught in close quarters just after the break, bumped several times with BLAZEN ROAD leaving the chute, advanced four wide, was
put to urging from outside on the bend, rallied the last furlong, took over with a sixteenth to go and began to draw off in the waning yards. CRANKSHAFT
took the lead before finishing the first sixteenth, showed the way just off the inside, began to wear down inside the final eighth but was clearly second best.
MON AMI FUZZIE settled at the back, moved to the outside midway on the backstretch, began to close the gap from path three on the turn, lost
considerable ground floating out to path six for the stretch run and passed tired ones the last furlong. STORMIN EL PRADO broke alertly, was soon chasing
CRANKSHAFT from just outside then flattened out for the drive. AHEADOFTHEGAME well placed from inside, began to fade before finishing three furlongs.
BLAZEN ROAD bumped several times with YOU'RE IN COREY leaving the chute, raced in contention from outside but also faded on the bend. SIRCORRI
boxed in behind the leaders on the backstretch, did not keep up between rivals on the turn, regained a striking position along the rail upper stretch but could
not sustain his bid late.

Footnotes
WILD WES stalked the early leader from just outside, took the lead when let out on the bend, widened command with little asking upper stretch, was under
steady urging the last furlong and held sway. INDIAN SIGN forwardly placed from outside, was bumped repeatedly nearing the turn through midway on the
bend, was three wide leaving the turn, floated out some as he gained second upper stretch, was corrected, drifted out midstretch, was again straightened
then lugged in as he closed the gap on WILD WES through the waning yards. READY REDDING hesitated then bobbled at the start, was settled inside,
commenced his bid on the turn, swung out widest into the lane, took over third inside the last eighth, made up minor ground on the top pair in the late going
but was easily best of the others. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD displayed early speed, was overtaken from outside on the bend and gave way through the stretch.
DAY IN THE COUNTRY was boxed in and looking for a clear path on the backstretch, altered out some after a quarter mile, bumped INDIAN SIGN
repeatedly to midway on the turn, began to yield nearing the end of four furlongs and faded for the drive.

Footnotes
ABSTRACT PAYNTER away slowly, was urged along leaving the chute, came into contention five wide on the turn, under a drive upper stretch, engaged
FIXICO inside the last eighth and edged ahead under hand urging the final sixteenth. FIXICO raced in contention from outside, was four wide taking the
bend, gained a narrow lead between foes midstretch, was all out the rest of the way but did not have enough left. RAHFEE TOWN chased the early leader
from just outside, took the advantage leaving the turn, was soon challenged from outside and gradually wore down inside the final furlong. STOSH was an
early factor between rivals, two wide on the bend, moved out widest upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed pressure with a furlong to go, held a straight
path inside the last sixteenth, was closing late and narrowly missed third. W W RUSSIAN GOLD well placed from inside, did not keep up entering the lane,
angled out some upper stretch and continued to fade. CHANGE DIRECTION unruly in the gate, was also away slowly and failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip. KING TITO broke alertly, was hustled clear of the rest, showed the way just off the inside, was put to a drive when challenged on the
bend and gave way the last two furlongs.
