Footnotes
DIAMONDSINHEREYES set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. KRZ SOCIETY showed
speed from the outside and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. EIGHT SPEED was up close and roused
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. J M R BOLD VISION settled off the pace and saved ground on the turn but needed
more. LAXMI was hustled early but chased on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER
ON LAXMI AGAINST DIAMONDSINHEREYES FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE GOING INTO THE TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
REIGN BY REIN stalked the early leader, dueled on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. NEW YORK
COMMANDER tracked the early leaders, had a good position on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. CEEBETT'S
BOW was unhurried early, roused from the inside on the far turn and finished well. QUIET ASCOT was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. CRUMLIN BIRD set the pace and dueled on the far turn but gave way at the top of the stretch.
DELIGHTFUL DREAMER was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention. HONEY GIRL was well back, showed nothing and was never a
threat.
