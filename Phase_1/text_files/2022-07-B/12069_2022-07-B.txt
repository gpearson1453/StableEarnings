Footnotes
DAMASCUS GATE sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear racing through the turn, responded under pressure in the upper stretch, widened to a
clear advantage and kept to task. COLD AS YOU urged inside around the turn then angled out approaching upper stretch, sustained a steady bid through
the lane and finished clearly second best. BAYLEYWICK was forwardly placed in opening stages and hustled along two wide through the turn, came three
wide into the upper stretch and churned on for a share. VICTORY BOLT raced in early contention and chased three wide around the turn then gave way.
SHIPS JEWEL reared in the air at the start and spotted the field several lengths, raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and had no response.

WHO'S BIG DADDY lacked early speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn, continued to gather up ground along the inside in stretch, dug
in gamely and got up in time. LURCH was away alertly, cleared the field and crossed over to the inside, showed the way through the backstretch then vied
inside of COLORFUL NATIVE around the turn, shook clear turning for home, held clear a furlong out then got edged in final strides. BRAVO KOLT chased
the pace along the inside then angled out three wide around the turn, sustained response into the lane and cleared the rest. COLORFUL NATIVE was
forwardly placed in opening stages then advanced to challenge LURCH for the lead entering the turn, could not match strides approaching the upper stretch
and steadily weakened. DAY MONEY chased near midpack into the turn, raced two wide at the quarter pole and failed to threaten. MR. PRIME TIME
steadily retreated.

JUST LIKE TRISTA bumped with rival at the start and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, held a slim lead around the far turn then roused for
more at the head of the lane, responded willingly, widened to a clear advantage, jumped tracks in the final sixteenth but remained well clear and finished
going away. NAUTICAL MISS prompted the pace up the backstretch, continued in striking distance around the far turn, urged two wide into the lane, was no
match for pulling away winner and had to settle for second best. LET'S GO LACEY rated off the second flight through the backstretch and saved ground,
angled out three wide approaching the upper stretch and stayed on for a share. BIT A BAD NEWS raced in the second flight mid-way through the
backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the far turn and offered no late bid. RUTHIE RULES raced in the back, had no response and
retreated. STREAKIN' EASY drifted five wide entering the first turn, tracked the top flight through the backstretch and came up empty around the final turn.

BUG A BOO came away last and was a bit slow into stride, hustled along in the back then picked up the pace along the outside late on the turn, circled up
five wide at the head of the lane, dug in under firm handling and edged away. CATALE tracked the top pair into the turn, hustled along three wide into the
lane, edged closer leaving the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner and finished on equal terms for place. DONNA'S HOPE raced midpack
mid-way around the turn and hustled along four wide into the lane, inched up closer in final stages and finished on equal terms for place. GOLDEN SHOT
saved ground around the turn, cut the corner and advanced into contention, tipped two wide, stayed on a furlong out then yielded. REBA sped to the lead at
the start and set the pace, held the advantage along the inside past the furlong marker then gave way. PAPA'S SECRET chased two wide around the turn,
stayed on three wide into the lane and needed more for impact. SHY RUNNER was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased up close two wide around
the turn then weakened in the final furlong.

RUNNING ALEX'SBAND was reserved and raced in the back of the back, given cue five wide at the head of the lane, responded gamely, rallied to the front
and finished going away. BIG PINES SANDY rated off the pace running through the backstretch, launched a bid midway around the far turn, came five wide
into the upper stretch and captured place. A BRUSH OF LUCK tracked the pace through the backstretch, hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, sustained
bid into the lane and got edged late for place. KWAI CHANG stalked the leader through early stages, took over the lead midway around the final turn,
dueled for the lead a furlong out then gave way. ALLEN'S ROCKET stalked the early pace, launched a bid along the inside at the head of the lane, vied for
the lead a furlong at the furlong marker then flattened out. GINGER RULES raced off the pace, saved ground on the final turn, tipped two wide for the drive
and passed tiring foes. SEMI CHARMED DAY rated near midpack, urged four wide on the final turn and failed to kick on. WARRIOR'S RUN raced off the
pace, chased five wide around the final turn and never threatened. AMERICAN POSSE set the pace then got collared at the five sixteenths pole and faded.
