DRIVEWAY saved ground setting the pace under pressure from California Halo, opened clear nearing the stretch and was ridden out to increase her
advantage. STARRY BEACH was unhurried after breaking a step slow, rallied along the inside on the turn and finished fast. CALIFORNIA HALO vied for
the lead from along the outside, was no match for the winner but held on fairly well during the drive. ANNETTE MARIE was forwardly placed on the turn
while racing three-wide, came five-wide into the stretch and finished willingly. GUNNHILD bobbled at the start, then was close up early, steadied from
between horses in the opening furlong, then was forwardly placed came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a response. GOIN' COASTAL dropped back
early and was unable to seriously threaten.

WARFRONT FIGHTER was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside to join the leaders before going a quarter mile, dueled for the lead from that
point and proved best in a prolonged drive. FREESTONE vied for the lead racing slightly off the rail between horses and lost a tough decision in a game
effort. IRON ROB disputed the issue throughout while racing three-wide, gained a slight lead at the eighth pole, but was quite good enough and held on
gamely. TENGO SED saved ground while being allowed to settle behind the dueling leaders, but lacked the needed late response. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT
was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. ROMAN RUSH was forwardly placed to the stretch while racing
four-wide and tired.

Footnotes
BOURBONWITHATWIST prompted the pace set by New Every Morning from the outside, joined that one on the turn, dueled from that point and prevailed
after a long drive. NEW EVERY MORNING saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged but wasn't quite good enough in a hard drive.
DEVILS WORKSHOP was allowed to settle after breaking a step slow, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out three-wide for the driver and was
gaining on the top two late. STARZAN was allowed to settle in stride, came three-wide into the stretch, responded during the drive bat lacked room nearing
the wire running up on the leaders. WESTERN RULE was off a step slow then broke out, saved ground while being unhurried, found room entering the
stretch but was in tight and lacked room nearing the wire running up on horses. LARSEN BAY came five-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously
threaten.

yards. TIG vied for the lead with Juspassinthru from along the inside, opened a lead nearing the eighth pole and just failed to last. EXECUTIVE ACTION
was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. JUSPASSINTHRU dueled with Tig to the lead from along the outside into the
stretch, drifted out slightly and weakened. FIREWALKER was allowed to settle in stride, came four-wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. COASTAL KING
