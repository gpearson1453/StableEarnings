Footnotes
MY CANDY GIRL , patiently handled behind rivals while never far back, altered out for room after advancing in mid stretch, straightened and closed
determinedly under a drive, overtook OUT OF SORTS in deep stretch and edged away. OUT OF SORTS saved ground early, angled out past the five
eighths and moved up three wide, was under a hustling ride chasing the embattled leaders nearing the lane, shifted out a bit wider and continued progress
to put a head in front with a furlong to go, kept on gamely but yielded to her stable mate late. WITTY BANTER , unhurried early while well off the inside,
dropped in to about the two path while under a ride past the three eighths, came back out to about the five path in upper stretch and closed steadily. I LOVE
YOU exchanged bumps with FOLLY through the opening fifty yards, edged up around the first turn and gained a stalking spot, took closer order into the far
turn, went after PIE KILLER soon after, dueled under some rating, responded and took a short lead in upper stretch, fought on past mid stretch then faded
late. FOLLY bumped with I LOVE YOU early, rated along three wide into the first turn, dropped in nearing the half mile marker but lacked a bid. TOWERING
GAZE vied early along the inside, eased back off of PIE KILLER past the five eighths, stayed in touch and chased around the final turn, failed to kick on in
upper stretch and faded. PIE KILLER , keen outside a rival while contesting the early pace, pulled her way clear with a half to go and dropped in, was
confronted by I LOVE YOU three furlongs out, dueled under asking past the five sixteenths, ceded command in upper stretch and weakened through the
final furlong.

mid turn, eased out three wide to progress into the lane, engaged CATCHTHISWINNER in upper stretch, dueled under strong handling, wrested the
advantage a furlong out, finally shook free in deep stretch the held firm. LUNAR DASH vied inside a pair of rivals early on, was rated back and stalked the
dueling leaders mid turn, angled out for room inside the sixteenth pole and came back on to nab the place. CATCHTHISWINNER took a short lead between
runners early and contested the pace, secured the inside into the turn, sparred with IRISH MCDOUGAL into and around the turn, got the better of that one
in upper stretch then was confronted by the winner, stayed on past the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and just missed the place. CELTIC SEA ,
unprepared as the gates sprung, leaned in at the gate and then the winner soon after, recovered and edged up three wide, shifted out four to five wide for
the drive, ranged up past mid stretch and churned on to slowly bridge the gap. MO MONEY MO BETTA saved ground and failed to seriously threaten.
HIDDEN ROD , in range between rivals into the turn, came three wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. IRISH MCDOUGAL , three deep with the early
pace, emerged in a battle outside CATCHTHISWINNER entering the turn, kept on to dispute the pace to upper stretch then gave way.

DIVINE HUNTRESS stalked the pace, was forwardly placed three deep around the turn, gained a short lead near the eighth pole, drifted in near the
sixteenth pole and lasted under vigorous rousing. SWEET GRACIE rushed up inside horses leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, hugged
the inner rail through the stretch, challenged for the lead in narrow quarters near the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. PETITION PRAYER , a
forward factor between horses entering the turn, dropped back mid way on the bend, swung to the four path approaching the stretch and closed late outside
the top pair. DRY WELL circled foes on the turn, was fanned five deep turning for home and lacked a rally. LITTLE BIT OF THAT sprinted to the early lead,
set the pace in the two path around the turn, lost the lead approaching the eighth pole and faltered.

Footnotes
SPUN GLASS rated kindly in mid pack while slightly off the inside, steadily progressed between rivals nearing mid stretch, split runners to take over heading
to the sixteenth marker, spurted clear then held firm under a drive. ELLANATION , well back in hand, raced three wide into the lane, moved up past the
eighth pole, altered out widest inside the sixteenth marker, closed gamely outside rivals and nabbed the place. ISLAND PHILO , taken in hand four wide,
commenced a run leaving mid turn, ranged up five wide outside rivals leaving mid stretch, kept on with good energy and was nipped for second while
between rivals at the wire. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER rated three wide in a stalking spot, came under pressure past the three eighths, moved up a bit wider
leaving mid stretch and churned on between runners. MATTITUDE broke a step slow, was taken to rate while saving ground, eased out into the lane, edged
up between rivals, shifted back in for the final furlong but lacked the needed punch through the last thirty yards. DENDROBIA settled off the pace, came
wide for the drive but lacked a bid. CAN THE QUEEN bobbled at the break, recovered and quickly gained a tracking spot off the inside, moved up three
wide into the lane, wandered outward then briefly threatened inside the eighth pole, failed to kick on and gave way in the final seventy yards. GOLDEN CAN
quickly went clear, set a rated pace towards the rail, was set down soon into the lane, maintained the advantage to mid stretch, was collared soon after and
gave way. MARGIE'S HEAVEN saved ground pursuing the leader, stayed on to the three sixteenths then weakened.

ALOTTAHOPE , three wide down the backstretch, bumped with SUPER LOVE near the five eighths pole, secured a two wide, lead at the head of the
stretch, was under brisk urging and pulled away. BUFF HELLO raced in the three path between horses around the turn, failed to menace and passed a tired
rival late. AL LOVES JOSIE , a forward factor in the two path down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn while setting the pace, lost the lead
advantage turning for home and weakened. CYNERGY'S STAR , four deep around the turn, faltered approaching the stretch. SUPER LOVE , caught in
narrow quarters inside AL LOVES JOSIE during the opening furlong and a half, came out and bumped with the winner near the five eighths pole, raced

Footnotes
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE drafted back after an alert start, was lightly steadied leaving the far turn, regrouped and eased out a bit when advancing into the
lane, leveled off under left handed asking in mid stretch, closed determinedly outside GRATEFUL BRED and forged to command in the final yards.
GRATEFUL BRED broke sharply then took to rating and prompted the pace outside JAXON TRAVELER, moved in hand to draw alongside mid turn, put a
head in front while dueling into the stretch, sparred on a short advantage heading to the sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but was worn down in the final
strides. JAXON TRAVELER , nudged to the front, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when joined mid turn, fought on to then sixteenth marker then gave
way grudgingly. SHOWTIME CAT stalked while saving ground, eased out through the final furlong and kept on with interest. KENNY HAD A NOTION saved
ground off the early pace, was steadied along into the turn, stayed inside into the stretch then offered a mild kick. DOUBLE CROWN circled the turn four
wide but lacked a stretch response. YOUNGEST OF FIVE , three wide with pursuit, stayed in touch to about the three sixteenths then gave way.

RIDIN WITH BIDEN , urged early to make the lead, set a controlled pace along the inner rail, was set down in upper stretch and eagerly pulled away while
kept under pressure. PLOT THE DOTS bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace, hugged the inner rail the final five furlongs and gained the place.
MAGIC MICHAEL stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced four deep around the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. TREASURE TROVE ,
bumped and pinched back by PLOT THE DOTS leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the far turn and was no factor. TAPPIN CAT
prompted the pace outside the winner and gave way. COMMANDEER saved ground the first turn, angled out inside the six furlongs pole, raced in the three
path between horses on the far turn and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FLANK SPEED , confidently handling prompting the pace outside LOADED SNIPER, took over nearing the lane, responded when asked soon after and
opened up, kept on under a drive leaving the sixteenth pole, relaxed a bit late and held sway. BOURBON AND ICE , taken to rate off the pace, angled out
mid turn, circled four wide into the stretch, leveled off to his best stride nearing the sixteenth pole and was getting to the winner. MARYLAND PRIDE ,
sluggish away, came four to five wide gathering some momentum into the lane and closed steadily. SCOTTY BROWN chased the pace, came three wide
for the drive, moved up a bit past the furlong grounds then flattened out. LOADED SNIPER took over between rivals heading to the turn, dropped in and set
a pressured pace, failed to contain the winner entering the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch and weakened. WORLD OF FOOLS , urged from the gate,
saved ground mid turn, shifted out and lacked a bid. DONTCROSSFUZZY was sent early and contested the early pace, rated back nearing the turn, stalked
and weakened.
