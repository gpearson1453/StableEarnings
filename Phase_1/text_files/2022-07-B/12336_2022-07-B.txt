Footnotes
CUPID AUSTIN settled off the early pace while racing two wide between foes, swung five wide leaving the quarter pole, surged outside, was up near the
sixteenth pole and drew off readily. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER saved ground off the pace, swung four wide leaving the quarter pole, could not keep pace with
the winner but ran on to gain the place. BULLET ON TAP hesitated at the start, trailed inside early, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, came
six wide into the lane and rallied for the show. GRAYTANA was reluctant to load, stalked the duel three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and
weakened. AVE FENIX chased the pace four wide, was shut off in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. CANDY MOM dueled along the rail, kicked clear in
upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and stopped. YELOMA dueled two wide to upper stretch and retreated through the lane. BREEHAZEL chased the
pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

DAVID'S ROSE dueled two wide to midstretch, was collared nearing the sixteenth pole but fought on inside of the winner. TEMPORA stalked the pace three
wide, lacked the needed rally but stayed on to hold the show. HAY HAY PAULA was off a step slow, raced four wide off the pace, angled widest in upper
stretch and improved position. MOUNT SINAI failed to menace while racing three wide. BALI BABY chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. IT'S
NORA NOW had brief speed two wide. LOVIN MAKES CENTS dueled along the rail to upper stretch and retreated.

TOSCANITO dueled two wide, drew clear near the quarter pole and widened under a drive. DESERT RULER dueled inside of the winner, could not keep
pace with that foe nearing the quarter pole but kept trying through the lane to be clearly second best. ASTRAL WEEKS saved ground off the duel, angled
three wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. FEDERAL EXCHANGE was bumped at the start, raced well back five wide and improved
position in the lane. VANCOUVER D'ORO was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. PORK CHOP was forced out at the
start, advanced outside down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. SANDY DUDE played no factor while
racing two wide. BUBBA DREAMS was outrun inside. CREATIVE KID broke outwardly, had some speed between foes and stopped after a half.

JAZZY T stalked the pace two wide, took over near the three-eighths pole and drew off under a drive. SHORT CIRCUIT settled off the early pace while
racing four wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane but stayed on to earn the place. CAGUA trailed in
the two path around the first turn, moved up four wide around the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. ALPHA BABE was no threat while racing two
and three wide. KATIESDREAMGIRL saved ground off the pace, made quick bid inside of the pacesetter early on the backstretch, was rated back off the
pace soon after, chased two wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. KARENVILLE set the pace the two path and stopped leaving the three-eighths
pole.

Footnotes
AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace in the two path, dug in when OUR FANTASY reached even terms near the sixteenth pole, dueled to the wire and
won the bob. OUR FANTASY was in a bit tight at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, bid outside of the winner near the sixteenth pole, dueled
head to head from there to the wire and lost the head bob. CHASING HAPPINESS stalked the winner three wide, could not match strides in upper stretch
but stayed on to hold the show. MORE GLORY failed to menace while racing three wide. SEA ART chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid.
NUMERIC had speed inside and faded after a half. STARSHIP NUGGET failed to menace while racing five wide.

HARD TO CAPTURE settled off the pace while racing three and four wide, tipped five wide in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch.
DREAMING OF AUDREY tracked the pace two wide between foes, angled in nearing the head of the lane, came through inside of the pacesetter to take
the lead nearing the eighth pole, led to deep stretch then came out and bumped TALKIN TIPSY in the final strides. TALKIN TIPSY stalked the pace three
wide, bid between foes in midstretch, battled on between rivals, bumped with UNCAPTURED HEART in deep stretch then was bumped again in the final
strides. UNCAPTURED HEART tracked the pace four wide, reached even terms near the eighth pole, vied between foes, bumped in deep stretch and
faded. ALLURAMORE was reluctant to load, broke a step slow, raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. EMIRATES AFFAIR failed to
menace while racing five wide. BUNNYNOTBEAST chased the pace inside and faded through the lane. VELOCE BELLA set the pace in the two path and
tired through the final furlong.
