Footnotes
CAGED BEAR set the pace while clear and was well handled, then was sent down leaving the turn and responded well to remain well clear to prove best
under a drive. SAINT KENNEDY tracked the winner two wide and lacked the needed stretch bid while being clearly second best. AIRLINE DRIVE was
allowed to settle on the inside and had no kick while being along for the show award. KITTENOFTHE COURT was rated three wide and lacked a rally. VITA
was void of early speed and was never involved.

Footnotes
TOUGH CHARLIE was well placed early and guided to the inside on the turn made a inside bid leaving the turn and kicked clear in the furlong grounds to
prove best, driving. NO PEDIGREE was rated early, shifted out on the turn and made a four wide bid leaving the turn and finished well. THATSAFACTJACK
dueled for the lead and made a inside bid on the turn but weakened the final furlong, held show award. SLITHER was reserved early on the inside, angled
out in the drive and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. SPECTROLITE dueled for the lead on the outside and came up empty in the drive.
