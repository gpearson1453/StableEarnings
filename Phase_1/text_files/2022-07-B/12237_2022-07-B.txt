WHERE'S FREDDIE went to the lead early, dueled for the lead from the two path to the five sixteenths pole where he gained a slight advantage and drew
clear in upper stretch and held off the late closer. CRUZ'N OLLIE tracked the leaders from the three path through the turn then went three to four wide in
upper stretch and made a late gain on the leader. BARLOWS PRIDE was hustled along the rail to duel for the lead to the quarter pole and faded. OTHER
THAN THAT was reluctant to load into the starting gate, then saved ground through the turn and chased the leaders home. BE ALL EARS raced wide
throughout while trailing the field.

UPPERCLASSMAN dueled for the lead from the two path to the eighth pole and drew off. MR. WHITE dueled for the lead from the inside to the eighth pole
and was out kicked. JACK WITH SEVEN was placed just off the pace in the two to three path throughout and was a game third. BAR ROOM BRAWL saved
ground through the turn then angled out to four wide but raced one paced. BEAU GOSSE raced near the back off the rail and gained late in the stretch.
CATALOGUE raced wide throughout made a mild bid on the turn and faltered. FELON raced back and was not a factor. SLICK IT UP was fractious in the
gate then raced in the middle of the pace in the two path but was not a threat.

BANJO BILL was unchallenged on the lead to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch. OPTIMAL went five wide in the first turn and steadily advanced
down the backstretch but was no match for the winner. LOOKING FOR BULL tracked the leaders from the inside through the final turn then angled out to
three or four wide in upper stretch and chased the top two home. MAD AT MONEY chased the leaders from the inside to the final turn then angled out to
two to three wide in upper stretch to improve position late. WEST COAST BROKER trailed the field through the final turn then moved out to six wide in
upper stretch and passed tiring rival. PANIC BUTTON raced in the middle of the pace in the two path and tired. I'M LUCKY was off the pace early in the two
path and slowly retreated.

under steady urging. GOLD NOTE was allowed to settle through the first turn and down the backstretch, made a two wide bid on the final turn then angled
out to four wide in upper stretch and gained on the leader to be up in the final jump. JIMBO'S BIZ was roused to press the pace from the two path through
