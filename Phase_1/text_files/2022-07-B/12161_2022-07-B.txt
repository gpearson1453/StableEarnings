Footnotes
SHOWGIRL LYNNE B prompted the pace in the three path, took over leaving the eighth pole, drew clear and held safe under a drive. GRAND BIRDIE was
off a bit slow, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied. OLGA set the pace in the two path, was collared by the
winner leaving the eighth pole and held well enough to hold third. ACTING saved ground off the pace, continued on the left lead in the lane and improved
position inside. STROKES (IRE) tracked the pace in the clear inside, angled three wide turning for home, continued on the left and weakened.
STEPHANIE'S CHARM was reluctant to load, raced three wide and never threatened. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) saved ground well back, angled four wide
near the quarter pole and lacked bid. R ROSE' ALL DAY steadied early and made little impact while racing three wide. MORGAN'S BLUFF steadied early,
chase the pace two wide and had no response.

Footnotes
DRINKS ON ME settled off the early pace inside, swung seven wide turning for home, closed outside, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and edged ahead
under a drive. VEIL pressed the pace in the three path, battled between foes through the lane, briefly led near the sixteenth pole, could not match strides
with the winner from there from dug in to win the battle for the place. AMERICAN TAP tracked the pace four wide, bid between foes in midstretch but was
outfinished. TURN IT ON stalked the pace from the rail, swung six wide leaving the quarter pole, and was one-paced through the lane. PRETTY PRINCESS
lacked early speed while racing three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and had belated interest. MS BIG SPRING set the pace in the two path and tired
in the final furlong. FOLLOW ME MOM was outrun inside.

Footnotes
ROYAL MAHOGANY set the pace in the two path, kicked clear around the turn and widened under a drive. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH chased the winner
from the inside, was no match for that foe but stayed on to be clearly second best. DANLEY pressed the winner in the three path, continued on the left lead
in the lane and held on for the show. RUNAWAY TOM chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. BAKER BLOCK failed
to menace while racing two wide. ZURIEL played no factor while racing two wide. KALINBA was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened.
MINISTER QUINN ducked out at the start, sawing off COYOTE RUNNER and also bumping KALINBA just after the start, chased the pace four wide and
came up empty in the lane. COYOTE RUNNER was sawed off at the start and trailed inside.

THRILLING BABY settled off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide near the quarter pole, kicked in outside and was up and clear late. SCIENCE
FRICTION stalked the early pace, reached even terms near the half-mile pole, dueled two wide around the turn, drew off in upper stretch, remained well
clear past the sixteenth pole but was swallowed up late. STACIAS RUBY set a pressured pace inside and weakened in the lane. BRIMAGE hesitated at the
start, raced four wide in midpack and lacked a rally. PEARLINTHEROUGH failed to menace while racing four wide. CREME CARAMEL dwelt at the start,
saved ground and never threatened. MONTANA JOYCE had early speed outside and retreated three wide around. UNBRIDLED CHROME played no factor
while racing four and five wide.

Footnotes
DEL REY DOLLY settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, took over in upper stretch and powered clear under a drive.
DIGNIFIED was off a step slow, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and finished well to gain the place. ONE IDENTITY
stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the lane. DIVINE CONNECTION failed to menace while racing four
wide. DEMURELY chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. AMAZING TRIP cleared off nearing the half-mile pole, set the pace along the rail to
upper stretch and tired. COUNTLESS DREAMS was outrun while racing two wide. DEVILETTE hopped at the start then had brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
CENTSATIONAL GRACE was in range while racing widest down the backstretch, edged closer four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the
lane, closed under left-handed urging and was up in the final strides. TORA LORA LORA pressed the pace four wide down the backstretch, drew clear in
the three path around the turn, remained clear past the sixteenth pole but was caught in the final strides. RIDE ON BEAUTY had early speed between foes,
settled back three wide around the turn then stayed on to gain the show. RAIN OF BLESSING saved ground well back, swung out in upper stretch and
rallied belatedly. PRETTY DEVIL went evenly inside. LATTE LOVER failed to menace while racing two wide. BLAME THE VETS was no threat while racing
five wide. INTERESTING GEM vied inside down the backstretch, chased inside around the turn and faded through the lane. FLAT OUT COOL had speed
two wide between foes and tired nearing the lane. THE CUBAN MISSILE was outrun while racing four wide. STARE IF YOU MUST hesitated at the start
and trailed throughout.
