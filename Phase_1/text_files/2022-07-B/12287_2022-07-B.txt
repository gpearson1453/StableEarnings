through the final furlong and prevailed. CAJUN RED was bumped at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, continued to gain four and five wide
around the turn, continued on the left lead, reached even terms near the eighth pole, put a head in front leaving that marker but was outdueled. EL

other side and knocked off stride soon after the start, raced six wide around the turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. SLEEPING EMPIRE raced without
front shoes, was bumped at the start, dueled inside of the winner for a half and tired in the lane. EXTRACTION WILL tracked the pace three wide and faded
in the lane. CAMPTOWN RACES hit the starting gate, made progress inside around the turn and came up empty in the lane. J T'S MY BOY was bumped at
the start, checked leaving the half-mile pole and made little impact inside. CORPORATE AFFAIR bumped at the start and had only brief speed four wide.

BLIND SPOT pressed the pace in the three path, briefly led past the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. GUARDIAN ANGEL was in range
while racing four wide and was one-paced through the lane to gain the show. DEFENDED set the pace in two path and weakened through the final furlong.
PENUMBRAS MAKER failed to menace while racing three wide. MOON ROSE played no factor while racing four wide. LADY PETAL was off slow and
made little impact while racing two wide. MURSAL was outrun while racing two wide. ONE OF ONE raced three wide in midpack and had no response.

AIN'T WASTING TIME disputed the pace outside of BLACK BELT while racing in the two and three paths, continued on the left lead in the lane and drove
clear. HARD BELLE tracked the pace two and three wide, could not quite keep pace with the winner in the lane but stayed on between foes for the place.
HIGH YIELD KITTEN stalked the pace four wide and was one-paced through the lane. MR TITO'S bumped with CHUCKY at the start, raced off the pace
four wide and had a mild rally between foes. BLACK BELT vied inside of the winner to upper stretch and weakened. CHUCKY bumped with MR TITO'S at
the start, steadied near the seven-eighths pole and made little impact while saving ground. YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN trailed inside.

Footnotes
FARM BOY stalked the pace five wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, steadily drifted in while switching
leads several times in the stretch and drew clear under a drive. IMPRESSIVE SPEED settled off the early pace while racing three wide, saved ground
around the far turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied for the place. ASTROTURF tracked the pace two wide, bid three wide between foes nearing the
lane, turned for home on even terms inside of the winner, was herded inward by that foe and weakened through the final sixteenth. CASH EXPRESS set the
pace a bit off the rail and tired in the final furlong. BELLA FUTURE pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
LOOK UP TO HEAVEN bumped with MORE MUCHO after the start, raced off the pace five wide, closed outside and was up on the wire. MABEE
LUCKYNWILD pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, took over early on the turn, drew clear in the two path rounding the bend and led until the
final strides. ARETE'S CHALICE settled off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was outkicked.
SILVER GLEN was devoid of speed, raced well back three wide, angled seven wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. OFFALY FAST was in range
three wide and was one-paced through the lane. HANNITA'S EMPIRE broke a bit awkwardly then went evenly while racing four wide. SCARLETT'S
FLOWER raced well back two wide, swung widest turning for home and was no threat. MORE MUCHO bumped with the winner after the start, prompted the
pace three wide and retreated through the lane. PUSHINGUPDAISIES set the early pace along the rail and retreated inside.
