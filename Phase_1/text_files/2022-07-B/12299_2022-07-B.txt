sway late under a drive. DIABOLICAL FIRE was off slowly, then advanced four wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch to the far outside and closed the
gap fast while racing greenly. GONE PROSPECTING vied for the early lead between rivals, then dueled for the lead to the outside of a rival, but faded late.
TATAS JOE MARK vied for the early lead and then dueled for the lead on the inside and faded late. M G LOOKINGOOD was allowed to settle early and
lacked a rally while racing evenly. NACHO GRANDE lacked a rally. CLUE stalked the pace and was four wide on the turn and then angled in leaving the

driving. GUNNERS ONE stalked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn but was out kicked by the winner. WHOOP WHOOP dueled for

well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out. MAGIC JOURNEY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the lane.
LOPIN JOE lacked a rally. SKEETER WHO failed to menace. ILLUMINATE D STORM was off slowly, then was pulled up on the turn and was vanned off.

pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the drive, held show award. AZTEC SUN was off slowly, then advanced mildly on the turn and swung out
seven wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to just miss the show award. BACK TO WORK was off slowly, then came wide into the drive and had no
late rally. SMOKE STACK chased the early pace four wide, then was on the inside on the turn and weakened. ABETEMARCO was off slowly and was not a

the furlong marker and then weakened. ALLIE R chased the pace three to four wide, came five wide into the drive and had no late kick. HEMATITE chased
