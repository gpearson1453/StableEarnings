Footnotes
NODAH moved up inside to take control after the start, showed the way into the turn, inherited a daylight advantage when closest pursuer got out late in the
bend, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under a hand ride to win ridden out. IM SINGLED UP bobbled just after the start, settled in mid pack
toward the inside, angled out three wide entering the straight, rallied for the place while not a serious threat to the winner. TAKING PICTURES broke out,
was straightened to race forwardly, chased the winner into the lane, flattened out and was caught for the second spot. SWEET OLIVE off a step slow, trailed
for three furlongs while saving ground,continued along the rail to improve a bit in the drive while not posing a serious threat. THROUGH THE CRACKS
broke back then was bothered slightly when TAKING PICTURES broke out, remained back in lacking a rally. RUN AWAY SAMARI broke up, chased the
winner for almost three furlongs before getting out late in the turn, fell back and trailed home. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
RESPOSADO broke well, allowed the early leader to go out of the chute, pursued that one up the backstretch off the inside, challenged that same rival from
the outside early turn, gained the advantage and kicked on through upper stretch to be well clear. STORM BREACH lacked speed just off the inside, split
foes in the two path turning for home, finished willingly to be slowly carving into the winner's advantage late, clearly second best. T R'S FIRST last away,
trailed for five furlongs, swung four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to be along for the show. ELIZABETH RENEE broke well, clear out of the
chute and up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the winner three furlongs out, faltered when headed. BOSTON LUCILLE in the second flight off the
inside, three wide through the turn, backed up stretch.

Footnotes
VALENTINES DAY unhurried early behind a soft pace, moved out to be three wide by midway on the first turn, moved closer on the outside into the second
bend, took over when in the four path and widest entering the stretch under confident handling, held the runner up at bay late under more aggressive
handling. GASTOWN also raced back off the early pace, three wide into the lane, challenged between horses and inside the winner past the furlong marker,
outkicked by that one, well clear of the othes. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) within striking distance, behind traffic into the lane, in a bit tight past the furlong
marker between horses,up for the show, not a threat to the top pair. ALLIACEOUS pressed the early leader through some soft fractions, dueled the middle
part in the two path, weakened gradually through the lane. FOUR PRINCESSES broke on top, set a soft pace along the inside, had little left for the stretch
run while remaining along the inside. QUARTER MILE FRACTINAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
NOT SO SWEET broke alertly, quickly clear afterward, set a glib early pace while maintaining a significant advantage, not seriously threatened through the
lane while being kept to task. SCARLET STORM lacked early foot off the inside, roused three wide out of the turn, finished with good late energy to be
closing the gap on the winner late. TALENTS HOT DEAL forwardly placed along the inside, continued to hug the rail into the lane, finished up best of the
rest. CECE WAVE in mid pack up the backstretch outside, four wide into the turn, dropped inside late in the bend, in some traffic inside the furlong marker,
improved a bit when clear. MY LITTLE MIA in the second flight early, three wide turning for home, lacked a closing response. FIELD OF LIGHTS lacked
speed outside, four wide through the turn, also went one paced through the lane to finish up evenly. PSALM PRAYER off a step slow, raced back off the
pace, between horses through the turn, also made little impact in the run to the wire. WINNIE B broke back and remained there in never threatening.
DIVINE DEFENCE also away in good order, chased the winner for five furlongs off the inside, caved in the final furlong to lose several positions.
SHADESOFGRAYMISS within striking distance in the early going, fell back was finished before three furlongs. JOSIE'S GRIP refused at the start.

Footnotes
SECRET MELODY broke out, was righted and moved up to be forward and three wide into the first turn, pressed onto the backstretch, took over and got
clear before a half, maintained a daylight advantage through the stretch under steady handling. ANN'S STORM off a step slow,bumped between horses,
raced back early, moved closer along the inside second turn, continued to save ground into the straight, challenged for the second spot soon after, proved
game for that position while unable to do much with the winner late. HIGH VALUE TARGET forwardly placed along the inside, moved outside late in the
second turn, also proved no match for the winner, outkicked for the place. K V SQUARED void of speed, began to advance far turn, came four wide into the
lane, continued to display mild interest to improve position, not a serious threat. ENCORE ENCORE bothered while off slowly, lacked speed, made little
impact while saving ground. BISTINEAU BELLE bumped, bothered, off slowly, remained back in failing to threaten. KORAT QUEEN broke in, second flight
early, was tiring when in some traffic midstretch, continued to weaken. LA LOLA broke on top, cleared and showed way early inside, stopped after a half,
continued to give way when drifting through the stretch.

Footnotes
WISE GUY closest to the leader for over a half, engaged that one from the outside in the far turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, wore that foe down
late under firm handling. STRONG RULES took control early, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when confronted by the winner inside that one
far turn, dueled the next quarter then gave ground grudgingly until late while holding sway for the place. GUITARZAN away best of all, continued forwardly
along the inside, moved off the rail when asked second turn, not enough to the wire for the runner up. MY GUITAR lacked speed, improved position, not a
serious threat through the lane. THAT'S D 'CAT behind the pace while along the inside, had little for the drive. LIAM SKYE broke back and never menaced.
MR. NASTY TIME fell back to trail after the start and showed little.

Footnotes
BEACHCOMBING close from the start, pressured the leader onto and up the backstretch, challenged far turn in the two path, dueled into the lane, edged
clear late under a brisk left handed crop. FORTUITY broke on top, clear before a quarter, set a pressured pace up the backstraight, responded when the
winner challenged three furlongs out, long duel, proved stubborn until late. FREEDOM FACTOR settled in the second flight off the inside, three wide into the
lane, getting to the runner up late. PIPES AND DRUMS unhurried off the inside, roused in the two path turning for home, displayed a mild amount of late
interest. JACI'S ROYALTY last to leave, continued to trail, saved ground second turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. PEACOCK
KITTEN forwardly placed for a half along the inside, tired. UNRESTRICTED broke back and showed little.

Footnotes
TWO PUNCH FIST broke well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, headed late in the bend, battled back in game fashion to
regain the advantage by the furlong marker then narrowly withstood a late push by the runner up. APRIORITY GIRL also away in good order, dueled
outside the winner, held a narrow advantage into the lane, headed a furlong out, refused to go away and was trying to come back late to just miss.
SHOTGUN ANNIE lacked speed while saving ground, continued inside for the drive, finished well clear of the others while not a threat to the top two.
SCRAPPY chased the dueling leaders for three furlongs, had little left for drive. JOEY'S THUNDER off a step slow, never menaced.
