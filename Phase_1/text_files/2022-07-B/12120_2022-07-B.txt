Footnotes
SILVER MOON ROAD vied for the early lead while in the two path, cleared into the turn, widened through the turn and into the lane, continued to widen
while hand urged and geared down late when far in front. NYOMAN was in the two or three path through the turn when near the back, swung into the lane
from the five path and finished with determination to gain the place spot. DOUBLE ADVANTAGE trailed through the turn while near the inside, came into the
lane from the three path and moved up late to be closing in on the place spot. STORM ADVISORY never a factor while in the two path through the turn.
MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH bobbled at the start, chased the pace from the two path through the turn, continued to be closest to the winner with an eighth to go
while in teh four path then was empty. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER vied for the early lead along the inside into the turn, lost contact with the winner through
the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
TACHLIS vied for the lead along the inside of two rivals, continued on near even terms into the lane, dueled through the final eighth and edged up. LATTE
DOLCE pressed then vied three wide through the turn, gained a short lead after straightening in the lane, dueled through the final furlong and was
outfinished. DEEP DISH was unhurried while racing through the two path on the turn, came into the lane from the four path, continued in the four path to
inside the eighth pole, shifted into the seven path late and finished with a rush. CURBS AND CONES set the pace while under pressure from both sides
through the turn, brushed when straightening into the lane and yielded. BEIRUT BEAUTY chased the three rival duel through the turn while in the three to
the four path, bid into the lane rom the four path, had aim on the leaders outside the eighth pole and lacked a closing kick. NINJA KITTEN bumped at the
start, raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane and never factored. VERKLEMPT trailed throughout while in the two or three path.

the lane from the five path with aim on the top ones then lacked a closing kick. JUST PHIL was in the two or three path through the far turn, came into the
lane from the four path and never was a threat. EVEN MONEY never a factor while near the rail through the far turn. RED LIAISON chased the two rival

Footnotes
HABUIAH was unhurried while off the inside, advanced from the two path through the far turn, tipped into the three path in late turn, came three wide into
the lane, gained the lead near the eighth pole and drove clear. REVS RUN set the pace while along the inside, was passed by the winner and the show rival
after straightening in the lane, stayed on well to come again late for the place spot. DASH OF SIMPLICITY was in the four path through the turns, bid
through mid-turn, gained the lead before the quarter pole, continued with the lead into the lane, collared by the winner near the eighth pole, could not keep
up with that one and lost the place spot late. JUST HUMMING trailed for half while near the inside, moved from the two to the four path through the turn and
into the lane, straightened in the four path and lost ground to the top ones while drifting in. SWIFT TEMPLE stalked the pace from the two path through the
turn, was asked for more nearing the quarter pole and was empty. MAMBACITA chased the pace along the inside and was done in mid-turn. FASHION
DIVA was in the two path while stalking the pace for half and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
SCOTTY'S ON EDGE chased the pace from the three to the four path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, caught the leader approaching
the sixteenth pole, cleared soon after and widened to the wire. CLASSIC MAX set the pace from the outset while in the two path, continued on a clear lead
into the lane, was no match for the winner nearing the sixteenth pole but stayed on well to save the place spot. BONNIE BILL tracked the pace from the two
path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing bid. ROCKET DOCKET chased the pace from the three path into the lane then lacked a kick.
RICH KINGDOM was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, angled from the two to the six path down the lane and never was a threat. MAI TAI'S
GEM was never a factor while in the four to the three path through the turn. COMPASS POINT never a factor while in the two path through the turn and into
the lane. DAAHER STREET brushed the gate at the start, raced in the four to five path through the turn and was never in it. AKAMAI chased the pace along
the inside through the turn and faded through the lane.

ROCKIN ALL NIGHT stalked the pace between foes, bid at the quarter pole and was clear late under mild urging. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE led between
foes, dueled inside through the stretch but couldn't last. UNBRIDLED VICTOR raced four wide and bid belatedly for the show spot. SUDDEN SHIFT was
bumped at the start, pressed the pace inside, then yielded on the turn. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE pressed the pace three wide, bid on the turn and then gave
way in the stretch. FASHION NUGGET was not a factor.
