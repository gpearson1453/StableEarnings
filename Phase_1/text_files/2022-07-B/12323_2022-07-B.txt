Footnotes
DR WYSONG rated off of the pacesetter early on, made a steady advance on GOOD TIME DOLLY along the backstretch, confronted that rival on the
second turn, battled into upper stretch then took a narrow lead into the final furlong, could not shake free from the stubborn runner-up in the late stages and
determinedly dug in to prevail. GOOD TIME DOLLY broke in a bit and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was
confronted by DR WYSONG nearing the quarter marker, lost the lead to the winner nearing mid-stretch, came again in the final sixteenth and was
stubbornly bested at the end, while having to settle for second best. ARISTEIA settled off of the early pair, gained ground four wide on the far turn,
continued that bid into upper stretch and came within aim inside of the eighth pole, was not able to produce the needed late response and was outfinished in
the final stages.

STARSHIP ENDEAVOR was sent to the early lead leaving the break, was well handled while setting solid fractions through the backstretch run, came under
pressure on the far turn, was able to hold rivals at bay through the lane and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. SACRED BEAUTY was hustled to be
close to the early pace, tracked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, advanced on the pacesetter on the second turn, was held at bay through the
lane and was gamely bested at the end, while settling for second best. PREMIUMONSATURDAY came four wide into the first turn while just off of the pace,
maintained position through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid on the far turn, came within aim nearing mid-stretch but could not sustain that run
and was outfinished late, while well clear for third. COCORITA stalked the early pace while three deep on the first turn, gained ground on the backstretch
run, lost position on the second turn and was not able to produce a late response.

DON'T TELL HYDEE broke alertly and took back off of the early pace, advanced in hand to confront the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took
command into the drive and drove clear in the final sixteenth. LAST STARFIGHTER stalked the pace three wide, gained ground nearing the top of the
stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the drive, while clear of the rest for second. SUGAR ON TOP lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn, was not able to impact the top pair in the late stages but passed tiring rivals to get up in the final jumps to secure third. BANDON BRIDGE
was off a step slowly but recovered to chase the pace to the turn, gained ground four wide nearing the quarter pole, could not sustain that bid in upper
stretch and lacked a late rally. CHIQUITA PIQUITA was sent to contest the early pace and led the field to the turn, was collared by DON'T TELL HYDEE
approaching the top of the stretch, lost position nearing the furlong marker and tired in the final stages.

RHODIUM RUNNER broke alertly then took back off of the pace and tracked the leaders heading into the turn, advanced three deep nearing the quarter
marker, confronted SPLIT ACES in upper stretch, dueled with that game foe while firmly handled through the lane and determinedly prevailed at the end.
SPLIT ACES vied between rivals early on to contest the pace, dueled on the front end while carving out solid fractions through the turn, was engaged by
RHODIUM RUNNER leaving the bend, battled with that determined rival to the wire and was gamely bested at the end, while clear of the rest for second.
DOUBLE THE GOLD chased the quick early pace, ran evenly through the turn, made a four wide bid into upper stretch, was outkicked by the top pair but
was well clear of the rest for third. LOVER BOY TOM hopped at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor. OUR
EMPIRE was sent to show early speed, disputed the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MIKE DAD hopped at the start but recovered nicely and was sent to contest the early pace, took a narrow lead to the turn, extended the lead nearing the
quarter marker, was set down for the drive and drove clear in the final furlong. TEE SHOT tracked the early pace outside of rivals, advanced three wide on
the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in the stretch run and was outkicked but stayed on to secure second. OLYMPIC SILVER showed early speed
and contested the early pace, pressed MIKE DAD to the turn, lost position on the turn and was in tight midway through the bend, lost ground to the winner in
upper stretch and was edged out late for second, while clear for third. DANNY MICHAEL was slow to begin and lacked speed to the turn, came three wide
into the stretch run and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
CALLMEMARTHAJANE was asked to show early speed and raced close to the early pace, made a three wide move nearing the quarter marker to vie for
the lead, took command into the drive and drew off late under firm hand urging. TAMANTARI was jostled by a neighboring rival out of the gate and was off
slowly, lacked early speed while saving ground through the turn, angled out at the head of the lane, was no match in the stretch for the winner but stayed on
to get up for second in the final strides. HIIS REINA was crowded a bit by DELIA MO at the start and bothered TAMANTARI leaving the break, was sent to
contest the early lead, disputed the lead with her stablemate to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong and just saved
third at the end. DELIA MO broke in a bit to crowd HIIS REINA at the start, was hustled to be forwardly placed in the early going, lost position between rivals
on the turn, gave ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. QUICK TAKE showed early speed and contested the pace to the turn while
outside of rivals, lost ground while four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and faltered in the final furlong.

Footnotes
QUEEN MOLOTOV was away well, attended the early pace from the inside, opened up on the field on the turn and proved best under brisk urging down the
lane. CITY GLITTER tracked behind the speed duel down the backstretch while under constant handling, was rank and hard to place around the turn,
showed some late interest turning for home and was gaining on the leader but was second best. MARY MARGARET was unprepared at the start, spotting
the field two lengths early, settled in the back of the field, made a three wide bid passing the quarter pole and finished evenly from there. RUNAWAY
PRINCESS hustled to the lead, was widest of the three-horse speed duel down the back stretch, took a brief lead entering the far turn, remained in
contention to the quarter pole then flattened out in the late stages. PERFECTLY JULIE broke well, was in the middle of a three-horse speed duel to the turn,
then began to drop back steadily when unable to keep pace and was not persevered with late.
