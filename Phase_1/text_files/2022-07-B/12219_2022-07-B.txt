Footnotes
OUR SOUTHERN GIRL broke sharply to track the leaders from the inside, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, found room approaching the stretch
and quickly drew off with complete authority. NOBLE MISS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, gained a brief lead
nearing the quarter but was no match for the winner in the drive. TIZ FOR REAL was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with
late interest. ZIPPIN BY U was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. RUN LIKE KATE pressed the pace
while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. GATOR VINDICATION was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide
and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
JUVAL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. JAZZ MAN
DO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not match strides with the winner late.
GOBLIN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. NO HUDDLE was forwardly placed early, moved
three-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. WILD FIREWATER chased the leaders from the inside and weakened through the final furlong.
SHAKE RAG lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
