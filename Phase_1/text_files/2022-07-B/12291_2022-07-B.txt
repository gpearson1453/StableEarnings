SOUPER CATCH was well rated throughout, came four wide into the lane and closed well to prevail in a game effort. P JS SILVER DUKE was allowed to
settle early, made a five wide move leaving the quarter pole, drifted out in the furlong grounds and was outfinished late to just miss. ZERTZ pressed the
pace and made a three wide bid leaving the five sixteenths and shook clear, but weakened the final furlong. ANNAMATED MOON set a pressured pace on
the inside and then dueled for command on the backstretch, then gave way by the quarter pole.
