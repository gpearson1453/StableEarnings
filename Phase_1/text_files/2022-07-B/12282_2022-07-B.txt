Footnotes
GARDENLY tracked two wide and between horses, loomed from behind the leading trio around the far turn, split foes three wide turning for home to bid
outside of PISTOL entering the lane, then gained an advantage nearing the furlong grounds, and drew off. PISTOL vied for the lead two wide, led from a
pair of pressers on either side around the far turn, dug in to resist GARDENLY's bid entering the lane, but was bested at the furlong grounds, and remained
well clear of show. CUZZYWUZZY settled off of the pace along the inside, trailed around the far turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and moved up.
BALLYKEEN vied for the lead along the inside, then inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but faded approaching the quarter pole. BELIEVING stalked
three wide, pressed in earnest into the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner foe while fading at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LET'S DUET broke a beat slowly, recovered to stalk three wide while right off the leading pair's flanks down the backstretch, inched forward around the far
turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, gained an advantage entering the lane, and edged clear through the final furlong. COASTAL CHARM vied for the lead
two wide, then from between horses around the far turn as LET'S DUEL menaced, got headed by that foe entering the lane, fought on, but yielded in the
final furlong. MCMANSION broke a step slowly, tracked from off of the pace four wide, pursued turning for home, then chased evenly while one-paced
through the lane. STUPENDOUS broke a bit outwardly, tracked two wide, stalked from behind the leaders approaching the far turn, but only managed to
chase thereafter without bidding. BAL A BAE BEE vied for the lead inside of a prompting foe, but yielded while inside of a pair of rivals at the five sixteenths
pole. TIZMISSBETTY tracked along the inside, got wrangled back while tugging in the bit entering the backstretch, trailed the field passing the eleven
sixteenths pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
OUT WORK'N established a loose and uncontested advantage early on, widened his margin into the far turn, and was driven home while holding sway from
a chasing BLUNDER through the lane. BLUNDER tracked along the inside, then three wide into the far turn as the leader got away, and only managed to
chase that foe thereafter while proving second best. COMMAND CENTRAL stalked outside of the clear leader, but faded into the far turn. BICKELL laid off
of the pace two to four wide and made little impact. STAVANGER was outrun. XKUZ chased outside of the top pair early on, but faded five wide at the five
furlong pole, and was done early.

JILLS PASSION pressed the pace setter from the outside while kept in the three to four path around the turn by that foe, vied in upper stretch, and drew
clear a sixteenth from home. JOY ENAMORADA set the pace inside of a prompting JILLS PASSION while a path or two off of the inner railing around the
turn, resisted that foe's challenge in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, gave way, and lasted for place. SENORITA AURORA settled at
the back after a furlong, saved ground, then rallied along the rail with a good finish to reach show in the closing stages. TETON THAI bumped with an outer
foe at the start, stalked along the inside, but chased entering the lane, and faded. I LOVE TO RACE hopped a bit while spotting the field multiple lengths at
the start, rushed inside of rivals to a midpack position down the backstretch, tracked fro the two to three path around the bend, but lacked a punch in the
lane. FIELD DAISEY bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to two paths, and made little impact. MARCIE'S CANDY took the
turn in the four to five paths, and failed to factor.

FED MONEY vied for the lead two wide, inched clear at the eleven sixteenths pole, lengthened his margin in the three path leaving the three furlong pole,
and was driven home to seal the deal. LAND REMEMBERED trailed along the inside, rallied along the rail around the far turn to gain place from outer foes
at the quarter pole, and chased the leader home while well clear of show. NOMADIC FIGHTER laid off of the pace in the four path, and stayed on mildly to
prove best of the rest. MO BETTA vied along the inside around the first turn, backed off to stalk at the eleven sixteenths pole, but was through entering the
far turn. COSME tracked in the three path, but faltered between horses at the five sixteenths pole.

B DAWK prompted the pace three wide, bid for the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, led turning for home as an outer RAYMOND loomed a danger,
but repelled that foe nearing midstretch, and drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. OPEN ROAD was bumped between horses while put to crowded
quarters among foes at the start, trailed between horses early on, raced off of the pace four to five wide around the turn, commenced a rally turning for
home, sustained his charge to take aim on RAYMOND for place in the final furlong, and reached that position nearing the wire. RAYMOND tracked three
wide while outside of foes, ranged up four wide to bid outside of B DAWK turning for home, but briefly delayed his lead change in upper stretch, flattened out
while failing to keep pace with his inner counterpart in the process, then got outfinished by an outer foe for place. IGNITIS brushed an outer foe at the start,
chased two wide and between horses, tipped three wide entering the lane, and ran on while fending off an outer foe for fourth through the final furlong.
KUNSHAN BRIDGE laid off of the pace in the two to three path, shifted four wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. COURTHOUSE COVE bumped an
inner foe at the start, vied for the lead two wide and between horses, but was outkicked turning for home by a pair of outer foes, and tired. BLUE NORTHER
set the pace inside of a pair of prompting rivals, but weakened while inside of a trio of foes at the quarter pole. HOLIDAY HOUSE bumped with rivals on
either side at the start, stalked along the inside, but faded while tipping two wide entering the lane. LEVEE PROUD was outrun.

Footnotes
NOT SO CLOSE set a sternly pressured pace around the first turn, cleared on her own power at the five furlong pole, maintained a margin in hand around
the far turn, then widened under moderate hand urging in upper stretch, and was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. SACRED KITTEN stalked three
wide, chased the clear leader from the two path around the far turn, and managed place through the lane. MY LILY MAE saved ground off of the pace, and
improved along the rail entering the lane to claim show in upper stretch. HEDY LAMARR tracked four wide, chased three wide around the far turn, but lost
show to an inner foe in upper stretch while fading. SHA GIRL was last away, saved ground far back around the far turn, and improved along the rail.
EIVISSA tracked in midpack, tipped between horses turning for home, but failed to factor. LITTLE GIA broke a step slowly and never got involved.
TIFFANY'S MO bobbled at the start and was void of early speed, attempted a rally in the five path around the far turn, but failed to menace before tiring.
BALI KUTA tracked along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, and tired. BELLA MORNING was done early. LIAM'S NESSY pressed in earnest two
wide around the first turn, but chased the leader nearing the far turn, and weakened entering it.
