Footnotes
WINWITHJIMMY set the pace two wide through the clubhouse turn, gave up the advantage, came on again nearing the top of the stretch while drifting out
to the seven path, shook clear before the furlong marker and lasted under strong handling while gradually angling back in. FLYING GUILLOTINE unhurried
early, rallied determinedly along the rail through the stretch but missed despite a game effort. AMES MISTER rushed to the lead along the rail after a
quarter, set the pace to the quarter pole, drifted to the six path then weakened late. STAYIN OR STRAYIN stalked the pace into the stretch then gave way.
GET ALONG had brief speed. FRANKIE Z lost contact with his field leaving the clubhouse turn, pulled up and was walked off.

Footnotes
MAN DOWN saved ground for a half, moved around the tiring LOVE TREE before the second turn, circled rivals three wide through that turn, rallied
determinedly inside the top pair under right handed urging through deep stretch and got up in the final stride. PALTARREVENGE stalked the pace four
wide, drifted to the nine path entering the stretch, drifted inward gradually through deep stretch and just missed. YOU ARE AWESOME pressed the early
pace two wide inherited the lead after a half, drifted to the eight path entering the stretch, maintained the advantage until the final stages then was
outfinished between rivals. VENETIAN DREAM moved up four then three wide before a half to press the pace, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch
then faded. KATHERN'S JOY close up, failed to respond. SAY HEY KID was no factor. KLAATU was hung four wide into the first turn, surged three wide to
make the lead before a half, had speed into the far turn then came up empty. LOVE TREE was fractious in the gate, set the early pace along the rail then
was through after a half.

Footnotes
SILENCE never far back, altered course to the six path entering the stretch, made the lead before the three sixteenths pole then widened the balance of the
trip to win as much the best. MR LOOOCH veered in soon after the start, appeared to have his heels clipped, surged four then three wide to make the lead
nearing the far turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. SOMEKINDAFUHRY was shut off and appeared to clip heels
soon after the start, battled for the lead two wide, kept pressured into the stretch then weakened. THAT'S THE WAY was squeezed between rivals and
appeared to clip heels soon after the start, battled for the lead along the inside early, remained a sharp threat into the far turn then weakened. SEASONS
END with the second flight inside, failed to respond. MCGRAW drifted out gradually soon after the start, contested the lead three then two wide into the
stretch then flattened out late. DYNAMIC REACH was outrun. MONSTER HUNTER was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND
THE RIDER OF SOMEKINDAFUHRY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MR LOOOCH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START.
AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MR LOOOCH AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

BLUE MONARCH never far back, closed fast four wide through upper stretch, made the lead inside the furlong marker and finished full of run under a brisk
hand ride to win as much the best. TURNING PAGES stalked the pace along the rail into the turn, shifted out three wide, rallied to make the lead before the
furlong marker the was no match for the winner. WEEKEND BUZZ was bumped shortly after the start, unhurried then had a mild late rally in the five path.
IMA BELIEVER passed tiring rivals. POWERFUL PHIL battled for the lead along the inside into the stretch then weakened late. THE PINK Z matched
strides for the lead two wide into the stretch then gave way. MOBIL MAGIC had brief speed. COOLER drifted in bumping WEEKEND BUZZ soon after the

Footnotes
GOING PRIMETIME stalked the dueling leaders into the stretch, rallied steadily under left handed urging through the final furlong and was along in time.
MARCH MAGIC away alertly, set a pressured pace along the rail with a narrow margin then couldn't handle the winner. RUNAWAY RUSSELL prompted the
pace two wide until deep stretch then faded. DASH OF FIRE passed tiring rivals. PLAYING BALL had good early speed then faded. STRIKING AGAIN
hopped at the start and had brief speed. SOL OF VAQUERO was never close. ATILANO'S THUNDER bore in at the start and trailed.
