Footnotes
PIPITO tracked the pace three wide, tipped four wide turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over leaving the eighth pole and drove
clear. RARE JEWEL broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace four wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. ROCK SOLID WORDS
was bumped at the start, dueled three wide, led in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was outfinished. CAN'T BE BROKEN saved
ground in midpack, swung out near the quarter pole and improved position without seriously threatening in the lane. ETERNAL FLAME was in range inside,
angled three wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. REGIO was bumped at the start, raced three to four wide and never threatened.
HIGHJUMP CHARLIE bumped with REGIO at the start and played no further factor while racing four wide. SIDNEY'S BID was outrun inside. MIGHTY
FROSTED made little impact while racing three wide. LIL CROWN bumped with ROCK SOLID WORDS at the start, dueled two wide between foes and tired
in the lane. SENOR GEE dueled inside of a pair for three furlongs and retreated inside. DANGER RANGER was sluggish at the start, raced off the pace two
wide, swung out entering the lane, was eased leaving the eighth pole, pulled up shortly after the finish and was vanned off.

MARIACHI CRUSH stalked the pace three wide, seized command in midstretch and drew off under confident handling. DON'T ANSWER was a bit slow into
stride, advanced four wide around the turn and rallied for the place. MY BILLEEBOY chased the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner and
just missed second. COOLER KING vied two wide between foes to midstretch and weakened. MAKIZAN set the early pace along the rail and tired in the
lane. WINOOSKI failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SONIC KITTEN tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced two wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole, kicked clear in
upper stretch and held clear under a drive. MY MAN FLINT settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced inside around the far turn, angled three
wide near the quarter pole and rallied to be a clear second best. KANTHARTANA saved ground in midpack early, went four wide around the far turn and
was along for the show. CADET CORPS lacked early speed in the two path, went six wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. MAJORITY RULES
broke through the starting gate but only travelled a few steps, raced in range two wide early, went four wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid.
ONWARD AUSTIN saved ground in range for a half, angled three wide early on the far turn, made progress between foes around that bend but faded
through the stretch. WOW RUN set a clear pace in the two path, angled in entering the far turn, led to the quarter pole and tired. SOLAR TAP failed to
menace while racing three and four wide. STREET FACTS lacked speed while racing two and three wide made some progress in upper stretch and was
blocked throughout the final furlong. AUTHENTIC HEART was outrun inside. FULTON STREET was up close inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
QUEEN DOMINA had her head turned at the start then was shut off and dropped far back early, circled four wide around the turn, seized command near the
quarter pole and drew off under a drive. KENYA SUN tracked the pace two wide, swung five wide nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the
lane and ran on for the place. HARDLY SOCIAL settled off the pace while racing four and five wide, lacked the needed rally but was along for the show.
CHUTZPAH was bumped at the start, advanced inside around the turn, made good progress in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong.
AMERICAN EMPRESS set the pace in the two path and tired after a half. PERFECT KIMBERLY S pressed the pace three wide, had a brief lead late on the
turn and retreated through the lane. ELLIEREESEASTON broke in and bumped CHUTZPAH into the winner's path at the start, raced two wide and was
outrun.

Footnotes
THINKABOUTIT settled off the pace along the rail, always had a clear path inside of foes, steadily gained inside through the lane and was up in the final
strides. REAL TALK settled off the pace while racing three and four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and led until the
final strides. NO QUE NO raced off the pace in two path, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied for the show. JEOPARDY JAMES chased the pace four
and five wide and was one-paced through the lane. GATSBY dueled inside of WIND OF CHANGE while racing in the two path, led to midstretch and
weakened. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) dueled outside of GATSBY in the three path and tired in the lane. MISTER LUIGI was getting out around the turn,
was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
HARDSPUN WOMAN settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid outside of foes in midstretch, vied outside of
DUBSTEP through the final sixteenth and prevailed. DUBSTEP stalked the pace inside, angled three wide turning for home, split rivals in midstretch, took
the lead near the sixteenth pole but was narrowly outfinished by the winner. YOUR INHERITANCE raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. STELLARATOR settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, reached near
even terms near the quarter pole, vied between foes to the sixteenth pole and weakened. SYLLABUS set the pace in the two path around the first turn and
along the rail around the far turn, battled on to midstretch and tired late. WHAT A KNOCKOUT pressed the pace two wide, took a short lead late on the turn,
battled on between foes through midstretch then faded. PATH TO VICTORY lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far
turn but failed to sustain the bid. MISS KEEN was outrun inside. ARTIFICIAL INTELL saved ground in midpack, appeared to clip heels near the
five-sixteenths pole and dropped back inside. ENOUGH RAIN trailed inside early, went four wide around the far turn, swung eight wide in upper stretch and
never threatened. UNCAPTURED GRACE tracked the pace two and three wide between foes, checked near the quarter pole and retreated.
