NOBLE CRUSADER was away alertly, drew clear in the upper stretch and extended the lead while ridden out. PAISLEY'S VISION was off a step slowly,
advanced outside to challenge for the lead on the turn, was no match late and finished second best. PANZER PRIDE held a good position, lacked the
needed late response and settled for show. JOHN'S KID was crowded at the start, never far off the pace, raced evenly and failed to menace. WE WANT
ANOTHER came in at the start and trailed the field. Hand timed.

CROSS TOWN broke sharply, set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended the lead while kept to task. HELLO HANDSOME advanced inside on the
turn, bid, came up empty late and just lasted for place. CRYIN' CHUCK raced mid pack, closed steadily, gained late and was outnodded for second.
IMPERATOR was reluctant to load, bumped after the start, offered a mild bid and drifted out late. TRACK BOUND advanced to the turn, lacked a stretch
response and fell back. FOUR O'FIVE bumped after the start, swung wide into the turn and lacked a bid. ROUGE SUNSET vied to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
LILA'S LUCKY LADY was slow early, saved ground, bid inside on the turn, closed steadily an inched clear late. PALACE STAR vied to the turn, swung
wide, dueled to late stretch and was outclosed. MADISON'S QUARTERS led early, was carried out leaving the turn and closed to get up for show. SHOE
GAME was squeezed at the start, dropped inside into the turn, bid between horses in the upper stretch, was checked, continued to close and was in traffic
late. MAYBEE A DIVA pressed the pace, got through along the rail on the turn, dueled for the lead and came up empty late. LUCKY STEPPER failed to
menace in an even effort. WINDI'S MOMENT raced outside and had brief speed only. THUNDER WOMAN had brief speed only. The rider of SHOE GAME
lodged an objection against the rider of PALACE STAR for alleged interference in the upper stretch. No change was made. Hand timed.

Footnotes
KING LEBRON vied to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held off the late charge of PARLEY STREET. PARLEY STREET was slow early, went widest in
the drive, closed with a rush and was gaining fast late. GOT EVEN SMARTER raced close to the pace, failed to rally and settled for show. WINNING
MAGIC rached in the back, put in a steady effort and failed to menace. PICK YOUR BID led early, raced inside, fell back on turn, bid and came up empty.
FIGHT ME vied to the turn, fell back and came up empty in the drive. JAZZ TOWN showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

Footnotes
SANTALUZ DREAMIN dueled to late stretch and inched away to prove best. FAMOUS ROCK STAR vied to late stretch, couldn't match strides and yielded
to finish second best. ALBANY FRONT was squeezed at the start, raced in the back, closed steadily and got up for show. AUTISM CAN DO contended to
the upper stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and hung late to lose position. DON'TTEASETHETIGER raced mid pack in an even effort and did not
threaten. KICK IT trailed early, offered a mild bid and improved position. CAUSE AND EFFECT was not a factor. BIGGER THAN YOU showed speed to the
turn and stopped. Hand timed.
