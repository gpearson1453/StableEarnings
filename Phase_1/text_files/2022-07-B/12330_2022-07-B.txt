Footnotes
RUNTODAY broke readily, angled immediately to the inside while being urged to a clear advantage, held sway on a safe margin into upper stretch, shifted
out under pressure racing through the lane but widened late while being kept to firm encouragement. FRANZ broke sharply, angled inwards pursuing the
pacesetter into the turn, couldn't gain terms with that foe but proved best of the others. MISTER MULDOON tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing in
the three path to the turn, briefly gained some position nearing the lane but flattened out late. RUNNIN' BLOCK broke slowly, settled well off the field, then
shifted out racing through the stretch with a belated effort to improve position between foes. CROSS THE CAUSEWAY was rated off the second flight in
early stages, angled inside entering the turn but lacked the needed late response. ROLLERCOASTER MAN made brief pursuit of the leaders along the
inside in the opening three sixteenths, drifted out four wide racing through the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
NORA'S LEGACY was urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for command inside rivals racing into the
far turn and gamely held the challenge of several rivals while being kept to brisk handling. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT, off slowly, settled off the inside, split
foes three deep racing into the far turn, shifted four wide on the far turn while advancing on the leaders, bid for command three deep leaving midstretch but
was outkicked. TEMPORARILY, forwardly placed three wide between foes attending the pace in the opening half, shifted inwards to press the issue
between foes on the far turn into upper stretch but weakened late. MOM'S PASS was rated tracking just off the first flight along the rail in the opening half,
was urged to lodge a brief bid inside the pacesetter nearing the far turn but quickly emptied out. U SO MONEY BABY, urged to contend four wide racing just
off the first flight from the outset to the backstretch, dropped out early. FULL SPEED ASTERN was urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset
to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. ME SAY SO, caught wide racing to the first turn while settling last, proved no factor.

Footnotes
LADY CLARE angled to the rail tracking off the first flight racing into the first turn, tipped out entering the backstretch, made a steady advance on the leader
outside a rival on the far turn, continued to close the gap in the three path racing through the stretch and responded to firm handling to prevail in time.
SUNDANCE STAR, off a bit slowly, was reserved last near the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes entering the backstretch, continued to
make steady progress four wide through the far turn to upper stretch and finished willingly to prove best of the others. STYLIN N PROFILIN was urged along
the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, shook clear racing into the far turn but faltered near the sixteenth marker. SENSE OF FLURRY settled
near the inside in the opening stages, shifted out while being prompted to gain position between foes on the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed
late kick. FLASH FLOOD, caught wide in the opening stages, was prompted to a forward placing three deep to the backstretch and gave way leaving the far
turn. MAIDEN ROCK, urged between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, was finished after a half. IMMINENT THREAT tracked the leaders outside
rivals in second flight to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
TWO BY TWO was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, steadily gained position inside foes on the far turn, tipped out midstretch
while being roused to advance on the pacesetter, then took over and went clear under firm handling. A ROSE FOR RAVEN was urged clear along the inside
racing to the backstretch opening a commanding margin, held sway to midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. STITZY tracked the
pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped off the rail after a half, was urged in pursuit of the leader into the lane but
couldn't match the top pair in the drive, then exchanged repeated contact with HARD ATTACK in the closing stages while edging that rival for a share.
HARD ATTACK tracked the pacesetter three wide between foes in second flight racing to the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane, then exchanged
repeated contact in the closing stages while being outkicked for a share. ZUMURUDEE, bumped, then squeezed back at the start, angled to the inside
tracking behind the eventual winner to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly inside rivals late. KID FROSTIE settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch, angled five wide racing through the stretch but offered no rally. MISHKO broke outwards bumping ZUMURUDEE, was settled last
to the far turn, was fanned widest entering the stretch and proved no threat. JOKER MATT tracked the leader four wide in second flight to the backstretch
and faded after a half. IOYA AGAIN, reserved along the inside in early stages, failed to menace.

Footnotes
XTREME V. I. P., forwardly placed three wide attending the pace, took charge racing into the far turn and held sway on a comfortable margin while being
kept to steady pressure. CLUB MESQUITE angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch
and bested the others. LAST MARTINI, unhurried between foes in the opening half, angled to the rail racing through the far turn and continued with interest
to gain a share along the inside late. MONGOL ALTAI, off last, was caught five wide racing into the first turn, settled outside foes, was fanned six wide into
upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. BREXTON, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages,
switched out after a half to track between foes and faded into the lane. MY DOMINATOR settled last, was fanned five wide racing into the lane but had no
rally. SMART CALL was urged to set the pace a bit off the rail between foes to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. NORTHERN PLAYBOY,
reserved along the inside to the backstretch, failed to menace. KNIEVEL, caught four wide between foes racing to the backstretch, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
MISS GLORIOUS was urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, forged clear racing into the turn, widened the advantage into upper stretch
and was kept to firm encouragement. SAILING ALONG, off last, settled along the inside early, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced
some late momentum to prevail for the place honors late. TWIRLING SAVI tracked the pacesetter four wide in second flight through the backstretch, shifted
inwards nearing the lane but lacked the needed closing response. APART OF MY CHARM bobbled at the start losing some position in the opening stages,
angled inside on the backstretch, switched out entering the bend while being prompted to advance four wide nearing the lane but lacked the needed late
kick. MISSCZECH tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch. SHE'S MY
WARRIOR flashed brief pace inside rivals prompting the pacesetter but emptied out early. BECAUSE retreated early.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GOPHER was rated three wide tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch
to challenge for command and narrowly prevailed under firm handling. DANZIG STAR, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, moved to press the issue on the far turn striking the front, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but came up second best. BRUCE'S GIRL,
reserved along the inside to the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the far turn, was fanned to the six path entering the lane but continued with
steady late energy to edge a rival for share. FAT AND FURIOUS tracked just off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted out four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued willingly while just missing for a share. ICYWILBURNYEH angled inwards while being reserved off the second flight
between foes to the backstretch, steadied out of tight quarters racing into the far turn, was fanned seven wide into the lane and continued with a mild bid.
CUPIDS LOVE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled inside rivals to midstretch and
gave out late. FOXGLOVE hopped at the start while breaking slowly, pulled her way between foes leaving the chute, shifted out five wide racing through the
backstretch making brief progress and flattened out on the far turn. PINK CHANNEL angled to the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch,
was shuffled back avoiding SURELY A LEGEND racing into the far turn and had no late response. NOTE PAD switched outside rivals racing through the
chute, was prompted to make some brief progress four wide between foes racing to the backstretch and quickly came up empty. SURELY A LEGEND
tracked the pace inside foes in second flight and emptied out abruptly racing into the far turn. PIPPA'S PROSPECT, caught in close quarters leaving the
chute, dropped out early.
