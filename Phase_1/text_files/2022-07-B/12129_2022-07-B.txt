Footnotes
CAUGHTANDCOLLECTED chased the early pace while racing just off the inside, shifted four wide near the quarter pole and finished well in the stretch to
be well clear late under strong handling. CITI CREEK dropped to the back of the pack soon after the start, made an advance towards the leaders through
the far turn, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and made a good late rally. SWIFTY DEVIL was quick to begin to set the early pace from the
inside, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and weakened while continuing to race near the rail. SUPER ROCKER stumbled at the break, stalked the pace
from the inside and raced evenly with no late rally. CATCHHIMANDFREEHIM dropped back early, raced near the inside around the far turn through the
stretch and had no response. DAGDA was coaxed along early and faded while racing three wide. FREDDYNESS chased the early pace from the outside,
raced two wide around the far turn, angled out through the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

SOLEADA stalked the pace, made a good bid near the three eighths pole while racing three wide, raced off the inside in the lane and held well to be clear
under steady handling. FEVER DREAMING tracked the early leader from the inside, continued his bid from the inside around the far turn through the
stretch, narrowly held the place position but was no match for the winner. LISA MARIE stalked the pace, raced wide in the early going, angled in race out
side around the far turn, raced along the outside in the lane and raced along for third. MY LUCKY HEART dropped back early on, swung five wide through
the upper stretch and had no rally. STERN CHASER was a step slow, quickly recovered to set the early pace and stopped the final quarter of a mile.
