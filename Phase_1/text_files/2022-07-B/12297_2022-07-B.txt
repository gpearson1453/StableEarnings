command just outside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. SIDEKICK five then four wide through the first turn, settled four then three
wide just off the duel before advancing into the far turn to take over command at the seven-sixteenths, shook away briefly before coming under threat
swinging three wide into upper stretch, got brushed straightened away by GOLDEN ALCHEMIST, dug in and was collared a furlong out and ran on well
clear of the rest to be along second best. BOLD LOOKER two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. GATE RUNNER coaxed from the start, raced three wide
through the opening bend before tipping five then four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CHEEKY TICO coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide through

heads, came under briefly coaxing into the far turn and was overtaken in tandem with his main pace rival with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish. INTERNAL CAPITAL coaxed from the start, dueled inside of CHEEKY TICO from the get go

Footnotes
SEANAN bobbled slightly just after the start, went to the front on the inside, disputed the pace on the inside of two foes then one rival starting around the
five-eighths, vied along the rail while still inside of a foe on the far turn, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, spun into the stretch in the two path
then shook clear, responded well when put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, was given one last pop of a right-handed crop inside that
marker, came outward when flagged with a left-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a solid hand-ride to the wire while much
the best. PHOEBE'S FROSTY brushed the outside of the gate then veered out at the start, went five then four wide around the first turn, prompted the pace
on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch under pressure, lost touch with
the winner around the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for the place. SELL SOMETHING dropped to the rear in the two path on the first
turn, was taken up while tossing his head late on that bend, raced at the rear under urging, saved ground early on the far turn then shifted three wide, was
driven five wide into the stretch then moved in around the three-sixteenths and safely secured the show. MEDIA SENSATION was hustled from the gate,
went three wide around the first turn, was urged along well off the pace, traveled three wide around the far turn, came under the crop inside the
three-eighths, spun four wide into the stretch then drifted out and was no factor. ON PALM SUNDAY went four then three wide around the first turn,
contested the pace between horses, dropped back with five furlongs to run and retreated then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to
prevail. SPIKED three then two wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and
ran on knocking heads with INSIGNIA to secure the place honors by a nostril. INSIGNIA four then three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on getting bested for the place honors after dueling to the finish with the
aforementioned foe. SOCIAL DILEMMA bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside early on, came under coaxing three to four wide at the three-eighths,
angled five wide for home and weakened. JOIN THE DOTS bobbled at the start and was bumped by FROST ME, who recovered outwards from bobbling,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. FROST ME bobbled at the start and recovered

Footnotes
FONTANAFREDDA was away awkwardly from the outside post, raced on the outside while ridden along, went four then five wide around the turn, gained
six wide into the stretch, lugged in while still on his inside lead at the three-sixteenths then was corrected with several tugs of the right-rein, chased into the
final furlong, swapped to the proper lead while drifting in and making a bid coming to the sixteenth-pole then got up under strong handling. TIS A PITY
settled in the middle of the field on the outside, went two then three wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, rallied six wide into the stretch,
closed strongly to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole, fought with two foes to the wire and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. PATRIA was
hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, responded well under threat
into the final furlong, led to the final strides but was denied while able to get the show. HAPPY HILL LIL settled in the back half of the field, went three then
four wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch, moved in some around the three-sixteenths then back out in the vicinity of the furlong marker and
finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. BUSTIN BULLET stalked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn,
bumped hard with a foe with her hindquarters in upper stretch then was steadied, chased behind the pacesetter into the final furlong, lacked room in the final
sixteenth and was taken in hand late then lost the last spot in the superfecta. SUMMER AT THE SPA settled towards the rear under some restraint, dropped
from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, gained some before the eighth-pole, raced in
traffic into the final furlong then brushed with a foe and improved position. BLAME IT ON MARY broke out and bumped hard with a foe then was hustled,
raced off the pace under urging, moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, bumped with a foe inside the
three-sixteenths and was out-kicked. LUCKY LATKES bumped with an opponent at the start, angled in at the rear of the field, moved from three to five wide
around the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SILKEN DOLLAR bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, moved up to
track the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, came in some under a right-handed crop at the
three-sixteenths then bumped with foes on both sides, pursued the leader into the final furlong and weakened. FLIP MY ID bobbled at the start, established
a good position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole, chased inside into upper stretch, brushed with a foe
while dropping back inside the furlong marker and capitulated. LAOBAN'S LEGACY bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled near the middle of the field,
raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. OUCH THAT HURT dropped back to the
rear of the field, started the turn in the two path, moved the four to five path near the five-sixteenths and was no factor.

Footnotes
SWEEPING GIANT tracked the top pair two then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four then three wide into upper stretch
advancing to take command at the three-sixteenths, then edged away under a drive to the finish. FAZARO tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and tipped out to the three or four path straightened away into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive head to head with SEBARAY and bested that rival for the place honors when running on willingly to the finish. SEBARAY just off the inside just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. GUT FEELING just off the inside near
the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. MAD MAGIC three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. INSPIRED MISCHIEF showed the
way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat and yielded with three-sixteenths to
go, then weakened in the final furlong. STREAMING TAP chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide for
home and offered no response. BLUEBERRY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened. DRUID attended the leader from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
for home and weakened. MYPLAYALINDA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and made no impact.

five-sixteenths, drew off under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, widened under a continued strong hand ride into the final sixteenth then was eased up
while much the best. TEN CENT TOWN pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, lost touch with the winner late on that

three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. BOBBY THE TANK broke out then was corrected by the rider, chased
the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and weakened then drifted in around the sixteenth-pole but was clear

near the rear of the field, tipped four wide down the backstretch in pursuit, got coaxed along with half a mile to go and continued four wide through the far
turn before angling five to six wide into upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors safe from the rest. CREATIVE MINISTER just
off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under coaxing along the fence with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from home, then flattened out in the late stages. A. P.'S SECRET bobbled awkwardly at the start
and came under coaxing to establish the front regardless, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled as a rival latched on briefly with five
furlongs remaining, shook off that rival once more into the far turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under
threat, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to run and weakened in the late stages. WESTERN RIVER grew detached at the tail of field early on just off
the inside, came under coaxing at the half mile pole, tipped out three to four wide with seven-sixteenths to go to circle the backing away BE BETTER, swung
four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. GOLDEN GLIDER coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased
three wide from just off the pace coming under urging at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. MAKE IT BIG

Footnotes
DANCING BUCK settled comfortably near the middle of the field, was roused in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, rallied on the
outside under a strong hand-ride, closed fast to get the lead inside the furlong marker, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and was eased up in the final
strides while best. COMEDY TOWN moved in early then was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, waited while blocked behind the
leading duo from the quarter-pole to the eighth-pole, was asked while finding room in the two path at that juncture as NOBLE EMOTION was pulled out a
path, came between foes shortly thereafter and finished willingly for the place. FAUCI bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, moved from
the two path to the four path around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just miss the place while clear for the show.
LYRICAL POET brushed the inside of the gate at the start then was hustled to the lead, showed the way on the inside while under pressure, vied along the
rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, was put to the crop outside the furlong marker, lost the lead to
the winner inside that marker and weakened. NOBLE EMOTION prompted the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, was asked near the
quarter-pole then came under a drive, dropped back while guided out a path into the final furlong and tired. RUNNINGWSCISSORS was last to commence,
settled on the far outside under some urging, went three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. KOBE
TOUGH settled in the back half of the field, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. SPIRIT ANIMAL was urged along towards the rear, moved
from three to five wide around the turn, dropped in under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor. MUCH BETTER was urged along early then taken in
hand while off heels briefly near the nine-sixteenths, quickly came back under urging while moving out some, went two then three wide around the turn,
chased into upper stretch and capitulated. ANACONDA bumped hard with a foe at the start, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide
into the stretch, moved out while behind foes in the final sixteenth and never reached contention.

Footnotes
ON THE HILL pressed the pace of LIFE CHANGER to the outside three then two wide advancing to take over command five-sixteenths from home, got set
down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. LIFE CHANGER coaxed from the gate, showed the way from the
two path under pressure from the get go from the aforementioned foe, tucked inside through the turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths
getting displaced from command at that station, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. CHARGER three paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and was patiently handled through the turn until let out spinning three wide for home,
dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. BALTASAR coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just
off the inside through the turn, angled four wide for home and weakened in the late going. QUICK TO BLAME coaxed from the start, chased just off the
inside early on before tipping four then three wide, went five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. NICHOLAS JAMES coaxed from the gate,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, angled five to six wide at the head of the stretch and
tired. DARK TIMBER stumbled badly falling to his face at the start planting the rider flat on his back, got apprehended by outrider after completing the
course sans rider and walked off under his own power. There was a general Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on DARK TIMBER before the result
stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY ROCKETTE came away in good order, stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, took the lead while asked at the quarter-pole then
moved clear into upper stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. STELLA MARS went three wide around the first turn,
settled on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, gained into the final
sixteenth, swapped back to her inside lead late and missed while able to get the place. LADY OF THOROTON bumped with a rival early while rank then
was taken up into the first turn, continued rank under restraint while saving ground on that bend, was reserved towards the rear, moved from the two path to
the four path while roused on the final turn, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with late energy for the show. HUNTRESS MOON went to the front,
showed the way on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead into the stretch and weakened but just held the last spot in the superfecta.
ROSEMARY POTATOES lost her footing slightly at the start but came out towards the front, saved ground on the first turn, was well placed in third position,
drafted in the two path around the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. BUILT
DIFFERENT went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved closer in the four path on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. VOICE OF SPRING was reserved under restraint on the inside, came under some coaxing on the far turn, was asked for her
best in upper stretch and failed to rally. IN MY WAKE bumped with SHAOLIN early, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the
two path on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the needed response. FRENCH FRANC
(FR) went three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, traveled three wide while roused on the far turn, was carried out near the sixteenth-pole
and also failed to rally. RADIANT GEM bumped with a foe at the start, bumped with foes nearing the first turn then was taken up, rounded that bend in the
two path, settled more kindly on the backstretch, moved from three to five wide around the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, moved out in the drive
then was carried out late and failed to threaten. SHAOLIN bumped with a foe at the start, was taken in hand early then bumped with IN MY WAKE, went
three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, shifted five wide at the quarter-pole, moved out in the stretch, was
forced out late and also failed to threaten. MORE MANGO bumped with a rival in traffic nearing the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was
reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out into the final furlong, paused while having her path
taken near the sixteenth-pole and was no factor.
