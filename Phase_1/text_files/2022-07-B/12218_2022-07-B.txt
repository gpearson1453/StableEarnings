Footnotes
SPEEDY FELLAR stalked the pace along the inside then moved up two wide to engage KILLEEN for the lead at the quarter pole, vied outside of rival
through the lane and edged away late under a driving finish. KILLEEN set the pace and continued clear into the far turn, took on the challenge from
SPEEDY FELLAR at the quarter pole, dueled inside of rival into the final furlong and got edged out. FOXY ACE tracked the early pace, chased the top pair
three wide around the far turn then flattened in the lane. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was well reserved racing in the back, came two wide into the upper
stretch and improved position without threatening. ROCK CITY ROADHOG settled off the pace in early stages, came under a ride mid-way around the far
turn and failed to rally. TRUE SAINT tracked the pace two wide through the backstretch, hustled up into the far turn, failed to move on and steadily faded.
MINE MY TIME was forwardly placed through the backstretch then retreated around the final turn.

MY FIRST PEARL tracked the early pace, hustled up three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and drew clear in the final furlong. BLAZE
AWAY N HIDE dueled for the lead inside of ITALIAN JUSTICE, shook free at the head of the lane, battled on under firm handling a furlong out then got
overtaken approaching the final sixteenth. ITALIAN JUSTICE dueled outside of BLAZE AWAY N HIDE in opening stages and continued to battle around the
turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but kept on and captured show. VOODAYO tracked the pace along the inside, launched a rail bid at the
head of the lane, raced in contention then yielded and got edged for show. EURO ME steadied after the start then sat off the top two flights heading into the
turn, hustled along four wide into the lane and failed to move on. SPANX LEGACY raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to respond.

BIG IF TRUE dueled for the lead three wide through the backstretch, battled on with LAURIEANN around the far turn, shook free at the head of the lane and
held late under a driving finish. EUTYCHIA was reserved and raced in the back of the pack, picked up the tempo midway around the far turn, set down two
to three wide for the drive, responded and was getting to the winner late. FIRST EMPRESS tracked the top trio through the backstretch, hustled up four
wide midway around the far turn, sustained outside bid in the lane and gained show. TAKE ME AS I AM vied inside of rivals then edged back into tracking
position midway through the backstretch, launched a rebid midway around the far turn, chased up close then flattened out upper stretch and ran on evenly.
LAURIEANN dueled for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle with the winner around the far turn then came up empty a furlong out.

COWBOY CASANOVA set the early pace, shook off the inside bid from rival late on the turn, widened to a commanding margin and stayed sharp under
steady urging. LORD OF THE PALACE tracked the pace in early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn, stayed on two to three wide through the
lane and held place. CHINLEE rated off the second flight, was ridden four wide around the turn, sustained outside bid through the lane and cleared the rest.
STORMIN' J. J. raced in range, urged inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and gave way. LANCELOT N ELAINE roused forward along the
inside to challenge rival for the lead entering the turn, raced up close past the quarter pole then faded. FOR ME LET IT BE raced up close in early stages
then faded around the turn. TAP THE BRAKES raced in the back, came four to five wide into the lane and had no response.

NOT ROCKET SCIENCE was well rated and settled through early stages, picked up the pace along the inside late on the turn, edged closer then tipped two
wide for the drive and edged away in the final sixteenth. GONE WITH THE FINN set the uncontested pace, held firm around the turn, continued with the
advantage a furlong out then got reeled in late. SAY IT NICELY was forwardly placed racing just off the leader, chased three wide around the turn then
sustained a mild bid for a share. ABOUT OUR TIME chased midpack into the turn, hustled along four wide and failed to move on in the lane. MAFIA DON
raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. DAAHERS BULLY raced in contention soon after the start, continued up close around
the turn then faded. APPLICANT raced off the pace, urged two wide around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
DIAMOND RIM raced in the back at the start then steadily advanced through the backstretch, chased four wide around the turn, sustained bid into the lane,
cleared command approaching the sixteenth pole and finished going away. BIG THORN tracked the leader into the turn, moved up two wide at the quarter
pole, held a slim lead at the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner and finished clearly second best. JACKMAN set the early pace and held clear
around the turn, got collared by BIG THORN in the upper stretch and gave way. RARE STRIPE hustled along in steady pursuit, chased four wide around
the turn and failed to move on. CHICKS DIG SCARS lacked speed and raced in the back, urged along the outside entering the lane and passed tiring foes.
WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW raced in range, chased along the rail around the turn then faded. HIDDEN RULER urged three wide and failed to move into
contention. D'FEVER showed brief response in early stages then retreated.

Footnotes
HOPING FOR A RING dueled inside of WINZE for the lead around the first turn, continued to battle for command around the far turn, shook free at the
furlong marker then widened advantage and finished clear. WINZE dueled inside of HOPING FOR A RING through the backstretch, continued to battle into
upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner past the furlong but stayed on for second best. SASSY AIN'T I settled through early stages then
moved up the inside entering the far turn, tipped three wide and given cue at the head of the lane, sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared the
rest. SWEET LAURA was unhurried and raced in the back, urged three to four wide around the far turn and gained position without threatening. BLACK
KAT TAPS raced in the second flight through the backstretch, flattened out around the far turn and continued to tire in the drive. GLAMOROUS LIFE tracked
the top flight through the backstretch then came up empty around the final turn.
