Footnotes
NO BURN broke out then was coaxed to establish early position, raced in the three path around the opening bend, turned onto the backstretch under some
extra left-rein pressure, prompted the pace on the outside, lugged out late near the half-mile pole, took the lead in the three path outside the three-eighths,
moved clear under extra left-rein pressure at the quarter-pole then came under a right-handed crop into upper stretch, drifted out into the final furlong, was
given one final pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand ride while widening to the wire. PALACE COUP broke very
fast and went straight to the front, dropped to the two path into the first turn then was taken under a snug hold, moved to the rail late on that bend, showed
the way with company to his outside, lost the lead to the winner outside the three-eighths, dropped back under pressure into the stretch and proved no
match while able to get the place. PERCEIVED went around the first turn in the three path, settled towards the back, was roused near the half-mile pole,
traveled around the far turn in the two path under urging, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the
bronze honors. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS broke a bit awkwardly then was hustled, came out into the first turn, moved from the two path to the four path
around that bend, tracked outside down the backstretch, came under a strong-hand ride before the half-mile pole, chased four wide around the far turn and
weakened. KUMAR was hustled from the gate, saved ground around the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, was urged along passing the
half-mile pole, raced inside early on the far turn then shifted three wide, came four wide into the stretch then drifted further out and faltered. BLAKE B.
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, fell well behind the rest of the field on the backstretch and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
V MART broke in at the start then came in early which carried KBCYA LATER inward, straightened momentarily for two strides then came in a bit more
causing the aforementioned rival to shy into other opponents, showed the way in the two path, vied inside of a foe around the turn, shook clear near the
quarter-pole, drew off under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, drifted out under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, shied inward when shown the crop
on the right-side outside the sixteenth-pole, shied in abruptly when flashed with a right-handed crop again then was wrapped up in the final seventy yards
while much the best. CLEAR THE DECK was urged along off the pace, dropped back four wide on the turn, was carried six wide into the stretch and just
earned the place while no match for the winner. KBCYA LATER was carried in by V MART at the start then straightened briefly, shied in when V MART
came in some again early then bumped with FORBIDDEN SECRET, steadied while bumping again with that rival near the nine-sixteenths, moved up to
make an outside bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired then just lost the place but
was clear for the show. RUN POPPY ducked in at the start then was straightened by the rider, was bumped early then hit the rail and checked, moved out
off the pace, was urged two then three wide around the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. FORBIDDEN SECRET
veered in at the start then was straightened by the rider, was bumped between foes early then steadied, raced under tight restraint while bumping again with
a foe off heels around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.
FOURFAITH was fractious behind the gate, broke out and hit the gate, raced on the outside under urging, was caught five wide early on the turn, dropped
back then moved to the three path before the five-sixteenths, reached close to the two path before the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
JEREMY'S JET came away in good order, angled in while going to the front, showed the way while getting pressure from the outside after the opening
furlong, vied inside to the two path while still inside that foe around the turn, shook clear into the stretch then responded well when was roused near the
three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed crop while drawing off at the eighth-pole, widened while switched to a left-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole
then was placed under a hand-ride late while much the best. A WESTERN YARN bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went
around the turn in the four path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no threat to the winner. BARZINI bumped with a
rival at the start then was hustled, paused off heels outside the nine-sixteenths when the pacesetter crossed in front behind the hedge on the pan-camera
view, chased the pace from that point, dropped back into the turn, went three then four wide around that bend, spun five wide into the stretch then drifted
further out and tired. THREE ZERO stumbled at the start, moved up then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired. IN DETAIL was bumped hard at the start then taken up some and slow into stride, spotted the front a few lengths,
was urged along towards the back, went five wide around the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and was no factor. CARA'S PRINCE broke in and bumped
hard with a foe, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond.

PRACTICE SQUAD saved ground near the rear of the compact field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out and took over command at that station, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside, knocked heads
through the final sixteenth to the finish and gamely prevailed at the end. DAKOTA GOLD three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the eighth pole to engage the
aforementioned foe in head to head combat through to the finish in game fashion but was ultimately denied on the wire. COINAGE coaxed from the gate,
attended the leader latched on under rating to the outside in the two path, applied little to no pressure through sensible splits until commencing an advance
three furlongs from home, steadily intensified the pressure on STOP THE SPREAD through the latter portion of the far turn coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, took command swinging three wide into upper stretch at that station, dug in under threat from flanking challengers and was collared just
outside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. SUNDAESWITHSANDY broke in a step at the start bumping
STOP THE SPREAD, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four then three wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild bid a furlong from home, then flattened out in the late going. STOP THE SPREAD got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, showed the way
rated along the inside under the watchful eye of COINAGE latched on to the outside but facing little pressure until three furlongs from home, had COINAGE
advance inside that station and came under urging at the five-sixteenths in response, yielded the front taking the inside route at the quarter pole and
weakened in the stretch.

moved to the two path while asked late on the turn, came three wide into the stretch under the crop, moved in while in pursuit of the leader outside the

stretch, maintained the advantage under a drive to just before the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the show. BINSKY bumped with a
rival at the start, was urged along near the back on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail around the turn,

around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and also improved position but failed to impact. GEORGEES SPIRIT was hustled from the start, chased the
pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, battled to near the
sixteenth-pole and weakened. SUGAR MAMAS CAKERY bumped with an opponent at the start, settled under some urging, went two then three wide on the
