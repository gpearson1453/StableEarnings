Footnotes
DESTINIQUE broke in slightly to start, tracked the leader throughout, loomed up to begin her bid for the lead at the quarter pole, started to wear down her
rival down mid stretch and took command at the sixteenth pole inching away at the finish. PRETTY RACHEL was away sharply to lead, had command
through the turn, tried to open up mid stretch but was collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole and gave way nearing the wire. NORTHERN RUBY
stalked outside of foes mid pack early, advanced three wide on the turn, could not quicken enough to threaten the top two running for home but ran on well
the be a clear third. PINO IN A PURSE stalked on the fence down the backstretch, lost ground to the leaders on the turn and ran evenly to the wire for a
minor share. PLUIE D'AVRIL rated near the back in the beginning, was roused on the turn and could not be a factor throughout the stretch run. I'LL TAKE
THE GOLD trailed early on inside, was angled outside for the stretch run and could not gain on rivals down the lane.

Footnotes
STARLIGHT RIDGE rated early off the leaders, raced outside the second flight four wide on the turn, came out five to six deep at the top of the stretch, was
in command by the three-sixteenths, quickly kicked clear and held well. WICKED MIAH raced two to three wide between runners off the pace into the turn,
came out in the stretch, was game for the place. ISHIYAYA set the pace racing off the rail, kept on but was outfinished for second while saving show
honors. BAYOU BELLE settled at the rear, went two to three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, ran on willingly but missed third. DANGER
pressed the pacesetter going three wide on the turn, was in contention in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. TEACHER'S PET tracked near the
inside on or just off the rail, failed to rally. SUPER LUNAR stalked early, was given encouragement three to four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT SCARLET was well rationed on the front end leading throughout and had enough left in reserve late to just hold on for the narrow win. WHO SAYS
was stalking near the back on the fence in the beginning, angled out at the three eighths pole to commence her rally between runners, was five wide
entering the stretch battling with rivals around her and showed grit gaining steadily on the winner at the wire. JOLENE JOLENE was last between runners to
start, began circling horses on the far turn while six wide, loomed into contention at the three sixteenths marker but stalled outside in the final stages to
settle for third money. BLU SKY SUNRISE was three wide entering the first turn, chased the winner down the backside, was roused to keep up at the three
eighths pole and weakened in the stretch for a minor placing. FORESTERS PRINCESS went four wide into the first turn, was mid pack outside through the
backstretch, ridden while three wide on the far turn offering a mild bid nearing the quarter pole and levelled out the final eighth of a mile. PRACTICAL
GIZMO saved ground throughout, tracked leader on the backstretch, retreated inside on the far turn and little to offer down the lane.

Footnotes
STRIKING MOON set the pace racing off the inside, drifted out through the stretch, struck a rival with the crop in late stretch after a long and hard drive and
just held. MALIBU UPROAR stalked just off the leading pair racing outside three to four wide through the turn and coming into the stretch five deep, made a
bid in mid-stretch, was carried out and hit with the leader's crop late while fighting on hard to just miss. ANALYZER stalked the pacesetter in behind off the
inside, came into the stretch three wide, was in tight quarters about the furlong marker, altered in late and held show honors. DECIMATOR raced off the
leaders in the back half of the field, went three to four wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, altered in for room about the furlong pole, ran on
and missed third. SEGUIMI broke a step slowly, was coaxed forward inside racing on or just off the rail, came out three wide in the stretch and improved
position. LAPOCHKA switched out early, raced four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, needed more. SELFMADE was up close tracking
inside, weakened in the stretch. SWAMP SOUFFLE broke in the air, trailed and was never a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH, STRIKING MOON WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND BEHIND MALIBU UPROAR FOR INTERFERENCE LATE.

SUNRISE DRIVE was allowed to settle near the back early, started to advance outside at the quarter pole, angled out to the six path for the drive and found
his best stride late getting up with seventy yards to go widening in the end. MAD DOG N JOE took command into the first turn, repelled a mild bid at the
three eighths pole, opened up turning for home but could not hold off a late closing charge outside in the final sixteenth while drifting outwards the final
sixteenth. AMMUNITION advanced past runners down the backstretch, began circling rivals at the quarter pole, loomed into contention entering the stretch,
was steadied between horses at the seventy yard pole and ran on to be a clear third. JUST START ME UP chased the pacesetter into the first turn, pressed
the leader at the three eighths pole, was repelled but fought on between runners down the stretch to hold on to a minor award. UNILATERAL was off slowly
to trail, angled out in the seven path for the run to the finish and passed tiring horses in the late stages. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE stalked near the back early
on, advanced between runners down the backstretch and levelled out on the rail for the drive. RUNNINFORCOVER was hard ridden between foes at the
quarter pole and weakened through the field down the lane. JMR PURE SENSATION was tracking inside to start, waited on the rail on the far turn, roused
at the quarter pole and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL #8 AMMUNITION AGAINST #5 MAD DOG N JOE FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE VICINITY OF THE SEVENTY YARD POLE RESULTED IN #5 MAD DOG N JOE DISQUALIFIED FROM 2ND AND PLACED
3RD.

SWIRLING CANDY was fractious behind the gate, got away alertly, was overtaken and pressed that rival from inside, bid up the rail taking command by the
quarter pole, was quickly clear and held well under moderate urging. SILENT GUROO switched out heading into the turn, went three to four wide on most of
that bend, swung six deep into upper stretch, showed good late energy to get up for second late. MY FINAL TRICK broke outwardly slightly bothering rivals,
stalked the pace just off the leaders going three then four wide on the turn, lost second late. NICE COMPANY tracked the leaders, saved ground on the
turn, had room inside at the top of the stretch, evened out in the lane. GELATO AMORE raced mid-pack outside going three wide on the turn, shifted five
wide turning for home, ran on evenly. LEON AZUL shifted out in the early going then altered back inside entering the turn, saved ground and ran on evenly.
MORE SAVVY tossed the head at the break and was also forced out, trailed early, passed tried rivals. ROSE RING went four wide on the turn and failed to
rally. CLASSY N' SILENT moved forward to take the lead soon after the break forcing the pace two wide into the turn, gave way once headed.

Footnotes
BASALT STREET took command at the start, surrendered the lead on the rail at the quarter pole, fought back to reclaim the lead at the eighth pole and had
enough to hold on at the wire. SPEEDY LYNN stalked mid pack on the outside through the turn, waited behind runners entering the stretch, angled out five
wide for the run down the lane and closed well on the outside getting up for second nearing the wire. STERLING SPEED chased the leader while three wide
on the turn, loomed at the top of the stretch to contend for the lead, led briefly at the three sixteenth pole and faded nearing the finish losing second late.
SPIDER BELLE was behind runners looking for room throughout the entire stretch, finally got clear to the outside in the late part of the race and closed for a
minor share. FEDALIA chased the pace between runners through the turn, led momentarily at the quarter pole and weakened in the last eighth of a mile.
FLIPPIN tracked inside on the fence through the turn and ran evenly on the rail to the wire. WINYAH BAY was near the back between horses throughout the
turn, angled out in the six path for the stretch run and offered no finish. WAR EMPRESS was steadied slightly on the fence going into the turn, shuffled back
to trail and could not become a factor down the lane. ELEANOR POWELL trailed in the beginning, made a mild run while five wide on the turn and stalled
through the stretch.
