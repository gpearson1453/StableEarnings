Footnotes
WEAREINITTOWINIT dueled on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to continue to battle from the two path around the turn and into upper stretch and
pulled clear in the final furlong. STILLWATER BROWN chased the leaders between horses, raced into slight traffic from the two path headed into the turn,
swung to the outside entering the stretch and gained ground while drifting late. SILENT SAILOR dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening
quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, continued to battle in the lane and gave way late. SIR BARNABUS trailed the field up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. JEROMIEO pressed the pace on the outside in the early going, raced in the four path
around the turn, and flattened out from there. UNCLE AL'S PAL was away from the gate slowly, settled at the back of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. LANAKILA dropped back to race off the pace in the opening stages, navigated the turn from
the two path and offered no bid. WILDCAT SKY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and
was empty in the stretch. AN OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP, STILLWATER BROWN, CITING INTERFERENCE BY THE
WINNER, WEAREINITTOWINIT, ON THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

STYLIN N PROFILIN raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn,
slipped through a narrow hole on the rail entering the stretch, took command and stayed clear to the wire. SPEEDY ENOUGH pressed the pace on the
inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the far turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch and chased
that rival home while drifting out late. PRANCE raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began a four
wide passing the three eighths pole and was outkicked in the lane. BRAHMS IS WHO trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile,
raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground late on the outside from there. MILLIGANMIKEANDME raced in
the three path around the first turn, chased the frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, moved up the challenge from the three path coming around
the far turn and weakened late. CHA led the way under a snug hold around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and tired in the stretch.

position on the outside in late stretch while never threatening. BUXTERHOOTER raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch
in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the lane but was never a threat. BONITA

Footnotes
EXETER saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid
nearing the quarter pole, dueled while drifting down the lane and got up for the win in the final strides. SIERRA HOTEL raced in the two path around the first
turn, tracked the frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dueled outside in the stretch to just miss. MR. WHO
pressed the pace from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled in the two path around the far turn and into the stretch and finished
well. SIDE STREET DAVE led the way from the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and raced gamely in the stretch,
getting caught late. CHOCOLATEICECREAM was forced back leaving the gate, saved ground at the back of the pack in the early going, switched to the
outside to race in the three path around the far turn and gained ground from there in late stretch. UNBROKEN SONG saved ground around the first turn,
raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and improved position mildly in the lane. KRAMDEN raced
off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn still in the two path and came up empty from there. P CLUB raced in the
three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn
and made no bid. SEEKING REFUGE trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the
second bend and was never a factor. HATCHET CREEK raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and tired in the lane.

missed. ARDANWOOD raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path
passing the three eighths pole and chased the top two home. DON'T BOX ME IN led the way from the three path around the first turn and up the

Footnotes
LESLIE'S GOLD led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and held clear to the wire.
HPNOTIQ RHYTHM stalked the leaders on the outside in the early going, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and chased the winner
home, the best of the rest. DAREABIGDREAM raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began to improve position from the three
path racing around the turn and finished evenly. COURAGEOUS TIMMY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground mildly in the lane. SHINBORO raced in the middle of the pack
between horses in the opening stages, came around the turn in the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and finished evenly. SR. BOM BON pressed
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. BRASKA trailed well behind the field while racing up
the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses from there. NACHO S tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, began to
drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the lane. ELUSIVE FREUD chased the frontrunners between horses up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch.
