Footnotes
KHAIKY'S COMMAND away well and set the pace from along the rail entering the first turn, continued to race on an uncontested lead from along the rail in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while proving clearly best. QUAGMIRE broke sharply and
tracked the leader one out from the rail in the run down the backside, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail
in the drive to prove second best. TIZ MEOW tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the
final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive to garner a share. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT stalked the leader from along the inside in the run down the
backside, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon over the final furlong. ADITYA was taken in hand and
dropped back to trail in the run to the first turn, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the lane while unable to
pose a serious late threat. AVE'S IN COMMAND stalked the leader while racing four wide in the run down the backstretch, continued three out from the rail
entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
VISENYA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, shook clear of her pace rival entering the lane, and held SLOOP JOHN BE safely at bay late to prevail. SLOOP JOHN B broke sharply and stalked
the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, lost a bit of ground on the pacesetters entering the backstretch, loomed a
danger while commencing her three wide bid entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. BETTER
TONE settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time well off the leaders in the run down the
backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. DR. BENNY settled off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive.
HANKY PRANKY settled well off the early leaders while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, raced four wide into the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SILK STILETTOS was off a step slow, but engaged the leader two wide midway through the first
turn, forced the issue from the outside of VISENYA in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival leaving the
turn, and weakened in the drive. The one mile split for this race was currently unavailable

Footnotes
KOALA broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final
turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and quickly drew clear while being ridden out late. ICE BREAKER settled well off the early pace while racing three
wide into the backstretch, commenced her bid two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the lane to prove second best,
while no threat to the winner. COUNTESS CAT away well and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overhauled leaving the turn, and had little left for the drive while holding on for a share. GROOVY GIRL
settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide from between
rivals in deep stretch. DEVINE DANCING away alertly and tracked the pacesetter three wide in the run down the backstretch, continued to chase the leader
two wide into the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. ANAAMY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing four out from the rail in the drive. DON'T TESS ME settled off the early pace while saving ground
at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground at the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon.

Footnotes
LASTING LIGHT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, tipped four wide entering the final turn to launch her bid, collared the leaders entering the lane,
and quickly assumed command, while finishing four wide in the drive to prove best. KICK UP THE DUST broke sharply and stalked the leader in the run
down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, lacked room through the turn, shifted
three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to get up for the place in the closing strides. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY tracked the leader into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly one out from the rail entering the final turn, took a brief lead leaving the turn, was no match for the winner in
the lane, and just failed to hold the place. BOUNDFORJAMAICA tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly
three wide entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. THE KAT'S BACK settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering
the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, but needed more late while finishing four out from the rail in the stretch drive. DEFINITE PLEASURE
away alertly and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was
overtaken midway through the turn, and stopped badly in the late stages.

Footnotes
BABY GRAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run down
the backside, maintained his advantage into the final turn, and fended off the closers late to prevail. ONE FIFTY ONE away well and stalked the leader
through the stretch the first time while racing three out from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to get the place. ERLICH stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at
the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the drive to garner a
share. FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply, but took back of BABY GRAND entering the first turn to take a two wide tracking trip into the lane the first time,
maintained his position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide from between rivals through the final turn, but needed more late when called upon.
JACOBS CALL tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held a striking position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response over the final furlong. WALKINTHEWALK unhurried early while settling well
off the early pacesetter entering the stretch the first time, trailed the field in the run down the backstretch, swung five wide entering the final turn, and
finished eight wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. DEBATABLE settled well off the early pace while racing two wide into the stretch the first
time, was always well back, and showed little.

Footnotes
AIRAFFAIR away well and pressed the pace from the outside of REPRIMAND in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide
through the final turn, and prevailed in the final strides over a very determined pace rival. REPRIMAND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and just missed. PADDY D'ORO
tracked the leaders from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished best of all late while
getting up for a share. KNOPFLER unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering
the final turn, swung six wide entering the lane, and improved his position in the late going. RACING RIVER tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch
while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away alertly
and was allowed to settle well off the contested pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. THE CHANCES R rushed up three wide in the run tot he first turn, before landing into a tracking trip
from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS ANGUS away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace while under a snug hold in the run
down the backstretch, maintained a clear advantage through the final turn, and was never threatened late while being ridden out in deep stretch. THE ALL
BUTTON broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and continued
one out from the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. COULTERBERRY unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, began to pick up
the pace in the run to the final turn, rallied from just off the rail through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. BODEGA
stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon over the final furlong. MASTER EWEN settled well off the early pacesetter while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, raced two wide through the turn, but was only able to pass a tiring rival over the final furlong. TRUPON
ONLINE stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to maintain his position in the run to the final turn, and weakened
over the final furlong.
