FIRECRACKER STAND sped to the lead at the start and showed the way around the turn, came two wide into the upper stretch, dug in under right handed
pressure and held late. MY BOY GUS tracked the leaders around the turn then launched a three wide bid at the head of the lane, steadily edged up closer
and gained on the leader in final stages. RUBIGINOUS was allowed to settle off the early pace, hustled up four wide heading into the lane, gathered
momentum under pressure in the final furlong and finished with good response. HANDSOME HUNTER chased after the leader around the turn, sustained a
two wide bid for the eventual winner into the lane then came up empty in the final sixteenth. VISION OF ELIAS chased two to three wide into the turn then
retreated in the lane.

SNAP AWAY held a slim lead in opening stages and raced on top under pressure around the turn, repelled several challengers through the lane and held
gamely. LIL DITTY'S KITTY rated off the early pace, swung four wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and captured place. FAST SOPHIA came away
last then roused forward into contention, was patiently handled along the inside around the turn, given cue along the rail at the head of the lane, advanced
into striking distance a furlong out then yielded. FIREY EMBLEM tracked the pace into the turn, raced three wide in aim at the quarter pole, hustled along
into the upper stretch and ran on evenly in the final furlong. CYCLONE SORORITY prompted the pace soon after the start and forced the issue around the
turn then gave way. WICKED CHOCOLATE raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ARKANSAS INVASION raced in the last
flight, swung five wide into the lane and failed to respond.

in gamely along the inside in the final furlong, found another kick left in reserve and edged away. MR. SOLO cleared the lead out of the gate then hooked up
with BLAME ELI heading into the first turn, dueled for command while racing clear over the rest, battled on into the lane and got denied late. MAKABIM was
a step slow at the start and rated off the clear top pair through the backstretch, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and ran on for a share.
TWO GUNS settled off the clear top pair in early stages, was ridden along midway through the backstretch, sustained a three wide bid around the far turn
and got edged for show. RECORDER was well reserved racing in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to rally. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS)

Footnotes
ALL OVER OLIVER sped to the lead at the start and held clear over rivals around the turn, widened advantage under pressure in the upper stretch, widened
to a commanding lead and finished in hand. POE MANS RIDE was forwardly placed soon after the start and chased three wide around the turn, sustained a
bid through the lane and finished second best. STAR OF MINE hustled along three wide around the turn, angled inside at the head of the lane and ran on
for a share. NATIVE HELLRAISER hopped and got bumped at the start, lacked early speed, roused three wide into the lane and improved position.
LUCKYAPRIL chased four to five wide and lacked a needed rally. STROLLN DOWN WELCH raced off the early pace, came two to three wide into the lane
and never threatened. HE'S A SHOWBOAT raced up close around the turn and came up empty a furlong out. WE'RE ALL NUTS raced just off the eventual
winner around the turn then retreated. TAIL OF SAMSON failed to move into contention.
