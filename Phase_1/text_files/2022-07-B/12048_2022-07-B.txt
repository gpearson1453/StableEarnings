LINCHPIN STORM stalked inside, swung four to five wide at the head of the lane, closed steadily and was along with time. MR. ARTISTIC attended the
pace from the three path, overtook the lead near the five sixteenth marker then moved clear, and was rundown late stretch. GRAY ADMIRAL stalked four to
five wide, roused at the quarter pole then went evenly through the stretch. BARE BACK JACK raced from the back of the pack, swung outside in the final
turn, and bid belatedly. YORKTOWN vied inside, was overtaken and faded. MY LUCKY MARK sat mid pack in the three path, and tired.

Footnotes
CUBAN COBRA was quickest to the turn, opened up through the stretch under a confident hand ride and won easily. FASTESTGIRLINTOWN vied inside
for the early lead, chased inside through the stretch but was no match for the winner and finished second best. WELL PLAYED broke slow, advanced
outside in the far turn, and was unable to improve position through the drive. SUBLIME EUPHORIA hurried away, steadied then clipped heels with
FASTESTGIRLINTOWN, and chased to no avail. SMART CAT hesitated leaving, and trailed throughout. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted
an inquiry into the start of the race involving SMART CAT but made no change as SMART CAT was deemed to have had a fair start. *STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the run away from the gate involving SUBLIME EUPHORIA. After review of the films it was determined
that FASTESTGIRLINTOWN cause interference to SUBLIME EUPHORIA and was disqualified and placed fourth.

EVER TRUE broke alertly then quickly took command, remained unchallenged into the stretch and was ridden out. BURNING LOVE brushed ACE OF
DIAMONDS leaving, sat off the pace from the three path, loomed boldly near the three sixteenth pole but was no match for the winner and refused a
challenge from WEEKEND WIZARD late stretch. WEEKEND WIZARD settled outside early, came under urging after the quarter pole, angled in sharply
towards the rail, rallied inside then weakened in the final yards. ITS ALL ON SLEW tracked inside, lodged bid and failed to threaten in the stretch.
BOLSANO lacked a bid. ACE OF DIAMONDS brushed leaving the gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
ROOKIE YEAR raced five wide leaving the opening turn, stalked the pacesetters from the four path through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader
nearing the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch and prevailed under a long hard drive. SPORTSCARR set a pressured pace outside of CHASKA,
gained a short lead in the far turn, responded to challenge from ROOKIE YEAR, dueled determinedly inside and was out finished. CHASKA threw head
leaving the opening turn, pressed the pace from a rail position, dropped back in the far turn, shifted out to the three path approaching the stretch, and was
unable to muster the kicked that was needed to get by. LONE PIONEER raced three wide into the turn, was asked to quicken into the final turn, and closed
late. DREADNAUGHT reserved off the pacesetters early, and lacked a serious bid. LONESOME CAT sat mid pack outside, and faded gradually.
SHIMSHINE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STEVIE WONDER GIRL contested the early pace inside of GET BAKK, inherited the lead with three furlongs remaining, opened up into the stretch and was
kept under urging to an easy victory. AMBER PRINCESS saved ground along the rail, swung three to four wide at the head of the lane, angled to the rail
and closed well to secure place. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL rated well off the pace, gained closer order nearing the quarter pole, angled to the rail and rallied late
for show. SOPHIE MCTROPHY raced in closest pursuit, and flattened out in the stretch. TOP DEMON was not a factor. GET BAKK contended the pace
through the backstretch, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and yielded. SCARLETTE ROSE never involved.

COUNT ON IT settled outside in the backstretch, hustled on the final turn, bid steadily into the stretch and won driving. JAGEN broke outward then quickly
went to the front, showed the way into the stretch, and weakened late stretch. WICKED WOMAN returned to paddock for a tack adjustment, lacked early
speed, and rallied inside through stretch to earn show. BEAR WARNING hustled away, was under a snug hold into the far turn, and flattened out in stretch.
MUSICAL RELOAD sent for speed inside, and failed to menace in the drive. KENTUCKY ROLL chased throughout. HUMBOLDTSTRONG offered little.

NO COLLUSION settled outside early, circled into the lane, bid steadily outside and won driving. GO MAMA brushed leaving, tracked four wide, took closer
order the swung out leaving the final turn, was asked for more but failed to keep pace with the winner and settled for place honors. FLORIST settled inside,
rallied into the stretch and was out kicked. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE attended the pace while four wide, dueled outside of EDGE OF OKOTOKS through the
far turn, gained a slim advantage entering the stretch and flattened. CARRIE'S SUCCESS brushed leaving and bid belatedly. SHIP'S CREEK stalked the
pacesetters, and failed to threaten. FLASHY BIZ failed to menace. EDGE OF OKOTOKS set the early pace from the three path, dueled inside of
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE, and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
EXPLODE stalked inside, asked to quicken in the final turn, was set down into the stretch then split rivals, and narrowly prevailed. ZICATELA tracked the
pace while four wide, drove four wide into the stretch, battled determinedly outside of EXPLODE, gave one last push in the final yards and was narrowly
denied by the nose. BANG ON attended the pace from the two path, was headed into the lane, rallied inside and was out finished. SOLO RING broke
alertly, fanned four wide leaving the backstretch, and lacked the closing response that was required. SMARTY RIVER PANTS never far back, and lacked a
kick. SMART PLAY attended the pace, fanned three wide and was unable to keep pace with the field. EDDYSHAK contended the early pace inside,
dropped back in the final turn and gave way.
