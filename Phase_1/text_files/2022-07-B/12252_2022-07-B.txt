Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY pressed the early foe from the outside, took command near the three eighths pole, dug in deep stretch and prevailed in a determined effort
under strong handling. MRS. BEANS stalked the pace from the outside while racing three deep down the backstretch, took aim on the leader near the three
sixteenths pole but couldn't get by in a game effort. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT settled to the back of the pack early on, moved up through the far turn, swung out
five to six wide into the upper stretch and flattened out late. TWISTED DIXIE stalked the early pace, checked just past the five sixteenths pole, raced near
the inside at the quarter pole, continued its run from the inside had not enough. ROAMING UNION showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave
way while racing off the inside in the drive.

Footnotes
FLASH OF MISCHIEF pressed the early leader from the outside, moved up between rivals near the five sixteenths pole, had a narrow advantage and held
well in the stretch drive to edge clear late under strong encouragement. TONY'S TAPIT tracked the early pace while racing four wide, was ridden along near
the three eighths pole, raced off the inside in the stretch run and finished second best. FLATOUT WINNER stalked the early pace from the inside down the
backstretch, angled out through the stretch run to make a wide bid and was no match for the top pair. CENTRAL PARK showed good early foot to show the
early pace, weakened a bit through the far turn, angled out near the three sixteenths pole and weakened a bit late. SONNY SMACK was unhurried early on,
angled five wide through the upper stretch and lacked a bid. DAME PLATA settled off the early pace, raced near the inside through the far turn through the
upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
CHECKCASHINGCONNIE was quick to begin to set the early pace from the outside and raced well clear in the stretch run under steady handling. ANA was
off a step slow, coaxed along early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and was no match for the winner. SHARPENED chased the pace from the
outside, raced four to five through the upper stretch run and had no closing run on the top pair. JOMAMA SASSY was bumped, shuffle back at the break,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and not enough. GRACE A'LACE dropped back early, angled in, raced along the inside through the far turn
and had not enough. MISS CARMEN CIBO dropped back off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole, raced towards the outside in the lane
and had no response. BARBARA ROHLOFF bumped at the break, lacked early speed, raced widest through the stretch run and never threatened. LET ME
DOWN EASY was coaxed along early to lay up close and tired while racing from the outside.
