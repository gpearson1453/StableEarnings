Footnotes
NORTH SIDE quickly cleared, inched further away in the two path around the turn, and continued to widen under driving pressure through the lane.
AWESOME FAMILY chased the clear leader while inside of a foe and in the three path, then secured place in upper stretch while not threatening the leader.
FEELING DANGEROUS saved ground off of the pace, and improved a position along the rail in the final furlong. TILLIS pursued the clear leader while in
the four path and outside of a rival, but tired. BUBBA CABALLO was outrun.

Footnotes
WHAT A COUNTRY stalked four wide around the first turn, tucked to the two path while behind the leading trio down the backstretch, tipped back out to
rally four wide at the five sixteenths pole, but between horses at the quarter pole, and kicked away in upper stretch. PROTONIC POWER balked when
originally attempted to load and jogged away from the gate for a sixteenth of a mile before being reloaded without further incident, lagged behind the field
around the first turn, gained five wide around the far turn to bid along with an inner WHAT A COUNTRY at the quarter pole, but swiftly failed to keep pace
with that one in upper stretch, and proved second best. EL FRANCO tracked five wide around the first turn, tucked four wide down the backstretch, bid for
the lead outside of the top pair leaving the three furlong pole, quickly gained command soon after, but met a pair of outer challenges at the quarter pole,
yielded to them entering the lane, and weakened on his left lead. TWO COOKIE RULE dueled for the lead tow wide and between horses, but yielded
leaving the quarter pole. ZOFFA vied three wide, but faded between horses at the three furlong pole. ELI was hard sent after a flat-footed beginning to duel
inside of a pair of rivals into the first turn, but gave way to outer bidders at the five sixteenths pole, caved entering the lane, and was eased thereafter.

FRIAR LAURENCE stalked the top pair from the outside, backed a bit off of them approaching the far turn, inched closer under urging turning for home, bid
three wide at the quarter pole, battled with an inner CHASING TIME through upper stretch, then gained an advantage at the furlong pole, and kicked clear.

Footnotes
ZAPPLE prompted the pace three wide, gained an advantage at the three furlong pole, assumed command shortly after, then drew off stoutly under driving
pressure through midstretch before being wrapped up in the final sixteenth. EGOZ UNIT broke a beat slowly and raced far back in the two path around the
turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong to reach place nearing the wire. AREUOKWITHTHIS chased in the four path, bid
for place entering the lane after ZAPPLE asserted his dominance, sparred outside of pair of foes for that position through the lane, but was nailed by an
outer oncharging foe late. STORM RATE set a sternly pressured pace from a rival on either side into the turn, got headed by his outercounterpart while his
inner faltered at the three furlong pole, proved no match for that foe soon after, vied for place inside of a pair of rivals through the lane, but was bested.
HOLY FOLEY chased from the two path, vied for place between horses through the lane, but yielded late. FAST GAL settled far back in the three path, and
made little impact. BASILICA D ORO was last away, trailed along the inside, and was outrun. MIDNIGHT XO vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but
gave way at the three furlong pole, and stopped.

ON A SPREE set the pace, felt stern pressure from a pair of outer rivals entering the backstretch, continued to show the way from THRU THE VINE around
the far turn, shook clear of that foe nearing the lane, drew off entering it, then tired in the final furlong as EGO closed in, but lasted to the wire. EGO got
caught in the five path while towards the back of the pack around the first turn, picked up stride in the three path around the far turn, rallied while claiming
place from an outer foe in upper stretch, took aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, produced a late bid, but ran out of ground. THRU THE VINE vied
for the lead two wide and between horses down the backstretch, sustained pressure outside of the leader around the far turn, but proved no match for that
foe entering the lane, and tired. ALTERED was crowded between horses in the opening furlong, then failed to factor. FIRERY TALE prompted the pace
three wide, but weakened entering the far turn. JURISDICTION was outrun. UNIDENTIFIED MAN tracked the leading trio from the three to four path, but
faded around the far turn.

HONOR THAT set the pace in the two path while feeling mild outer pressure from a pair of foes, inched clear of them on her own power at the quarter pole,
was guided out to the four path entering the lane, remained clear while well in hand through midstretch as an inner MY MY MUNNY pursued, but felt a light
right handed crop entering the final sixteenth to seal the deal. MY MY MUNNY broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, gained along the rail to bid for
place inside of foes entering the lane, secured that position soon after, then chased the outer leader home to prove second best. THE CLUB chased outside
of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader while getting outmoved by an outer foe nearing the lane, vied
for show outside of LAURA'S CHARM through the final furlong, and prevailed. LAURA'S CHARM broke in subtly, pressed the pace two wide whilst between
horses in the three path, but failed to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, and tired after losing place to an inner foe in upper stretch. MONOCACY
broke a bit outwardly, trailed in the four path around the turn, and was outrun.

DOROTHEA set the pace along the inside, then from a path off of the rail while still encountering pressure, shook free of chasing foes entering the lane,
drew off in upper stretch, and held on with a diminishing margin through the closing stages. SWEET LADY IVANKA settled off of the pace along the inside,
moved to a two wide tracking position approaching the far turn, tipped out to the five path while progressing turning for home, chased a clearing
DOROTHEA through upper stretch, took aim on that foe while closing in strongly in the final sixteenth, but was belated. GUN MOLL tracked in the five path,
tucked three wide entering the backstretch, was urged along to pick up stride in the four path around the far turn, fanned six wide entering the lane, stalled in
upper stretch, but produced a good late kick in the final furlong, and reached show at the wire. FINE COTTON tracked four wide around the first turn, moved
forward to press the leading pair into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, got outkicked for place nearing the furlong
grounds, then got nailed at the wire for show. TEXAS LUCKY stalked three wide early on, tucked to the inside entering the backstretch, but only managed to
chase the leader through upper stretch, was outkicked for place approaching the furlong grounds, and faded. RUN UP THE SCORE pressed the pace two
wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. LANDED GENTRY broke slowly, raced at the rear in the six to four
path around the far turn, and made little impact. JUST GET IT never got involved. MARINA'S GOLD laid off of the in the six path, was urged along four wide
down the backstretch, then faded while wide around the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
MARKET RUMOR settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out and gained four wide around the far turn to bid at the quarter pole, dueled outside of
UNDISTURBED through the lane while multiple paths away, and prevailed in the closing stages. UNDISTURBED set the pace, felt pressure down the
backstretch and around the far turn, shook free of that foe while meeting MARKET RUMOR's challenge nearing the lane, gamely clung to an advantage
through upper stretch, battled tenaciously through the final furlong, but was bested late. DEMODOG broke a step slowly, tracked from midpack three wide,
but got outmoved by the eventual winner leaving the five sixteenths pole, stayed on in upper stretch to bid for show at the furlong grounds, and secured that
position soon after. FAIR GAME stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase along the rail through the lane. CAROLINE'S STORY broke a bit
outwardly, tracked along the inside, then two wide and between horses nearing the backstretch, but lacked a rally through the lane. JOY OF PAINTING
stalked two wide, moved to press the leader approaching the backstretch, sustained pressure around the far turn before MARKET RUMOR joined the fray at
the quarter pole, then yielded entering the lane. RUSSIAN MAFIA broke a beat slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COMMON BOND laid off of the pace two to three wide, cut the corner entering the lane, rallied to bid inside of the leader leaving the furlong grounds, drove
clear, and held late. FAMILY MAN stalked in the three path, chased as the clear leader's closest pursuer around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner
rival in midstretch, stayed on to threaten that foe late, but did not have enough. SAQEEL trailed, gained four wide around the far turn, shifted in entering the
lane, and stayed on. DEFIED opened up to a wide lead, came back to the field around the far turn, then weakened between horses leaving the furlong
grounds. ROGUE ELEMENT never got involved. CHANTRY FLATS stalked in the two path, but faded around the far turn. WORLD CRUISER tracked along
the inside, but was done early.
