LOOKINGFORANEWSPOT pressured the pace from the three eighths pole and contested the edge two deep while between horses on the turn, dug in to
inch briefly clear late stretch and just lasted. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE gave chase off the rail, eased outward toward the head of the lane, left the turn about
the four path, closed briskly and just missed. UNCANNY closed to the lead inside and set a pressured pace, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the
rail on the turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but relented the final sixteenth. ROCKIN ANNA ROLLIN came away awkwardly but pressured
the pace through the backstretch, contested the turn three wide then weakened inside the eighth pole. MISS GRANDSTANDER chased, rounded the turn
about the four path then weakened.

Footnotes
CHANGE YOUR LUCK took over nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was urged approaching the quarter pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn and proved much the best with steady stretch handling. CRISTIANO BOY saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and was no match in the lane. DUKE OF CORK became fractious in the gate then bobbled at the break,
settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished evenly to hold the nod for
third. CHASE LIL ME saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, ran evenly down the lane and
missed the nod for third. QUIET JUSTICE came away a bit awkwardly and rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the three and four paths of the far turn and showed little more. YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN rounded the first turn in the five path, left
the turn outside and showed little response. PULL UP MY SOCKS saved ground and showed only a mild bid from the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
STRETCH THE TRUTH dueled for the early lead and set a pressured pace from the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn
and was steadily handled to hold on well. TAPPING pressured the pace from the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and
ran evenly in the lane. SCAREDY CAT gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and finished well to take third later yards. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS
chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT chased, rounded the turn about the five path then
flattened the final sixteenth. FORGOTTEN MISSION bobbled leaving the gate then picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the three path and showed
little more. TRUTH SERUM dropped well back from early contention and was never a factor. TANELEER chased inside, ran near the rail on the turn and
weakened in the lane. COMMITTEEMAN was never a factor.

ROCKET J. took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. GOLDEN METTLE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the three path, left
the turn four wide, dug in for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. TAXIT rounded the first turn in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the three path and dueled through the stretch to earn the nod for third. GHOST MINE saved ground on the opening turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then missed the nod in the stretch duel for third. KID GENIUS rounded the
opening turn about the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole.
DON'TCALLTOOEARLY showed little response through the backstretch and ran in the four path of the far turn. READY FOR CLASS saved early ground.

Footnotes
SAYYESTOTHELADY pressured the pace and drew to even terms toward the head of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. ALL CAPS
chased, raced close in the three path of the turn and ran evenly in the lane. LEMONSONDESURPRISE was hustled to a clear early lead and set a
pressured pace, dug in to the challenge of Sayyestothelady nearing the head of the lane, succumbed to that one toward mid-stretch and flattened the final
sixteenth. TUESDAY TOO chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. CHURCH KEY gave close early
chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened in the lane. PRETTY CASTLE was slow getting into stride, gave chase through the backstretch,
rounded the turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. NINETY PROOF was not a factor. SILVER RULES was through early. SIENTE LA
BRISA became a bit edgy in the gate and never factored. New Age Bad Girl refused to load in the gate and was a late scratch.
