Footnotes
ANY MINUTE broke clean and raced between HOUR CAT and RED EAGLE in the three path, the trio heads apart with no one working hard to take
command. Making their way along the far turn he received some encouragement and when they hit the quarter pole ANY MINUTE began to move away
from his early foes to make a bid in the lane. Under strong hand riding urging he was not challenged late and was best of field. CONSIDER ME allowed the
trio including the winner to set all the early fractions, pacing himself a couple of lengths back, He raced four-wide of the pack but in the seven path.. At the
quarter he moved inside a bit drafting behind a pair until they straightened out. He moved to the outside again, four wide and under very strong urging rallied
past the others to get second. PURRS WELL broke slowly out of gate giving all a length head start before gathering himself; raced up the backside in the
same six path from which he broke and did not move until the far turn when he passed one horse. At the turn he moved even wider and started gaining
ground. However he was no match for the others. RED EAGLE broke with the early leaders and kept pace with them, racing in the three path and raced
evenly well into the stretch when he tired and ultimately held off the latter two runners. RENEE'S Z VA uneventful break and trailed others up the
backstretch and into the turn; passed lone tiring rival who contended early. HOUR CAT had a clean break and was prominent in the early going, paired in a
trio with the winner and RED EAGLE for a positive going for 3/8th of a mile; did not respond when asked as others were moving past and that may have
been their best of the going as he faded and was ultimately outrun by all.

Footnotes
ALWAYS TALKING , sent to the front from the opening bell, stayed on the lead just off the rail, had inside position at the three eighths pole, came under
strong urging through the stretch, held off rival while racing along the inside, game through the wire. FREE TO FLY found nice outside stalking position after
the start, moved four wide in a three horse scrum at the the three eighths pole, stayed wide top of the lane, came under a ride inside the furlong marker,
took dead aim on leader, just missed game for the place money. TEXAS REWARD , lacked early pace, stayed in a nice four wide stalking position backside,
moved out five wide around the turn, stayed middle of the track through the stretch, finished up with good energy. MY BOSS LADY off slow, stayed four
wide entering first turn, stayed in the four path top of lane, finished even through the stretch. AWESOME VIEW, found a stalking position just off leader
down the back stretch, moved between horses at the three eighths pole, stayed between horses till deep stretch, lost contact with top pair inside the
sixteenth pole, weakened late. THEA'S THEME along the inside after start, asked to quicken into first turn, outrun through the stretch.

Footnotes
FAST CASH sat off the pace, five lengths off of the leaders and when the field approached the quarter pole he moved toward the outside and to his right
was NANTUCKETER. That runner later lodged a claim of foul for interference at this point which was disallowed. Once clear FAST CASH swung
exceptionally wide and with no one on either side of him drew away from the field and won under urging. DIESEL not a factor in the early going until they
approached the 3/8ths and he moved. Rated outside FAST CASH, when that foe moved, so did DIESEL. This rider lodged a claim of foul on the winner
which was disallowed and when they turned for home he moved to a four path and was all out in the straight. Not enough to catch the winner but was
second best. BINKSTER broke wide and maintained that far wide path throughout, running further than everyone else. Making a move at the 3/8 BINKSTER
looked like a contender and would be forwardly placed until the top of the stretch when he turned very wide and lost a lot of ground; was game in the final
run and moved up to a very well earned third place finish. SATCHEL DE RITCHES did not get away very well and raced evenly throughout; passed tired
rivals to get up for fourth. PEPE AND HEYWOOD sat just off the leader for the first 3/16ths of a mile when the rider started urging him. Brief early foot and
kept pace but slowed dramatically in the stretch and was outrun. MR FANTASY broke alertly and went straight to the front guiding the field up the
backstretch with PEPE AND HOLLYWOOD on his right flank. When that foe began to be urged by his rider MR FANTASY continued in a gallop and others
were coming at him. Rider made attempts to continue but he lacked any response and faded, outrun by all y and ran well with trs. THE BIG S broke cleanly
and ranged up with the pacesetters in the early going; when they raced past the first quarter something went awry and the rider pulled the horse up. He did
not finish and was vanned off.

cleared for the win late. MIRANDA'S DESMOND , took control at the start, stayed on the front end around the turn, shook off the challengers to the outside,
could not hold off the winner to her inside, ran on well for the place. SHE'S A BIG DEAL , wide in the early stages, remained wide around the turn, shifted
out after leaving the quarter pole, finished willingly through the wire. AWESOME BIRDIE , stalked the leader into the first turn, running between horses
around the turn, asked for best stuff leaving the quarter pole, faded late in the lane. WILLOW DRIVE off the pace early, stayed middle pack till around the far
turn, urged on nearing the quarter pole, lost contact with leaders, outrun through the stretch. PROPER GRAMMAR off slow, stayed off the pace down the
backstretch, asked around the turn, outrun through the stretch. MY SISTER CLURRIE , hit gate at the start, lost rider.

Footnotes
HEFFNER prompted the pace in the five path, took over the lead from the three path rounding the far turn, and held on gamely. LIFESPAN rated from the
six path, continued to race in the six path while challenging for the lead coming into the stretch, but hung late to place. TINY TIN was well back and in the
three path, was hustled while racing inside coming into the stetch, and rallied up the rail to show. URBAN WARRIOR tracked three wide, was ridden in the
seven path coming into the stretch, and finished evenly. SUNNY SAINT led from the four path but yielded rounding the far turn. CODE NAME BRODY
chased from the five path, was ridden from the eight path into the stretch, but flattened. SOCIAL EQUALITY trailed into the stretch and was never a threat.
NANTUCKETER stalked inside but backed out around the far turn. DAVID'S PROSPEC raced in midpack but was done early.

Footnotes
HACHURE was bumped at the start, moved forward on the outside three then two wide stalking the pacesetter, took closer order leaving the far turn and
was forced out six wide into upper stretch, dueled and just got up at the wire. VICTORS VALIANT set the pace moving nearer inside on the first turn, was
challenged on the far turn, bore out five wide leaving that bend, dueled in the stretch and was game but just missed. SILK WAR shifted in on the first turn,
saved ground on the far turn, had room inside for the stretch run but ran on evenly. UNION LEAGUE broke outwardly, shifted in and saved ground racing
about mid-pack, came out two wide nearing the quarter pole then three to four wide for the stretch and ran on well but needed more. BUNKER HILL bumped
a rival at the start, was guided in to the rail in the early going on the first turn, saved ground on the far turn and gained mildly inside. GHOST OF KHOZAN
was forced four wide on the first turn, stalked the leaders from outside, went four to five wide on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. BOLD LICORICE was
up close but off the leaders stalking three wide, continued about in the same path on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. DELTA RIDGE was bumped
at the start, settled toward the back in the three path early, advanced outside on the far turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, failed to menace. OUT OF
TOWNER bobbled just slightly at the start, steadied early when in tight on the rail and was guided off the fence then steadied more sharply on the first turn,
appeared to be getting out and floated five wide leaving the first turn, continued about five wide on the far turn and was never near enough to threaten. EL
PATOJO broke a step slowly and was brushed lightly at the start, lacked early speed, saved ground on the turns to no avail. BORRELLY was in tight early
after about the opening sixteenth on the rail, moved out and raced mostly two wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
JUROR NUMBER FOUR had a clean and uneventful break allowing the field to dictate terms until deciding to move at the 3/8ths pole. At that point JUROR
NUMBER FOUR picked off rivals one by one, cut the corner well, staying in his three path as PROPER ATTIRE and SHERO moved wide into the seven
and eight paths losing ground. Throughout the lane he was never challenged, rider maintaining proper urging and drew clear from the others. SHERO was
in tight quarters after the break and took a bad step about 50 yards into the race, recovered quickly rode a five path trip moving into contention, and poised
to strike approaching the quarter. He was then swung wide by PROPER ATTIRE. Once straightened out in the lane he was eight wide and moving well with
a clear path in front of him, working hard but giving futile chase, having to settle for second best, in the final jumps. PLANE DRUNK galloped along just off
the pacesetting PROPER ATTIRE in the three path with ALAYLA to his inside on the rail and as that one faded it allowed him to take a rail position where he
stayed throughout the remainder of the race. Rider kept to task and horse remained focus, working hard only to get caught for second place money in the
final jumps. PROPER ATTIRE broke fairly well and served as pacesetter for the early going, when the time came to be asked he went wide at the turn and
never fully recovered, tiring and unable to keep pace with the others until ultimately outrun. SALT PLAGE fair break, turn his head slightly and took to the
rail, tucking himself behind the initial leader ALAYA until up the backside the eventual winner moved past him and he trailed the field until the late stages
where he passed one horse and was not a factor. ALAYLA came out of the gate clean but then quickly moved from the two path to the seven path and
gradually moved back toward the rail, leading the way for the first quarter mile. At that point he ran out of gas and faded, at the head of the stretch he had
nothing left and just followed the rest of them home.
