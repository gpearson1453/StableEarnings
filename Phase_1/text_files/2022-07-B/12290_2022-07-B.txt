SHIMMERING LIGHT settled off the pace, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside of MISTER JT at the quarter pole, took over, drew clear under urging
and held well late. ANGELI BLU raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside and could not threaten
the winner. MISTER J T set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, was no match for the winner when challenged,
weakened in the lane and held on for third. CLASSY UNION raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, closed
belatedly and just missed for third. RICKYS REVENGE stalked the pacesetter in the early stages, then chased that rival and tired. RIGHT ON Q raced three
wide early, settled off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. MOON SECRET raced off the pace inside and gave way.

Footnotes
TAP EM set the pace on the inside, opened up a clear lead, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the final furlong and held well for the win. SUIT OF
ARMOR chased between rivals, rallied into the stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and came up second best. BIG RED CARDINAL was outrun early,
came three wide into the lane, angled in, closed late inside and got up for third. BAYOU SHACK chased on the inside, chased on the turn, lacked a rally and
lost third at the wire. WHATA GUY chased three wide, chased on the turn and weakened. TOTALLY PSYCHED chased on the inside and faded. BATTLE
MAP broke through the gate prior, raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. WINE TIME was outrun.
