Footnotes
LA SMOOCHIE allowed the early leaders to go after breaking when them while racing three wide, closer turning for home, quickly collared the lone
remaining pacesetter just inside the furlong grounds, drew clear under steady handling. MAGIC APRIORITY broke well, set the pace along the inside, clear
into the straight, proved no match for the winner when confronted by that one with less than a furlong remaining, saved place. OUR LIBERINA closest to the
runner up while in the two path, fell back off that one late in the turn, failed to keep pace with the winner when that one went by upper straight, coming back
for the second spot late. SPIDER LEGS last to leave, lacked speed just off the inside, two path through much of the turn, angled out four wide for the drive,
some late gain while well out in the course. TEXAS PROMO GIRL fell back after the start, trailed throughout in failing to menace. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

exiting the turn, edged clear for the runner up position. LUCK OF THE STARS also with the pace from the start, held a narrow advantage along the inside
early in the turn, continued to do battle through the bend,also proved no match for the winner, could not keep up with the runner up the final furlong to finish
best of the rest. PROUDTOWN in the second flight off the inside, moved closer with a three wide move between horses through the turn, failed to sustain
that advance through the stretch. FLIT N FLOT TIME back off the early pace, advanced with a four wide middle move in the turn, also flattened out in the
drive. SOULOLOGY last to leave, made little impact. OUT MAKING TREBLE flashed early foot three wide for just under a half and stopped.

Footnotes
ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN away in good order, pressed the issue three wide up the backstretch, fell back slightly off the leader turn, roused for the drive,
engaged entrymate from the outside approaching the furlong grounds and wore that rival down under firm handling. A P HUMOR broke sharp, fell back and
headed up the second flight for three furlongs toward the inside, angled out three wide exiting the turn, closed with a good burst of energy to be up in the
final stride and gain the nod for the place. CHARLIE SKY away well, showed the way along the inside, continued to hold the advantage into and through
upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to her winning entrymate, nipped in the final stride for the place. VISIONLADY back off the pace and the inside,
dropped to the inside nearing midstretch,displayed interest to close the gap on the first flight while in some traffic along the rail at the wire. CALL ME
DARLIN vied up front between the two entrymates up the backstretch, continued to apply pressure through the turn then weakened in the drive. HOT
PATOOTIE fractious loading, broke with the field, remained in mid pack off the inside, floated out four wide into the lane by the winner then evenly drive in
lacking a closing response. SOUVENIR CHANNEL broke back, lacked speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. HEY YOU off slowly,
remained always back. HOUSE OF ZONG tired while racing outside. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
ZENUCCI broke back, was patiently handled for five furlongs while saving ground, closer in some traffic late in the final turn, got through along the rail into
the lane, gained the advantaged and edged clear under steady handling. MIAS MOONBEAM last to leave, lacked early foot, began to advance far turn off
the inside, four wide into the stretch, challenged past the furlong marker while widest of the first flight, could not match strides with the winner late, clearly
second best. DEBONNAIRE DUDE broke back as well, void of speed, following the runner up into the stretch in the four path, rallied and was up in time for
the show, not a serious threat to the top two. CALCULATE another who lacked any early speed, saved ground into the lane, improved up the inside.
WILSON TO LOCKETT chased the dueling leaders for six furlongs, three path into the lane, faltered late to lose several positions. FRIENDOFTHECOURT
broke up and then was asked away to make the lead into the first turn, dueled closest to the inside the middle half inside, two path into the lane allowing his
entrymate the rail, began to weaken when headed. SUCH in mid pack for a half, had little left thereafter while racing three wide. FLASHING ANGELBABY
dueled up front in the two path, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CHARLIE G settled in the second flight while in the two path, advanced on the two leaders and challenged three wide entering the straight, lost some
ground to the leader, drifted in while getting to that one with less than a furlong remaining, drew clear late under steady handlng. ALL MIKE NO MAE away
well, dueled up front along the inside through some quick fractions, continued to save ground into the lane, gained a larger advantage after putting the other
speed away entering lane, responded when confronted by the winner in midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to that one while holding sway for the place.
DECLARE WAR last away, raced back for six furlongs, traffic into the lane, got through and finished well to be getting to the runner up late. SCORING
DRIVE unhurried early well off those rapid fractions, moved closer four wide turning into the lane, flattened out to finish up evenly. DEER CROSSING in the
second flight along the rail and inside the winner, lacked a closing punch through the lane. TOUCHDOWN JOE broke on top, helped set those quick early
fractions, faltered when the real running began at the head of the straight.

Footnotes
L G GIRL broke on top, allowed the two leaders to go first turn, stalked on the outside up the backstretch, took over turning for home, drew clear and
expanded that advantage under token encouragement to win ridden out. FUHR MEO close up inside, dueled up the backstretch, shook off that rival just as
the winner was challenging far turn, dueled with that one through the rest of that bend, proved no match through the stretch, clearly second bdesty. ST.
MONICA void of speed in trailing early, angled out four wide turning for home, rallied to be clear of the others, no threat to the top pair. GALAXY AFFAIR
main body off the inside, three wide into the stretch, little left. ALLEN'S JUDY last away, remained back while saving ground to no avail. RENE'S NEW BOW
moved up to duel off the inside first turn, alternated up front in the run up the backstretch, gave way from between the top two far turn.
