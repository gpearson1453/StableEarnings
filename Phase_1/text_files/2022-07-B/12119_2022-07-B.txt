Footnotes
EL ROMANTICO bumped with GRUMPA at the start, was sent to get the lead, showed the way from inside, was roused again leaving the second turn,
under urging in the lane, drifted out approaching the sixteenth marker, was straightened and held sway. EL FEFO raced in contention three wide from the
beginning, made his bid just off the inside on the second turn, pulled away for second, lacked the extra needed deep stretch but was easily second best.
AWINBENEATHMYWINGS chased from outside then passed outside weakening rivals the last two and a half furlongs. CONCOCTION moved to the inside
leaving the first turn, advanced under urging on the backstretch, progressed two wide on the second bend then gave way the last furlong. GRUMPA
bumped with EL ROMANTICO at the break, was hustled along to prompt the latter from just outside but gave way from inside before finishing five furlongs.

Footnotes
PALAGO was a step or two slow at the break, raced in hand from outside on the backstretch, took over when allowed leaving the turn, responded to a mild
urging upper stretch then steadily drew away as much the best. KIANA'S LOVE was steadied when her path narrowed leaving the five furlong marker, was
altered out, went for the lead two wide on the bend, angled in some leaving the turn, pulled away for second then could only hold her position late.
ALMAFUERTE was boxed in early, had the rail on the turn, swung out widest leaving the turn, took over third inside the last eighth and was closing the gap
on KIANA'S LOVE in the late going. FIRST SQUADRON broke on top, steadily angled in, was overtaken from outside on bend, fanned outside KIANA'S
LOVE for the drive and continued to gradually yield.

BAM BAM CAM broke on top, moved clear after the first furlong, was just off the inside leaving the bend, lengthened command under hand urging and was
kept to task to the waning yards. HELLOFAGUY broke a bit inward, jostled with GOLDENPENCE, raced in contention from outside, was widest taking the
bend, gained second nearing the final sixteenth but could not close the gap on the leader. PENALTY SHOT broke a bit outward and also jostled with
GOLDENPENCE, prompted the pace just outside BAM BAM CAM, could not stay with the latter when set down for the drive and slowly yielded the last
sixteenth. GOLDENPENCE was jostled between rivals at the break, raced in contention from inside and failed to have a serious stretch bid. COOL
AMBITION broke well but soon dropped back, angled in to be just off the inside on the bend and had no significant stretch response.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT rated just off the early pace from outside, was allowed to take over two wide on the turn, put to a drive in the stretch, drew away the last
furlong and was kept to urging until the waning yards. GO STORMIN GIRL was unwilling to load for a good bit of time, as the stewards were scratching her,
she loaded into the gate and the starter released the field, she took a clear lead before finishing the first eighth, was overtaken from outside on the bend, no
match for TRIPLE SCOUT the final eighth but was unchallenged for the place. AFOOLER hustled between rivals early, found herself boxed in after a
quarter mile, gained a clear path three wide on the turn then leveled off the last two furlongs. SACRED STORM helped prompt the pace from inside on the
backstretch, faded on the bend, had no stretch rally and weaved in and back out inside the final sixteenth. Due to miscommunication, the race was hand
timed. There was a stewards' inquiry into the race. After their review GO STORMIN GIRL was declared a non-betting interest. All wagers with GO
STORMIN GIRL, except a consolation daily double, were refunded.

Footnotes
CALL ME DROSSEL jostled with CONGRATS ZAPPA leaving the chute, progressed widest to vie for the lead into the bend, was carried out some leaving
the turn, edged ahead with a furlong to go and shook free the last sixteenth. BLEEDING BLUE drifted out some shortly after the break causing CONGRATS
ZAPPA to be squeezed and roughed up briefly between horses, progressed just inside CALL ME DROSSEL, shared the lead with the latter into the turn,
floated out some leaving the bend, gradually wore down deep stretch but was unchallenged for second. THACKER FROMM soon trailed from inside, picked
up his pace after two furlongs, advanced two wide on the turn, threatened just off the rail with a furlong left but leveled off instead. CONGRATS ZAPPA was
squeezed and roughed up between rivals leaving the chute, hustled up from outside, was three wide on the bend and had no late bid. VALE OF EVESHAM
broke on top and quickly drew clear, began to yield nearing the end of a quarter mile, quit from inside before finishing three furlongs, was unresponsive to
urging upper stretch, eased deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
AROSE FOR LYLA was settled inside, picked up her pace after two furlongs, advanced two wide between horses, altered out for a clear path upper stretch,
altered out again when PLAY TWENTY came out nearing the furlong marker, surged to the lead under vigorous handling inside the final eighth and drew
away from the rest in the waning yards. MY MORNING GAL bumped shortly after entering the main track, moved clear for second along the rail on the
bend, was relegated to third inside the last furlong after AROSE FOR LYLA gained the lead but caught the tiring PLAY TWENTY for the place nearing the
wire. PLAY TWENTY emerged with a narrow lead from between rivals after the first eighth, moved clear after two furlongs, tried to bear out leaving the
quarter pole, was corrected at the top of the lane, ducked out when put to left-handed urging upper stretch, was again corrected, could not keep AROSE
FOR LYLA at bay inside the last furlong and slowly wore down between horses. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE angled in some trying to keep a clear path after
leaving the chute, bumped with MY MORNING GAL nearing the end of the first sixteenth, failed to keep up after two furlongs, had the rail on the turn, lodged
her bid just off the inside in the lane, made a strong move outside PLAY TWENT deep stretch and just missed for third. HIDENSEEK SALLY dwelt at the
start, spotting the field several lengths, moved up quickly from outside to be a factor on the backstretch, did not stay close three wide on the bend, fanned
out some for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. MENDING pressed PLAY TWENTY from just outside in the early going but faded four wide
on the turn.

Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT rated between horses on the backstretch, took over into the bend, was asked leaving the turn then steadily opened up under a drive in the
lane. CHICKS FOR FREE soon trailed, was three wide taking the turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch, gained second inside the last furlong, was no
match for W W HOTSHOT deep stretch but pulled away for the place. MEDAL OF FACT broke on top, vied for the lead from outside, did not keep up three
wide on the bend, drifted out some entering the stretch and could only catch the tiring TORIN for third in the waning yards. TORIN was hustled to dispute
the pace from inside, did not stay with W W HOTSHOT on the turn, swung outside the latter into the lane and wore down the last eighth. ONE PUTT RICHIE
was well placed from inside on the backstretch but gave way on the turn. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND raced in contention between horses early but faded two
wide on the bend. ARCHIEMYBOY was a contender from outside on the backstretch but gave way widest on the turn.
