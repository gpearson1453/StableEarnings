Footnotes
NANTUCKET RED took command from the start, was unchallenged through the backstretch and turn and was well rationed up front to have enough for the
stretch drive to never be seriously threatened. PEACE SEEKER tracked the leader on the rail, was roused at the three eighths pole to go after the
pacesetter and could not gain through the stretch, but showed good tenacity winning the battle between rivals for the place award. SARATOGA VISION
stalked outside after the break, was three wide through the turn and angled inside at the quarter pole showing some late interest to get up for third. GOTE
GO trailed in the early stages, began to pick up horses advancing on the rail at the three eights pole, contended for the place share mid stretch and faded
late to get a minor placing. BARKIN stalked inside through the backstretch, angled out for a clear run entering the stretch, had a brief rally at top of the lane
and stalled the final eighth. SWEET SERENADE tracked outside through the turn, was asked at the three eighths pole and had no finish down the lane.

Footnotes
SILVER BULLET LADY tracked inside, lacked room briefly past the quarter pole, angled out at the top of the stretch, took aim on a rival who got the jump
and under long steady drive just got up near the wire. MUSKOKA SUMMER stalked the pace from outside two to three wide on the turn, moved to the lead
at the three-sixteenths, was clear in mid-stretch but worn down late. FEW REGRETS raced mid-pack off the inside, was along for show. GOLDEN SUZIE
shifted in, saved ground on the turn, needed more. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER broke a step slowly, moved up inside under some encouragement then
steadied when in tight heading up the backstretch, altered out, swung five wide into the stretch and ran on. BABY FADE broke outwardly and steadied
slightly while being corrected, went two to three wide on the turn and was never able to menace. CRIMSON SKY set the pace racing off the rail, faltered and
faded.

Footnotes
GABBY SQUARED was allowed to settle at the back early, advanced between runners on the far turn, made a rail bid for the lead at the eighth pole and
was beginning to draw away at the finish. SHES THE NORTH tracked the speed until the five sixteenth pole where she then assumed command, was
headed at the eighth pole by the winner and gave way grudgingly the last sixteenth. BLONDEONAMISSION tracked mid pack down the backside, advanced
outside of runners on the far turn to loom into contention turning for home, could not quicken enough to challenge the top two contenders through the lane
and settled for a clear third. VERY SAVVY was three wide throughout and passed tiring rivals through the stretch to get a small piece. DEJAS TOO saved
ground into the first turn, was in a good stalking position on the rail through the backstretch, had to briefly wait to angle out at top of the stretch and ran
evenly in the late stages. OLD SECRETS trailed in the beginning, was ridden inside on the far turn and had little to offer in the stretch. ASHA IRONBORN
took command early on the rail, was collared at the five sixteenth pole and backed through the field down the lane.

READY FOR THE LADY was bumped lightly at the start, tucked in three wide settling well off the pace, began to pick it up on the far turn moving out six
wide on that bend, engaged the leader a furlong out putting a short head in front, had to be kept busy to the wire dueling with that one to hold sway. GO
TAKE CHARGE stalked the leaders two to three wide, moved to challenge late on the far turn, drifted out five wide into upper stretch taking the lead by the
quarter pole, was headed a furlong out but fought on gamely however just missed. OPUS NORTH settled toward the rear three wide, swung out eight wide
turning for home, gained steadily through the stretch. TARANTO TITAN shifted in heading into the first turn, saved ground racing near the inside, advanced
inside on the far turn angling out five wide leaving that bend before shifting back in once in upper stretch, ran on well late. AWESOME STRIKE bumped the
outer rival at the start, was caught four wide on the first turn, moved in and advanced inside foes late on the far turn coming out four deep again leaving that
bend, ran on evenly in the stretch. LARAQUE was forwardly-placed into the first turn, ceded the lead and eased back switching out to stalk, moved to the
fore at the half-mile marker racing two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. BRINGER OF RAIN raced two wide into the first turn, settled well back toward
the rear, saved some ground on the far turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on. RALPHIE BOY settled inside, passed tired foes. SPANISH PRINCE set
the pace racing off the rail, gave way. MORE THAN A DANCE bobbled then was bumped at the start, was caught five wide on the first turn, edged closer to
the leaders heading up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn, tired in the lane. UH OH IT'S MAGIC bumped a rival lightly at the start,
stalked the early pace four wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
AMAZIN QUEEN brushed the gate at the break, trailed in the early stages, angled out to seven path while widest turning for home and was full of run late
taking command at the sixteenth pole. MISS MARIE was positioned near the back after the break, began a rally at the quarter pole behind runners looking
for an opening, was angling inside the last eighth while charging up the fence late. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL was between runners at the quarter pole looking
for a path, found a seam while four wide at the top of the stretch to split runners and ran on well to get third money. GLORIANNIA was steadied slightly
entering the first turn, stalked the leaders just outside down the backstretch and finished some late energy to garner a small share. MOQADAMA (IRE)
settled near the back in the beginning, circled runners at the quarter pole while angling out to the six path turning for home and could not gain through the
stretch. TRISH THE DISH stalked mid pack while saving ground, waited on the far turn inside, advanced up the fence only to steady briefly mid stretch and
levelled off afterwards. DIRECTOR'S CUT broke in at the start, tracked inside through the backstretch, was briefly steadied going into the far turn,
contended at the three sixteenth pole between runners and faded late. BIG BAND LUZZIANN broke alertly to set the pace, was collared at the eighth pole
and stopped the last sixteenth. GOOGLY EYES chased the pace outside early, was ridden to keep up in the far turn and faded between runners in the late
stages.

CAIRO CONSORT vied inside rivals, drifted out a bit turning for home, kicked clear and held sway while being kept to the task. LAST CALL tracked inside,
angled five wide leaving the turn, had aim on the leader but could make no headway while clearly second best. COURTLY RO exchanged a light bump at
the break, stalked between runners in the second flight early, went two to three wide on the turn losing ground into upper stretch while coming out five wide
but kept on late to gain show honors. WITCH HAZEL exchanged a light bump at the break, attended the pace from outside three wide, needed more in the
stretch. KANTBACKOFF was bumped at the break, shifted in and saved ground early on the turn before tipping out three wide late on that bend, moved
back inside foes in mid-stretch and gained some. OUR LIBERTY BELLE shifted in early, raced two wide on the turn advancing inside foes, ran on evenly. A
GAL FOR T J raced outside the second flight three wide early, lost ground on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, was never able to menace. MY
GIRL GABBY bumped the outside rival at the start, raced mostly three wide on the turn swinging out eight deep out of that bend, was never near enough to
threaten. MISCHIEF LILY veered out badly at the start, shifted in, saved ground on the turn, failed to menace. FILM bumped a rival at the start, vied
between runners for the lead, gave way. THUNDERHEAVYRAIN was bumped at the start, raced at the rear along the inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
HARLAN ESTATE broke sharp, tracked the early speed into the first turn, rated kindly down the backstretch and pounced on the lead with a quarter of a
mile to run, battled briefly with a rival through the stretch and was kept to the task to the finish line. CASH DIVIDEND settled on the rail mid pack throughout
the first turn and backstretch, angled out turning for home and finished well getting up for second. WAR BOMBER (IRE) took the lead into the first turn, was
headed at the quarter pole and battled with the winner for an eighth before giving away late losing the place award nearing the wire. AVOMAN was near the
back between foes after the break, advanced outside five wide on the far turn entering the stretch and levelled out the final eighth. RIPTIDE ROCK trailed at
the half, was roused at the three eighths pole and offered a brief run through the turn but could never really get involved. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was
four wide throughout, made a middle move down the backstretch and could not be a factor down the lane. IT'S GAME KNIGHT tracked just off the pace
outside in the early stages, was in range turning for home and faded between runners in the stretch.

Footnotes
FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) was a bit reluctant to load, broke well and set the pace racing just off the rail, went in the two path on the turn, edged away in the
stretch and was kept to the task. MARCH TO THE ARCH bumped a rival after the break, was in tight and steadied on heels twice past the five-eighths pole,
saved ground on the turn coming out two wide into upper stretch, kept on late to get up for second over SILENT POET, who stalked the pace from outside
going three wide on the turn, could make no headway on the winner and lost place late. CHEWING GUM was bumped into a rival after the start, raced
mid-pack inside on or just off the rail, came out three to four wide in the stretch and ran on. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT settled off the pace, went three to four wide
on the turn racing outside rivals, angled out six wide turning for home, exchanged repeated light brushes with a rival in upper- to mid-stretch and went
evenly. VANBRUGH tracked the pace from inside, steadily weakened in the stretch. WHITE FLAG was unhurried early trailing the field, swung eight wide
into the stretch and passed rivals. SURLY FURIOUS pursued from mid-pack, went four wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. ARTIE'S STORM was
bumped after the break, raced off the pace two to three wide on the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch, exchanged several brushes with a foe and was in
tight just after. OLYMPIC RUNNER raced off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, came out seven wide turning for home and failed to rally.

Footnotes
LADY MOONSHINE was brushed at the break and trailed early, waited inside behind runners through the backstretch, angled out at the three eighths pole
quickly circling runners into the stretch to lead and was drawing away late. NOW IS A BREEZE pressed the pace outside from the onset, took command at
the three eighths pole only to lose that position entering the stretch to the eventual winner, battled on stubbornly through the lane for second money and just
won the nod at the wire. ANYQUIST took command after the start, was pressed by an outside rival down the backstretch, could not hold off the winner
turning for home but battled gamely on the rail through the stretch for the place award. MARDENE was brushed on the break, rated mid pack just off the
pace on the outside, was roused mid turn and ran even down the lane getting a small share. GIO MARIA rated inside just behind the dueling pacesetters,
was ridden to keep up at the quarter pole and offered little in the stretch. HUSHEMUP raced wide throughout, was asked at the three eighths pole and had
no response.

Footnotes
MITZI set the pace inside, faced pressure up the backstretch, edged clear on the far turn, was engaged by a rival in mid-stretch and dug in to hold that foe
at bay and prevail by a narrow margin. ALPHA MIA pulled a bit racing inside in the early going, saved ground on the first turn, advanced inside foes on the
far turn coming out four wide leaving that bend, bid in mid-stretch drawing nearly even but couldn't get past while clearly second best. TEMPEREYA settled
just off the pace three wide, raced nearer the inside on the far turn then swung four wide into the stretch, kept on evenly under steady urging. ARRIVISTE
was held up inside off the leaders, saved ground on both turns, improved in the stretch. LUZ DE LA LUNA bumped a rival at the start then angled in settling
at the rear inside, swung seven wide into the stretch and gained mildly. SILVER MAGNATIZED was forwardly-placed two to three wide stalking in behind
the pace, tipped out at the seven-sixteenths and clipped in behind, swung out five wide turning for home, flattened out in the drive. TAQUANYAH was
caught four wide through the first turn, clipped heels and stumbled badly about the seven-sixteenths, continued mostly four wide on the far turn and ran on.
ABSOLUTE JEWEL broke a half-step slowly, settled last but one racing off the inside, failed to menace. KEEP IT NEAT was bumped at the break,
forwardly-placed chasing four wide, pressed the pacesetter up the backstretch, gave way thereafter. FREDERICIA raced mostly two to three wide and failed
to threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY SILVER MAGNATIZED WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH AND PLACED TAQUANYAH FOR
INTERFERENCE.
