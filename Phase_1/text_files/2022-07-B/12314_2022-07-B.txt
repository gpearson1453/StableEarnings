Footnotes
MISS CHAMITA settled off the rail the first turn, started a bid leaving the half mile pole, steadily progressed and rounded the far turn about the five path, dug
in for the lead mid-stretch and widened through later yards. LACE REVOLUTION saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths
pole, eased outward on the far turn, left the turn in the six path and dug in to take second the final strides. VILLAREGGIA rated off the pace inside, bid
leaving the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn, took the nod into the stretch but was caught a sixteenth away
and relented later yards. WICKED WISDOM saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail,
drifted toward the head of the lane and flattened in the lane. MIDNIGHT REGRET became a bit edgy in the gate then angled in to stalk two deep,
challenged into the backstretch and dueled from that point, contested at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the far turn then
weakened leaving the eighth pole. CANVAS ART was reluctant to load, took over soon after the break and angled to the inside to rate the pace, was met
into the backstretch and dueled from that point, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught into the lane and weakened the final
furlong. GOSSIPING settled off the early pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the backstretch.

second the final strides. CATHERINES WARRIOR rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, was caught past the pole,

Footnotes
STEAL THE CASH stalked inside into the first turn then kept in range through the turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed at the rail on
the far turn, eased just outside the runner-up past the eighth pole, took the lead from that one mid-stretch and drew clear later yards. PER DIEM took the
lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the
far turn, was met just inside the sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. IT BEAST ALL stumbled leaving the tate then stalked two deep into the backstretch,
challenged approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened leaving the eighth pole. COASTAL CHAOS saved
ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened into the lane. DIAMANTE DE ORO saved ground
racing well back from early contention, bid into the backstretch and improved at the rail on the far turn, but flattened leaving the turn. PROUD UNION rated
off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the five path of the far turn. FAIRPIT
rounded the first turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. BLAMEITONTHEFUN rounded the first turn in the four and
five paths, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened in the five path of the far turn. SUN OF SILVER was bumped out into the first
turn then saved ground. RED DEVOLUTION hesitated then hopped from the gate and bore out into the first turn.
