Footnotes
FREDDY FLINTSHIRE settled two to three wide near the rear, tipped to be stacked five paths off the inside nearing the final flight, cleared that hurdle well
and then commenced a three wide bid through the final turn into prominence swinging four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away
and drew clear in the flat kept to task. PROVEN INNOCENT settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing after the final fence and
advanced inside of ANCIENT TIMES and was carried into the dogs midway on the final turn rolling over one of them when flirting with leaving the course
before nudging his way back on course which in turn nearly felled TAKE PROFIT while forcing GREY GIANT to be taken hold of off heels, came back under
urging and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. GREY GIANT just off the
inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing four wide after fence eight and tucked to the two path through the final turn urged along before having
to steady off the heels of ANCIENT TIMES and PROVEN INNOCENT as those rivals jostled in front and TAKE PROFIT bobbled heavily and precariously to
the outside, came out of the pause re-engaged by the rider and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on under a drive to secure the show
honors. SPRING HEELED JIM (IRE) saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing after the final hurdle improving position into contention,
swung five wide into upper stretch and flattened out under a drive in the flat. STATE OF AFFAIR tracked three wide just off the pace, came under urging
after the final flight and went four wide into upper stretch, then tired in the flat. TAKE PROFIT three then two wide in aim, came under coaxing at fence six to
keep pace, was under urging midway on the final turn when impeded by ANCIENT TIMES, clipped that foe behind bobbling heavily and nearly falling with
three furlongs to go, went four to five wide at the head of the stretch paused and tired. WELSHMAN just off the inside early in aim of the leader pulling on
the bit, tucked inside at the third fence, and tracking along the inside, came under coaxing nearing the final fence, bid up the inside and bumped repeatedly
with ANCIETNT TIMES inside that juncture before seizing command into the final turn, got displaced by the eventual winner spinning three wide for home
and folded. BEE MAJOR just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing tipped briefly five wide at the final flight, spun just off the inside for
home and made no impact. ANCIENT TIMES bobbled over the first jump, showed the way in hand along the inside, showed the way through to the final
fence when trading bumped with WELSHMAN inside that station, then faded and nudged PROVEN INNOCENT nearly off course before being shoved back
inwards running over the cone and being clipped behind and nearly felling TAKE PROFIT, then continued to retreat and faltered in the flat.

straightened away and edged clear under a drive getting geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. GENERAL BANKER coaxed from the gate,
vied from the two path among a quartet in the early stages, eased off tucking inside at the seven-sixteenths and chased along the inside through the turn,
angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to come again and just get up for the place honors on the wire. TWENTY SIX BLACK hustled from the gate,
led narrowly early on before being engaged by a trio and was taken in hand and backed out half a mile from home, forcing DISARMED to checked and
steady in behind him, tipped to the two path floating DISARMED three wide midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch, improved position to
chase the winner home but was nailed on the wire for the place honors. DISARMED coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside, got forced to check

before being floated briefly three wide three furlongs from home, tucked back to the two path at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch
and improved position by tired rivals. DISCO DEMOLITION coaxed from the gate, advanced to vie between foes from the three path, had the inside pair
back away and tucked to the inside just inside the seven-sixteenths now dueling with WEYHILL FARM RD to his outside, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the drive. VINCE THE PRINCE broke a half a beat slow, crossed to chase just off the inside until tucked inside three furlongs from
home, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, shied out under a left handed stick and made no impact. WEYHILL FARM RD. vied from the four path

Footnotes
KIMARI was carried out at the start and off a bit slow, settled outside early then was taken under a strong hold, went four wide while let out on the turn then
came five wide into the stretch, was roused for her best at the three-sixteenths, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained coming to
the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling. FRANK'S ROCKETTE stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled at
the rear, made a rail rally on the turn, came through an inside opening to take the lead at the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the three path into the stretch,
raced with her ears up while appearing to wait on foes, led under the crop into the final sixteenth and was caught while well clear for the place. BELLA
SOFIA showed speed on the inside of AMADEVIL then was eased back off the pace and switched out before the five-eighths, tracked from that point, was
asked in the three path at the three-eighths pole as the runner-up commenced an inside run, gained to make a bid at the five-sixteenths, was driven four
wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. AMADEVIL broke out at the start but came out even at the front, showed speed
while hustled then moved clear with five furlongs to run, went around the turn in the two path, lost the lead under urging at the five-sixteenths, dropped back
coming to the quarter-pole and stopped then was eased in the final furlong before being vanned off while reported to have bled.

Footnotes
MOONEY LOVE (IRE) settled just off the inside near the rear of the field early on, briefly wandered four paths off the inside past the stands the initial time
before tucking to the inside into the second turn, remained patiently handled along the inside until tipped to the two path put to coaxing at the three-eighths,
got forced to steady and alter to the rail near the five-sixteenths when CURBSTONE tucked in from the outside to the two path, came under urging once
more and swung three then four wide into upper stretch, rallied with a good kick to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth
out, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. JARREAU tracked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path put to coaxing at the three-eighths and
advanced on the leader to pressure that foe for the front, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, took over command near the three-sixteenths, dug in
under growing lone threat and was collared a sixteenth out, then ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. DANTE'S FIRE two to three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. NEOTROPIC broke
out a step at the start bumping FORWARDLY, chased along the inside early on before being tipped to the two path past the stands the first time, tucked
back inside through the second turn before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and passed a pair of tired rivals. CURBSTONE just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, got nudged three wide when put
to coaxing at the three-eighths by JARREAU tipping off the inside, continued three wide at the head of the stretch and tired. FORWARDLY bumped at the
start by NEOTROPIC, who broke out a step at the break, spurted away in hand early on before settling into a comfortable rhythm allowing the field to take
closer order past the stands the initial time, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole when coming under threat and
pressure to the outside for the first turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
MIRACLE displayed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, kicked clear
under the crop into upper stretch, extended the advantage inside the furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead just inside the sixteenth-pole and
proved much the best under steady handling. BANTERRA settled on the far outside while not asked much for speed, dropped back some while tucking into
the four path leaving the backstretch, was roused while moving to the five path at the three-eighths, spun six wide into the stretch in pursuit of the winner,
drifted out near the furlong marker and just earned the place. GAMBLING GIRL was urged along near the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted four
wide into the stretch then tipped to the five path and improved for the show. SILVER SKILLET dropped back early, settled behind horses under some
coaxing, raced in hand while among foes at the seven-sixteenths, was roused three wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch, drifted in outside
the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. RECOGNIZE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on
the turn, lost the advantage while roused for more outside the quarter-pole and tired. ALICE KRAMDEN chased the pace on the outside, went five then four
wide around the turn and came up empty. DISRUPTION chased the pace on the inside of an opponent, went three then two wide around the turn and
capitulated. DANSEUR D'ORO was urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, checked outside the quarter-pole and had nothing
left. BERNING HONOR broke a step slow, was urged along at the rear while racing very greenly, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. LUNA
LOCA broke a half-step slow, was ridden along towards the rear on the outside, went four wide on the turn then was driven five wide into the stretch, drifted
in around the three-sixteenths and was no factor.

Footnotes
HATARI coaxed from the gate, settled along the inside near the rear of the field, tipped to the two path through the far turn coming under light coaxing near
the quarter pole before being roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command straightened away, then edged away under a
drive kept to task. FISH MOONEY bumped at the start by VINTAGE GIRL, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT coaxed from the gate,
crossed to settle briefly along the inside showing the way into the first turn, tipped to the two path through most of that bend before going three paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path nearing the seven-sixteenths for a brief moment before getting out through the far turn four wide and
carrying MISS INVINCIBLE five wide despite a firm left side grip and being flashed the crop on the right side, came under threat along the inside and
attempted to get back three wide before swinging seven wide into upper stretch, got displaced from command and kept on to preserve the show honors.
MISS INVINCIBLE forwardly placed just off the inside early on, went three wide through the first turn before settling four then three wide in closest aim
outside the aforementioned foe and leader, tucked briefly three wide into the far turn before getting carried out four then five wide by MIRTH 'N
MERRIMENT through the far turn, went seven to eight wide at the head of the stretch, kept on to the end but was outkicked. VINTAGE GIRL broke
outwards brushing the off side stall at the start before bumping FISH MOONEY, chased two to three wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SPOOKY ROAD just off the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths and bid for the front swinging four wide for home, got on near even terms for command straightened away, then weakened in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
O'GOTTEN GIRL broke out but came away in front, went clear early then showed the way under some pressure, came under a strong hand-ride in the two
path around the turn, floated four wide into the stretch under a drive, remained on her inside lead while battling with UNLOCK into the final furlong, shook
clear outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best while remaining on her inside lead to the wire. PREPOSTEROUS moved out while urged along off the
pace, went four wide around the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then tipped a bit further out and finished willingly for the place. UNLOCK broke
out at the start, moved up then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, was carried five wide into the stretch, passed the
three-sixteenths on even terms with the winner, battled with that foe into the final furlong then weakened while clear for the show. KEEN DANCER broke out
slightly, was urged along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. HANDLE THE TRUTH bobbled at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground early on the turn, shifted four wide while roused outside the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to threaten. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE was last to commence while loosing her footing
some, raced off the pace under urging, went three wide around the turn, came under the crop at the five-sixteenths and faltered. SARATOGA COMMANDO
was well placed down the backstretch, dropped back into the turn, saved ground while falling further back around the bend and also faltered.

Footnotes
MESSIDOR (IRE) stumbled at the start, recovered to save ground at the rear of the compact albeit spread out field early on, remained patiently handled and
took closer order on the front in tandem with her main rivals into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out four wide into upper
stretch, offered up a good kick to close stoutly on the outside seizing command seventy yards from home, then edged away to the finish under a light hand
drive. EVVIE JETS two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five then four wide into upper stretch straightened away,
came in under a right handed stick a furlong out placing a pair of rivals in tight just in behind, seized command just inside that station, got collared seventy
yards from home while running on with good energy to the finish. PHANTOM VISION established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside
shaking away into the first turn to open up a commanding lead, settled into a comfortable rhythm and steadily had the field take closer order remaining
unhurried until TASS latched on nearing the quarter pole, got put to coaxing at that juncture, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and
was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. HIGH OPINION tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and got nudged by AMALFI PRINCESS and paused as a pair of lanes
tightened up when EVVIE JETS came inwards at the eighth pole, then improved position to miss for the show honors. AMALFI PRINCESS two to three wide
in pursuit, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch under a drive, dug in and had EVVIE JETS come
inwards and had her lane tighten up nudging HIGH OPINION to her inside at the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. TASS broke a beat slow,
then ranged up to be forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader through the first turn, tracked the spurting away leader just off the inside, began to
advance on that rival three furlongs from home and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when latching on the front, spun three then two wide into
upper stretch and weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
BACKYARD MONEY bumped lightly with a rival at the start, showed good speed on the inside of a foe, was eased back off the pace around the
nine-sixteenths, drafted inside while behind the leader on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid at the
three-sixteenths, fought inside of two foes into the final furlong, gained the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, battled with the runner-up to the wire and
narrowly prevailed. LIQUIDITY PROVIDER was coaxed along just off the pace, chased two then three wide around the turn, gained under a drive to make
an outside bid at the three-sixteenths then took a short lead, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on with that foe to the wire
and just missed while clear for the place. MS. SOLVEIG lacked early speed, went around the turn in the three path, turned into upper stretch under a drive
and finished willingly for the show. MATTAPOISETT bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along between horses, went three wide around the turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch, moved in to go around an opponent outside the furlong marker and improved position. DOVER DREAMS bumped with
a rival at the start and was last away, raced at the rear under urging, moved from the two path to four path around the turn, came seven wide into the stretch
and also improved position. AQUILA MOON broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four wide early on the turn, shifted six wide just
inside the three-eighths and failed to rally. GLITTER UP broke out and bobbled at the start but came out near the front, disputed the pace on the outside, led
in the two path around the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. ADAM'S ANGEL was well placed down the backstretch, lost
position while shuffled back behind BACKYARD MONEY late on the backstretch, shifted three wide while roused around the three-eighths, moved to four
wide while chasing later on that bend, drifted out in upper stretch and capitulated. COURSE RUNNER bobbled at the start then bumped lightly with a foe,
was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. SHE'S AWESOME brushed the outside of the gate at the start then
was hustled, chased the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn and faltered.
