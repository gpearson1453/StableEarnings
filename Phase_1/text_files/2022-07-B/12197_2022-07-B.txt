Footnotes
SHELL GAME broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, dropped off the winner into the stretch
and came back to wear down that foe in the closing strides. ALWAYS PUNCTUAL set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by the
winner nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run but could not resist that foe through the final yards. SCARLETTS PAYBACK was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. LAS TRES MARIPOSAS was away in good order to
press the pace from between foes, checked nearing the quarter and weakened in the drive. TRICKING TRIXIE was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and failed to menace. SEXY PROPOSAL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. BLAME
THE TEQUILA was off slow and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
COWBOY TOBY broke sharply to press the pace of SOUTHERN SUMMER from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and quickly drew off. FABOZZI was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. SOUTHERN SUMMER was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a
half. ALMOST A STORM lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to threaten. WILLY TELL HIM showed brief speed and weakened.
SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ZOMBIE ALAN lacked early speed, moved up for a
contending position and weakened in the drive. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
