SMARTY PANTS SANDY had her heels clipped in the initial quarter, settled off the pace then wore down the leaders in the final stages. HIDDEN CACHE
saved ground throughout, earned a narrow lead in midstretch but was nailed nearing the wire. MO MUMMY broke a step slowly, rushed to the front off the
inside, vied and weakened. VALEURETTE settled off the pace and raced inside throughout with a mild gain. SUPER DUPER FLY pursued the pacesetter
outside then flattened out in the stretch. SWEET FURY raced just off the pace outside and began fading on the turn. THE FURMANATOR broke slowly,
clipped heels and bobbled slightly in the opening quarter and trailed. A claim of foul by the last finisher against the winner for interference on the backstretch
was dismissed.

Footnotes
DR ZRADA trailed early then swung wide rallying to get up in the final strides. EGO MAN vied for lead outside, drifted in near the far turn and had his heels
clipped, rallied clear and was nailed. WHAT'S TO BLAME prompted the pace outside, faltered on the turn but held the show. GONE INZANE dueled along
the inside to the stretch and faded. I'M BLAMING YOU dropped off the pace and weakened steadily. GOLDENLINEOF was urged close up wide then gave
way. LARGE swerved to avoid spill on the turn losing all chance. VICTOR'S DYNASTY struck fallen opponent on the turn and lost his rider. YEI YEI eased
back and clipped heels near the far turn and fell. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the turn and EGO MAN was disqualified and placed
last for interference. YEI YEI suffered a catastrophic injury caused by the spill and was subsequently euthanized.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROMA forced the pace outside, took over after the half then drew away through the stretch driving. THE ANGRY MAN fanned wide into the first
turn, moved inside on the final turn and gained late. POLITICAL trailed far behind then showed late energy inside. KINGS HIGHWAY lacked speed, chased
inside and failed to menace. ARRIVEDERCI was fanned wide into the first turn, raced close up and weakened. FLIGHT RISK prompted the pace outside to
the five sixteenths pole and stopped. HEART OF A DREAMER dropped far behind, drifted wide and raced far behind. KID MAC COOL led early, suffered an
injury and was eased after half a mile then vanned off.
