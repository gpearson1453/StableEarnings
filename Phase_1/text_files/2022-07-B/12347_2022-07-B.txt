Footnotes
TRUANCY bobbled at the break, vied from the two path with a pair of rivals to his outside, shook off ROYAL CURRENCY half a mile from home in concert
with PHOTON and tucked inside, showed the way narrowly while badgered through the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away and shook off his main pressure with three-sixteenths to run, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. PHOTON broke in brushing the
near side stall at the start, vied from the three path between foes down the backstretch before shaking off the outermost of the trio tucking to the two path
half a mile from home, pressed the aforementioned foe through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and ran on
to secure the place honors. VOLEUSE chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors, clear of the rest. ROYAL CURRENCY vied four
wide outside a pair down the backstretch until shaken off near the half mile pole, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. EAU CLAIRE coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. GLOCCA MORRA six then five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, went four
wide into upper stretch, faltered. HONOR STAR broke a beat slow without incident, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch until
tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
BE YOUR BEST (IRE) was restless in the gate, had the rider begin to look to move out from the outset, was guided to the outside on the initial straightaway,
went four then three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch then
closed fast to get the lead, kicked clear outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. CALLIE'S GRIT tucked into the two path
on the first turn, settled on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive
into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to hold the place. FREE LOOK came out a bit at the start and broke near the back, was taken up
slightly and briefly by the rider early, angled in outside the seven-eighths, saved ground under restraint on the first turn, pulled under reserve at the back,
shifted to the two path leaving the backstretch, was roused outside the quarter-pole, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with late energy to just
miss the place while up for the show. FREYDIS THE RED (FR) bumped with a rival early, tucked in near the seven-eighths, rounded the first turn in the
three path under restraint, was carried out entering the backstretch, settled towards the rear on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn, came five
wide into the stretch and improved position. CANDLE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and
gave way. FOURWAY STOP moved in down the initial straightaway, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, was given her cue on the final turn,
turned into the stretch under the crop, dropped back between horses into the final furlong and weakened. TURF ACCOUNTANT saved ground on the first
turn, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in while still on her inside lead outside the
furlong marker and failed to rally. TICKER TAPE HOME was bumped hard near the seven-eighths, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace
on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. MILIEU broke a bit slow, was taken up multiple times
while tugging rankly at the bit in the two path around the first turn, checked while continuing to be rank early on the backstretch, went two then three wide
while asked on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then drifted in and failed to threaten. GRACEFUL was hustled from the start then became
keen when taken under a hold early, bumped hard with TICKER TAPE HOME while very rank nearing the first turn, saved ground while hard held on the
inside, dropped back while taking an awkward stride at the three-eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
TRADE SECRET broke out at the start, showed the way early on crossing to the three path before being engaged in head to head combat by AMERICA'S
PRIDE to the inside, dueled with that rival down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing when taking command just outside the quarter
pole, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from flanking challengers a furlong out and inched away gamely to the finish to prevail.
KNOWING GLANCE broke out at the start taking over the lane of the slow breaking CLASSINESS, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge latching on the aforementioned foe a furlong out, dug in under a drive but
was ultimately repelled while running on to the finish. TWEAQUED traded a bump at the start with LET'S BE CLEAR, chased just off the inside getting set
down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to threaten the innermost of a loosely spread out trio a furlong out, kept on clear for the
show honors. CLASSINESS broke a beat slow and lost her lane to KNOWING GLANCE who broke outwards, chased two to three wide until briefly tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and tipped to the two path three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide
into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. LET'S BE CLEAR traded a bump at the start with TWEAQUED, chased just off the inside until put to
coaxing tucked inside half a mile from home, cut the corner into upper stretch surprising the backing away AMERICA'S PRIDE straightened into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid before weakening in the late stages. DAWNLAND coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMERICA'S PRIDE coaxed from the gate, ranged up after the start to duel to the inside of

UNIQUE UNIONS pressed the pace on the outside of three foes then in the four path around the turn, was carried six wide at the quarter-pole then took a
short lead before the three-sixteenths, inched away into the final furlong, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and held sway under steady handling. BOLD
JOURNEY leaned out at the start then was corrected by the rider while off a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, moved from the two path to the four
path around the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, bumped lightly with a rival while coming six wide into the stretch, rallied into the final furlong,
drifted in while gaining late and finished with good energy to just get the place. DR. BLUTE showed good speed, contested the pace on the inside of three
rivals, vied along the rail while still inside those foes on the turn, came out three wide into the stretch then moved out a path further when put to a
left-handed crop, bothered two foes one of which was severe, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths, fought on in the final furlong but
was outfinished while just able to get the show. G MUNNING bumped with a rival at the start then bobbled, was urged along on the outside, went four to five
wide on the turn, bumped lightly with a foe while carried seven wide into the stretch and finished with late energy to just miss the trifecta. COLORMEPAZZI
was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed
kick. TAP'N DE BANK bumped with foes on both sides at the start, contested the pace between horses, vied in the three path while still between opponents
on the turn, was bumped and carried five wide into the stretch then dropped back and tired. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND stumbled at the start then bumped with a
foe but broke with the field, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back at the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch then steadied off heels, moved in near the three-sixteenths and faltered. STREET TSAR displayed good speed, disputed the pace between horses
in the two path, was carried four wide by DR. BLUTE at the quarter-pole then bumped with TAP'N DE BANK and checked sharply, fell back quickly after
encountering the trouble and capitulated. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS' POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN REGARDING THE INCIDENT AT
THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

CAPITAL STRUCTURE (GB) bumped at the start by COASTANA, who broke inwards, pulled on the bit under a rating hold early and grew rank off the heels
of a rival steadying into the first turn along the rail, intermittently sky gazed under restraint off the heels of rivals past the stands the initial time before settling
better through the second turn and down the backstretch remaining along the inside, tipped to the two path with about seven-sixteenths to go and was just
off the inside through the third and final turn patiently handled until placed to urging angling eight wide into upper stretch, straightened away fully roused and
offered up a good kick the outermost of quintet arriving to the eighth pole in contention, swept to the front just outside the sixteenth marker and edged clear
to the finish to score. ICE PRINCESS established the front and showed the way rated along the inside, shied out from a camera tucked under the temporary
rail just past the finish line the first time, remained on hold showing the way until placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch set down for the drive, dug in under threat from a host of rivals and was overtaken a sixteenth out, then ran on willingly to secure the place honors.
COMMUNITY ADJUSTED tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, ran on to
procure the show honors. COASTANA broke in at the start bumping CAPITAL STRUCTURE, chased just off the inside early on before taking to the inside
past the stands the first tim, went just off the inside through the second turn before tipping three wide five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to the wire but was outfinished. QUEEN BOURBON three wide in
pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outifinished in the late
going. CREATIVE CAIRO steadied off heels of rivals early on into the first turn, tracked the pace just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide for home before taking to the inside a furlong out and had no bid. BABY BLYTHE two to three wide in
closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened. MEZCAL chased just off the inside under a

Footnotes
PRANK was hustled to the front, dictated terms in the two path around the turn, drew off while kept to the task to the sixteenth-pole then was geared down
while much the best. ST. BENEDICTS PREP broke near the back of the field, was urged along off the pace, went three then two wide on the turn and
secured the place while no match for the winner. MY BETSY was urged along towards the rear, went three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and failed to rally. MISINTENTION settled well off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and
was no factor. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field, traveled around the turn in
the two path and failed to threaten. HIGH CLASS showed speed then chased the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn, spun four wide
at the quarter-pole, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and tired. O SHAUGHESEY was hustled from the gate, chased the
pace down the backstretch, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn and retreated. SPLURGE was urged along off the pace,
went two then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and faltered. DAGMAR was hustled from the start then hard ridden on the outside,
went four then five wide around the turn and also faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SOLDIER RISING (GB) saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide into upper stretch under a drive,
tucked to near the inside a furlong from home and had the clear leader coming inwards in front, tipped to the two path near the sixteenth marker and offered
up a good kick to just get up in the very last jumps to the wire. STREET READY showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until tipped three
wide into upper stretch, got roused straightened away for home, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat and came
inwards to the inside under a right handed crop through the final sixteenth under threat to the outside and was nailed at the finish. VALUE ENGINEERING
tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to garner the show
honors. SANCTUARY CITY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly
to the line. KINENOS broke out at the start and traded a light bump with HARD LOVE, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. EVER DANGEROUS just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. OCALA DREAM just off the pace tracking
along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. SPANISH KINGDOM two to three
wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLOP SHOT (IRE) just
off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. HARD LOVE traded a
bump at the start with KINENOS, settled just off the inside in closest aim of the leader patiently handled until put to urging at the three-eighths, angled three
wide into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) came in shortly after the start and bumped soundly with CROSS BORDER, was reserved on the outside while racing in the two
path, tipped three wide midway through the final turn, was roused coming to the quarter-pole, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly to make a bid
nearing the furlong marker, took the lead at the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. ARKLOW dropped to the rear, was reserved while saving
ground, tugged at the bit down the stretch for the first time, continued in reserve on the inside through the final turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole,
waited while blocked from that point to inside the three-sixteenths, altered out while finally roused at that juncture, rallied outside in the final furlong and
closed well but was too late while up for the place. L'IMPERATOR (FR) was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was let out on
the far turn then asked coming to the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong
marker, drifted out around the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken while clear for third money. HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) was bumped soundly at the start,
went two then three wide around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide into the stretch then dropped back under a drive and weakened. CROSS BORDER bumped hard with foes on both sides at the start, went three then
four wide around the first turn, dropped to the two path entering the stretch for the first time then made his way to the rail, was rated against the fence from
that juncture, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased into the final furlong under a drive and lacked the
needed kick.

Footnotes
GUNITE stumbled at the start and recovered under hustling to range up inside in tandem with PINEHURST to overthrow the early leader with five and a half
furlongs remaining, pressed PINEHURST from the outside in the two path through swift splits, coming under light coaxing when taking narrow command just
outside the quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch, edged away briefly bracing for the challenge of ACCRETIVE nearing the eighth pole, had that
rival latch on and come inwards and was bumped lightly in the hindquarters nearing the sixteenth marker, leaned out despite a right handed stick seventy
yards from the finish and gamely held on to prevail. ACCRETIVE four wide in pursuit throughout, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to
six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge latching on a furlong from home, came inwards under a right handed stick making brushing contact
with GUNITE'S hindquarters near the sixteenth pole, then had that rival lean outwards and traded leans while battling to the finish and was denied at the
end while well clear of the rest for the place honors. RUNNINSONOFAGUN got pinched out between foes at the start when CORNICHE recovered inwards
from a stumble and ACCRETIVE held his lane, crossed to chase just off the inside down the backstretch before going four to five wide through the turn
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair.
PAPPACAP chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MY
PRANKSTER chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position passing tired
rivals. HOIST THE GOLD bobbled at the break, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. SURFER DUDE hustled from the start, showed the way six paths off the inside in the opening furlong before being displaced by the pair of
PINEHURST and GUNITE, steadily dropped back to the rear of the field with nine-sixteenths to go before tucking three wide into the turn, came under
coaxing just off the inside at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. PINEHURST bobbled at the start and came under hustling
to advance in tandem with GUNITE and overthrow the early leader a furlong into the race, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure every
step of the way by GUNITE to the outside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front just outside the quarter pole and took the inside
route into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. CORNICHE stumbled at the start recovering inwards into RUNNINSONOFAGUN and pinching that rival
against ACCRETIVE, chased four then three wide just off the top pair under coaxing from the half mile pole, faded through the turn, went four wide into
upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC JOHNSON showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped off the pace with three furlongs
to run, came out into the stretch, took over inside the three-sixteenths and drew clear under steady urging. SHARP SENSATION was hustled from the gate,
disputed the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path for most of the turn then dropped to the rail, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch
and proved no match for the winner while able to hold the place. STEERAGE broke a step slow, rushed up under urging then checked off heels around the
five-eighths, raced off the pace, saved ground early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved out a bit more,
steadied behind BRENNAN'S WAR when that foe came out inside the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole
and finished willingly for the show in a tough trip. BRENNAN'S WAR broke out then was corrected by the rider, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked
in the four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch, came out inside the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened.
BOINTHEBACK was hustled from the start then ridden along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. MARTINEZ settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then steadied off heels, moved out
around the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. DISENGAGE was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn
and came up empty. UNCLE BRUCE raced well back in the field, saved ground on the turn and also was no factor. CHAPEL ROAD was hustled from the
start, raced just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and capitulated. PERFECT BANKER pressed the pace
down the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn and tired. SLUGO checked against the rail early, moved out while off the pace, went three then
four wide on the turn and failed to respond. ERIDROMOS raced at the rear of the field, went four wide around the turn and showed little.
