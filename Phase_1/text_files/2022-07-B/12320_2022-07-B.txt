Footnotes
MAHOMES sped to the lead soon after the start and set a pressured pace through early stages, held firm still unleashed around the far turn, came two wide
into the lane, roused for more, responded willingly, widened to a commanding margin and kept to task. POINT OF IMPACT was allowed to settle in opening
stages and raced in the back, picked up the tempo mid-way around the far turn, hustled along four wide into the lane and gained second best. HEZA WILD
RIDE tracked the pace along the inside, angled out late on the far turn, was ridden three wide into upper stretch and stayed on for a share. STAGE DOOR
raced off the early pace, chased four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. SHWEET PERSUASION got bumped and steadied at the start, tugged a
bit into closer contention around the first turn and stalked through the backstretch, given cue three wide midway around the far turn, sustained bid into upper
stretch then came up empty. LUCKY LOUIE broke inward at the start, pressed the pace through the backstretch then faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
TYLER'S TRIBE sped to the lead strides out of the gate and raced on top under some pressure from AINT SO BAD, began to pull away from the field still
unleashed midway around the turn, was ridden two wide into the lane, tapped once right handed in the final furlong, continued to pull away from the field
and finished clearly best. C R INSTA GATOR hustled along in steady pursuit, chased two wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and finished
clearly second best. SUCCESSION got bumped back at the start and raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide into the lane and gained a share.
AIN'T SO BAD broke inward and bumped CAPTAIN DOZER at the start, raced just off TYLERS TRIBE in opening stages, pursued rival through the turn
then weakened in the lane. BLACKTECA chased four wide around the turn and never threatened. CAPTAIN DOZER got bumped back at the start and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HERZEN got bumped at the start then rated midpack three to four wide through the backstretch, moved up to challenge CLEARLY MAD for the lead at the
quarter pole, vied with rival into the final furlong, edged away to a slim lead three wide and just lasted over rail running BILLY YANK. BILLY YANK rated off
the pace in early backstretch then picked up the tempo and angled inside near the half mile marker, cut the corner entering the lane, was inching up along
the rail in closing strides and just missed. CLEARLY MAD set the pace through the backstretch, took on the challenge from HERZEN at the quarter pole,
dueled into the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. FAKE SOLUTION was reserved and raced well off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane and
improved position. APOLLO BAY raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn then shifted three wide and needed more for late impact. SUEZ rated off
the early pace, urged four wide around the far turn and failed to threaten. NEW STRIPE stalked the early pace, urged three wide around the far turn then
tired in the drive. FREER was forwardly placed racing just off the pacesetter then came up empty past the mid-way point around the far turn.
