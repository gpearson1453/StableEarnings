SYNC settled just off of the early pace, saved ground through the backstretch run and into the second turn, lost position nearing the quarter pole, kept to his
task in the stretch run and outlasted the others to prevail. GALLANT OAK broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid fractions through the
backstretch run, widened the lead nearing the top of the lane, was clear in mid-stretch but could not hold off SYNC in the final stages and was second best.
STAY LIT came in tight entering the first turn while just off of the pace, settled off of the solid fractions through the backstretch run, was outrun on the far
turn, rallied in upper stretch and was unable to impact the top two in the end but stayed on to get up in time for the show. HANS GRUBER bobbled at the
start and was off a step slowly, showed early speed and stalked the solid fractions through the backstretch run, vied for the lead nearing the half-mile
marker, gave ground to GALLANT OAK on the far turn and into upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. TIZ A THRILL settled just off of the early pace
while outside of rivals on the first turn, improved position on the backstretch run, chased the top pair on the far turn, gained ground in upper stretch but could
not sustain that run in the final stages and flattened out late.

Footnotes
ROYAL JESTER settled just off of the early speed, gained ground on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch, made a determined late run along the
inside and held gamely in the final strides. GREAT STORY was hustled out of the gate and was sent to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn,
was confronted by HAY JUAN nearing the top of the lane and battled with that foe into upper stretch, was confronted by ROYAL JESTER in deep stretch
and could not hold that bid off and was bested for the win, while holding safely for second. HAY JUAN showed early speed and kept close attendance to the
fast early pace, advanced on the pacesetter on the turn, battled for the lead into upper stretch but could not match strides in the late stages and was
outfinished, while holding safely for third. HOLIDAY HUSTLE chased from the rear early on, steadied off of heels heading to the turn, saved ground into the
drive, gained ground in upper stretch but could not muster a late rally. GALOPIN GOURMET chased the quick early pace to the turn, gained ground
approaching the quarter marker, continued that bid into upper stretch but weakened in the final furlong.

DUMB LUCK broke best and sped to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn while pressed by the runner-up, shook free in upper stretch and
kicked clear in the end. HULA KING was bothered at the start but showed good early speed and tracked DUMB LUCK through the early going, confronted
that foe nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch and outkicked in the final stages, while besting the rest. TIME IS GONE raced close to
the early pace, lost ground on the turn, could not summon a late response but held safely for third in the end. OFFICER OF WAR was bumped at the start,
chased the quick early pace in traffic, checked repeatedly along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. HANDS OFF broke
in at the start, was outrun in the early going and did not threaten. SPEEDY TRIP was shuffled back at the start but recovered to be forwardly placed into the

Footnotes
FILLY PELLI settled off of the early fractions, gained ground along the backstretch run, was asked for run four wide nearing the quarter marker, came within
aim nearing the eighth pole, overtook APPLAUD THE BENCH inside of the final furlong and kicked clear in the late stages. APPLAUD THE BENCH was
sent leaving the break and opened to a clear early lead on the first turn, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, was clear into upper stretch, was
overtaken by FILLY PELLI inside of the final furlong and just held for second in the end. SEENEVA THE CAT came under a tight hold while close to the
early pace, gained ground on the backstretch run, was steered three wide approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outfinished in
the final furlong, while just missing for second. CHELINA was shuffled back leaving the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle through the
backstretch run, slipped to the inside on the far turn and was unable to mount a late rally. UNUSUAL BREEZE stalked the solid early fractions, maintained
position through the backstretch run, dropped back on the far turn and came up empty in the drive. EASTER GRACE settled just off of the early pace, lost
position on the backstretch run, was outrun on the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

IRREFUTABLE broke well and immediately seized the early advantage, repelled all challengers entering the stretch and powered away under a brisk hand
ride. HANDSOME GARY got a good rail trip tracking the early leader, awaited running room through the turn, responded when asked but was unable to
make up any ground on the eventual winner while clearly best of the rest. OUR BOLD PRINCE brushed slightly with SOUND JUDGMENT out of the gate,
stayed wide down the backstretch, bid for the lead alongside that rival entering the turn, finished with good interest but was outkicked in the final stages.
SOUND JUDGMENT broke alertly took a position to the outside of IRREFUTABLE, made a bid with OUR BOLD PRICE to challenge the leader but came up
empty in the final furlong. PLAYING HARDBALL was off a step slow, hustled to keep contact with the field, had no response when asked through the turn
and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER rated just off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, made a three wide move nearing the quarter marker,
loomed in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the eighth pole, took command late and proved best in the end. SUGAR BEETS settled off of the early
pace, came four wide into the backstretch run, improved position nearing the half-mile marker, advanced three wide on the second turn, swung widest to be
five wide in upper stretch and rallied in the final furlong to secure second. SLEEP OVER was asked for early speed and stalked the decent early pace, made
a two wide bid in upper stretch, vied for the lead nearing the eighth pole, was outkicked by the top pair and just held in the end for third. GOVERNOR
ARTHUR took back just off of the early pace, maintained position while saving ground through the backstretch run and into the second turn, advanced in
upper stretch to vie for the lead but could not match strides in the final stages and was outfinished, while just missing for third. PIVOTAL FEVER took
command out of the gate, set a moderate pace under restraint, picked up the pace passing the three-furlong marker, was challenged on all sides at the top
of the stretch and faltered in the final furlong. RUNAWAY KRISTIN hit the gate and was away awkwardly at the start, raced at the rear early, made up some
ground down the backstretch but never made an impact from there. WILL IS CHILL threw his head at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the
pace, was coaxed outside of rivals on the second turn to be five wide into the stretch and was not a factor in the drive.
