Footnotes
ADIOS DINERO dueled along the rail to midstretch, continued on the left lead and drove clear. OPEN CARRY hit the starting gate, advanced inside, angled
out in upper stretch shutting off SHAQ DIESEL then rallied between foes. MORE DRAMA tracked the duelers three wide and churned on for the show.
ANNA'S IMAGE was in range while racing four wide but was one-paced through the lane. SHAQ DIESEL was bumped at the start, raced two wide in
midpack, was shut off and forced to check approaching the eighth pole then regained some momentum and just missed fourth. MR MURGO dueled outside
of the winner to midstretch then tired. LIGHTNING TONES raced five wide and never threatened. CONRADO failed to menace while racing four wide.
TWELVETWO played no factor while racing three wide. ALWAYS THERE was outrun while racing five wide. R K FLACO was bumped at the start, steadied
near the half-mile pole, saved ground and was never close. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SHAQ DIESEL,
OPEN CARRY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FIFTH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
DOMINEERING settled off the early pace three wide, bid three deep around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear and angled in then just
lasted. MONEY FACTOR hopped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied through the lane and just
missed. DIVINE EXCHANGE tracked the pace three wide, angled five near the quarter pole and ran on for the show. PANOTTI raced off the pace two wide,
angled out turning for home, gained between foes but was outfinished for the show. BRODY'S HONOR saved ground off the pace, edged closer three wide
around the far turn, swung six wide near the quarter pole and a belated rally outside. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE was up close inside early, chased inside
around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. STREAKING GREY was hard held while disputing the pace two wide through the opening half, angled in
entering the far turn, led to upper stretch and tired. GREY CHARLOTTE prompted the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GAMBLING TZAR hopped at the start then checked off heels, trailed two wide early, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, struck the front
near the sixteenth pole and held firm. TRAVEL GUIDE saved ground in range early, went three wide around the far turn, was boxed in through most of the
stretch run, found room leaving the sixteenth pole, closed between foes and just missed. RAGING WHIRLWIND stalked the early pace two wide, settled off
the duel inside down the backstretch and around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes. TAKEMYSHOT raced off the early pace
three wide, checked while getting rank midway around the first turn, rushed up outside down the backstretch, dueled three wide from there to the sixteenth
pole and weakened late. DUNKLE pressed the pace three wide around the first turn, dueled between foes from about the five-eighths marker to the
sixteenth pole and tired. MY BROTHER MIKE set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of two foes down much of the backstretch, around the far turn and
through the sixteenth pole then caved. BLUTO'S CANDY was outrun while saving ground early and going three wide down the backstretch and around the
far turn. PALACE SINGER chased the pace three and four wide, steadied midway around the far turn and retreated. AN OBJECTION FROM THE TRAINER
OF TRAVEL GUIDE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
NOVGOROD THE GREAT stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the lane, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole and dug in between
foes to prevail. ALADO was off slow, trailed three wide early, came five wide into the lane, closed outside and just missed. MAMBA ON THREE set a
pressured pace two wide, was collared near the sixteenth pole fought on inside of the winner to the wire. OFFICER COUNTRY lacked speed, raced five to
six wide and finished well. NO NAY FRANKLIN (IRE) settled off the pace inside, angled out in the stretch and had a mild rally. ONUR (ARG) chased the
pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. TIZ ROMANTIC vied inside to upper stretch and tired. NEW YORK'S FINEST tracked the pace three wide, was
shut off near the eighth pole and had no further bids.

THIS RUN'S FOR YOU set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. BORIS prompted the winner three wide, continued on the left lead in the
lane and held second. TICKING was in range two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. KOHAKU saved ground and
failed to menace. SUPER COMPUTING chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. NATIONAL UNITY raced three wide and never
threatened. SCANDALISSIMO played no factor while racing four wide. MISTER ABARRIO made little impact while racing two wide. BELTS 'N BROOKS
steadied soon after the start, raced three wide and was never in contention. MAJOR DEAL was outrun inside. ROLLING ON chased the pace four wide and

Footnotes
MEADE hit the starting gate, raced well back outside, advanced five wide around the turn, steadily gained and was up late. HIERRO set the pace in the two
path, led to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER tracked the pace from the rail and churned on inside of foes for the show.
HERE COMES BULLET had early speed between foes, was shuffled back nearing the half-mile pole, re-bid four wide around the turn and flattened out a bit
late. BOURBON WISDOM pressed the pace three wide to upper stretch and faded. BLESSED JOURNEY failed to menace while racing two wide. TONE
FEELIN was outrun while racing three wide. IL FARAONE trailed inside.

WIND NINETY NINE pressed the pace two wide, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. FROSTED ARMOUR set the pace along the
rail under pressure from the winner, could not keep pace with that foe in upper stretch but held well clear of the rest. RUSSIAN TO WIN stalked the pace
three wide and faded in the lane while besting the rest. BOCA GUY chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. MR RUM RUNNER was in range
inside and had no response. THE TWINS SNEAKERS played no factor while racing three wide. GRAN ANDREWS steadied leaving the three-quarters
marker and was always outrun inside. HUNTER trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LANIAKEA STORM raced in range two wide between foes, angled four wide nearing the far turn, swept to the front three deep nearing the quarter pole,
quickly cleared, angled in turning for home and held safe under a drive. TIZ ENOUGH steadied at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four
wide around the far turn and finished well. ROSA STAR stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes around the far turn, briefly led near the five-sixteenths
pole, could not keep pace with winner from there and held well enough for the show. ZAMBAK was bumped soon after the start then pinched back, raced off
the pace two wide, advanced five wide around the far turn but failed to sustain the bid in the lane. SUSANS NOVELA exchanged several bumps with KIZZY
in the early stages, raced two and three wide in midpack and lacked a closing bid. SEMIRAMIS saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far
turn and never threatened. KIZZY exchanged several bumps the first time through the stretch, prompted the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.
NOVELERA was bumped at the start, saved ground and made little impact. KNOWWHENTOFOLDEM was sawed off early, saved ground well back, went
four wide around the far turn and never reached contention. LOUELLA STREET was bumped at the start, had some speed inside, steadied off heels early
on the first turn, chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. CINDY'S SONG set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the five-sixteenths
pole.
