E T'S SUPER STAR trailed early inside, moved out in the stretch and quickly surged clear in the final furlong. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE stalked the
pacesetters outside, led into the stretch and finished gamely for the place. DUNE DUNE earned a narrow advantage outside, lost the lead but continued
willingly to the finish. DIABLO D ORO dropped far behind outside, moved very wide into the stretch while no threat. PORSUPUESTO bid closer outside on
the turn then flattened out late. SPLITZVILLE bumped early, raced between rivals early then inside and failed to threaten. DANGNABBIT dueled along the
inside to the quarter pole and stopped.

DRONE SWARM prompted the pace three wide, vied throughout and was just up following a long drive. CATCH MY VIBE forced the pace inside, eased
back to the outside in the lane then came again just missing. LAST INVESTMENT held a narrow lead between rivals then inside and continued gamely to
the finish. TWO PRINCES settled off the leaders outside then closed the gap inside rivals late. FEARLESS FLY dropped far back after the start and was
never a factor. DON'T RECALL stumbled at the start, saved ground and was always outrun.

UPTOWN AMANDA quickly took control, widened in the stretch and maintained a big advantage under mild urging late. BRUNO BARBER GIRL angled
inside advancing on the turn and proved easily second best while no threat to the winner. WINNING MOON broke slowly and steadied, raced wide early,
angled inside and rallied. GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE chased in the two path and was never in contention. STORMIN' ELVIS pursued the winner briefly and
gave way on the turn. HAWAIIAN TALENT lacked speed and trailed most of the trip. DESI'S REWARD ran off prior to the start and ordered a late scratch.

PIANZI trailed early, advanced very wide on the turn and stretch then surged late to get up in time. CANT STOP THIS MAN set a pressured pace off the
inside, repelled that challenge, bid clear briefly but was nailed. FLOAT ON pressed the pacesetter outside to the final furlong and finished gamely. MR
SANDMAN prompted the pace inside in the opening quarter then began tiring on the turn. LOVERBOY LOU dropped off the pace outside and lacked a solid
rally. SCREEN SAVER raced along the inside and weakened steadily. CELTIC HEART raced wide throughout and faltered.
