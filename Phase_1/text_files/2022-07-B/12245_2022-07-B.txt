MISSY LIZZY stalked the pace surging to a short lead at the quarter pole wresting daylight in upper stretch before taking off in mid stretch to win going
away. BORDEAUX LEGACY bobbled at the break quickly recovering to stalk early pressing up in bid along the inside on the turn extending near the rail in
upper stretch proving no match for the winner late holding up to save place. HERO OF LIFE slow early raced evenly on the turn gaining then holding
position from mid track the final eighth. ECLIPSE GLOW veered in leaving the gate, trailed after saving ground to upper stretch passing some tired ones
there at the rail. GRAND VENUS a step slow through the turn raced wide to upper stretch finding no rally in the eight path. LADY ARCH was never involved.
SMOKING FOX sped clear early then was passed on the turn fading through the lane in the four path.

BREANNA brushed at the break was rushed wide through the turn giving steady response in the six path down the lane coming on a clear second best.
TWN TAWFEERS PARTY brushed at the break lagged through the turn racing inside to upper stretch gaining modestly there. DAH PHILLY chased through
the turn weakening near mid track in upper stretch. SEA MY MOVES pressured the pace through the turn wearing out the final eighth. QUEEN OF

ORBETTE slow early circled the field on the turn coming six wide in upper stretch angling in while running down rival to win clear. BLUEGRASS CANDY
stalked the pace pressing along the inside to wrest the lead outside the quarter pole shaking clear in the two path upper stretch angling out a bit late proving
no match for a wide closer. DARLINDIVA away alertly set the pace being collared between horses nearing the quarter pole weakening in the four path late.
BELLA BASORA chased the pace pressing three deep on the turn weakening near mid track in upper stretch. BREAKING THE CODE saved ground failing
to mount a bid.
