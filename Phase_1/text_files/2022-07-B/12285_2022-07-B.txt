Footnotes
WEEKEND PASS settled toward the outside, picked up her pace after a half mile, was two wide taking the second bend, took over between horses upper
stretch then steadily opened up while ridden out. JACK'S FINALE also rated off the early leaders, commenced her bid as well after a half mile, vied for the
lead briefly at the top of the lane, was no match for WEEKEND PASS then fought to keep second the final furlong. VIVA VIOLENCE was sent to the early
lead, was challenged from outside on the backstretch, moved ahead approaching the end of six furlongs, drifted out some entering the lane, was overtaken
from inside, tried to battle back for second deep stretch but did not have enough late. FRIEND rated between rivals on the backstretch, also started her bid
after four furlongs, swung to the outside into the second turn, drifted out leaving that bend and gradually closed the gap on the second flight in the stretch.
SILVER POM POM was sent to contest the pace outside VIVA VIOLENCE but began to wear down before finishing six furlongs. UNIVERSIADE was always
outrun.

Footnotes
THAT KHENNY was kept close from inside, took over along the rail when allowed on the turn, drew away under a drive upper stretch and was kept to task
to the wire. SEMINOLE BEACH bumped at the start, was settled inside, picked up his pace on the bend, swung out behind SNOOZER into the lane, altered
in some for a clear path upper stretch, closed well and caught FAITHFUL RULER for second at the wire. FAITHFUL RULER broke alertly, was challenged
from both sides into the turn, floated out some for the stretch run, did not stay with THAT KHENNY as he gradually drifted out and was outfinished for the
place. SHANGHAI SILVER was reluctant to load, broke outward once the race began, bumping RODEO MAN, was widest on the turn, angled in with two
furlongs left, moved clear for third while two wide upper stretch then leveled off. RODEO MAN was bumped and forced into SEMINOLE BEACH at the start,
soon trailed from outside, stayed well off the inside taking the bend and lacked a significant stretch bid. SNOOZER helped prompt the early pace, was three
wide on the turn, carried out some entering the stretch and gave way.

TRUIST pressed from between horses, advanced three wide on the bend, edged ahead with a furlong to go and held off DARREN'S LEGACY under steady
handling. DARREN'S LEGACY prominent from outside, lost ground four wide through the turn and found best stride too late deep stretch. U S HONOUR
NAP contested the pace between rivals, was two wide through the bend, battled in the lane but slowly wore down inside the last furlong. ROCKET MAN
ATTACK set a pressured pace from inside, fought through the stretch but flattened out inside the final eighth. I'M YOUR VALENTINE chased from inside,
closed the gap upper stretch, angled out inside the final sixteenth and leveled off. PONCHO ATTACK chased from outside, was two wide taking the bend
then had no stretch bid.

TETSU rated off the early speed, waited behind W W SCOUT'S HONOR on the bend, got through outside that one entering the lane, the rider appeared to
lose his whip at that point but slowly edged ahead under hand urging inside the final furlong. W W SCOUT'S HONOR was kept close outside WILDWOOD
SECRET, took over the lead three wide on the turn, was challenged from outside in the stretch, fought gamely but did not have enough left in the late going.
DIAMOND MAXIMUS broke a step slow and inward, was steadied, advanced from outside to threaten four wide on the turn, floated out some into the
stretch, could not sustain his bid but was easily best of the others. WILDWOOD SECRET displayed early speed just outside SUSPECT but began to yield
two wide leaving the bend. SUSPECT contested the pace from inside but also faded leaving the turn.

Footnotes
WATERMARK was bumped and forced out into VICTORIA'S DOLL then CYBERTAP, jostled briefly with the latter, quickly recovered, was hustled up to
prompt CREAL SUGAR from just outside, went for the lead on the bend, was carried out by the latter into the lane, edged ahead upper stretch, gradually
lugged in under right-handed pressure inside the last furlong but held sway. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC raced in contention from inside from the beginning,
commenced her bid on the turn, swung out behind WATERMARK entering the lane, altered to the inside for a clear path upper stretch, closed well, was
crowded by CREAL SUGAR nearing the wire but edged ahead for the place in the final strides. CREAL SUGAR broke outward, bumped solidly with
WATERMARK initiating a chain reaction of interference to several outside the latter, took the lead after leaving the chute, was challenged from outside with
three furlongs to go, floated out into the stretch, lost the advantage, fought gamely to come back, also gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure
inside the final eighth, brushed with JAMAICAN TRAFFIC nearing the wire and was outfinished. BURNING BUSH broke on top but soon dropped well back,
picked up her pace three wide on the turn, began to fan out nearing the end of four furlongs, lost ground floating out to path six entering the lane, showed a
willingness to run late and proved easily best of the rest. BEE A WINNER void of speed between rivals, was two wide on the bend, also swung out leaving
the turn and passed between some tired rivals the final eighth. CYBERTAP jostled with WATERMARK just after the break then VALE OF EVESHAM leaving
the chute, was checked, improved position from inside on the turn and upper stretch then leveled off. VALE OF EVESHAM jostled with CYBERTAP leaving
the chute, rushed up, once clear, between rivals to be an early contender but began to fade three wide before finishing a half mile. VICTORIA'S DOLL was
squeezed between horses just after the start, appeared to clip heels leaving the chute, was checked, taken out widest of all, remained there and showed
little. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. After their review CREAL SUGAR was disqualified and placed eighth for coming out at the start, initiating a
chain reaction of interference

Footnotes
NAUGHTY ALFRED hesitated at the start, was hustled up to gain the advantage before finishing a furlong, soon moved clear and gradually angled in, was
challenged on the bend, responded when roused at the quarter pole, moved clear with mild urging upper stretch and proved clearly best while ridden out the
final furlong. ONE PUTT RICHIE prominent from inside, waited for room on the turn, got through two wide entering the lane, took over second then could
only maintain his position late. BRAVO BRAVO soon trailed from outside, was just off the rail on the turn, swung widest for the stretch run, was all out the
last eighth and got up for third. TAP'S BIG SHOT went for the lead outside NAUGHTY ALFRED on the bend, floated out some into the lane and gradually
wore down. TALIS PARK GRAD came off the rail on the backstretch, loomed a threat three wide on the turn, stayed outside TAP'S BIG SHOT into the
stretch and failed to have the needed late kick.

Footnotes
CARSON RESERVE was kept close between horses, three wide on the turn, stayed outside MIND YOUR OWN entering the stretch, rallied under steady
urging, gained the advantage with seventy yards to go and began to drew clear near the wire. MINI DRESS came into contention two wide on the turn,
fought for the lead just inside MIND YOUR OWN with a sixteenth left but did not have enough left in the waning yards. MIND YOUR OWN shared the lead
outside SNOOTY nearing the end of two furlongs, moved ahead on the turn, drifted out to path four entering the stretch and slowly wore down between
rivals inside the last eighth. RONAN a step slow leaving the gate, was settled well back and inside, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, saved ground
taking the turn, weaved around traffic midstretch, closed well from along the rail deep stretch but came up short. DIAMOND GUCCI raced in contention from
outside on the backstretch but faded three wide on the bend. SNOOTY broke inward, was corrected and gained the lead after the first sixteenth of a mile,
was challenged nearing the end of two furlongs and began to fade from along the rail before finishing a half mile.
