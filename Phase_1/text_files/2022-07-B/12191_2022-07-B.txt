Footnotes
MIGHTY BOISTEROUS away cleanly, debut apprentice rider stayed in the clear and well off the rail on the turn, mildly encouraged entering the turn, made
a eye catching move three to four wide throughout the turn, entered stretch in the four path and altered inside of clear rival in upper stretch, move proved to
be the winning one as MIGHTY BOISTEROUS easily drove past leader. AUNTIE BEV came out and bumped rival at the start, showed good speed to clear
along the inside, entered turn clear and increased lead on the turn, entered stretch clear and in the three path, remained clear until deep stretch when
caught by rallying rival. SISKIYOU SKY broke out and bumped rival at the start, settled into a stalking two wide position on the backstretch, continued two
wide on the turn, split rivals in mid stretch and finished willingly. ADMIRAL AESCHBACH bothered by inside rival at the start, asked early for speed and
found a inside chasing position, entered turn along the inside, took a awkward step with hind end early on turn and lost momentum, regained stride and in
rang entering the stretch, and kept on under urging to the wire. LORRHA bumped by inside rival at the start, showed good speed and pressed pace two
wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, in range entering the stretch and failed to kick on with rivals. GABES GIRL away cleanly, stalked
pace in the third flight along the rail, continued along the rail entering the turn, had to steady sharply when rival took and awkward step on the turn, rebid
along the inside exiting the turn and once again stymied by same rival entering the stretch, finally in the clear in the lane and coasted home under minimal
urging. FANTASY HIGH off bit slow and bumped at the start with inside rival, mildly urged early and failed to accelerate with the field, settled well off the
pace and failed to threaten when asked in the lane.

Footnotes
BALLROOM HUSTLER pressed leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, came up head and head with leader entering the
stretch, dueled with game rival to the sixteenth pole and began to edge away in final sixteenth to win clear. LUCKY LUPE away cleanly and took to the front
on the backstretch, continued to lead on the turn and held slim margin along the inside, entering the stretch, dueled with outside rival most of the stretch
until yielding late. QUEEN'S MARQUE chased duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn and began to lose contact
with top two, failed to threaten top two entering the stretch and coasted home well clear of next rival. SHANGHAI COMMAND lacked speed early and fell
way back, stayed along the inside throughout and managed to pass rival who blew the turn. BIG COLE MAN away cleanly, in a uncomfortable position
exiting the chute and rider chose to drop back, stayed well off the rail on the turn and failed to corner into the stretch, lugging out into the seven path, and
not asked to the wire.

good acceleration, drifted out passing the gap and proved no match for clear winner. BETTER WORLD away cleanly, had a wide path throughout and kept
on under mild urging. DASHAS DYNASTY lunged towards the inside and came out at the start, mild urging thereafter and showed a good stride. CREATIVE
CORONA off half length slow, shied and came in three lanes at the start, asked left handed and finished trying hard. RUN DAPISAURUS RUN away a step
slow and in, drifted in passing the gap, briefly lost path, but did not affect much while being outrun.
