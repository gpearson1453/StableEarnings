GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader, then made a steady gain and drew off late.
DOM THE BOMB sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the
rest. ATTUCK unhurried early, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and closed for the show. SAMURAI LEGACY
stalked the pace on the outside, looped three wide through the turn and faded into the stretch. GUACO broke a step slowly from the gate and was no factor.

Footnotes
ROAD TO THE CROWN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, dropped back into the stretch, then came again, lugged in and drove clear late.
BAROLA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside the leader, gaining command, then was no match for that one late and
held the place. TAMI'S ORCHID allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed willingly
for the show. SHES A THREAT rated inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong.
BELLE GOSSE steadied into the first turn, angled out for clear racing room, angled in through the second turn, came through inside of rivals and weakened
in the lane. NOW PRAMELA well placed, gained position three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened.
PERGOLA was no factor.
