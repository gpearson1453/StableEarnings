OFFICER APPEAL was firmly rated to show the way, drew away at the rail on the far turn and proved much the best to win handily. CHESAPEAKE
CHARLIE saved ground off the early pace, challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole, but retreated on the far turn and settled for second.
RIGHTEOUS MAN settled off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. STEP OUT
DANCING raced off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded on the far turn. CITIZEN'S FIRE settled off
the pace about the four path on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole then flattened on the far turn. EXPLOITATION raced wide on the
opening turn and never factored.

up later yards. BOUNDTOBEOK took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching
the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling, was caught late but held on for second. LONG LEGS LOUISE
stalked off the rail, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close through the backstretch, dropped back toward the quarter pole, rounded
the far turn near the rail and remained a factor to late stretch before flattening stride. JAMESTOWN ROAD settled off the rail on the first turn, left the turn
outside and gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. LACE REVOLUTION rounded
the opening turn about the four path and raced close into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran in the three path of the

CAPE LOOKOUT rated close off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, factored off the rail on the far turn, dueled at even terms through the
upper stretch and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over PROTA through later yards, while the latter took the lead nearing the three quarter pole
and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled at even terms between
horses through the upper stretch but grudgingly ceded later yards. NOVA BOY settled off the early pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, raced close near the rail on the far turn and remained a factor through the upper stretch before relenting later yards. FIRE DOWN BELOW
rounded the first turn about the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far
turn in the four path and ran evenly in the lane. KING NEKIA saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail and ran evenly in the lane. JEFFERY SCOTT rounded the opening turn about the five path and showed little response through the backstretch.
CHRISATUDE raced off the pace two deep while between horses on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
SOCIAL CHIC took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, was pressured from the three eighths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far
turn and dug in determinedly to edge out the game effort of SHAMELESS RISK, who stalked two deep and challenged nearing the three eighths pole,
contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to the wire. ALLEN CAN DO IT came away a bit awkwardly and rounded the
opening turn about the three path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran
evenly in the lane. MINISTRY OF MAGIC saved ground racing well back from early contention, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the four path and was closing well late. SPUNMAN saved early ground, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail then weakened. DIVINING DANCER saved ground. HUMPTY GRUMPTY rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole,
faded through the far turn and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
EPIC TIME angled to the rail and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn and
was steadily handled to widen the final sixteenth. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE stalked from the three path, challenged toward the five sixteenths pole, contested
at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in through the lane and just lasted for second. TWILIGHT YEARS stalked three wide, picked up the
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn but dug in through the lane and just missed second.
BLUE N GOLD settled off the rail on the opening turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and ran evenly in the lane.
ROAD SLEW saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn then finished evenly
to pass rivals. HILLBILLY ROCK saved early ground just off the pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn.
SUGAR LIPS showed little response. REMYS GUNSMOKE came away awkwardly then stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
faded at the rail approaching the head of the lane. MIO GRACELAND was not a factor. SECRET SWIRL showed little response.
