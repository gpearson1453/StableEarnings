Footnotes
OSBIN sent from the gate, sprinted away from the field, held sway without challenge and held under brisk handling in the lane. GORUN allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, then closed willingly to gain the place and be clearly best of the rest. OLE G
MAN tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. GERRYS MAGIC MAP well placed
and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. WHONEW'S TREASURE was no factor.
GOVERNOR ATWOOD well placed and between, faded on the two path through the turn.

DORISTO sent in the early going, drew clear of the field, stayed on when challenged through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled out, then
came again in the late going and drove clear. ABE HONESTLY well placed and inside, angled out two and three wide through the turn, bid, then lacked the
needed late kick and held the place. AMERICAN CHAOS well placed and outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, held sway to the final
yards, then weakened and held the show. BISHI never far back, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, angled
out and evened out. EAGLES PALACE well placed, gained position four wide into the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened
the final furlong. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE hopped at the start, looped widest through the turn and inside the stretch and passed tiring rivals. KIANG
tracked the pace and faded through the turn. JESSE JONES unhurried in the early going, looped three wide through the turn, angled in and came through
inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not gain.

DECLARED rated inside early, saved ground through the turns, got through inside the leader into then stretch, made a steady gain and drew off under mild
urging. A COTSWOLD VILLAGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then was no match for the winner,
while clearly best of the rest. HEIRLOOM KITTEN tracked the pace in the early going, moved to a stalking position down the backstretch, bid three wide
outside the leader into the stretch and flattened out, holding the show. INDIAN GULCH allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled five wide
into the stretch and gained a share. CEDUNA well placed and outside, lost some ground through the second turn, then had no stretch rally. ENGLISH

ROSES FOR DEBRA tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, angled out when clear, shook loose quickly,
then drew off and was kept to the task. YOU LOOK COLD well placed and outside, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into
the stretch, then could not threaten the winner and closed well for the place. NEW HIRE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the stretch and got up for the show. MYSTIC TWIST set a pressured pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then
weakened late and held a share. TRIPLE R RATED veered in after the chute, was steadied and corrected, then moved up two and three wide through the
turn, angled in in the stretch and improved position. SHOSHANAH pressed the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on

Footnotes
PATSY'S BIG GIRL well placed, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off late.
SASSY MISS MARGIE mid pack, saved ground turns, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid, angled out, made a steady gain and edged
up in the final strides. RED LINGERIE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off down the backstretch, then stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, weakened late and held the show. KEYPIT broke a step slowly, was well placed and outside, gained position three and four wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. YO YO MON well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside
and weakened the final furlong. MOANA'S TALE well placed early, steadily lost ground. HOXIE showed little. LACEE was no factor. ANIMAUXSELLE
hopped at the start, was never involved.
