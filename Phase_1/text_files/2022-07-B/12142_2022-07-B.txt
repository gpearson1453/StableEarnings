Footnotes
LULOS broke on top, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, dueled up the backstretch and into the turn, put the other speed away turning for home,
held the runner up comfortably at bay late under steady handling. LEROY JENKINS back off the early pace, angled out three wide when moving closer late
in the turn, chased the winner into the lane, could do little with that one late, clearly second best. INDEFENSIBLE closest to the dueling leaders for a half,
came up empty for the stretch run. MUCHO VELOCE in a bit tight at the start to be last away, trailed up the backstretch, continued to lack speed through the
turn, picked off a single tiring rival through the stretch while never a serious threat. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE dueled up front outside the winner for almost
five furlongs and caved in when the real running began at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
PAYDAY TOO allowed the pace to go early along the inside, loose restraint up the backstretch behind the first flight, closer behind some traffic into the
stretch, shifted out slightly when straightened for home, continued to grind on, collared the leader in the waning strides and was up in the last couple of
jumps. TURN ON THE MAGIC prompted the leader off the inside through some leisurely early fractions, challenged and took over turning for home, clear a
furlong out, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. SOCIAL AFLEET last to leave, moved up to a forward position on the outside, continued three wide
far turn, came up empty for the stretch run to prove no match for the top two, clear of the others. COOL CATOMINE broke on top, worked way clear before
a quarter, set a soft set of early fractions then yielded to the runner up turning for home, continued to weaken through the stretch. GENTRIFIED lacked any
early foot, continued back in failing to muster a rally. AKHNAS fell back to trail just after the start, fell further and further behind, jogged in through the stretch
after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
KAHAAL broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, continued to be clear into the straight, drifted out slightly nearing the furlong grounds, held the next
two safe late in finding more. AHIMAAZ last away, was rank along the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground through the turn, proved
determined in a battle for the runner up spot late while unable to get the winner. MACHO RONNIE hopped at the start, quickly recovered to chased the
winner into the turn off the inside, three path into the lane, steered inside the winner past the furlong marker, late battle for the place, outkicked for that spot
while between those two at the wire. TAPIT TO THE LINE settled back off the pace and the inside, lacked a closing response through the stretch to finish up
evenly. MAJESTIC MANDATE bobbled at the start, trailed throughout to finish well back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

CITIZENS REWARD in the second flight early inside, moved out and advanced to the front late in the final turn, engaged entrymate nearing the furlong
grounds and wore that one down under steady handlng. TOOSIE broke on top, set the pace inside, shook off the other speed to be clear in the final turn,
briefly responded when confronted by the winner a furlong out, remained clear for the second spot. OVERLY SWEET back off the early pace, continued to
lack speed the middle half, lodged a mild rally up the inside to annex the show. DAVE'S RONDA dueled up front outside the runner up, faltered far turn.
CRAFTY PRINCESS last away, trailed in the rear flight off the inside, came four wide for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to improve a bit. LAST
DESTINY in the second group off the inside, tired in the drive.

ITSONLYMONEYHONEY behind the pace off the inside into the turn, came in the four path for the drive, blew by the two leaders past the furlong marker
and won going away while ridden out. BRAVE OLLIE dueled up front off the inside, offered little resistance to the winner the final furlong, drew clear of the
others. CANDY'S PARADE broke out, fell back to trail after the start, picked off a single tiring rival down the stretch without making much of an impact.
LOVE THAT STAR away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

ROUX BANDIT broke well, dueled up front in the two path into the turn, shook off the other speed by late in the turn to be clear into the lane, well clear past
the furlong marker, enough left to hold the next two safe late. CASH BIZNESS in the second flight off the inside, continued three wide through the turn, set
down for the drive, steadily getting to the winner late. BITSY C C LIL GIRL behind the pace along the inside early, angled out to race in the two path when
closest to the winner turning for home, lacked a closing punch. JULIO CHOICE behind the pace outside, four wide through the turn, continued one paced
through the lane to finish up evenly. SLIDE fell back off the issue early, also failed to mount a significant response in the drive. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
dueled up front inside the winner for almost three furlongs and gave way. KIKI KAT off a step slow, trailed throughout in failing to menace. QUARTER MILE

SWEET TEMPERAMENT away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, well clear past the furlong
marker, enough left to last. SCARLETT O'HARA back off the early pace toward the inside, continued to save some ground into the lane, shifted out a bit
with less than a furlong remaining, late push to rapidly close the gap on the winner late. SIENNA BREEZE fell back to trail just after the start, continued to
lag turn, four to five wide entering the stretch, modest interest down the middle of the strip to be well clear of the others, no match for the top two. ACTION
POTENTIAL closest to the dueling leaders early, three wide and between foes into the lane, lacked a closing response. HARRIET'S DREAM alternated up
front outside the winner for almost three furlongs and caved in late turn.

Footnotes
MR. E EDWARDS pressed the issue up the backstretch in the three path, took over late in the turn, kicked in upper stretch and drew off under mostly his
own courage to win ridden out. PAC THE PULPIT broke sharp, fell back off the lead pack soon after, asked three wide when advancing exiting the turn, up
late for the place while not a threat to the winner. GENES FEATHER broke well behind the runner up, vied up front along the inside, proved no match for the
winner stretch, caught late for the place. PERFECT STRIKE with the pace while between foes, began to weaken after a half. K R TARGET in mid pack just
off the inside, had little for the drive. ROYAL SOLUTION last to leave, remained back in trailing through out in showing little while racing outside.
