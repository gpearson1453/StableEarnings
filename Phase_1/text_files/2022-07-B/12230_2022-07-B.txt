DREAMINOFPASSION stalked the early leader, had a slim lead on the turn and was much the best. SHOW SOME SKIN was up close and a factor from
between foes on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SARARENDA showed speed from the inside but
chased on the turn and had nothing left. LOUEMMA settled off the early leaders, trailed on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to
fire.

SHANGHAI KIMMY was hustled from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure at the top of the stretch drew off. J M R BOLD VISION was
off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and was up for place. MS. P'S BELLA was away alertly and had a bid on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch needed more. LOADED ONCE MORE tracked the early leaders and was a factor from between foes on the turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch leveled off. JUNGLE GODDESS was in range but trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. WORDS OF GOLD was up close early but
chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

from the inside, was a factor on the turn and had a bid from the four path through the stretch in a good effort. NOT A GAME was in touch and hustled along
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. THY KINGDOM was well back, gained ground on the turn and from the five path
at the top of the stretch finished well. JOCULARITY was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late

Footnotes
LITTLE FIRE was off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch rallied in time. SEAQUELLE was unhurried
early, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. BURMESE showed speed and set the pace, had a clear
lead on the far turn but failed to hold. DREAM NOW was in mid pack and a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
PICTUREDAY JESSICA stalked the early leader but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. SHE AINT NO JOKE had no speed, showed little and was
never in contention. REGAL BILLEE was in touch and saved ground on the far turn but was not a factor. BLACK TAFFY was in range and had a good
position on the far turn but dropped back through the stretch.
