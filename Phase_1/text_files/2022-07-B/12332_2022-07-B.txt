Footnotes
FRISCO LINE rushed to vie for the lead four wide nearing the turn, tucked two wide at the three furlong pole, inched clear turning for home, shifted ground
outwardly entering the lane, and held sway under driving pressure through the final furlong. UNCLE NICK nudged an outer rival at the start, tracked in the
two to three path before swinging five wide entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes while hanging on his left lead to reach place in the shadow of the
wire. SOUTHERN SENSE tracked four wide and between horses, tucked three wide turning for home, reached place at the furlong grounds while hoping to
attempt a bid inside of the clear leader, but flattened out in the final furlong, and was nailed for place. T MONEY tracked while hung outside of the main
group six to five wide around the turn, tucked four wide turning for home, but only managed to chase through the lane. MR. MARIAH was among the top
flight two wide and between horses, shifted inwardly turning for home, but checked in tight quarters along the rail at the furlong grounds. BRUCE ON THE
LOOSE broke inwardly, vied two wide early on, then only inside of the eventual winner around the turn, failed to keep pace at the five sixteenths pole,
wandered about as rivals on either side ranged up in upper stretch, put his inner challenger to tight quarters at the furlong grounds, and weakened shortly
after. STRICKLAND broke a step slowly before shying from an outer rival at the start, trailed three wide, swung six wide entering the lane, and moved up.
INDIAN SPRINGS tracked five wide and between horses, but faded at the three furlong pole. KEEP ON never got involved. CIRCLE THE KID hustled to vie
along the inside early on, but chased outer foes into the turn before checking when put to tight quarters at the five sixteenths pole,, and weakened. SING
ME AN ALIBI broke a beat slowly while getting bumped by an inner rival at the start, avoided trouble from an outer rival by doing so, yet made little impact
thereafter. ARTIE AND JESSIE raced close up three wide and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
CHIQUITA MOSCA broke inwardly, tracked along the inside, inched closer under urging entering the lane, produced a bid for the lead inside of a green
KENTUCKY REIGN nearing the furlong grounds, led leaving that station, and drew clear soon after. KENTUCKY REIGN rushed after a flat footed beginning
to show the way leaving the chute, set the pace in the two path into the turn as an outer GATHERING STORM pressed, repelled that foe while shifting to the
three path entering the lane, but greenly shied from, yet into, a right handed crop in upper stretch, saw CHIQUITA MOSCA produce a rail bid in the
aftermath, got headed by that foe at the furlong grounds before the rider tried another right hand, which caused another shy nearing the sixteenth pole, then
kept on willingly once the rider put the crop away. BIG DIG trailed two wide and between horses into the turn, commenced a rally by splitting foes four wide
turning for home, and sustained an advance to reach show in the closing stages. GATHERING STORM stalked three wide, pressed the leader two wide
from the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace while being floated to the four path entering the lane, and tired thereafter. LADAN pressed two
wide and between horses early on, backed off to stalk from the inside into the turn, but weakened nearing the quarter pole. NEED SOME MONEY settled off
of the pace along the inside, trailed two wide at the five sixteenths pole, then improved inside of wide foes entering the lane. INQUIETA raced off of the pace
three wide, gained mildly four wide around the turn, but weakened while drifting out turning for home. LITURGIA chased three wide and from between
horses around the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SHES BOUT A MOVER prompted the pace two wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led at the quarter pole, drew clear while tipping to the three path
entering the lane, held sway before meeting SHANNON's inner challenge inside the final furlong, and held firm from that foe and a pair of outer chasers
through the late stages. SHANNON broke a bit outwardly, stalked along the inside around the turn, split foes two wide in upper stretch after SHES BOUT A
MOVER kicked clear, grinded away to attempt a bid inside of that foe nearing the sixteenth pole, but was kept at bay. DEVINE CHARGER tracked from off
of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, came into the lane four wide, stayed on outside of foes, vied for show in the final sixteenth, and
prevailed. HEY KITTEN broke outwardly to open space, stalked three wide, but lacked a kick while in pursuit of the clear leader in upper stretch, chased
between foes late, but was outfinished for show. MY MY MUNNY set the pace inside of a pressing eventual winner, got headed by that foe at the quarter
pole, and gave way in upper stretch. ELEGANT JOY broke slowly, laid at the rear two wide, tracked from between horses around the turn, but weakened
nearing the lane, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
THIRSTY BETRAYAL tracked four wide, ranged up outside of the leading group around the bend while well in hand to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied
with ONE FOR RITCHIE at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, sustained his chase through midstretch, kept on to
produce a re-bid a sixteenth out, and prevailed late. ONE FOR RICHIE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, met THIRSTY BETRAYAL's bid
turning for home, shook clear of that rival when let out passing the three sixteenths pole, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong, but tired late, met
his counterpart's re-bid entering the final sixteenth, and gave in late. CYRIL'S BOY brushed the outer part of the starting gate at the start, tracked from the
two path, split rivals and emerged from tight quarters entering the lane to claim show, then chased the top pair home. CAN IMAGINE prompted the pace
three wide, then from between horses around the turn, but yielded passing the quarter pole. DAVID'S GEM vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes early on,
but yielded while inside of a trio of foes at the five sixteenths pole, then checked out of tight quarter along the rail entering the lae. FIRERY TALE was
outrun.

Footnotes
ROJA LIGERA shifted outside of the leader nearing the turn to stalk from the three path, bid in hand at the three furlong pole, vied before drawing clear
leaving the quarter pole, and held sway from an inner chaser through the lane. COLLECTED GLORY stalked along the inside while a path off of the rail
around the turn, moved forward two wide turning for home to claim place in pursuit inside of the clear leader, then chased that foe home well while pulling
clear of show. JUST SAY SO tracked from midpack along the inside, split foes two wide in upper stretch to claim show, and held that position through the
final furlong. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, swung to the five path entering the lane, failed to gain while
delaying his lead change to the furlong grounds, then finished up decently with a moderate kick for a minor share. CHANEL POINT tracked two wide and
between horses early on, checked when ROJA LIGERA shifted across her path nearing the turn, chased from the four path turning for home, but weakened
through the lane. FABULOSITY laid off of the pace four wide, faded leaving the three furlong pole, tucked two wide turning for home, and passed tired foes.
CATCHA LATER MO set the pace, but yielded turning for home, and weakened. LADY EVELYN CAN tracked three wide, but faded turning for home.
JEFF'S JOY was slow to get going, and got outrun.

Footnotes
ANARCHIST stalked three wide and between horses, emerged from the group to press outside of the leader from the four path into the turn, bid for the lead
at the five sixteenths pole, battled with his inner game counterpart through the lane, and prevailed late. SKELLY shifted out at the start, set the pace in the
three path, met ANARCHIST's bid turning for home, persisted doggedly through midstretch, but was bested in the closing stages. BOURBON HEIST
squarely bumped with an inner foe at the start causing him to trail the field, sat reserved far back in the two path around the turn, gained before swinging six
wide entering the lane, and finished up well with a strong kick through the final furlong to reach show. TRIPLE OPTION solidly bumped an outer foe at the
start, tucked entering the turn while off of the pace, saved ground turning for home, and produced a rail rally through the lane, but was outkicked for show
late. SLIM MAN stalked along the inside, chased the leading pair from the three path in upper stretch, but tired. GUNOE laid off of the pace in the three
path, inched closer in the five path turning for home, but leveled off in upper stretch without threatening. REDEMPTION TIME tracked from midpack along
the inside, moved to the four path and between horses turning for home, but lacked a rally. GOLDEN LUNA broke outwardly to open space, raced forwardly
five to four wide into the turn, chased around the bend, then weakened between horses nearing the lane. STAR ENTERTAINER was never involved. ORO
DE MORO MORO was mildly forced outwardly at the start, raced forwardly four wide and between horses as a part of the top flight, but backed out when
put to tight quarters at the half mile pole, and was done early. RAMPATIOUS stalked two wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
MUSTANG LADY veered inwardly at the start causing him to lag behind the field, improved in the two path turning for home, swung to the six path while
picking up stride entering the lane, produced a strong and flashy rally outside of rivals, took aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, and reeled that rival
in at the wire. SPARKLING ROSE dueled for the lead two wide, drew clear in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead and got worn down by an outer
oncharging foe at the wire. FLOWERDEW stalked two wide, chased the top pair entering the lane, dug in for show approaching midstretch, but was
outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong grounds, kept on thereafter, and reclaimed that position from a tiring rival late. SAVE YOUR TEARS broke slowly,
raced off of the pace in the five path, exchanged severe bumps with an inner PERFECT ROSE entering the turn causing her to lose action, then tracked
from the five path around the bend, but lacked a bid. SECRETS GALORE tracked four wide, then three wide and from between horses while in the four path
around the turn, shifted inwardly entering the lane, but lacked a needed punch to menace. THREE SPORT COATS dueled for the lead along the inside, but
gave way in upper stretch. PERFECT ROSE shifted out to settle off of the pace in the four path down the backstretch, but exchanged multiple harsh whacks
with an outer SAVE YOUR TEARS entering the turn, almost lost her rider while rank in the aftermath, and was done early. MORIARTY tracked in midpack in
the three path, but tired. BOGEY FREE chased along the inside, but weakened.

Footnotes
OFF WE GO stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of WINGS OF AN ANGEL into the turn, dueled with that foe around the turn, continued to battle well
into the final furlong, shook clear in the final sixteenth when his inner counterpart faltered, and held from a pair of outer chasing rivals to the wire. CANCEL
THIS laid off of the pace in the four path, rallied outside of the leading trio in the final furlong, and claimed place at the wire while running out of ground to
reel in the leader. SHELL SHOCK stalked the dueling pair from the two path around the turn, tipped outside of them turning for home, but lacked a kick to
produce a bid, chased between horses in the late stages, and got outfinished at the wire for place. WINGS OF AN ANGEL set the pace early on, met OFF
WE GO's challenge into the turn, sparred with that foe around the turn, sustained the duel through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, but faltered in
the closing stages. FABRICATE saved ground off of the pace, but failed to menace through the lane. STELLAR GRACE tracked in the three path around
the turn, but gave way. AVENIDA MANANA was outrun.
