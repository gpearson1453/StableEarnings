taking the lead and then was ridden out. DANCERS FOR TOKEN Ducked in at the start forcing DR BLARNEY into RUN FOR BOSTON, contested the lead
three across to the lane, kicked loose some in the lane, was collared and finished clearly best of the rest. AMERICA'S JUSTICE Vied for the lead along the
rail to the lane and weakened inside. RUN FOR BOSTON Jostled at the start, unhurried, saved ground on the turns and weakened. DR BLARNEY Forced
in bumping with RUN FOR BOSTON at the start by DANCERS FOR TOKEN, contested the lead from between to the lane and tired. MISS JIMMY Slow to
load, lunged at the start, unhurried along the two path to the lane, dropped back and then was eased over the wire.

rallied. SHESASCOLDASICE Unhurried along the two path, took the rail on the last turn, angled out and rallied. SILENT INVASION Broke a step slow, set
