FEARLESS WILL was off a step slow and raced off the early pace, angled inside and edged closer late on the turn, cut the corner and roused forward along
the rail in upper stretch, took over the lead just past the furlong marker and edged away. COLD SNACK THIRTY dueled with rivals for the early lead and
battled on with PARLAY PETE around the turn, held a slight edge a furlong out then got overtaken by the winner. PARLAY PETE vied for the lead soon
after the start and continued to match strides with COLD SNACK THIRTY around the turn, raced three wide in aim for the lead a furlong out and ran on for a
share. THREE TIME CHARMER was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased up close three wide around the turn then flattened in the lane. CANDY'S
LITTLE TIP raced in the back, saved ground and lacked a rally. FLY FIRST CLASS vied for the lead in opening stages, chased two wide around the turn
then gave way.

SIR ELI dueled outside of SWEET WHEAT for the lead around the turn, shook free at the head of the lane, widened advantage and held late under a driving
finish. SPALDING STROLL got brushed back at the start and settled off the early pace, urged inside then angled out midway around the turn, swung four
wide into the lane, gathered momentum under firm handling and produced a solid finish. HOOKED ON DREAMS raced in early contention, chased three
wide around the turn and ran on for a share. MY BOAZ raced in range and coaxed inside around the turn, angled off the inside in upper stretch and gave
way. MINISTRY OF ART raced off the top two flights into the turn, chased three to four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SWEET WHEAT dueled
with the eventual winner soon after the start, battled for command into upper stretch then came up empty.

away. MR. ANKENY tracked the pace along the rail, moved up to challenge for the lead then raced in tight quarters, got shuffled back entering the turn and
lost position, waited patiently then launched a bid along the rail at the head of the lane and finished second best. SACRED KIKI BIRD broke alertly and set
the pace, took on the challenge of JAZZY JUSTIN at the quarter pole, vied at the head of the lane then flattened to show. KING OF ANYTHING raced two to
three wide in contention around the turn and failed to kick on in the lane. SEAZAN lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn then
