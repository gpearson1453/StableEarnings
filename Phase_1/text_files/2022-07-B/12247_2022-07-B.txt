edged ahead then drew off in the late going. BRET'S AT CADDIES allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch,
made a steady gain and edged up for the place late. GOLDEN EMPEROR chased the pace outside, held position on the two path through the turn, came
through on that path into the stretch and had a mild gain. ANOTHER SOFTBALL never far back, looped three wide through the turn, came widest into the
stretch and passed tiring rivals. LADY MARVEL rushed up to set the pace inside, then faded the final furlong. DONALD rated outside the leader, drifted out

Footnotes
TROLL CROSSING sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then dueled late and lasted under steady
pressure. THISAINTJUMPSTREET never far back, moved up outside into the second turn, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into
the lane, dueled with the winner late and hung. ROLLING MO tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out and lacked
the needed late kick. ANIMAUXSELLE mid pack and inside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch and
flattened out. LACEE ran evenly. AT LEAST stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside
the leader into the stretch and faded. HOXIE unhurried early, chased three and four wide and could not gain. MIDNIGHT LEAP was never involved.

Footnotes
SHIRLEY'S SHERMAN tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled out to come three wide into the stretch, then made a steady
gain and drew off late. DUN RIGHT stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch
gaining a short lead, shook clear inside the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner late and held the place. NATHANIEL'S HOPE well placed,
held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, evened out and gained the show. TEMPLE OWL LIAM broke out at the start,
pushing a rival out and was forced to steady, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and flattened out. CALL ME PEAK set the
pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. GAISGEACH bumped and pushed out at the start, improved
position. CHIPPER RON was no factor. HERO DRAGON steadily lost ground.
