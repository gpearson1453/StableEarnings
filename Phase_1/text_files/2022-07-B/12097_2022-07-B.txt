Footnotes
BOBBI'S LEGACY was reined back after the break to trail on the fence, advanced through the backstretch to get a good inside tracking position into the far
turn, angled outside to the three path for a clear run down the lane, split runners near the sixteenth pole to lead and was inching away late. IL MALOCCHIO
took the lead from the start while being hounded by an outside rival through the first three quarters, surrendered the lead briefly at the quarter pole, regained
the lead into the stretch, bumped an outside rival nearing the eighth pole and fought on well inside to hold second. KITTEN'S ROMANCE was three or four
wide throughout, made an early move into the far turn to contend, ridden hard through the lane but could not gain on the leaders and ran even the last part
to settle for third. MUSICAL RIDE pressed the leader outside for the first half, headed the pacesetter through the far turn and briefly took command at the
quarter pole, was bumped by the inside rival nearing the eighth pole while battling for the lead and faded the last sixteenth. SILVER DAHLIA was in the
second flight tracking into the first turn, between runners through the backstretch stalking, gave way into the final turn and offered little down the lane.

Footnotes
CHISELER moved forward soon after the start to take command and dictate the pace, was clear leaving the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and held safe
while being kept to the task. TWIN CITY stalked from between runners three to four wide through the turn, fought gamely for the place. ARMSTRONG
shifted in early settling last but one, saved ground early on the turn, tipped out late on that bend coming five wide into the stretch, gained mildly under strong
urging but missed second. IMPERIAL STAR tracked inside, was held up in behind about the five-sixteenths, outkicked for the major placings. SILENT
RESERVE stalked outside four to five wide through the turn and within striking distance into upper stretch, weakened late. GRAN SPIRITED chased two to
three wide, weakened. SOUPER SUNSHINE broke several lengths slowly, saved ground but was unable to threaten. MR. RUDY dropped back early racing
off the inside, failed to rally.

Footnotes
POULIN IN O T tracked just outside the pacesetters down the backstretch, glided to the lead at the three eighths pole to quickly open up leaving the turn
and was unchallenged through the stretch. BATTLE STRIKE stalked between rivals early, advanced outside of runners through the turn and could not offer
a charge for the win down the lane but ran on well in the late stages to be a clear second. VELOCITOR chased inside down the backstretch, started to rally
mid turn between runners, and ran on through the lane to hold on at the wire for third. KAUKOKAIPUU broke outwards at the start, stalked near the back
early, showed some late energy between runners in the four path down the stretch to just miss the show award. MIKEY BANANAS trailed outside after the
break, roused while three wide on the turn and passed a tiring foe through the lane. UNCLE JOCK broke alertly to lead, was collared at the three eights pole
and retreated through the field on the turn.

WAR STRATEGY pressed the early pace from inside, eased back to track, switched out four wide coming into upper stretch, struck the lead about a furlong
out, moved clear and held off a rival under steady handling. HILARIOUS AFFAIR was off slowly and shut off at the start, raced near the inside, came out
about the three-sixteenths, gained steadily but was too late. COLONEL MUSTARD raced off the pace outside going four to five wide on the turn, came out
seven wide in upper stretch, ran on to gain show honors. MT LOGAN false broke and came inward, tracked the leaders in behind, steadied slightly about
the five-eighths, asked for more three furlongs out, moved out six to seven wide turning for home, improved position late. CEREBRO set the pace racing off
the rail, steadily weakened through the final furlong. UPTOWN LIGHTS stalked from between rivals up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn,
was bumped fairly hard about the quarter pole, ran on. TIZ DESTINY chased from outside going four to five wide on the turn, bumped a rival near the
quarter pole, steadied slightly when in tight past the three-sixteenths and ran on. RED MERCURY raced off the pace inside, pulled up in the stretch and was
vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED MT LOGAN RECEIVED AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AT THE
BREAK AND WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
STEAK AND CHEESE settled early in mid pack, angled out for the drive while five wide, was gaining steadily on the leaders throughout the stretch and got
up just at the wire. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) tracked the pacesetters inside on the rail, waited on the turn for a clear run, angled out to the three path to get the
lead at the eighth pole but could not hold off the late outside challenge at the finish. GRANDSON was near the rear in the early stages, commenced a
closing rally angling out widest in the six path turning for home and was narrowing the gap with every stride. FUNICULI trailed through the backstretch on
the rail and rallied in deep stretch splitting runners inside to get a minor placing. MASTER SPY chased the pace into the turn, pressed for the lead at the
half, was ridden on the far turn, collared at the eighth pole and weakened in late stretch. BANFF cleared from the outside to lead on the rail through the first
turn, was pressed down the backside, ridden on the far turn, was headed at the eighth pole and faded late. UPSTART GENTLEMAN stalked mid pack
throughout and had little to offer through the stretch.

Footnotes
SOUPER DORMY stalked the loose leader unencumbered, went three wide into the stretch beginning to advance, struck the lead past the three-sixteenths,
kicked clear. FORESTER'S FORTUNE settled off the leaders along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn angling seven wide into the stretch, rallied to gain
the place. LUCKY CURLIN was encouraged along after the break, chased inside the second group, came out a bit in mid-stretch under encouragement, ran
on mildly late. SIR SEAMUS sped clear to set the pace racing just off the rail, was well clear on the turn, began to shorten stride in the stretch and continued
to weaken. WARP RIDE pursued from outside foes three to four wide, exchanged a bump entering the turn, lugged in a bit about the furlong marker, evened
out late. SOUPER WATSON raced in behind foes three wide on the turn and went evenly. ENTRY TO HEAVEN settled at the rear racing off the rail, swung
seven wide into the stretch and passed tired foes. ESKIMINZIN raced outside foes in the third group going four then five wide on the turn, failed to rally.
SAIL AT SUNRISE chased from between foes in the second flight, went two to three wide on the turn, was in a bit tight near the eighth pole while weakening
and came up empty. TYCOON was in a bit tight at the break, lacked early speed racing off the inside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MONEY PRINTER got a good tracking position early into the first turn, sat just off the pace through the backstretch, pounced on the leader at the quarter
pole and opened up when asked at the eighth pole to win comfortably going away. MALIBU EDGE showed good speed early to clear into the first turn, was
collared at the quarter pole by the winner but ran on willingly the final eighth to hold onto second money. GLIDER was bumped at the start, tracked mid pack
with a half mile to go, advanced on the far turn following the winner and closed well to be a clear third. HOLYFIELD broke in at the start, was wide
throughout, advanced outside through the final turn and showed some interest late to get a minor award. OCTOBER FROST was near the back between
runners through the half, roused on the far turn and passed tiring runners late. HIDDEN HONOR was roused at the three eighths pole and had no impact.
TOUR OF DUTY chased the pace early on, was ridden on the far turn to keep up and retreated inside down the lane. LESLIE CHOW was brushed at the
break, trailed in the backstretch, offered a brief run five wide on the far turn and was empty for the drive. BET N WIN saved ground but could not get into
contention. MASTER MCGRATH was mid pack in the beginning and never became a factor. ICE ROAD was wide throughout, asked on the far turn and had
no response. RACING IN THE RAIN weakened inside on the far turn and backed away through the stretch.

Footnotes
THERE'S NO JOE set the pace, saved ground inside on the turn, extended the margin under moderate hand urging in upper stretch, went to a moderate
use of right-handed crop past the furlong marker and was well clear. DOWNY BOY eased back inside content to settle mid-pack, saved ground on the turn,
kept on in the stretch along the rail to just get the nod for place while no match for the winner. GHOUL (BRZ) settled toward the rear, took closer order three
to four wide on the turn, had room to room in the stretch and kept on but missed the place. DIAMOND CITY switched out to chase the eventual winner three
wide, evened out in the drive. EXECUTIVE SEARCH raced up close off the leader stalking three wide, asked for more turning for home, lacked the needed
late kick. DRAGON'S BREW settled toward the rear, swung six wide into the stretch, failed to menace. VICTORIOUS WAVE failed to threaten while racing
just off the inside. NEVAEH'S DREAM was mid-pack going three to five wide on the turn, came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
PERFECT CRIME broke out at the start, tracked behind the leaders into the far turn, moved to get the lead on the rail at the three sixteenth pole,
surrendered that lead late inside the eighth pole and fought back stubbornly very late to win the nod at the wire. LONG POND waited on the turn behind
runners to find room, shot through on the fence entering the stretch to take command in the final furlong only lose the lead just before the finish line.
POSEIDON STEEL made an early move down the backstretch to contend entering the turn, was between runners battling for the lead at the quarter pole
and showed good determination running on end in the stretch to get third money. GALVASTON challenged for the lead while four wide entering the stretch
and levelled out the final sixteenth to get a minor placing. COMMANDER JOE made a five wide bid on the turn, angled out to the seven path turning for
home and ran even in the late stages. HEAT MERCHANT broke out, was roused on turn behind runners and could not get into contention. UNCLE JOE
took command leaving the chute, was collared by runners at the quarter pole and stopped in the lane. ROMANTIC GAMBLE trailed early and never got
involved. LESSON LEARNED (IRE) was brushed at the start, briefly led in the chute, chased the pace down the backstretch, lost position into the far turn
and weakened inside.

Footnotes
VIEW FROM EGBERT got away alertly, set the pace inside facing pressure from an outside foe, moved clear late on the turn, extended the advantage
some in upper stretch, held sway under steady handling. MIA AND ME bobbled at the break, steadied slightly heading up the backstretch when in tight,
entered the turn four wide but shifted in early on that bend, advanced inside foes in upper stretch and chased the winner home. THE BAND COMING
bumped a rival lightly at the start, tucked in near the inside and saved ground through the turn, gained steadily inside through the stretch. KODIAK MAMBA
(IRE) broke awkwardly and spotting the field several lengths, settled at the rear inside, came out turning for home then weaved through rivals shifting in then
out throughout the stretch and finished with good energy. MORE THAN HAPPY was bumped by a rival after the start and in a bit tight, saved ground
through most of the turn racing well off the pace, angled out six wide at the top of the stretch bumping a rival in the process, ran on well. BREACH OF
TRUST stalked just off the pacesetter two wide through the turn, weakened in the stretch. BROKE AN BROKEN was up close racing outside four to five
wide, lacked the needed late kick. NGABE was bumped lightly at the break, raced off the pace two to three wide on the turn, angled out in upper to
mid-stretch and improved position. SILENT THUNDER bumped a rival after the start, moved forward to press the eventual winner, came up empty. FOUR
BOUNCE chased the pace from between rivals three to four wide and came up empty. WIN THE DRAW raced outside off the pace four to six wide through
the turn, was bumped at the top of the stretch then forced out a short while later, faded thereafter.
