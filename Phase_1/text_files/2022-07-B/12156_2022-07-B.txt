Footnotes
HUNTER JOHN set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, dug in down the lane and inched clear in the final stages. TRUE JEDI pressed the pace
early two wide, was in the two path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane, drifted out and held place in the final stages. ZARTOWNIS tracked the
pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid three wide down the lane and missed place in the final stages. TRULY MISCHIEF raced back
early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. DERIVATIVE was bumped and bothered at the start,
raced in the six path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. VERITABLE raced in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch
drive. BOOYAH chased the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. VASSAR'S BOY was bumped and bothered at the
start, done early. GO VIRTUAL was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. THE CLOWN veered out at the start and was never a threat.
