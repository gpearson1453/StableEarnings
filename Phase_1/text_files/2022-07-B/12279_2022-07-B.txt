Footnotes
REGAL MAX saved ground while showing the way, responded to threat from EDDYSHAK at the head of the stretch, and held under a drive. EDDYSHAK
tracked inside, loomed boldly at the head of the lane, shifted out keeping pressure on the leader and just missed. SMART PLAY stalked three to four wide,
and lacked a kick. THESHACK settled outside, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and missed out. VIATURE unhurried early, and bid belatedly.
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE raced five wide into the opening turn, saved ground along the rail through the backstretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
DEPARTURE sat just off the pace under a snug hold, dropped back leaving the backstretch, found running room inside then swept the lead, and drew off to
finish in record time. UNCHARACTERISTIC sat off the pace inside, shifted out into the stretch to the five path, improved position late but was no match for
the winner and just held on for place. PARKING PERMIT raced at the back of the pack, angled out closing determinedly and just missed for place honors.
STONE CARVER led the field through the backstretch just off the rail, was overtaken into the stretch and gave way inside. EXPLODE stalked the pace four
wide, moved up in the far turn to challenge the lead but could not get by STONE CARVER and faded. SEBASTIAN'S BOY settled outside, and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
BIG AL'S VISION quickly went to the front to secure a position just off the rail, turned back challenge from AWESOME SATURDAY approaching the stretch,
was kept under heavy urging between rivals, dug in in the final stride refusing to relinquish control and narrowly prevailed under a long hard drive. BAR NO
Q tracked inside, asked to quicken leaving the final turn, rallied through stretch and lost the nod. AWESOME SATURDAY sat mid pack in the four path, went
in pursuit of the leader nearing the final turn, moved up menacingly outside of BIG AL'S VISION, was all out late and could not muster the last push that was
needed. BOOKIE fanned three wide leaving the opening turn, settled in the five path traveling through the backstretch, rallied through the stretch outside of
WHERE'S THE GOLD and got by. WHERE'S THE GOLD unhurried early, rallied belatedly and was bested late. BUCKYS PICK sat three wide just off the
pace, was unable to keep pace with the field dropping back in the final turn, and faded. LONESOME CAT offered little. SHIMSHINE always outrun.

READYTOTAPNSING vied inside for the early lead, dueled inside of CUBAN COBRA into the final turn, and kicked clear late. CUBAN COBRA vied
between rivals for the early lead, dueled outside of READYTOTAPNSING into the lane, and lacked the rally needed into the stretch. IT'S A FACT trailed
early, advanced quickly outside nearing the quarter pole, closed outside and got up in time for show. LAHUN pressed the pace while four wide, was unable
to move on with rivals into the lane and was rundown late stretch. MUDINATOR away well, angled in leaving the backstretch, and bid evenly through
stretch. SMART CAT some early speed, and lacked a bid. LIL ZAPPER raced wide early and tired. ALWAYS LOOK UP was pulled up, did not finish and
was vanned off.

held under a late drive. TONE IT UP raced three wide into the opening turn, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, was roused at the head of the lane,
closed steadily and just missed. ADDYDIDIT stalked in the four path, asked to quicken at the five sixteenth marker, loomed boldly at the head of the lane
and was out finished. LA PALINA trailed the field early, and bid belatedly. LILBITSPICY stalked the early pace from the three path, and lacked a closing
response. KEKE KIMONO rank leaving the opening turn, was under a strong hold in the backstretch, steadied approaching the quarter pole and flattened.

SLAATS sat just off the pace between rivals leaving the opening turn, pressed the issue near the three eighths marker, gained a slim lead approaching the
stretch and won driving. ITSMYDAY raced in second flight along the rail, came under urging then angled off the rail and lacked the kicked needed.
FLASHFORDANI allowed to settle early, chased wide leaving the backstretch, rallied outside of GLAVA into the stretch and inched up to score third. GLAVA
quickest to the turn, pressed from the five path, flattened in the drive and was edged out late. ABOVE AND BEYOND lagged early and showed interest late.
ASYOUBELIEVE set a pressured pace inside, and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
FAST EH was quickest to the turn, turned back challenge from STRONG AND FREE near the quarter pole, and drew away. REMARKABLE ELI bumped
leaving, angled outside leaving the backstretch, sat in range nearing the quarter pole, rallied outside of FIRST BASE and got up in time for show. FIRST
BASE was outsprinted to the turn, rallied belatedly and was out finished for show. PULL THE PIN circled wide into the lane, and lodged a late bid outside.
STRONG AND FREE showed good outside speed, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole, and gave way into stretch. SAKURABA bumped leaving,
chased three wide into the lane, and failed to threaten. MARANGO went five wide into the opening turn, and faded through the stretch. CAPITAL CALL
failed to menace. IMPERIAL DASH never involved.
