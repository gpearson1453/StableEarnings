Footnotes
QUEEN OF LOVE was sent to the early lead, was well handled while setting modest fractions through the backstretch run, quickened along the second turn
and drew clear in the drive. HARBOR ABBEY attended to the moderate pace through the second turn, was outkicked in the drive while on the left lead but
stayed on to be second best. CYCLONE SLEW hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, came in tight along the first turn, ran evenly to the second turn
while off of the pace, was steered outside of rivals into the stretch run and was unable to impact the top pair but won the nod for third in the end. PARTY
SPIRIT (GB) stalked the pace from a ground saving position, lost ground on the second turn, did not produce a late rally and was just edged for third in the
end.

Footnotes
TRIP TO SPAIN was allowed to settle off of the early pace, was taken outside of rivals into the turn and was roused to go four wide into the drive, advanced
in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker and made a determined late push to prevail. HEAVEN SHINES prompted the moderate early
pace, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, was engaged by NORTHVALE ROAD and battled with that rival to mid-stretch, shook free in deep stretch
but was overtaken by the winner in the final stages, while holding safely for second. NORTHVALE ROAD rated off of the early pace, advanced along the
inside on the turn, battled for the lead in upper stretch, could not match strides with the top two in the final furlong and was outfinished, while well clear for
third. STANFORD BAY broke alertly and showed early speed while setting moderate fractions, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in
upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

A DIME FOR ME stalked the moderate early fractions, gained ground on LOUD FUSAICHI along the turn while three wide, shifted out at the top of the lane,
found her best stride in the final furlong and finished well in the late stages to prevail. LOUD FUSAICHI broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set
moderate fractions through the turn, was set down for the drive and was caught inside of the sixteenth-marker, while holding safely for second.
PERSUASIVE LIPS took back off of the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch but could not muster the needed
late response in the final stages, while clear of the rest for third. PHANTOM INDIAN chased the pace to the turn, gained ground while outside of rivals
approaching the quarter pole, could not sustain that bid in upper stretch and did not produce a late rally. SEGURO was away a bit slowly, chased the pace
from the inside, lost ground in upper stretch and was not a factor.

confronted the winner in the final stages but was denied for the win, while well clear of the rest for second. COUSIN NIECEY stumbled at the start and was
off a step slowly, chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive, while holding safely for third.
DEAREST BARBARA showed early speed and pressed the moderate pace, lost ground on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.
JEANIE'S SWAN was away from the gate slowly and lacked early speed, trailed through the turn and was unable to offer a late rally.

Footnotes
GALLIVANTER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, was confronted approaching the top of the stretch by
PIPER'S CAUSEWAY, dueled gamely with that rival through the final furlong and dug in in the last strides to prevail. PIPER'S CAUSEWAY showed early
speed and tracked the pace to the turn, advanced nearing the quarter pole to confront GALLIVANTER, dueled gamely with that rival through the lane and
was denied for the win, while holding safely for second. EL CAPRICHO was squeezed at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the top pair to the turn,
came outside of rivals while gaining ground nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch but re-rallied in the late stages to be clear for third.
GOOD DANNY chased the pace to the turn, lost ground along the bend and into upper stretch but showed good late interest while unable to impact the top
three. HOT JOURNEY was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late rally. TEN
THOUSAND STEPS was off slowly and lacked early speed, lagged through the turn and was not a threat in the stretch.

DAMN THE TORPEDOES tracked the solid pace to the turn, advanced four wide nearing the quarter pole, vied for the lead in upper stretch and responded
in the late stages to prevail. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN broke alertly then took back off of the early pace, gained ground to confront the pacesetter nearing the
quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch but re-rallied in the final stages to secure the runner-up spot. LA AGUILILLA settled off of the quick early fractions,
gained ground outside of rivals on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch but was outfinished in the final furlong, while just being edged for second
and getting up in time for third. EMMA'S DANCE was asked to show speed and took command of the early pace, set solid fractions through the turn, was
confronted by the winner nearing the quarter marker, met that bid to mid-stretch but relented in the final furlong. OPTIMAS chased the early pace, gained
ground from the inside on the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and flattened out in the final stages. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn and did not offer a late rally.

UNION DANCE kept close attendance to the moderate early fractions, came two wide to the quarter marker while in pursuit of the pacesetter, gained
ground inside of the furlong marker, determinedly overtook ALVAARO in deep stretch and was up in time to prevail. ALVAARO was sent to the early lead,
set moderate fractions while prompted by UNION DANCE, held that rival at bay into upper stretch, met the bid of the winner in deep stretch but was bested
in the final strides, while holding safely for second. POUR ON THE COLE broke out at the start, settled just off of the early pace while four wide, maintained
position through the backstretch run, ran evenly while two wide to the quarter pole, was able to gain a bit of ground on the top two in the final furlong but was
outfinished in the end, while holding for third. ROCKTILLYOUDROP stalked the moderate early fractions, maintained position through the half-mile pole, lost
ground nearing the top of the stretch, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was able to offer a late rally but was outkicked in the final stages. ENGRAM was allowed
to settle in the opening stages, came three wide into the backstretch run, improved position while three wide on the second turn but could not make a late
impact in the stretch run. STALKING SHADOW was a bit slow into stride early on and was unhurried in the early stages while not far back, saved ground
through the backstretch run, was asked for a response while three wide on the far turn and could not muster a late bid.

Footnotes
RIVERSKY was asked to show speed and tracked the quick early pace, came three wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, overtook the
pacesetter in the final furlong and drew clear in the late stages. MEDAL ICE was a bit slow into early stride, improved position approaching the turn,
mounted a three wide rally into the drive, gained ground in upper stretch, was unable to reel in the winner in the final stages but stayed on to be best of the
rest. OLYMPIC SILVER chased the early pace then took back when in tight approaching the turn, improved position while along the rail on the bend,
continued that bid in upper stretch but was outkicked in the final furlong and held safely for third in the end. SHE THINKS IM CUTE broke out at the start
and squeezed OMAHA RUTSCH, recovered to take the early lead and set the pace to the turn, carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, was
confronted by the winner in upper stretch and could not hold off that rival's bid and weakened in the final stages. OMAHA RUTSCH was squeezed at the
start, chased the pace to the turn, lost ground while two wide nearing the quarter pole, was able to improve position in upper stretch but gave way in the final
furlong. BUEN CHICO lacked early speed, came in tight and was hard to place nearing the turn, was outrun approaching the top of the stretch and was not
a threat. INTO BOURBON was crowded at the start and off a step slowly, tracked the pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter pole and faltered in
the drive.
