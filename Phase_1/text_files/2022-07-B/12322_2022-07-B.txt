GOLDEN MERGER lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a sixteenth to run and was up in the closing yards to be going away late.
LEAD MONTEREY broke sharply to press the pace of MAGNUS WHO while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths
marker, gained a brief lead but could not hold the winner safe late. SMOOTH BLUES was reserved just off he leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. MAGNUS WHO set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong.
CHIPPSTER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. JASMINE WHO was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SUMMER dueled for the lead with SIDNEY'S HOPE while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into deep stretch and edged away late.
SIDNEY'S HOPE disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide through a prolonged drive and gave way grudgingly late. SAMURAI JACK was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. BOOMER WHO showed no early speed, saved ground through the
turn and did not threaten. OVER EZ showed brief speed and weakened.
