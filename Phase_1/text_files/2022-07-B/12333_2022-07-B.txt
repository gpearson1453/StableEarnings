Footnotes
TIZ A MACHO GIRL chased inside, moved up two near the quarter pole, shifted five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up under
strong handling. NANA'S ANGELS was quick to begin, crossed over to the rail to set the early pace, led at the eighth pole and was wore down late. GOLD
COAST GIRL was void of speed, moved up along the inside through the far turn, just after passing the quarter pole checked, altered out, raced four wide
through the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. TOE DANCER pressed the pace from the outside while racing two wide and weakened
through the stretch run. SLICE OF PIE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the inside, angled out through the stretch run and weakened.
BOWEN broke in, bumped with rival, settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. LEONE dropped back early, raced five wide
near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid.
