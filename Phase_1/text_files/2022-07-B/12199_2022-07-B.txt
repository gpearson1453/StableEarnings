Footnotes
REALLY GOOD bumped lightly with a foe just after the start, settled comfortably on the inside, was asked on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
rallied on the outside to get the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging. COACH PETRO angled in quickly in the early going,
went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed in third while well behind the leading duo, moved closer in the two then three path around the far
turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was headed by the winner, fought into the final sixteenth then was
outfinished while clear for the place. PLEASE BABY bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand off heels into the first turn, settled in the two to three
path, swerved inward in upper stretch and bumped with his stablemate, moved out into the final furlong then split foes, bumped with another foe in the
process and finished with late energy to garner the show. RECKONING FORCE came out at the start then was corrected by the rider, went four then three
wide around the first turn, settled outside down the backstretch, was roused three then four wide on the far turn then driven six wide into the stretch, reached
a reasonable striking position but lacked the needed kick. ACTIVIST INVESTING (GB) unseated the rider during the warm-up, had the rider look down at his
right iron a few times just before and as the gate opened then came in and bumped a foe, bumped repeatedly with WIDERIGHT nearing the first turn then
was forced out nine wide by that foe, gave up tons of position, made his way to the three path by late on that bend, settled near the back, was asked three
then four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, bumped with a foe outside inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response.
TWO MINUTES APART bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, contested the pace on the inside of a foe while well clear of the rest of the field,
was asked on the final turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way. WIDERIGHT bumped with a rival at the start, became rank on the initial
straightaway, bumped repeatedly with ACTIVIST INVESTING approaching the first turn then bore out eight wide and checked, checked again between foes
while dropping in later on the bend, made his way to the rail before the backstretch, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, went two then three wide
on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MO'S TREASURE showed early speed, remained out in the five path around the first
turn, contested the pace on the outside while detached from the rest of the field, was asked in the two path around the final turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired. I LIKE BOSTON settled in the two to three path, was roused on the far turn, steadied when forced in by his stablemate in upper stretch and
had nothing left. COUTH bumped lightly with an opponent just after the start, was taken up off heels as a foe crossed in front early, settled nicely on the
inside, saved ground under urging on the far turn, was put to the crop at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BRAZILLIONAIRE away well and to the front, settled four then three wide in pursuit from just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out, dug in dueling through to the finish with ME 'N SAP and gamely prevailed on the
wire. ME 'N SAP dueled from the two path with STANHOPE to his outside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and absorbed a glancing
bump by STANHOPE near the five-sixteenths as that rival got on near even terms, took the inside route into upper stretch, floated very slightly off the rail
clinging to command coming under threat from a trio as FORE HARP came up a tight inside seam, dueled with the aforementioned foe through the final
furlong in game fashion but was ultimately nailed and denied at the end. FORE HARP brushed the left side stall at the start when breaking in a step, tracked
the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, had ME 'N SAP float off the inside in front
very slightly and rallied into a tight seam along the rail scraping the paint inside of that rival a furlong from home, dug in battling on to the finish to latch on
the top pair but was ultimately staved off in a good effort. STEELERSFANFORLIFE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued three wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish but was out-kicked. STANHOPE dueled from the three path with ME 'N SAP to his
inside, came in a path forcing LOADED JOE to grow rank when taken in hand and steadied off his heels directly behind him, knocked heads through the
turn bumping his main pace rival in a glancing blow near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home set down for the drive and weakened in the
late stages. LOADED JOE chased just off the inside, grew rank when forced to steady as STANHOPE tucked directly in front placing him off his heels, lost
two lengths of position as a result, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
UNION LAKE was reluctant to load then had her saddle adjusted behind the gate, came away in good order, pressed the pace on the outside then in the
three path around the turn, gained a short lead while asked for her best in upper stretch, fought outside of REPEALING until near the sixteenth-pole then
moved clear under strong handling. JANE GREY settled just off the pace, went two to three wide around the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, came
four wide into the stretch under a drive, chased outside while looming a threat into the final furlong but was out-kicked while just up for the place.
REPEALING went to the front, showed the way in the two path through the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch,
fought with that foe until near the sixteenth-pole and weakened then lost the place while clear for the show. ROOKERY bumped with a rival at the start then
dropped back, was urged along at the rear, moved closer while four then five wide around the turn, chased outside into upper stretch and tired. BANK ON
ANNA brushed the inside of the gate at the start, settled on the inside, checked when having his path taken outside the nine-sixteenths, was roused two
then three wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. AWESOME INDRA settled off the early pace, came in front of
BANK ON ANNA and took the rail nearing the nine-sixteenths, moved up soon after then was taken in hand while off the heels of the leader, remained off
heels until near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn and came up empty. BREAKFASTATBONNIES bobbled at the start then bumped with
an opponent, moved out under urging early then was rated on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch
and faltered.

Footnotes
JANE MAST broke in at the start bumping and pinching WINGS LIKE EAGLES in tandem with BEYOND PERFECTION, who broke outwards, led early on
before conceding the front to GET RESPECT coming under a light rating hold and growing keen in the two path pulling on the bit into and through the first
turn before settling to track that rival behind her loose cover along the inside six furlongs from home, tipped into the two path and into the clear near the
seven-sixteenths and advanced under her own power to intensify the pressure on the leader getting placed to light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, took over command just inside the three-sixteenths and offered up a good kick to edged away then
hold off a late charging rival while under mostly a vigorous hand drive. VERONICA GREENE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and rallied with good energy to threaten for it all inside the final furlong but was ultimately
rebuffed at the end. MOZAY tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick to close in and secure the show honors. HERINGTON ROCKET chased along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish. WINGS LIKE EAGLES got bumped between foes who each
broke her way and was pinched back at the start, raced along the inside through the first turn before chasing four then three wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. GET RESPECT established the front after the start and showed the way
rated along the two path through the first turn before taking to the rail down the backstretch uncontested and settled into a comfortable rhythm, came under
increasing pressure through the far turn and was placed to coaxing in response nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared inside the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. BROADWAY BOOGIE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased
two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no late rally. SIXTH STREET (FR) broke out
at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide through the opening bend before settling five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch
near the rear of the field, tucked three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs out, tipped five wide into upper stretch and had no kick.
BEYOND PERFECTION broke out at the start bumping WINGS LIKE EAGLES in concert with JANE MAST who broke inwards and pinched that rival back,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.

Footnotes
NEST was coaxed to front after the two fillies to her inside stumbled at the break, went around the first turn in the two path while inside of two foes, lost the
advantage to SOCIETY as that foe came through against the rail to take the lead coming to the seven-eighths, prompted between foes for a furlong then
regained the lead inside the three-quarter pole, was let out some near the half-mile pole then jostled in the hindquarters leaving the backstretch, raced in the
two then three path around the far turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole then spun four wide into the stretch, responded well when shaken up for
more around the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage to the furlong marker, was given one pop of a right-handed crop at that point then another pop
outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while widening to the wire. SECRET OATH went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the
outside, was asked in the four then five path around the final turn, lost touch with the winner near the quarter-pole, spun six wide into the stretch, drifted in
while remaining on her inside lead at the furlong marker and weakened but safely held the place. NOSTALGIC came away in good order, raced in the three
path while between foes around the first turn, tracked between foes down the backstretch, jostled with the hindquarters of NEST leaving the backstretch
then was grabbed with the left-rein and dropped back, fell further behind the top two under urging while two to three wide around the far turn, came in under
a right-handed crop at the furlong marker and tired while best of the rest. SOCIETY stumbled in the hindquarters at the start then bumped with a foe, moved
up into the first turn then was rank under restraint until inside the mile-marker, moved through against the rail to take the lead approaching the
seven-eighths, lost the advantage back to the winner inside the three-quarter pole, dropped back inside on the far turn, was taken up while battling with
NOSTALGIC for third purse money at the furlong marker then moved out and capitulated. BUTTERBEAN stumbled badly at the start then bumped with an
opponent, dropped well behind while saving ground and was distanced.

Footnotes
SINFULLY SWEET settled nicely off the pace, raced in hand while behind a foe leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused
outside the quarter-pole, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging.
ROYAL DANCER was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead into the stretch, led under a
drive into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner and proved no match while able to get the place. QUICK POWER NAP was well placed just off
the pace, drafted in the two path around the turn, was asked three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick
while able to get the show. MY CARA MIA MINE broke a step slow, was urged along near the back, rounded the turn in the two path, moved out in upper
stretch and improved position. TREAT STREET broke a half-step slow, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground around the turn, moved off the rail
under a drive in upper stretch and also improved position. WRITERS ROOM broke out slightly, was urged along early then settled between foes passing the
half-mile pole, raced in hand behind horses leaving the backstretch, was roused three wide on the turn, jostled with a foe while forcing her way six wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. ROAD TO REMEMBER settled on the far outside, went five wide around the turn, steadied off heels while
seven wide into the stretch, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. LOLLYGAG settled between horses, went four wide on the turn, was
jostled and forced seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TOUGH STREET set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to two path
around the turn, was headed at the quarter-pole and tired then was vanned off while reported to have bled. MRS. BOOMER tracked the pace on the
outside, was given her cue in the four path on the turn, chased five wide into the stretch and came up empty. QUEEN OF LIES was rated just off the pace
on the inside under a snug hold, drafted behind horses while saving ground around the turn, was asked while just behind the leader into the stretch,
steadied just inside the three-sixteenths, had a sliver of a seam along the rail coming to the furlong marker, saw the seam close then checked sharply inside
that marker, lacked room behind horses to the wire and lost all chance. ADMIRE MY CROWN was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the
rear under urging, went four wide around the turn, steadied while ten wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
STAGE LEFT chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied and had the rider lose the
handle on the crop to the right side nearing the eighth pole, took command just inside that station and drew clear to the finish under a vigorous hand drive.
PEACEFUL WATERS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from PRISONER to the outside, shook off that rival
and spun three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors. FAVORITE OUTLAW
broke in at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid and
weakened in the late stages. PRISONER hustled from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. REJECTED AGAIN four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. RYAN'S CAT hustled from the
start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.
HIGHLY RESPECTED six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn and five wide into upper stretch and tired.
UNDER OATH five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, got out seven wide through the turn, went eight to nine wide for home and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
STAGE RAIDER brushed with a rival at the start, stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, took the lead with five-sixteenths to run, was asked while
clear at the quarter-pole, extended the advantage while put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch, had the rider put the crop away entering the final furlong
and was geared down while much the best. THE REDS saved ground while in hand around the first turn, was rated just off the pace, moved from the two
path to the four path while asked on the far turn, chased under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while well clear for the place.
GENTLEMAN JOE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, came a bit off the rail under pressure on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole, moved out into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. CREED had his saddle
adjusted behind the gate, broke out and brushed with a foe, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was roused outside the half-mile pole,
went three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. RISING EMPIRE was off a couple lengths slow, raced under a tight hold
behind horses in the two path around the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, came under strong urging while saving ground on the far turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
ROBIN SPARKLES hustled from the gate, crossed directly to the two path and showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits settled into a
nice rhythm came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under threat from a trio and lasted on the wire. SOUPER SENSATIONAL four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the
two path through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a nice finish closing well and stoutly
between foes and missed at the end. LADY EDITH three then two wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide at the head of the stretch, offered up a good finish to miss at the end. MISS J MCKAY just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace initially, got
forced to steady near the five furlong marker when foes in front were taken hold of as ROBIN SPARKLES crossed to the two path from the outside and
conceded about two lengths of position, raced just off the inside in behind CARAVEL when that rival was forced to steady out of the rail spot as STAR
DEVINE tightened the inside near the seven-sixteenths, got steadied once more as that rival backed up into her and conceded an additional three lengths of
position, remained undeterred and came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, angled out widest, seven wide into upper stretch, then rallied with good
courage outside a pair, but ran out of ground while up for the last major share. STAR DEVINE (IRE) forwardly placed just off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked inside into the turn forcing CARAVEL to steady out of the rail and in turn forced MISS J MCKAY to steady in behind that rival, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. BOUT TIME chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late going while tepidly handled to the finish. KEPT WAITING
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn advancing under coaxing from the three-eighths, bid four wide at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TOBYS HEART chased three to four wide until tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide for home and offered no response. CARAVEL chased along the inside, had STAR DEVINE tuck inwards and was
forced to steady out of the rail at the seven-sixteenths which in turn forced MISS J MCKAY to steady behind her, lost about four lengths of position in total,
continued along the inside coming under coaxing when tipping out near the quarter pole, went four wide for home and weakened.
