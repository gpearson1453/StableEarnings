Footnotes
SASSY CAT was sent along early to set the early pace from the inside and held gamely in the drive to remain clear under strong handling. LUCKY LAUREN
chased the early leader from the inside, shifted out through the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. VICTORIA'S DANCE was hustled along from
the outside, moved up four wide through the upper lane and made a good late gain. TOP HAT BOSS was coaxed along soon after the start, raced near the
inside in the lane and had not enough. YELLEN was forwardly placed to lay just off the top pair early on and weakened while racing from the outside.
BEAUTY DAY dropped back early on, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. LEJEUNE was void of early speed, raced near the
inside in the stretch run and had no response.

SHARINGTHEJOURNEY was rated along in the early stages, moved up two wide through the far turn, angled five wide through the upper lane and finished
well to get up under strong encouragement. O CIGANO hopped at the break, raced near the inside around the far turn, raced near the rail in the stretch run
and finished willingly to the wire. LOVE TWENTY SIX pressed the early leader down the backstretch, led near the five sixteenths pole, led deep stretch and
gave way grudgingly. DANZEL settled off the early pace, was hard ridden near the three eighths pole, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and
had no rally while racing from the outside. TRATO was quick to begin to set the pace from the outside, was empty near the eighth pole and weakened.

upper stretch and had no late rally. LACY QUEEN settled off the pace, raced three to four and had no response. MINNIE BUT MIGHTY chased the early

Footnotes
ILLBOOTENGOTTY tracked Feeling It down the backstretch while racing just off the inside, gained a narrow lead near the eighth pole, dug in late, proved
best to prevail under strong handling while racing three deep. MASON A. P. settled off the early going, made a good rail bid in the stretch run and finished
willingly to the wire. NOT AGAIN JACKIE stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. FEELING IT showed
good early speed to cross over while setting the early pace, had a clear lead near the three sixteenths pole and weakened the final furlong while racing two
wide. JROCK settled off the early pace along the inside and lacked a rally. TWOBIRDSONESTONE was slow early and trailed throughout.

WHAT A RUSH was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up three wide in the stretch run and finished well to just get up under all out pressure.
BIG TRUCK stalked the early pace, moved up two wide near the quarter pole, shifted out five wide through the upper stretch and finished gamely to the
wire. RELISH THE RIDE stalked the pace from the inside, continued its run from the inside in the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. FIRST SONG
showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mille. MANGA MAN was forced in tight at the break, settled to the
back of the pack early on, moved up through the far turn, raced widest through the lane and closed in too late. OHIO EAGLE settled to the middle of the
pack, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no response. TRUST AND OBEY dropped back off the early pace, raced five to six wide through the
upper lane and lacked a final winning bid. MOBIL SOLUTION settled to the second flight early, raced four to five wide in the stretch run and failed to
respond. PECKS NOT BAD was slow early, raced near the inside and lacked a bid.

SUBDUED stalked the pace, moved up just off the inside and drew off to be well clear late under a vigorous hand ride. BRODYTHEOXMAN dropped to the
back of the pack early on, moved up widest through the stretch run and finished well to get up for the place position near the wire. PAYNTED stalked the
pace from the outside, was carried out wide through the upper lane due to a drifted out rival and kept on late to the wire. LUCKYINKENTUCKY settled off
the early going, raced near the inside at the quarter pole through the stretch run and had not enough. AYCAPOTE was forwardly placed to lay up close early
on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and had no rally. CLASSY COWBOY was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced two to
three deep and weakened in the stretch run. GAMBLER showed good early speed to set the early pace, drifted out through the upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RAISON KARTER was rated down the backstretch, moved up through the far turn, waited for racing room near the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
at the quarter pole through the stretch run and drew clear late under a strong hand ride. IMPROBABLE STORY void of speed early on, made an advance
through the far turn, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to get up for the place position. ROCK ON KITTEN settled off the early
pace, moved up three to two wide through the stretch and flattened out. COME SEE ABOUT IT was quick to begin to set the early pace and weakened the
final three sixteenths. CACAHUETE stalked the pace and tired in the stretch run while racing three wide. COOL RUNNINGS was forwardly placed to lay up
close early on, was hard ridden near the three eighths pole and tired.

Footnotes
WEST WARPATH stalked the pace from the outside, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, drifted a bit late and prevailed under all out pressure.
LITTLE ALEX was hustled along early, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, raced between rivals in the stretch run, came out to race wide deep
stretch under left hand urging and finished gamely to the wire. THING was off slowly, hustled from the outside while racing near the back early, moved up
five to six wide through the upper stretch, raced wide deep stretch as West Warpath and Little Alex well off the inside and finished gamely to the wire. A
jockey objection was filed against the top two finishers for interference in the stretch run and stewards ruled no change. CONTRACTOR BILL was coaxed
along early, experienced traffic near the quarter pole, raced four to three wide and kept on to the wire. HOLY CROSS pressed the early leader, raced in tight
quarters at the three eighths pole, shifted three wide in the upper stretch and had not enough. AUDACIOUS ANTOINE was bumped at the start, waited for
racing room near the quarter pole, swung out four to five wide through the upper lane and had no final winning bid. TOASTTORODNEY vied for the early
lead from the inside and weakened. JUJU NINETEEN chassed the pace from the inside and never threatened. HINK'S PALADIN was bumped at the break,
hustled along early and tired while racing three wide.
