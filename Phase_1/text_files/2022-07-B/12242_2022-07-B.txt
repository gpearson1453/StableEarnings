DETERMINED LOVE set the pace and with a clear lead in mid stretch was much the best. STERLING ICE was away alertly, vied through the stretch and
held place. PERFECT GENTLEMAN was hustled early, a factor in mid stretch and finished evenly. SUMMER RETREAT was in touch and hustled along but
needed more. RED MAPLE was in range and roused but had no response. BIG BAND BENNY had no speed, trailed the field and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CALMING INFLUENCE stalked the early leader, had the lead on the far turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. MORE HARDER was
well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch just missed. STRONG ATTITUDE tracked the early leaders from
the outside and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. READY AT DAWN was in mid pack, had a bid on
the far turn and with the lead from the four path in upper stretch but was outfinished. DOODLE DANDY showed no speed and had a mild gain on the far turn
but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. CONQUER THE BREEZE was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. INTREPID WARRIOR
set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

inside and had the lead on the far turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. MY LAST DREAM was in touch and a factor on the far turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch was all out. DONTCALLMESWEETY forced the early pace but dropped back on the far turn and was empty. ONLY BELIEVE

Footnotes
RADCLIFFE set the pace, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. WONNEFRAC stalked the early leaders, was
a factor on the turn and had the lead in upper stretch but was outgunned. NO EASY ROAD showed no speed, moved up on the turn and raced from the six
path at the top of the stretch but angled to the inside while all out. SANTIAGO SALSA was unhurried early, roused on the turn and from the three path at the
top of the stretch was up for a share. SLIGO CALLING was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. C BY THE SEA
forced the early pace but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch faded. I'M SO FLY was off the pace, raced evenly on the turn
and was not a factor. HYPERACTIVE was in touch early but lost ground on the turn and had no impact.

Footnotes
PETAWAWA tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. SHAMBO was away alertly,
had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed in deep stretch and was no match for the winner. SUIGU STAR was well back, gained ground on the far turn
and from the six path at the top of the stretch was the best of the rest. DYNAMIC MISSION was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch was all out. STREET MAX showed no speed and was roused on the far turn but had no response. MR. DYNAMIC was in range
and raced evenly on the far turn but had no rally. STORMIN' HUMOR was in mid pack and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch failed to fire. RUSHING RIVER was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. LETS
SAY THIS was off slow and showed little while outrun. SECTION TEN stalked the early leader but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
DOT'S VISION was in touch, had a good inside position on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was up in time. SAILIN STREET showed
speed from the inside and had the lead on the far turn but was caught late. DEEP EXPLORER was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was up for
show. ROBUSTO was in range and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. HIATUS was away alertly and
a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. JACK BEANSTALK stalked the early leaders but chased on the far
turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch faded. CALL ME WALLY broke poorly, trailed the field on the far turn and had no impact.
