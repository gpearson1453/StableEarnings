G KATE was roused to the lead, inched away on the turn and held sway. OUT OF THE SKY vied for the lead from the three path, couldn't gain on leader
and proved second best. PORSUMSUGARONME tracked the leaders from the two path while racing one paced. RYRYSWEETIE raced near the back in
the three path made a three wide bid on the turn and raced evenly. HOBBS HOPE saved ground to no avail. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS raced back made a
mild three wide bid on the turn but was not a threat.

gained late. UNPLUCKED GEM stalked the pace from the four path, raced wide throughout and passed tiring rivals. JONO set the early pace and gave way
in upper stretch. HOT ARTIE raced back and was not a threat. HANDY BOY raced in the middle of the pack in the two to three path and was not a factor.
