Footnotes
LE BOIANA stalked the pace inside, got through turning for home and drew off under a drive. DA JOURNEYGIRL set the pace in the two path, was collared
turning for home, continued on the left lead and dug in for the place. GINRIN pressed the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane to maintain
the show. ASTONISHING ANABEL raced greenly inside down the backstretch, angled three wide entering the turn and settled down, came six wide into the
lane and showed some late interest. PRINCIPIA failed to menace while racing two wide. MILK MONEY played no factor while racing two wide. BLACK
BELT BARBIE was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. AWESOME PIC chased the pace four wide and faltered nearing the lane.
AWESOME IDENTITY was outrun while racing four wide. KRAZYKATKOUSIN was bumped at the start, had speed between foes and retreated through the
lane. PASSINGTHEMISTERY steadied near the half-mile pole and made little impact inside. GENUINE MISS steadied near the half-mile pole, raced three
wide and was through early.

BYE BYE DAVID settled off the pace in the two path, raced three wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside, struck the
front near the sixteenth pole and held sway. COLONEL JACKSON stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, moved to the front down the backstretch,
angled in to set the pace along the rail around the far turn, was collared near the quarter pole, fought on inside throughout the lane in a game try.
TAPATERM raced well back two wide early, edged closer four wide around the far turn and rallied through the lane. DRUM AND DRUMMER tracked the
pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. OCTOBER TIME broke outwardly, raced off the pace four wide, bid three wide around the far turn, took the
lead near the quarter pole, dueled to the sixteenth pole and weakened. AUTHENTIC HEART was outrun inside. GOLDEN INDY set the pace along the rail
and faltered around the far turn. SAVAGE SAILOR played no factor while racing three wide.

ADIOS GARY set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. TRAPPE THE WIND was extremely reluctant to load, chased the pace three wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and was just up for the place. STRONG AGAIN stalked the pace inside, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane
and lost second late. MAJOR KING prompted the winner two wide, could not match strides with that foe in the lane and was outfinished between foes for
second and third. SOUTHERN BREEZE saved ground to no avail. SALTY BIRD played no factor while racing two wide. FIRST TEAM was outrun while
racing two wide. IMPETUOUS SOUL was outrun inside.

Footnotes
AWESOME APEAL stalked the pace three wide, slowly gained in the pacesetter through the final furlong and was up in deep stretch. CHASING JOY set the
pace along the rail, drifted out in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. VIOLENT ZAP raced off the pace five wide and rallied for the show. YEGUITA
QUEEN saved ground in range, angled four wide near the quarter pole, angled back in near the eighth pole and finished evenly. LITTLE BELITA raced well
back two wide, swung seven wide turning for home and rallied belatedly. ADIOS DIXIE chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally.
SCARLETT'S FLOWER played no factor while racing three wide. STONE BEAUTY pressed the pace two wide and faltered nearing the lane. LA BRODY
bumped with HOTLINE TO HEAVEN early, clipped that one's heels in the opening sixteenth and was always well back. HOTLINE TO HEAVEN stumbled
after the start, bumped with LA BRODY, was clipped behind early on and was through early.

Footnotes
CARROTHERS stalked the pace in the three path, put a head in front near the three-eighths pole, vied between foes around the far turn then drew off under
a drive in the lane. LORENZ (BRZ) raced off the pace two wide between foes through the opening half, angled out midway down the backstretch, made a
quick four wide bid into the far turn, reached near even terms midway around that bend, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out while holding
clear of the rest. JOURNEYMAN was in range inside, could not keep pace with the winner from the quarter pole but stayed on to gain the show. SIGRUN
FAST BOY raced four wide in midpack, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. CAXAMBAS CANDY was outrun inside. WICKED
FINN set the pace in the two path and retreated inside. MIDWAY MISCHIEF played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
SOUTH POINTE DRIVE raced well back two wide, swung five wide turning for home, closed outside and was up late. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT tracked the pace
three wide, steadily gained through the lane, took the lead and was brushed near the sixteenth pole but was unable to hold off the winner. CAMINERO
stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out and brushed I'LL FIGURE IT OUT near the
sixteenth pole and weakened. PROUD CONTENDER saved ground and failed to menace. FULL DISCLOSURE set the pace along the rail, was collared
near the five-sixteenths pole and retreated through the lane. EUPHORIA STAR slammed the starting gate to get away well last and was never involved. BIG
AND CLASSY chased the pace inside and had no response. PER RULING 2022037344 FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, I'LL FIGURE IT
OUT WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

MISS AURAMET dueled two wide to upper stretch and drew off under a drive. POSEIDON'S PASSION stalked the pace two wide, split rivals entering the
lane, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on willingly to hold the place. SEQUIN LADY raced four wide in midpack and stayed on through the
lane to gain the show. TREVESS settled off the pace while racing three wide, angled in near the eighth pole and just missed the show. NIKEE KAN
prompted the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. ALIZEE was outrun inside. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) played no factor while racing three wide.
SAMMY'S TOWN dueled inside of the winner to upper stretch and wilted.

Footnotes
THOUSAND LOVES settled off the runaway pacesetter down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, ground on outside through the stretch
and was up in the final strides. VENEZUELA FIRST saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the turn, tipped two wide in upper stretch, moved to
the front near the sixteenth pole but was outfinished. FEDERAL EXCHANGE was pinched back at the start, raced well back three wide, angled widest in
upper stretch and surged late. CHIQUIRIN broke in and bumped FEDERAL EXCHANGE at the start, saved ground well back, tipped out in upper stretch
and rallied between foes. FROSTY BREEZE advanced inside around the turn, took over near the three-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth pole and
weakened. SANDY DUDE played no factor while racing two wide. PACIFIC LEGEND raced off the pace three wide, made progress in upper stretch and
faded through the final furlong. I'LL FINISH broke out and bumped FEDERAL EXCHANGE at the start, chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the
lane. LAKI LIO set a blistering pace in the two path and faltered nearing the quarter pole.
