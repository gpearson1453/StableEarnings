Footnotes
WAYWARDNESS led the way while saving ground the entire way around the oval and was in command at the wire. DAILY PLANET saved ground around
the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, could not go with the winner in the stretch
and chased that rival home. HARVEY'S PRINCESS trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far
turn and gained ground mildly in late stretch. FLASHY TOO chased the leader on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SWEET BEAUTY raced in midpack from inside, was ridden three wide into the stretch, and rallied to get up late. CARNELIAN stalked from the three path,
took over while contiuing to race in the three path rounding the turn, was cued in upper stretch but was caught in the final strides to place. MOOR
STRENGTH trailed from inside, was roused while tipping into the three path around the turn, and ran on for show. QUEEN OF MINE chased from the three
path, was coaxed from the four path rounding the turn, but flattened. WILLING rated from the four path but was never a factor. BLUE BONNIE set a loose
lead from inside but yielded at the top of the lane.

NOBLE CROSS chased the leader from the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from
the two path coming around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and drew off to the wire. AND THE OSCAR GOES saved ground around the far turn,
raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and gained ground in late stretch. POETIC CODE
raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around
the far turn, gained ground on the outside down the lane and flattened late. CURLIN'S MALIBU raced off the pace in the three path for the opening half mile,
came around the far turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. CUP MATCH raced in the two path around the turn, tracked the leaders up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded in the stretch. GET THEM DIGITS showed the way while saving ground around the first turn,
continued to lead the field up the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn and tired in the stretch. SAMURAI ISLAND saved ground around the
first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and was empty from there.
WATERMELON CRUSH reared up leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY tracked from the four path, loomed up to make a bid from the six path heading into the stretch, took the lead in upper stretch and held on. E
J'S REVENGE was unhurried from inside, was ridden between rivals coming into the stretch, and rallied down the center for place. SHELLY ISLAND
hopped up leaving the gate, was squeezed back and stumbled in the opening furlong, rated from inside, was driven along while floating into the eight path
coming into the stretch, and ran on for show. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN stalked from inside, was cued while tipping into the three path in upper stretch, but
finished evenly. CLAUDEE BOY chased in the three path, was roused three wide into the stretch, but flattened. TANGO CHARLIE trailed from the two path,
swung into six path at the top of the stretch, but was no threat. DETERMINED TRUTH pressed from the four path, was coaxed three wide roundong the
turn, but faded. BRION led from inside but yielded at the top of the stretch. TEMPTING MOMENT prompted the pace inside but was done early.

Footnotes
SPEED GAME led the way while saving ground around the first turn, dropped back to chase a rival up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn, rerallied in upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong to go and held that margin to the wire. CITY PLAN raced in the two path around the first turn,
chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground steadily to the wire but could not get by
the winner. THOMOND PARK raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch,
came around the far turn in the two path, and gained ground on the outside to the wire. THANK YOU RICKETTS raced at the back of the pack on the inside
through opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and gained ground on the outside late. ELEMENTARY saved ground around the first
turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. CAPTAIN
THUNDER chased the leaders on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend, gained ground
between horses in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. FRANKINCENSE saved ground in the early going, continued up the backstretch off
the pace on the inside, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. TY RAN A HOMER raced in middle of the pack on the outside
around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the lane. FARLEY pressed the pace from the two path
around the first turn, took over the lead while saving up the backstretch and around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. POSTERITY trailed the
field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and was never a factor. TEXAS GANO
raced outside at the back of the pack in the early going, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid.
