Footnotes
TAKE A STAND was well placed early on, raced in the four path into the lane, made a three wide in the upper stretch, was lugging in while edging past foes
and cleared the field in the final stages. TAKE CHARGE LORIN set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane, yielded inside the eighth pole but came
back for place. OUTLINING stalked the pace early, made a bid from between horses nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late
in the stretch run. LADY TRAVELER broke awkwardly at the start and raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane, altered out down the lane while
making a bid but flattened out late in the drive. CAPTAIRE was in the five path entering the lane and raced widest down the lane. DIVINE HOPE was never
a factor. SHOSHONI MOON tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane and faded down the lane.
