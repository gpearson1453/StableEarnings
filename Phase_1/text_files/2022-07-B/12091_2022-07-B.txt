Footnotes
DOC AMSTER broke sharply for a clear early lead, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the turn, responded when roused, pulled away and was ridden
out. HERO TIGER came over a bit at the five eighths pole, chased close up two wide early, chased the winner on the turn, dug in gamely in the stretch and
earned the place award. HE'S SMOKIN NOW broke through the gate prior, steadied slightly between rivals passing the five furlong marker, then chased
inside on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch and got up for third. STEADYTILLREADY stumbled at the start, chased on the inside, raced between rivals on
the turn and was outkicked late for the show spot. THE SICARII raced two wide off the pace, went four wide past the quarter pole, lacked a rally and
weakened. RITHM BOX was outrun. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of HE'S SMOKIN NOW against the second place finisher was dismissed.

Footnotes
THAT'S RIGHT quickly showed in front, set the pace on the inside, opened up on the turn, responded to some mild urging at the furlong marker and was
ridden out. ONE TIMER raced off the pace between rivals, continued between horses on the turn, rallied into second and dug in late to hold that spot.
GROOMS ALL BIZNESS raced four wide in the chute, trailed the field, moved up entering the stretch, rallied inside and finished well. TOO MANY
TWIZZLERS was off slowly, raced five wide leaving the chute, settled off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn and rallied mildly outside. RADICAL
RIGHT raced off the pace with a three wide trip, lacked a bid and finished evenly. CENTER MID MADDIE chased close up on the inside, shuffled back
slightly entering the turn, continued inside and lacked a bid. CLASSICSTATEOFMIND chased close up two wide, raced inside on the turn and tired.
