Footnotes
SUMMER ALL YEAR bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and dug in gamely while drifting mildly in the stretch, refusing to yield to the wire. COFFEE CALIENTE chased the leaders between
horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and dueled to the finish while drifting mildly,
just missing. STAR REDEMPTION tracked the frontrunners between horses up the backstretch, raced wide in the four path around the turn and gained
ground mildly on the outside in late stretch. UNRIVALED QUEEN trailed the field in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn and gained
some ground late. ROLLERCOASTER MAN dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around turn, gave
way with a furlong to go and weakened to the wire. DEE'S WISEGUY stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the five
path and faded entering the stretch. STEALING HEARTS bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders through the opening
quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
WAR CHEST saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position
from the three path coming around the far turn and continued to gain ground outside to pull clear late. PINTXOS brushed lightly with the horse to her outside
leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, battled on the inside around the far turn and
dueled gamely down the stretch, getting caught late. WHISKEY PLANK stalked the leaders from the three path through the opening half mile, began a three
wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, dueled between horses down the lane and missed. GIANT PAYDAY bumped and was forced back at the
break, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a four wide bid coming around the far turn
and dueled on the outside in the stretch, narrowly missing. ROBINSON raced off the pace in the three path through the opening half mile, navigated the far
turn from the two path and gained ground late. CAVE HILL raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
angled in to save ground around the turn, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. COMING UP ACES raced in the three
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the second bend and finished evenly. KING NATE
saved ground at the back of the pack through the first half of the race, continued to race inside around the second turn and never threatened. BENS
MALICE trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack from there, swung four wide around the far turn and passed
tiring horses to the wire while never threatening. ATOMIC CANDY tracked the leaders on the inside in the early going, began to drop back while racing in
the three path around the turn and tired further in the stretch. GREAT BRITAIN raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the frontrunners on the
outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and faded in the lane. VIOLIN MAKER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside

DOCTOR OSCAR dueled on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to press the pace while saving ground around the turn, battled back to pull clear in
upper stretch and held that margin to the wire. LOVE THE NEST chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the
turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground outside late. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, edged clear while racing in the two path around the turn, couldn't go with the winner in the stretch and was caught for second in the final strides.
XAVEY DAVE tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the middle of the pack in the two path around the turn and finished evenly.
NORTH ARM BAY raced well off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and never threatened. HAP HOT hopped up and
bolted in sharply leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field the entire way around the oval and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CURRENT showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to race on the rail around the far turn,
kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. LET'S SKEDADDLE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off
the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside to the finish. SCENT
OF SUCCESS saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
chased the winner home from there. MOLLY'S ANGEL raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn
from the two path and gained ground late. CLICKBAIT chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to
challenge coming around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. READY TO RUNAWAY raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on
the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. COME ON SWEET PEA saved ground
around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and made no bid. SHABAM raced in the three path around
the first turn, settled at the back of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and came up empty in the
stretch. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC raced in the middle of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, launched a bid from the two
path headed into the far turn and faded from there. ICYWILBURNYEH angled in sharply to save ground around the first turn, trailed well behind the field the
entire way around the oval and was never a factor.

Footnotes
PIRATE BIRD bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and dueled gamely the length of the stretch to hold the win while drifting mildly late. GUEST CHECK raced in
the four path around the first turn, stalked the front runners on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole,
dueled down the lane and could not get by the winner while drifting out some in the final furlong. LEAD OFF chased the leaders between horses around the
first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and finished evenly. BIG PETE raced in the three path around the first turn,
chased the pacesetters on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn three wide and finished evenly from there. CALICO JOE raced at the
back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and was not a threat. BOSTON WALLY raced in the
two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between horses, raced in the three path around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch.
HONEY'S SUPERMAN trailed the field while racing wide around the first turn, improved position coming up the backstretch, raced in the three path around
the second turn and flattened out in the lane. PERIPATETIC led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, gave way from
the rail coming around the second bend and faded in the stretch. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the
inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and wasn't a factor.
