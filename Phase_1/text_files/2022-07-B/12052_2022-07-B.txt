Footnotes
HAPPY CLOUDS quickly cleared and crossed over to the two path, then widened under moderate hand urging through the lane. MAGIC BEAUTY leaned
inwardly at the start, chased the clear leader from the three path while outside of a rival, then secured place in midstretch while greenly wandering about on
her left lead. FLAG TO FLAG tracked in midpack in the four to three path, and improved inside of a drifting foe in the final furlong. MACI'S GEMSTONE
broke inwardly and was greenly slow into stride while keen, saved ground far off of the pace, and made little impact. BLESSED ANGEL broke inwardly,
chased the clear leader from the two path around the turn, failed to keep pace with her outer chasing counterpart while hanging on her left lead in upper
stretch, then drifted out while faltering through the final furlong. LADY ENVOY broke slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
STAYED IN FOR HALF dictated terms with a narrowly clear advantage, felt sterner pressure around the turn, shifted out to the two path entering the lane,
and held firm from chasing foes on either side through the final furlong. TWIRLING ROSES stalked two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane,
chased the inner leading pair while just off of their flanks in the final furlong, vied for place in the closing stages, and reached that position late. COMISKEY
PARK stalked along the inside, bid along the rail in midstretch, but was fended off, then got nailed at the wire for place. RESPECT THE CODE broke a step
slowly before being brushed by an inner foe, sat reserved at the rear two wide, spilt foes while shifted four wide at the three sixteenths pole, bur continued
out to the six path in the process, and lacked then needed punch in the final furlong. KENNESAW came out at the start, settled at the rear along the inside,
and never got involved. B D VALESKI was pushed outwardly by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, raced forwardly placed three wide and between
horses while stalking the clear leader, but failed to keep pace entering the lane before being floated five wide in upper stretch, and faded through the final
furlong. CIRCLE BACK JACK broke a step slowly before brushing with foes on either side at the start, tracked four wide and outside of rivals, but faded six
wide entering the lane.

TITLE SHOT was slow into stride and laid off of the pace along the inside, tracked behind the leaders in the three path around the turn, split foes four wide
at the quarter pole, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled with an inner WORDS OF WISDOM through the final furlong, and clung to a narrow margin
through the late stages. WORDS OF WISDOM stalked along the inside, tipped two wide nearlng the lane, bid at the furlong grounds along with an outer
TITLE SHOT, battled through the late stages, but was second best. RIKIO set the pace along the inside, dictated terms from outer pressers around the turn,
but yielded to a pair of rivals at the furlong grounds. PRIVATE CONNIE pressed the pace three wide, but yielded between horses entering the lane. INDIAN
SPRINGS prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but weakened at the quarter pole. MOUNTAIN GHOST tracked four wide, but faded after being
floated five wide turning for home. OFFICER NICK trailed in the five to six path around the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
FADETHENOISE dueled for the lead three wide and drew off leaving the five sixteenths pole. SAILOR'S CHANCE dueled for the lead two wide and
between horses, but failed to keep pace with them leaving the three furlong pole, yet kept on through the lane to re-bid for place entering the final sixteenth,
and prevailed. SPANISH DOUBLOON dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but proved no match for her widest counterpart at the five sixteenths pole,
then lost place late. COACHES MEETING broke a step slowly, stalked the dueling trio from the three path, but lacked a rally. ST. NEOTS broke a beat
slowly, saved ground off of the pace, then chased evenly through the lane. LORD GRANTHAM broke slowly before shying from an outer foe at the start,
raced far back in the three path, and failed to menace. SIVAKO tracked in the four path, but faded around the turn. LUCKY'S SECRET laid in midpack in the
two path, but faded around the turn. LOOKA LOOKA showed little.

Footnotes
BOURBON SPIRIT brushed with an outer foe at the start, laid close up along the inside early on, backed off to stalk into the turn, tracked two wide turning
for home, split the leaders entering the lane to bid at the furlong grounds, and drove clear. ACCIDENT trailed in the four path, then rallied on his left lead to
reach place at the wire. MIRANDA RIGHTS brushed with an inner foe at the start, dueled two wide and between horses into the turn, then only inside of
MEMPHIS PHAROAH while a bit off of the rail around the turn, inched clear entering the lane as BOURBON SPIRIT took aim, but failed to resist that foe's
bid at the furlong grounds, gave way, and was nailed late for place. MEMPHIS PHAROAH broke outwardly, dueled three wide, then two wide while in the
three path around the turn, but faded entering the lane. BLUFF CITY dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but steadily faded leaving the three furlong
pole. MYSTIC MINISTER laid off of the pace in the three path and never got involved. DREAMFACTOR hopped slightly at the start, raced off of the pace
two wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
FANCY MARTINI prompted the pace two wide, gained an advantage entering the lane, dueled as her inner counterpart battled on, and held gamely
between horses late. QUEROBIN DOURADA set the pace inside of a pressing FANCY MARTINI, got headed by that foe entering the lane, fought on
gallantly thereafter, but did not have enough to reclaim even terms, and saved place. AMANI'S IMAGE stalked along the inside, chased outside of the top
pair through upper stretch, kicked in late to produce a bid in the final sixteenth, but missed. MAMA RINA settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted two
wide entering the backstretch, and stayed on mildly to surpass outer foes in the final furlong. CARIBBEAN NIGHT laid at the rear along the inside, split foes
two wide turning for home, swung six wide in upper stretch, and leveled off outside of foes. LAVISH HABITS tracked two to three wide, then pressed around
the far turn, and tired through the lane. LADY ARSINOE tracked in midpack two to three wide, then four wide around the far turn, got floated five wide in
upper stretch, and lacked a bid between horses. WICKED WONDER saved ground in midpack, but faded. BALI DREAMIN broke a beat slowly, raced off of
the pace two to three wide, and failed to factor. HARD LIKE HOLLY broke a step slowly and never got involved.

Footnotes
LEGIONNAIRE broke a bit outwardly, settled two wide, rallied four wide to bid outside of the leaders nearing the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, and held
sway. WHAT'S UP DOC hesitated at the start, rated far back four wide, gained two to three wide turning for home before fanning five wide in upper stretch,
and rallied. BOLD MEDICATION showed the way early on, dueled inside of a pair of foes down the backstretch, failed to keep pace and chased them into
the far turn, regained stride to rebid outside of them turning for home as an outer LEGIONNAIRE did the same, but was outkicked by that foe in upper
stretch, and tired. INEXORABLE saved ground off of the pace, shifted out in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly between horses. YORK TAVERN broke a
beat slowly, chased in the two path, cut the corner entering the lane, but lacked a rail bid. PORT ROYAL failed to factor. BLOW TORCH broke a bit out,
moved to prompt the pace three wide and between horses entering the backstretch, backed off to track soon after, but faded between horses around the far
turn. UNCLE BERLEY dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, then only inside of a single foe around the far turn, but weakened between horses
in upper stretch. CALL ME FAST broke slowly while shying from an inner foe at the start, rushed outside of foes around the far turn to vie four wide entering
the backstretch, sparred three wide, then two wide around the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CURRENT stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair approaching the five furlong pole, bid at the quarter pole along with an outer WHISKEY
DOUBLE, then dueled between horses through the final furlong, and forged an advantage late. TEMPER TANTRUM set a pressured pace, dug in inside of
a trio of bidding foes turning for home, tenaciously clung to an advantage from a pair of foes inside the final furlong, but was nailed at the wire. WHISKEY
DOUBLE tracked in the three path, inched closer four wide and outside of foes around the far turn to bid nearing the lane, then vied outside of a pair of foes
through the final furlong, but did not have enough. NEXT pressed two wide, vied between horses leaving the quarter pole, but gave way at the furlong
grounds. CELERITY settled in the two path, attempted a gain in the five path around the far turn, but made little impact. ARTEMUS EAGLE laid in midpack
two wide, tracked while between horses in hand just behind the leading group around the far turn, but faded through the lane. ATTORNEY TIM laid far back
two to three wide, and failed to factor. BAMA BREEZE rated at the rear long the inside, cut the gap on the main group while in the two to three path turning
for home, but failed to sustain a rally. INTRADAY (BRZ) saved ground while tracking, but faded.

Footnotes
STELLA TERESA set a pressured pace inside of a rival around the turn, and drew off entering the lane. BALL GOWN tracked along the inside, shifted four
wide in upper stretch, and rallied between horses to claim place a sixteenth out. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX settled off of the pace in the two path, swung five
wide in upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show. CAUSE CELEBRE broke slowly, saved ground far back, rallied along the rail to bid for place the final
sixteenth, but flattened out. GET BY laid off of the pace in the three path, swung six wide in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. BELPERRON trailed in the
two path, and improved in the lane. ALEATORY raced far back in the four path, and failed to factor. MAHOMEBRED stalked the top pair from the two path,
tipped outside of them in upper stretch, but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. RATHER BE LUCKY prompted the pace two wide, but swiftly
failed to keep pace entering the lane, and wilted between horses at the sixteenth pole. MISS NUCKOLS tracked two wide, but faded between horses
entering the lane.
