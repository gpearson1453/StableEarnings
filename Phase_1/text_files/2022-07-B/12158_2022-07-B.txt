Footnotes
TOO MUCH BOURBON broke on top, worked way to the inside when clear and showing the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace into the lane,
two path, slight drift inside the furlong marker, held the next two safe under firm handling. LOUISIANA HERO chased the winner up the backstretch and
through the turn off the inside, three wide into the lane, lodged a late bid while still outside the winner, not enough. MAINTAINANCE MATT trailed early off
the inside, improved a bit through the turn, came four wide for the drive, moved a bit closer with the runner up with a furlong remaining, flattened out. YES
BAB within striking distance early along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn to no avail. RUN AWAY SON was finished before a half,
trailed home.

Footnotes
PEANUT N IKE moved up to duel soon after the start, continued to alternate through the turn, shook clear a furlong out, increased advantage to the wire
under steady handling. ROYAL UNLIMITED behind the pace while moving off the inside, three wide through the turn, moved closer on the outside of the two
dueling leaders turning for home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, proved determined for the second spot. LUCAS ZIP IT fractious while
loading, broke on top, dueled outside the winner for three furlongs, drifted out a bit while between the top two nearing midstretch, also proved no match to
the wire, outkicked for the place. ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL last away, moved up along the inside to race in the second flight, just off the rail into the lane,
came up empty for the stretch run. JOHNNY JUDE fell back to trail after the start and was never a factor.

Footnotes
YOUNG BULL in the main group up the backstretch closest to the inside, in tight into the turn, continued inside, bid when straightened for home, gained the
advantage and dug in to win in determined fashion. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE behind the pace and just outside the winner early, also was in tight quarters,
brushed entering the turn, maintained position, challenged with the winner in upper stretch, outkicked by that one late, narrowly gained the place. WILD
BERT main flight outside, four out to five wide turn, challenged widest upper stretch, not enough late. GOLD MERRITT sprinted clear soon after the start,
got out a bit late in the turn when still showing the way, continued to hold the advantage with a furlong remaining, drifted out again late and weakened
slightly. FATHER GOOSE fell back to trail after breaking with the field, four wide into the lane, had nothing for the run to the wire. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF
FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BRIAN'S IRON MIKE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MONITOR MILLS broke on top, set a pressured early pace, edged aclear into the far turn, shook off his remaining pursuer turning for home, steadily
increased advantage while out in the strip while kept to pressure. SHOETRICK behind the pace, raced three wide when moving a bit closer in the second
turn, could do little with the winner through the lane, clearly second best. OLDER AND WISER moved up to a forward position while four wide into the first
turn, continued to prompt the winner the middle half, weakened through the stretch but managed to narrowly save the show. BUBBA SMACK lacked early
foot, raced four wide through the final turn then went flat through the lane in lacking a closing punch. DARK MATTER pressed the issue early outside the
winner, gave way into the far turn, continued to back up through the lane. LAMONT last away, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field,
jogged in.

MY MAN LOUIE broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear afterward, shrugged off a rival turning for home, clear again, coasted home late to win ridden out.
BITCOIN BANKER last away, lacked speed, rallied three wide out of the turn, had too much to do to get the winner, well clear of the others. COACH DAN
settled off the pace inside, displayed some mild interest up the inside to annex the third spot while no threat to the top pair. MR. CURLIN closest to the
winner early, tried that one from the outside late in the turn, gave way entering the stretch, continued to fade, caught late for third.

the early pace while between horses, began to give way before a half and continued to fade. SPIN TOWN set or forced the pace four five furlongs off the

pressure. SPLENDA GAIL in the second flight well wide, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, finished up willingly to be clear for the place, not a serious
threat to the winner. HOT TUB HOTTIE moved up to narrowly set the pace along the inside, proved no match for the top two through the lane, remained
clear of the others. LA TRESS GRAY vied up front while between horses for three furlongs and began to falter. FACTOIRE four wide and inside the runner

PRAYERS SAVED close from the start outside, vied three wide into and through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, responded when
challenged late and repelled. TENSAS VIRGINIA checked up when in tight at the break to be last away, moved up steadily, improved along the inside late
turn, angled out four wide entering the stretch, late bid, denied. ROCKETT MAGIC with the pace while inside the winner and between foes, could not match
that one in the drive or contain the runner up, remained clear of rest. KASEN'S SISTER behind the first flight toward the inside, moved out to be five wide
turning for home, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing kick. GRACESSPECIALTOUCH forwardly placed early, in the second flight in the two
path late turn, also lacked a closing response. SWIMHARD DREAMBIG remained back while off the inside, continued one paced in lacking a rally as well.
STOP THE FRIEND broke alertly, cleared to the inside soon after, raced with the leaders for three furlongs then gave way. EASTER GIRL remained back in
failing to threaten. BOSSY'S TROUBLE was never involved.
