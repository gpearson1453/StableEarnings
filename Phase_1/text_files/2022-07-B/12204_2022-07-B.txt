SECRET FIX broke alertly, pressed the pace from inside, dueled around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong remaining and held safely. KITTEN CALLS was
off a bit slow to begin, raced four deep at the rear of the field into the turn, continued four wide into the stretch and rallied to gain the place. DON'T TALK
stalked the top pair early on, bid three deep leaving the turn, could not keep up with the winner in the final furlong and got edged for second. DARLING
DONNA set the pace outside the winner early, dueled with SECRET FIX around the turn, lost contact approaching the furlong grounds and weakened.
SWEET HEIDELBERG got bumped from inside early, raced three deep then three wide on the turn from off the pace, tipped out into the stretch and could
not rally. TAMARANDO COAST away quickly from inside then drifted out, in, then back out and bumped SWEET HEIDELBERG early, dropped back off the
pace, took the turn two wide and lacked. CHARLOTTE HARBOR raced near the back on the inside, got shuffled early on the turn, angled out to the five path

Footnotes
STRAIGHT NO CHASER away quickly and sped clear to assume command the pace on the inside into the stretch, kicked clear in the lane and held safely
under urging. VIRAT was off slow to begin, angled down to the inside racing near the back, saved ground to the stretch, steered out in deep stretch and
rallied to best the rest. PELIGROSO was hard to load, chased under coaxing up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and got outkicked for the place
honors. TO SPEIGHT HER broke a step slow but recovered quickly, stalked the pace from inside then two wide into the stretch, failed to produce a bid and
got outfinished for the place and show. AN ARMY OF LIGHT tracked off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and needed to find more late. MAGIC MAN
got crowded along the inside early, chased along the rail then two wide into the stretch and could not rally. CRIBBAGE BOARD broke a step slow, tugged
the rider along early, chased four wide exiting the turn, moved out further in the lane and lacked a rally. MASTERMIND settled outside rivals or off the rail,
entered the drive four wide and also lacked a rally. HONEYMOON SUITE was closest in pursuit to the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch and
weakened. LAUGHING LEGACY was off slow in the beginning, rounded the bend three deep and failed to menace. PESO sat off the pace, raced between
foes on the turn, lugged in at the eighth pole and could not make an impact. STILL ON THE BOOKS dropped back early, trailed through the turn and was
not a factor.

DIRECT LINE brushed leaving the gate, went four deep around the first turn, bid three deep into the stretch, dueled with BOLD ENDEAVOR in the final
furlong and was all out to edge the runner-up. BOLD ENDEAVOR pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn, cleared briefly in upper stretch
then received the challenge from DIRECT LINE, fought with that rival through the late stages and finished gamely to the wire. MONGOLIAN WIND brushed
with rival at the start, chased three deep around the first turn, raced in range to the second bend, entered the drive two wide, lacked a late bid but stayed on
to hold third. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY stumbled badly at the start, traveled wide through the first turn, angled down to the rail while advancing on the far
turn, finished willingly from inside but could not get up for third. LOUD MOUTH set the pace under pressure from BOLD ENDEAVOR, battled that rival on
the far turn, could not match strides at the top of the lane and weakened after. BOTTLE OF SMOKE raced off the rail near the back, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. WILLY THE COBBLER chased between early then off the rail on the backstretch, stayed off the inside to the lane and could
not rally. TIZHOTNDUSTY hopped at the start, pulled into and on the first turn, settled on the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn and lacked further
response. PROVERB stumbled leaving the gate, trailed on the inside early, continued at or near the back in the middle stages, trailed two wide into the
stretch and failed to make an impact. SOL DEL SUR stalked from inside early, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
HAVNAMELTDOWN hustled from the gate and cleared the field, steered to the inside and set the pace on the inside to the stretch, urged left-handed in
deep stretch and remained clear. MISTER ICEMAN broke well then took a stalking position outside a rival, bid two wide into the stretch, could not summon
the needed late kick to overtake the winner but was stayed on to prove second best. DILLINGER broke awkwardly at the start, chased three deep into the
turn, closed in around the bend, bid three deep into the stretch but was no match for the tp pair late. PURE FIRE raced in mid-pack off the rail, lacked room
behind a rival entering the turn, angled down to the inside and kept on to fill out the superfecta. SKINNER broke a bit slow and bumped with inner rival,
drifted out on the backstretch, entered the lane four to five wide and improved position. ALEXANDER HELIOS raced in range between rivals entering the
turn, exited the bend three wide and lacked a rally. BOLT FROM HEAVEN was off slow to begin, navigated the turn three then four wide and also lacked a
rally. JANUARY MAGIC broke well then began to climb and dropped back early, raced off the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. TOP GUN CLASSIC
bobbled slightly at the start, chased along the rail then two wide into the drive and faded. DEEP RIVER broke a bit slow and bumped with outside rival,
became a bit rank early, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane and proved no menace.

deep into the turn, waited behind the top trio outside a rival on the turn, bumped with ATOMIC DROP in upper stretch, bid with a furlong to go but flattened
out late. NEXT FLIGHT unhurried and raced between rivals at the back early, altered out around rival early on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and

HACKING IT UP away quickly while also coming in early from the outside, led early then lost command past the half-mile pole, pressed the leader into the
turn from outside, dueled on the turn, led into the stretch, cleared with a furlong left and held safely. STAY IN THE GAME broke well then got forced in by
TAPATIO LEO early, chased the top pair two wide into the stretch, showed late effort and outkicked SHIP AND SCAM for second while closing the gap on
the winner. SHIP AND SCAM came in at the start, bumped with inner rival then checked early, got bumped entering the turn, entered the lane three wide,
finished well in tandem with STAY IN THE GAME and got edged for second. TAPATIO LEO came in and bumped early, went up to take control past the
half-mile pole, dueled from inside around the bend, could not keep pace with the winner entering the final furlong and flattened to fourth. DUTY FIRST got
sandwiched between rivals and checked early, chased two wide through the turn and could not make an impact in the stretch. WARRENS WORLD chased
along the inside and weakened. KRIXUS FLASH got bumped hard from outside and checked early, raced in mid-pack after, went two wide into the drive and
could not rally. THEUNTOUCHABLEONE was off slow to begin, raced a bit off the rail into the drive and made no impact. VINCE'S CORNER was off slow
and took up at the start and never got involved. MY RANSOM got bumped from outside then had his path taken and clipped heels early, raced three wide
into the stretch and could not recover from a rough beginning. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TAPATIO LEO FROM
FOURTH TO LAST FOR COMING IN AND CAUSING MY RANSOM TO CLIP HEELS EARLY WHICH THEN CAUSED A CHAIN REACTION BETWEEN
SEVERAL RUNNERS.

Footnotes
GREGDAR stalked from inside, waited for room on the far turn, urged briefly then paused again at the top of the lane, found room between the top pair at
the eight pole, quickly took advantage and surged clear. FLASHIEST was off slow to begin, trailed early on, advanced outside rivals into and around the far
turn, entered the stretch five wide, rallied and gained second while no match for the winner. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) traveled near the back early on, saved
ground on the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and finished well to earn the show honors. RIP CITY settled off the pace in
the two path early, moved closer on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, bid five deep at the eighth pole but did not have the needed late punch.
LURE HIM IN rated early outside the leader then moved to the two path, drew alongside at the three-eighths pole, dueled from outside on the second turn,
carried a short lead into the final furlong and yielded in the final sixteenth. NEPTUNE'S STORM stalked three wide early, bid four deep with a furlong to go
but faltered in deep stretch. SHADOW SPHINX was rank early between rivals, steered to the inside, tipped three wide on the far turn, lacked room behind
rivals in the lane, angled out late and could not rally. SEVEN CHARMS raced off the rail near the back, exited the far turn four wide, angled out widest in the
lane and failed to menace. VANTASTIC broke a step slow, became rank first time in the stretch, raced in range two wide into the far turn, roused upper
stretch but lacked further response. SEATTLE BOLD cleared and crossed over in the chute, showed the way up the backstretch, met a bid from outside at
the three-eighths marker, dueled around the far turn, stayed on to upper stretch, then weakened.

HEYWOODS BEACH stalked the pacesetter from outside, applied pressure leaving the clubhouse turn, headed rival at the five-sixteenths pole, took over
past the quarter pole, cleared at the eighth pole and drove clear under right and left-handed urging. TIZAMAGICIAN sped clear early, gained pressure at the
thee-quarter pole, headed by HEYWOODS BEACH midway on the final bend, lost command but fought back from inside, lost touch with the winner with a
furlong to go and stayed on through deep stretch to hold second. EXTRA HOPE stalked outside the top pair to the stretch, finished willingly down the lane
but lacked the needed late punch. ORDER AND LAW settled early while racing four to five wide first time into the stretch, continued wide throughout and
finished evenly in the late stages. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) raced in range from inside to the final turn, lost ground around that bend and weakened down
the lane. DEAN MARTINI was unhurried in the beginning and angled in on the first turn, trailed to the stretch and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
IRIDEO (ARG) unhurried on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, altered out midstretch, split foes and edged away. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) tracked
the pace from inside early, traveled between on the backstretch, came three wide into the lane, moved out further in the drive, rallied four deep late and got
up for second. BRAN (FR) away quickly in the beginning and showed early speed, ceded command nearing the first turn, pulled while stalking near the
inside, saved ground into the stretch, put in a rail bid in deep stretch and got outkicked for second. KENTUCKY PHAROAH showed early speed outside
BRAN (FR) then cleared that rival and crossed over nearing the first turn, controlled the pace up the backstretch, maintained a short lead through the far
turn, cleared into the stretch but yielded in the late stages. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY raced in range in the two path then three deep in the middle stages,
exited the far turn four wide, finished willingly through the lane but needed to find more late. STORM THE COURT tossed his head leaving the gate to come
away slow, stalked from off the rail then moved up to press the pace, stayed alongside through the far turn, lost touch with the leader into the stretch,
chased through the lane and lacked the needed late kick. TESORO reserved early on the inside, went two wide into the stretch, got crowded between rivals
at the sixteenth pole and kept on while unable to threaten. ME AND MR. C was off a bit slow from outside, moved into the two path, traveled between foes
on the backstretch, trailed four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SWORD ZORRO (IRE) raced outside a rival near the back, between rivals into
the far turn, got put in a bit tight around the bend, angled out in the stretch and lacked a rally. NAVY ARMED GUARD tracked three wide early, four deep in
the middle stages, came back to the three path on the final turn and lacked further response. INDIAN PEAK broke a step slow, went three wide around the
first turn, advanced four wide on the second bend, got bothered by inner rival midstretch and weakened.

Footnotes
HAIL FREEDOM bumped rival three deep then went four wide on the first turn, moved up quickly to take control from STREET RUCKUS around the bend
and angled down to the two path, kicked clear on the far turn, opened up in the stretch, grew a bit weary late but held safely. ECHOSMITH (IRE) got
bumped from outside and steadied between foes and behind a rival on the first turn, raced in mid-pack three deep on the backstretch, went four deep into
the far turn, remained four wide into the drive, rallied and got up for second. DARK VADER broke in and bumped rival, went four wide around the first turn,
chased outside a rival into the second bend, exited the turn three wide, showed late effort to close the gap on the winner but got edged for second by the
runner-up. AJAAWEED broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, came with a mild rally and earned a minor
award. STREET RUCKUS sent from inside early and took control, lost the lead around the clubhouse turn, remained closer up to the inside of the
pacesetter up the backstretch, lost ground on the far turn and flattened in the stretch. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) got bumped from outside and crowded
leaving the gate, went three wide around the first turn then traveled between rivals, entered the far turn three deep, remained three wide into the lane and
could not rally. STORMY PATTERN bumped with rival leaving the gate, stalked on the inside, lost ground while pushed upon through the far turn and
weakened down the lane. NO HANG CHARLIE chased in the two path then between rivals, lost ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back on the final
turn and tired. TROUBADOUR bumped leaving the gate, angled to the inside and saved ground off the pace and was not a factor. DIVINE ARMOR dropped
back off the rail early, eased on the backstretch and pulled up at the half-mile pole, then walked into the van under his own power.

Footnotes
GRACELUND GRAY pulled early on the front end first time through the stretch, dueled with rival then cleared on the clubhouse turn, controlled the pace up
the backstretch, led cleared into the drive, padded the lead in upper stretch and stayed strong to the line. BALLET DANCING broke slow from outside,
unhurried in the early going and moved down to the two path, traveled between rivals in the middle stages, got boxed in briefly on the far turn, tipped out
and rallied to prove second best. RHEA MOON (IRE) reserved in the early going racing outside a pair of rivals, driven four wide into the stretch and got up
for the show. SHE'S GOT A WAY stalked in the two path then moved inside, tipped back two wide on the far turn and failed to offer the needed late
response. ANNIE'S SONG (IRE) stalked three deep, chased outside a rival on the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and could not rally. FORTUNATA
TENSIO dueled for the lead from outside then chased the leader on the clubhouse turn, entered the lane three wide and weakened. GLENALL (IRE)
became rank when tossing her head about early, settled near the back, had to steady on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and improved position.
MISS MATTIE B had to check leaving the chute, became rank along the inside and was hard to ride through the early stages, steadied on the far turn,
steered out and failed to rally. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) was off slow to begin, pulled early between rivals, sat off the pace to the stretch and failed to
threaten in the lane. BARRISTER'S RIDE hit the gate in the beginning, traveled three wide on the first turn, raced outside rivals to the stretch and lacked a
rally. ISOLA MIA stalked the pace from inside, got put in tight leaving the far turn and weakened. YOUTEYOURHONOR broke a step slow, checked
between early then became rank first time through the stretch and could not get involved after.
