not match strides with the winner late, second best. ROBBER was settled early, then was three wide on the turn, had no kick in the lane while besting the
rest. MAPACHE MAN chased the early pace four wide, then dropped down towards the inside and was two wide by the quarter pole, weakened.
KISSMEISTER was settled four wide, and was five wide on the turn and was not a threat. MOONSHINE SURFER was off slowly and far back, not a factor.

BODEE BODEE was rated along three wide, shifted out on the turn and made a five wide move leaving the quarter pole and continued that move in the
furlong grounds to prevail under a drive. SHANKINSTINE was with the early pace four wide, then was given a breather by the three eighths, made a four
wide bid by the quarter pole and hit the front leaving the turn, but was outfinished late in a game effort. TED STRIKER set a pressured pace on the inside
and weakened in the drive, stayed on for the show award. TOOCAN DANCE pressed the pace three wide and weakened. YOU YOUR DADDY SON
passed the tiring rivals. SASSI ASPEN chased the pace on the inside and swung out five wide for the drive and was empty. LIT A SHUCK chased the pace
between rivals and weakened. MAGIC ICE failed to respond.

Footnotes
LA LA LATTE set the early pace and then was challenged by her barn mate by the quarter pole, turned back that bid to draw clear in the final furlong to
prove best under a drive. ARMS APRIORITY checked on the inside nearing the three eighths marker, made a bid two wide on the turn to vie for command
by the quarter pole but flattened out, second best. A STONE RUNNER was rated along the inside, steadied nearing the three eighths, then made a inside
run on the turn, shifted out three wide in the drive and finished evenly, bested rest. CAUGHT MY HEART stalked the pace three wide and weakened. THE
CAT CAME BACK was rated between horses and checked hard at the three eighths marker, then had no rally. CRYPTO SMARTY was reluctant to load, off
slowly and was not a factor. RIVER GODDESS chased the pace three wide and stopped. KANCANCUTIE veered in at the start and hit the rail, then made a
three wide run before bolting on the turn and was pulled up, walked off.
