Footnotes
BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL away well to race with the pace into the first turn, showed the way onto the backstretch, rated in the run into the far turn,
responded when challenged, shook clear again when straightened for home, fully extended to just last for part of the win. PARALISSFRMANALYSS
prompted the pace off the inside,moved to duel early in the far turn, fell back off that early leader upper stretch, rebid late late between horses, closed with
good resolve to lodge a second bid late between foes to earn the dead heat. NATE'S REVENGE off a step slow, raced back and inside for five furlongs,
moved out second turn, roused four wide into the lane, late push, finished willingly while narrowly too late. XANTHUS WRATH forwardly placed while four
wide into the first turn, stalked the top two the middle half, came three wide for the drive, lacked a closing punch the final furlong. MARVINS GOLD in mid
pack early, moved closer along the inside just before a half, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE forced the issue early off the
inside, finished after half. HOPE FOR CHANGE fell back early, was well beaten in showing little.

Footnotes
HUMPHREY unhurried in the early going outside, continued back the middle half mile, came three wide into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, went to
a right handed crop soon after, late surge outside the late leaders to be up in time. HOT STOVE LEAGUE narrowly set the early pace along the inside,
continued to vie up the backstretch, headed in the second turn, regained the advantage when straightened for home, proved stubborn to the end to miss.
DEBONNAIRE DUDE broke on top, pressed the runner up between foes, briefly put a head in front second turn while remaining in the two path, long drive
to the wire, outfinished for the second spot while edging clear for the show. FLASHBURN prompted the pace outside, vied three wide through the final turn
and upper stretch, weakened late. SEMI CHARMED LIFE broke forwardly, in traffic then steadied into the first turn, fell back and failed to muster a rally
when called on into the stretch. WAYPOINT stopped after a half, finished well back.

Footnotes
ONAMARGARITADAY broke out at the start to be last away,moved up steadily to duel onto the backstretch in the two path, shook off the other speed
turning for home, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire while being kept to task. SHE A HOT MESS four wide in the first turn when well off the early
pace, continued outside before moving closer after a half, roused three wide into the lane, took over the runner up spot with less than a furlong remaining,
proved no match for the winner late while lasting for the place. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) broke out a bit, fell back to trail, emerged from between foes late in
the final turn, finished willingly to improve position, too late for the place. TEXAS BLUEBONNET dueled up front inside the winner and closest to the inside,
continued on equal terms with that one into the far turn, began to falter late in that bend, continued to weaken through the stretch. GATOR PROUD
remained back in failing to menace. MIZZEN MONARCH raced briefly forward then began a steady retreat before a half. BURNING DESIRE in the second
flight for four furlongs, also gave way before the real running started.

Footnotes
CHARLI MICHAEL broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, narrowly showed the way into the turn, disposed of the other speed late in the bend to be
well clear stretch, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to pressure. BODE'S LIGHT with the pace along the inside, dueled turn,
came in the two path for the drive no match stretch, narrowly saved the place late. CARIBE NIGHTS void of speed inside, continued to save ground turn,
advanced up the inside to be getting to the runner up late, well clear of the others. KING MARVIN closest to the dueling leaders for a half, had little left for
the drive. BITSY'S CUSTOM C back off the pace outside, raced four wide through the turn and failed to rally. MOVE IT fell far back after the start, continued
to lag turn, managed to close the gap on his nearest rival with some modest late interest while never posing a threat.

Footnotes
CABOCHON TREASURE broke back, moved into contention four wide in the turn, took over while still in the four path entering the stretch, drove well clear
under a steady right handed crop. ETBAUER'S SECRET chased the winner early, challenged between foes and inside the winner turning for home, proved
no match for that one, clear of the others. MALIBU MONEY asked away from the gate, failed to keep up with the leaders into the turn, fell back a bit in the
bend then was along for the show while not a threat to the top two late. BIG RUSSSS broke sharp, cleared to the inside entering the turn, narrowly showed
the way late in the bend then began to falter when headed by the winner into the stretch. FIGHTING SOLDIER failed to menace while racing four wide.
HONORABLESTATEMENT in mid pack, checked up in traffic into the turn, fell back and did not recover. FLASH OF RAIN last away, trailed throughout.

CATCAKE broke with the leaders, fell back steadily the opening quarter, came four wide into the stretch, roused, closed with good resolve while between
horses at the wire. DA DUE RUN RUN last to leave, trailed for three furlongs, swung five wide turning for home, rallied down the middle of the strip to finish
willingly while too late while widest of the first flight at the wire. MADAME JANE broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path, shook clear with a furlong
remaining, could not contain the top two in the late going, clear of the others. STARBUCK LUCK dueled up front along the inside, weakened. MISS NITAP
forwardly placed behind the duel up front in the three path, faltered in the drive. MOMENT TO DREAM behind the pace, in some traffic late in the turn, faded
when clear for the drive.

Footnotes
EXACTA broke well, soon got clear, set the pace along the inside while rating kindly, drew off as she pleased under a moderate hand ride through the lane
to win ridden out. IRON BANNER in the main body, off the inside into the lane, long drive for the place, proved determined to be up for that position late, no
threat to the winner. LADY CHURCHILL underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke out, was straightened to race closest to the winner, continued to
prompt that one into the far turn, proved no match in the drive, held stubbornly to miss the runner up spot. HERE COMES LOVIE settled off the pace and
the inside, was four wide exiting the final turn, some late interest while widest of the second fight, not enough in the final strides for the place. LUTIE MO
back off the early pace, moved closer before a half then lacked a further response. GLORY TO ME broke in to help pinch GOODNIGHT GRACIE, raced four
wide into the first turn when off the pace, remained back in lacking a rally. GOODNIGHT GRACIE off a step slow then was pinched and steadied, trailed
throughout to be never a factor.

Footnotes
FUHR MEO broke back, moved up steadily the first three furlongs inside, boxed in through much of the turn, steered out when presented a seam in the two
path entering the stretch, took over, drew out under steady handling. GLENNEYMAX in the second flight off the inside, came four wide turning for home,
finished willingly to be up for the place, no threat to the winner. HOUSE OF ZONG fractious prior to the start to get loose from his handlers, broke sharp,
steadied when he came in exiting the chute, recovered to show the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace turn and into the stretch, proved no
match for the winner the final furlong, caught late for the place. ST. MONICA broke back, lacked speed, moved out, five wide turning for home, improved
position to be closing the gap on the second flight late. LUCCA'S LILYBY dueled early off the inside, continued to chased through the turn, weakened in the
drive. MY DEPOSIT last away, trailed most of the way, failed to threaten. DIAMONDS SHINING tired while racing four wide out of the turn.
