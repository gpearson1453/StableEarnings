Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR BALA was hustled to the lead, stayed just off the inside, put to a drive upper stretch then lengthened command while ridden out the final
furlong. EL RAYO broke on top, was soon chasing LOOKIN FOR BALA from inside, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but drew away
for second. WICKED SKY chased from outside, drifted out some under left-handed pressure entering the stretch and finished evenly. CRUISING ALTITUDE
was inattentive in gate and spotted the rest of the field several lengths at the break, was encouraged to race but showed no speed, eased the last eighth
and walked off.

Footnotes
TIZ APPROVED showed the way in hand from inside, floated out some on the bend, was put to urging upper stretch, widened his lead and was kept to task
to the wire. CREEKMORE was sent to prompt TIZ APPROVED from just outside, could not stay with that one in the lane but proved easily second best.
TALE OF THE NILE chased from outside, took over third on the bend, angled to the inside nearing the end of a half mile, moved out widest upper stretch,
drifted out further, kept a straight path inside the last furlong but had no late bid. KARAYEL steadily faded, was in hand deep stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
INCORRUPTIBLE was steadied behind traffic leaving the chute, altered to the rail, altered out three wide for a clear path to make his bid with four furlongs
left, swiftly took the lead on the bend, widened command under a drive in the lane and was kept to urging until the final seventy yards. DEVIL'S RULE broke
on top but then was settled back while in hand, fanned out some as he commenced his bid leaving the turn, split horses two wide upper stretch, moved clear
for second inside the last furlong then could only maintain his position late. EL ASESINO in contention early, advanced just off the inside on the turn, fanned
four wide into the stretch, lacked a significant bid but took over third with a sixteenth to go. MAXIMILIANO prominent from outside on the backstretch, did not
keep up widest on the bend and also failed to have a serious stretch bid. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, fractious in the gate, vied for the early lead outside
CHOPPER, did not keep up two wide on the turn, floated out some into the stretch and flattened out between horses the last eighth. CHOPPER displayed
early speed from inside, did not stay with INCORRUPTIBLE on the turn and quickly gave way the last two furlongs.

WILD FOX stalked IMPERIAL MOMENT from just outside, took over when allowed with three furlongs to go, moved clear on the second bend, drifted out
some midstretch, was put to urging at that point and kept to a drive until near the wire. IMPERIAL MOMENT displayed early speed from inside rivals, was
overtaken into the second turn, swung outside WILD FOX entering the stretch, battled inside COMFORT ME NOW for the place and edged ahead for the
place inside the final eighth. COMFORT ME NOW forwardly placed from outside, was three wide on the second turn, fanned out further into the lane, edged
ahead for second upper stretch but could not sustain his bid in the late going. MEMORY BANK showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SHOBIZ STAR was quickly clear, showed the way in hand, was asked with two furlongs left, lengthened command under a drive upper stretch and was kept
to urging until the final forty yards. JOHNNY LONGBOAT rated from inside, progressed along the rail on the second turn, came into contention upper
stretch, took over second inside the last furlong then could only pull away for the place late. CHERNYAHOVSKIY was sent to prompt the pace outside
SHOBIZ STAR, could not keep up with that one when set down for the drive, gradually yielded narrowly held third under steady handling. DRAW THE LINE
chased from outside, was three then four wide taking the second bend, angled in two wide midstretch and finished evenly. TOCCETIVE JAC moved to the
inside on the backstretch, saved ground taking the second turn, lost ground moving out widest at the top of the lane and showed a willingness to run late.
LONG STATION chased from between horses, retreated some two wide on the second turn, took the rail in the stretch, closed the gap some on the second
flight but leveled off deep stretch.

Footnotes
W W CRAZY gradually progressed from outside, circled rivals three wide on the second turn, took the advantage inside the final sixteenth and shook off
SHANGHAI POINT in the waning yards. TWO WORLDS moved up to contention from inside on the backstretch, came off the rail with a half mile to go,
gradually angled out through the second bend, lost ground floating out to path five entering the lane, made a strong move the last furlong and got up at the
wire to share second with SHANGHAI POINT. The latter broke on top, showed the way in hand between rivals, took the rail on the second turn, floated out
some for the drive and slowly wore down deep stretch. MKAR THE FAST pressed from between horses, fanned out behind W W CRAZY into the stretch,
altered outside that one with a furlong to go and lacked a late bid. FULL MAGAZINE vied for the lead from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the
second turn and wore down the final eighth. WILDWOOD SICILIAN was prominent between horses for five furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
ASTOROTH kept close toward the outside, responded when put to a drive and circled rivals widest on the bend, came four wide into the lane, edged ahead
inside the final sixteenth and just lasted. SOME DUDE without early speed from inside, progressed between rivals on the turn, came into the lane behind
ASTOROTH, altered to the outside upper stretch, made a strong move inside the last furlong but was a bit too late. EVIDENCE bumped with COPPER
CROSSING at the break, quickly recovered, advanced between horses to vie for the lead with four furlongs to go, was three wide on the turn, angled in
leaving the bend, drew clear under a drive upper stretch but slowly wore down inside the final eighth. MUNCH prominent between horses early, did not keep
up along the rail on the bend, came into the stretch just off the inside, rallied belatedly deep stretch but proved easily best of the others. COPPER
CROSSING bumped with EVIDENCE at the start, chased just off the inside, angled out through the turn, came five wide into the lane and passed outside
tired ones the final furlong. TSALI broke on top, was soon in the second flight from outside, went for the lead outside EVIDENCE on the bend then gave way
from between horses through the stretch. A BIG A BAD BILL raced in contention just off the inside on the backstretch but faded along he rail before finishing
three furlongs. HE'S A FINE MAN was sent to contest the pace between rivals but began to tire on the turn. TEARS ON A RIVER was hustled vigorously
leaving the gate, was boxed in from between horses and looking for room behind the early leaders then gave way four wide on the bend.
