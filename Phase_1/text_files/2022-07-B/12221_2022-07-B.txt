Footnotes
BLAZING SEVENS broke in and bumped solidly with a foe, recovered to chase the pace on the outside, went around the turn in the four then three path,
gained under a left-handed crop into the stretch, was pulled in by the rider to elicit a lead change inside the three-sixteenths, swapped to the proper lead at
that point, gained the advantage under a continued left-handed crop at the furlong marker, moved clear outside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up in the
final sixteenth while much the best. BOURBON BASH bumped with a rival at the start, quickly sped clear, controlled the action in the two path around the
turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop under threat in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong then moved out
and proved no match for the winner but was clear for the place. UPGRADE hesitated at the start and broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, went
four wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and earned the show while no match for the top two. FAITHFUL AND TRUE broke a step
slow, moved out early then settled off the pace, was urged three wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response. BAT FLIP was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved to the far outside early, lugged out badly while going from the six to the eighth
path around the turn and failed to threaten. NO CONFESSION bumped solidly with a rival at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back
while three then two wide around the turn and came up empty. SAINT IN THE CITY bumped with a foe at the start, chased the pace on the inside, dropped
back into the turn, saved ground around that bend and retreated. WASABI BOY was bumped soundly on both sides at the start, raced on the outside under
urging, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
AMPERSAND broke out at the start bumping STUD PUPPY into ONCE A GIANT, then got bumped between foes when that outside presence ricocheted
back inwards and bumped with ICON, who was slightly coming outwards, raced two then three wide through the first turn before tipping four to five paths off
the inside down the backstretch, advanced in tandem with ONCE A GIANT to overthrow the top pair five and a half furlongs from home and dueled into the
far turn taking command near the seven-sixteenths, shook off that rival coaxed along and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a
drive to prevail. AMEDEUS MUSIC five then four wide through the first turn, tucked to the rail until tipped three wide six furlongs from home, came under
coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild bid to improve
position for the place honors. ICON broke out at the start bumping and leaning on AMPERSAND and pinching that foe back in tandem with STUD PUPPY
against pressure outside from ONCE A GIANT, saved ground through the first turn and then chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and kept on to secure the show honors. ONCE A GIANT broke in at the start bumping STUD PUPPY into
AMPERSAND and pinching that pair of foes back against pressure inside from the aforementioned foe, chased along the inside through the first turn
forwardly placed, tipped three wide into the backstretch and advanced suddenly in concert with AMPERSAND to overhaul the top dueling pair taking over
narrow command five and a half furlongs from home, knocked heads with his rival getting overtaken with seven-sixteenths to run, got shaken off at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. MR. FIDGET chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, made no impact. LORD BROWNIE dueled along the inside briefly with ALITE to his outside, got overhauled in tandem with his brief pace
rival with five and a half furlongs remaining, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and faltered.
ALITE dueled from the two path briefly with the aforementioned foe until overhauled as a pair five and a half furlongs from home, chased just off the inside
under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and folded. STUD PUPPY got bumped between foes at the start when
AMPERSAND broke outwards, then got bumped again between foes and squeezed out due to pressure outside from ONCE A GIANT and inside from
ICON, tipped out and went three then four wide through the first turn before growing detached when sluggish at the tail of the field three wide down the
backstretch, continued just off the inside through the far turn well behind the rest and trailed throughout, cantering home to the finish.

DOCTOR LOVE was away awkwardly and towards the rear of the field, settled in fourth position under coaxing while well behind the three-way pace
dispute, went four wide around most of the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, moved to five wide late on that bend, swept by the leading trio into upper
stretch, kicked clear under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, was put to a hand-ride into the final furlong, had the rider reach down and adjust
his right iron just inside the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. GOT THE GOLD broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was urged
four wide around most of the turn then moved to the five path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved position to secure the place.
MOONSHININGBRIGHT was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three to four path around the turn, dropped
back in upper stretch and tired while able to hold the show. TACO BEAN was hustled from the gate, contested the pace between horses, vied in the two
path while still between rivals on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and also tired. RAW COURAGE stumbled badly at the start and was off slow,
spotted the front several lengths, was urged along at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. POWER AGENDA was hustled from
the break, disputed the pace on the inside of two opponents, vied along the rail while still inside those foes on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch,
wandered about at the furlong marker and capitulated. CAJUN COMMANDER broke out at the start, was urged along while well off the pace, went three
wide around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CLAIRIERE broke very fast, was allowed to drop to the rear of the field then angled in entering the first turn, raced inside to the two path around that bend,
was rated at the back, moved closer outside the half-mile pole, drafted in the two path while pocketed between horses around the far turn, tried to move out
at the five-sixteenths then bumped with MALATHAAT while kept in by that foe, checked off the heels of the leader shortly thereafter, espied an inside
opening when EXOTIC WEST dropped back coming to the quarter-pole, moved to the rail and cut the corner into the stretch, made a rail bid at the
three-sixteenths, took the lead inside of two foes into the final furlong, battled with MALATHAAT into the final sixteenth and proved best under good
handling. MALATHAAT was coaxed from the gate to establish early position, went three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, stalked three wide
early on the far turn, was asked while keeping CLARIERE in at the three-eighths, bumped with that foe at the five-sixteenths, had the rider reach down and
adjust his left iron inside the quarter-pole, made an outside bid under a drive in upper stretch, battled outside of two foes into the final furlong, fought with the
winner to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the place. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead
at the nine-sixteenths, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, came under a drive while challenged on both sides in
upper stretch, lost the lead between horses into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened but was far clear for third money.
EXOTIC WEST was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead at the nine-sixteenths, vied along the rail on the far turn, was asked
with three furlongs to run, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and faded.

KALING hustled from the gate, showed the way along the inside early on before being displaced from the front near the nine-sixteenths by RARIFY, settled
in pursuit of that rival along the rail through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
just inside the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive to prevail. RARIFY hustled from the gate, raced three wide and tucked to the two path
bumping VAHVA into TAKE CHARGE BRIANA before advancing to take over command loosely between foes at the nine-sixteenths, showed the way
through the turn just off the inside, swung four then three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, lugged in to the two path straightened away under
threat and was collared just inside the three-sixteenths, then ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. RANDOMIZED hustled from the start,
chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened while able to preserve the show honors. TAKE
CHARGE BRIANA got bumped after the start by VAHVA due to pressure from RARIFY tucking inwards, chased just off the inside until briefly tucked inside
at the seven-sixteenths, tipped out to the four path at the three-eighths put to coaxing, went seven wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the
wire. VAHVA got bumped after the start by RARIFY tucking inwards and in turn bumped the aforementioned foe, chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, shied in when shown a right handed crop straightened away and made no impact. WATCH
THIS MUNNY broke in under hustling from the start, chased along the inside coaxed along from the get go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
SWIFTSURE established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under steadily increased
pressure from TOTALIZER to the outside and was placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, had that rival latch on outside and spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, shook off his main danger at the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. TOTALIZER three then two wide in closest aim of
the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and steadily whittled away at the leader bidding to latch on swinging three to four wide into upper
stretch, got shaken off straightened away and kept on to secure the place honors. GOOD CULTURE broke out at the start bumping EMERALD EXPRESS,
chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and improved position to secure the show honors. PICO D'ORO
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, tired. EMERALD EXPRESS bumped at the start by GOOD
CULTURE, who broke outwards, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and faltered. Please
note due to a technical error the three-quarter split was hand timed.

Footnotes
NOTA BENE dropped back under urging after the start then settled off the pace, moved closer while inside on the turn, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole
then dropped in and was asked when given a clear opening into upper stretch, came through to make an inside bid at the furlong marker, inched away into
the final sixteenth and was eased up late while best. TUSCAN QUEEN tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the turn,
made a bid outside the quarter-pole, was carried five wide into the stretch, battled outside of foes into the final furlong, fought with the winner to near the
sixteenth-pole then was outfinished but willingly earned the place. A LITTLE FAITH bobbled outward one stride from the gate, was well placed just off the
pace, drafted inside early on the turn, tipped to the two path while asked at the five-sixteenths, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, was carried four wide at
the quarter-pole, battled between foes under a drive in into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked but secured the show.
OSIRIA was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked while spinning three wide into the
stretch, lost the advantage under a drive before the furlong marker, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. CAIRONI had her head turned at
the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. BLAZING STAR (GB)
brushed with BOXING DAY at the start, brushed with that opponent again early, was rated under a snug hold, moved from two to four wide while roused on
the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders under the crop into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. BOXING DAY brushed
with BLAZING STAR at the start, brushed again with that foe early then was in tight, settled towards the back, was asked while moving from three to five
wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. NEON SUMMER pressed the pace on the outside, chased two then three wide on the
turn, dropped back quickly late on that bend and stopped then was eased before being vanned off after pulling up on the far turn.

under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide for home, tipped to the four path as rivals inside shifted and rallied to issue a threat through the
final sixteenth running on willingly but was ultimately staved off. GOOD MEDICINE saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. DRAKON showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, weakened in the late stages. SMOKE AND
