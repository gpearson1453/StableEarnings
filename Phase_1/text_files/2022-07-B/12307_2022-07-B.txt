Footnotes
PLAY ACTION PASS set a soft pace, responded readily when let loose and kicked away from a pressing foe entering the lane, then was wrapped up
through the final furlong while pulling further clear. ICE BLAST was a bit crowded among foes in the opening furlong while unable to achieve forward
positioning, raced at the rear while tracking two wide and between horses, tipped three wide entering the lane, chased the drawing away leader while in
pursuit of RED RUN for place, ranged up to that foe approaching the final sixteenth, and reached that position nearing the wire. RED RUN stalked outside of
the clear leader while not applying pressure down the backstretch, inched closer to do so into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart
entering the lane, met ICE BLAST's outer bid for place entering the final sixteenth, and got bested late. AMERICAN HERO tracked along the inside, but
required urging to keep pace around the far turn, and lacked a bid. PINEDALE tracked three wide, but tired in the four path around the far turn.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BLAZE stalked two wide, tipped outside of the top pair nearing the turn, swept past them with a quick blitz at the five sixteenths pole, drew off
turning for home, widened under moderate urging through midstretch as chasing rivals tired, and was ridden out. DREAMFACTOR prompted the pace two
wide, but was swiftly outkicked by an outer rival while vying at the five sixteenths pole, maintained place turning for home, then changed to his right lead at
the furlong grounds, and held that position late. MIDNIGHT DREAMING chased three wide, but failed to sustain track position in the the opening stages,
took the turn three wide while near the rear, yet stayed on outside of foes through the lane, but missed reeling in a tiring rival for place. HUASTECO set the
pace inside of a pressing rival, but yielded to that foe and an outer surging rival at the five sixteenths pole. TOP NOTE chased along the inside, but faded at
the three furlong pole. CONNECT ME broke outwardly, raced off of the pace two wide and from between horses around the turn, and made little impact.
NOBLE CONNECTION broke a step slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, but was outrun and eased through the final furlong.

PRIVATE CREED stalked the top pair from the three path, ranged up to them entering the lane, kicked past approaching the furlong grounds, drew clear
leaving that station, and held safely from a rallying rival through the closing stages. SIX MISSIONS broke a bit slowly before subtly shying from an inner
rival, raced off of the pace in the three path around the turn before fanning to the five path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes to claim place
entering the final sixteenth, then narrowed the gap on the clear leader late. URGENT FURY chased along the inside, failed to match gaining strides with an
outer foe turning for home, tipped to the four path in upper stretch as an outer SIX MISSIONS rallied alongside, and stayed on between horses, but was
outkicked for place at the sixteenth pole. IRONSIDES prompted the pace two wide, vied between horses entering the lane, but was outkicked by his outer
counterpart in upper stretch, and tired. GOLDEN REIGN set the pace inside of a pressing foe, then gave way once inside of a pair of foes in upper stretch.
THE BOOKKEEPER broke a step slowly while mildly shying from an inner foe at the start, and was outrun. FITZEA saved ground off of the pace, but to no
avail.

MR SIPPI broke half a beat slowly, trailed the field four wide into the turn, rallied outside of rivals turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, then
sparred with a pair of inner foes through upper stretch, gained an advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged ahead in the final sixteenth. SILK TRADE
prompted the pace four wide, then three wide at the three furlong pole, bid for the lead nearing the lane along with an outer MR SIPPI, dueled between that
foe and an inner game COMISKEY PARK well into the final furlong, but failed to match strides with his outer counterpart in the late stages. COMISKEY
PARK vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses entering the lane as a pair of outer rivals made bids, gamely resisted those foes through upper
stretch, battled into the final furlong, but gave in leaving the sixteenth pole. LET MY PEOPLE GO raced forwardly placed three wide and between horses
into the turn, tucked two wide at the three furlong pole, chased the leading trio through upper stretch, dove inside of them at the furlong grounds, but lacked
a rail kick to produce a bid. LAMUTANAATTY vied for the lead along the inside, but weakened while inside of a trio of foes passing the quarter pole. FLINT
RIDGE tracked two wide and between horses, backed out from tight quarters entering the turn, trailed soon after, and made little impact.
LIVINGONTULSATIME stalked along the inside, then faded turning for home.

Footnotes
DYNABLUE tracked along the inside, allowed outer foes to make early moves down the backstretch, emerged inside of foes turning for home to claim place
in pursuit of the clear leader, took aim outside of that one in upper stretch, inched closer while hanging on his left lead to bid at the sixteenth pole, and
edged an advantage. BULLSEYE BUN set the pace along the inside while well in hand with his ears pricked around the first turn, dictated terms while
meeting light pressure from a group of outer foes approaching the far turn, easily shook free of them at the three furlong pole, remained confident entering
the lane, but was shaken up approaching midstretch as an outer DYNABLUE pursued, met that foe's bid at the sixteenth pole, and gave in late. ABSAM
settled off of the pace along the inside, awaited racing room in the three path around the far turn, rallied four wide entering the lane, then chased the top pair
home while mildly cutting the gap on his left lead. PROTONIC POWER trailed, took the far turn in the four path, altered course five wide at the furlong
grounds, and improved. HIGHESTDISTINCTION tracked two wide, moved forward to press three wide and between horses at the half mile pole after outer
rivals made middle moves, then tired on his left lead through the lane. CRIMINAL DEFENSE laid in midpack in the three path, moved early while four wide
and between horses to press nearing the half mile pole, but faded while floating five wide turning for home. PALACE KITTEN stalked two wide, but
weakened between horses at the quarter pole. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) broke a step slowly and settled off of the pace in the four path, gained five wide down
the backstretch to press nearing the far turn, but chased entering that bend, and caved six wide turning for home.

MORE THAN VOWS broke outwardly, set the pace in the two path, shook away from chasing foes in upper stretch, and held sway. BEAUTIFUL
FAREWELL tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, got floated six wide entering the lane, rallied to vie for place in the closing stages, and
prevailed narrowly at the wire. AMARYLLIS KISS lunged outwardly at the start, tracked three wide while in the four path around the turn, attempted a bid for
the lead outside of MORE THAN VOWS passing the quarter pole, but leveled off and failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, met BEAUTIFUL
FAREWELL's challenge for place in the closing stages, and got nailed at the wire. MISSED OPPORTUNITY raced off of the pace in the two path, shifted out
while moving up through traffic turning for home, swung to the five path entering the lane, but lacked a rally between horses. CANDY ISLAND stalked along
the inside, but only managed to chase before fading the final furlong. DREAMALOT raced at the rear two wide and between horses, tipped four wide in
upper stretch, and moved up. JAG WARRIOR saved ground at the rear, then split foes two wide under light urging in the final furlong.
LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD broke a step slowly, trailed three wide, and raced greenly while outrun through the lane. CAMI CAT was floated outwardly at the
start, pressed that foe from the outside, but weakened between horses nearing the lane. SAVE GRACE was also floated outwardly at the start, raced in
midpack in the five path while outside of foes, and weakened while drifting out turning for home.

Footnotes
ANGLOPHILE stalked the run-away leader from the two path, bid outside of that foe entering the lane, drew clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway.
SALUTE THE STARS broke a step slow while bumping an outer rival, then was sandwiched between horses as inner foes shifted out, raced far back two to
three wide, swung six wide while picking up stride entering the lane, rallied to reach place at the sixteenth pole, and was gaining on the clear leader late.
PADDOCK BOSS broke a step slowly, raced far back three wide, then stayed on between horses in midstretch. HEZMORETHANREADY lunged out at the
start, then came out many paths while interfering with a handful of rivals, ran off around the first turn to a wide advantage, came back to the field around the
far turn, briefly resisted ANGLOPHILE's bid in upper stretch, but weakened a sixteenth out. SOLOMON VANDY bumped with an inner foe multiple times at
the start, tracked two wide, tipped four wide down the backstretch, inched closer to bid turning for home, but was outmoved by an inner foe entering the
lane, hung on his left lead in upper stretch, and faltered between horses in the final furlong. DRAMA CRITIC was forced outwardly and solidly bumped on
both sides at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide down the backstretch, tipped five wide in upper stretch, but offered no rally.
DETECTIVE STEPHAN was slammed between horses at the start, trailed, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and moved up. REDEEMER broke inwardly,
tracked along the inside while saving ground, but tired. AUGUSTUS BLUE stalked in the three path, then from between horses around the far turn, but tired.
LED TASSO raced in midpack three wide, but lacked a response to urging in the five path around the far turn, then was eased through the lane. DUE TO A
TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE SEVEN FURLONG FRACTION WAS COLLECTED BY HAND.

Footnotes
QUEENS UP subtly shied from an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped two wide turning for home, then took aim inside of the leading pair
in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. LADY DEMAREE vied for the lead two wide and between horses, forged an advantage at the
half mile pole, fended off his outer counterpart through upper stretch, but offered little resistance to QUEENS UP's rail challenge leaving the furlong
grounds. SONADOR hopped slightly at the start, trailed the field into the turn, improved four wide entering the lane, and stayed on. COMEDY ACT prompted
the pace three wide, vied around the turn, but tired approaching the furlong grounds. SOCIAL MANDATE brushed the outer part of the gate at the start,
settled off of the pace in the two path, but failed to factor. TAIGA lunged outwardly while losing his balance at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path,
and made little impact. SOLAR REIGN set the pace inside of a pair of pressing foes down the backstretch, but was headed by them at the half mile pole,
and weakened leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
BEL ARIA vied two wide and between horses early on, backed off to stalk entering the backstretch, took aim outside of the leader turning for home, bid
along with an outer HUSH HUSH approaching the furlong grounds, and prevailed over that foe late. HUSH HUSH settled off of the pace three to two wide,
tracked in the four path into the far turn, rallied turning for home to bid at the furlong grounds along with an inner BEL ARIA, but was turned away. NO
COMMENT settled far back along the inside, swung from the two path to the five path for clear sailing entering the lane, and stayed on. MAYSVILLE MISS
vied for the lead three wide before clearing entering the backstretch, showed the way around the far turn, but weakened inside of a pair of bidders at the
furlong grounds. MADRE DI GRANDEZZA saved ground off of the pace, improved to a stalking position turning for home, but faded through the final
furlong. DILMUNIA trailed two wide, raced far back in the four path around the far turn, and failed to factor. SURE WASN'T ME tracked in the two path,
chased between horses around the far turn, but lacked a bid. BRIE'S LIL' BIT never got involved. SILK ADIEUX laid off of the pace, took the far turn in the
five path, and tired. SENORITA KARLITA vied inside of a pair of foes early on, stalked two wide down the backstretch, but wilted through the field turning for
home.
