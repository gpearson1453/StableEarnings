EVIL TEMPTATION was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with BROADWAY ROMANCE, disposed of that rival before going a half and
was ridden out to be kept to task. BROADWAY ROMANCE broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide, could not match strides
with that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. MS. LEA lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
BEACH BODY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. TRICKING TRIXIE settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. FRENCHGIRL was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was
eased through the lane.
