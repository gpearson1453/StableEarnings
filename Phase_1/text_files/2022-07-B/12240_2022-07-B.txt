Footnotes
VILLAREGGIA rated from the four path, loomed three wide while under a slight nudge at the top of the lane, took over the lead passing the three sixteenths
pole and drew clear. TRULY A DREAM stalked from inside, saved ground around the turn, made a bid while staying inside at the top of the lane, but
finished evenly late to place. NOBLE PRESENT set the pace from the three path, was coaxed between foes coming into the stretch, but flattened to show.
FIVE K KITTEN tracked from the three path, but faded at the top of the lane. LIKES was never involved.

Footnotes
CHICA BOOM raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and
gained ground on the outside to pull clear late. SUNNYMEDE DREAM chased the leader from the three path through the opening half mile, moved up to
challenge from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled outside in upper stretch, was caught late and chased the winner to the wire.
FEARLESS KITTEN saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the two and three path and gained ground late. DANNYHILL raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace up the backstretch, took
over the lead while saving ground around the far turn and gave way with a furlong to go. HAPPYLIFE `saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in
the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and came up empty in the lane.
SOME NIGHTS showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing on the rail around the far
turn and tired further from there.

Footnotes
MOVE IT BABY led throughout, was cued from the two path into the stretch, and held on gamely. TIKI BAR stalked from the five path, was driven from the
four path into the stretch, and ran on for place. ZITA OF BOURBON was unhurried and inside, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and rallied
late for show. SILENT SWINGER chased from the three path, was coaxed while saving ground around the turn, but finished evenly. MISS GRAND SLAM
trailed off the rail, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, and improved position. LUCIDITY raced in midpack from the two path, was roused from
inside at the top of the lane, but faded. UNLEASH THE SPIRIT rated from inside but was empty at the top of the stretch. GULF BENDER prompted the pace
from the three path, but blew the turn and was no longer a threat.

Footnotes

approaching the quarter pole, dueled down the lane and edged clear late. STEPSTONES showed the way while racing inside around the first turn and up
the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far turn and in the stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth of a mile. SUWANNEE CHICK saved ground
around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and gained ground late to the wire.
LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS saved ground at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid
entering the stretch and improved position on the inside in the final furlong. MAGNOLIA ROAD raced off the pace in the two path in the early going,
navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide into the stretch and passed tiring horses on the outside from there. BRINGTHEWINE trailed the field
while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the two path coming around the far turn and finished evenly between
horses. COME WHAT MAE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, came around the far turn in
the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there. SUPERSNAKE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening
stages, continued around the far turn in the three path and made no bid. PETITE ROUGE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the second bend and flattened out in the lane. HOLLYWOOD HONEY chased the
leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back coming around the far turn, tired in the lane, raced into tight

Footnotes
BARAHIN raced in midpack from the four path, made a bid while four wide rounding the far turn, led passing the eighth pole and held on. ONE LUCKY DAY
stalked between foes, tipped into the three path at the top of the stretch, and rallied for place. CRAZY ODDS set the pace, was cued inside at the top of the
lane, yielded grudgingly late to show. AZURE SKY bumped with the outside horse at the break, trailed, swung into the five path at the top of the lane, and
improved between in the stretch. TAPIT BRIO pressed two wide but faded into the stretch. VIRGINIA FULLA chased inside under a nudge, saved ground
rounding the far turn, but was empty. SONGWRITER brushed with the outside horse leaving the gate, tracked inside, steadied slightly at the end of the far
turn, but was tired. STRATFORD was well back in the three path and was no factor. VOLTE FACE rated between foes but was no threat.

Footnotes
COLONIST rated two wide, was three wide around the far turn, floated into the six path in upper stretch, and just got up in the final strides to win.
ROHRBACHER set the pace from inside, was cued from the three path at the top of the stretch, but was nipped at the wire to place. TIL THE END tracked
inside, saved ground under a drive rounding the far turn, and ran on for show. MYSTERY BANK stalked from the two path, was ridden two wide around the
far turn, tipped into the four path in upper stretch, but finished evenly. SPINNING KITTEN pressed while two wide but flattened coming into the stretch.
BASSETT raced well back in the two path and was no threat. SONDE ST BLUES was hard held and taken back to trail, was very wide heading into the
stretch and was no threat. ZONIC raced in midpack from inside but backed out around the turn.

Footnotes
LONTANO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a four wide bid coming around the turn, gained ground on the outside
and pulled clear. BALISTICO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path, started a bid passing the quarter pole
and gained ground on the outside to the wire. BATTLEBUS bumped lightly with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the inside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. COOP TRIES HARDER chased the leaders between horses through the opening
quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and raced evenly to the wire. RULING FRONT bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and faded between horses in the lane. MOTATAABEQ was bumped
and squeezed back at the break, raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was empty from there. CALL ME HANDSOME
pressed the pace on the outside early, raced in the three path around the turn, gave way entering the stretch, tired quickly and was vanned off after being
pulled up on the backstretch. PARISHIONER dropped back to trail far behind the field after a quarter of a mile had been run, saved ground around the turn
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PEAT MOSS (IRE) chased the leader through the opening mile and a half, began a bid coming around the final turn and pulled clear on the outside with a
furlong to go. BELLA COOLA led the field the first time around the oval, continued to show the way on the second lap, was caught at the head of the stretch
and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. MOJAVE (GB) raced off the pace in the early going, began a challenge racing up the backstretch for the
second time and was outkicked in the lane. SEB'S WELCOME (FR) raced in the middle of the pack between horses and finished evenly. MAKE A STAND
trailed the field in the early going, raced at the back of the pack through the next mile and gained ground mildly in the stretch. CRITICIZE raced outside in
the middle of the pack in the opening stages, moved up to challenge approaching the third turn and flattened out in the lane. BOLD QUEST raced outside in
the middle of the pack through the opening mile and faded from there. CUP OF AIKEN tracked the leader on the inside through the first lap, began to drop
back after running a mile and continued to tire. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
