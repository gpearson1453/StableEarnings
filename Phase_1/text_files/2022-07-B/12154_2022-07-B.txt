Footnotes
CHATTY GAL prompted the early pace, gained the lead then opened up when give cue and was geared down late. BLUSHING BROOKE tracked the
pacesetters from between foes, raced evenly through the stretch and inched clear of CAN'T TOUCH THIS late to earn place. CAN'T TOUCH THIS set the
early pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and was wore down late. TEMPLE OF ZOOM chased four to five wide through the backstretch,
and passed tiring foe late. BLACKBERRY LISA stalked inside, and lacked the kick needed. ENTITLED STAR sat in range outside and failed to threaten.

SEA SPLENDOR allowed to settle inside, drove four wide on the final turn, and won driving. COUNTRIFIED bumped leaving, trailed the field, advanced
quickly inside in the final turn, lacked running room in traffic at the head of the stretch, split rivals and was outkicked. SPOT ON DUDE broke outward into
COUNTRIFIED, crossed over quickly into the opening turn, showed the way through the backstretch, was under attacked at the head of the stretch, and
flattened late stretch. WILDCAT WILLY raced four wide into the opening turn, chased into the lane and lacked a response late. H K MELODY reserved off
the early pacesetter, and came up empty in the drive. SNAP COUNT was in tight then clipped heels with SPOT ON DUDE in the opening turn, stalked the

**JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SNAP COUNT against the rider of SPOT ON DUDE alleging interference into the first turn was
upheld. SPOT ON DUDE was disqualified and placed last for interference to SNAP COUNT.

ROYAL STATUS quickly went to the front then led the field through the backstretch, responded to threat into the lane, and held. GO MAMA sat mid pack,
waited for running room in the final turn, bid three wide into the lane, was gaining late and was up for place. MI REYNA sat off the pace from the four path,
moved up menacingly near the quarter pole but lacked the rally needed and just held on for show. ORANGE THEORY saved ground inside, was asked to
quicken in the final turn, but was unable to improve position through drive. EXACTLY sat in range from the four path, chased through the stretch but came
up empty. SANGRIA fanned three wide into the first turn, chased outside into the lane, and gave way late. BABS DELIGHT trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET BOBBY took the lead early from between foes, took pressure inside of DUNE D'ORO leaving the backstretch, turned back challenge from
WALKTHELINE and edged clear. HARD TO COME HOME stalked pace from the five path under a snug hold early, urged on while outside in the final turn,
was kept under encouragement and got by late for second. WEDGE POND saved ground inside, shifted off the rail coming off the final turn, and rallied
belatedly. WALKTHELINE stalked the pace while three wide, dropped back through the far turn, lodged a rail bid into the stretch then was steadied to avoid
BACKSTREET BOBBY, and was edged out. ETU BABOU was gapped early, and closed steadily outside late. DUNE D'ORO contended the early pace
outside of BACKSTREET BOBBY, was unable to move on with the fore mentioned, and yielded. CATS TOUCH raced a back of the pack, and lodged a late
mild bid. RAILWAY stalked wide through the backstretch and flattened. MAKE'N TRACKS never reached contention. *STEWARDS INQUIRY- The
Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving BACKSTREET BOBBY and WALKTHELINE. *JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by
the rider of WALKTHELINE against the rider of BACKSTREET BOBBY alleging interference into the stretch run was upheld. BACKSTREET BOBBY was
disqualified and placed fourth for interference to WALKTHELINE.

Footnotes
SAVYSKYE was quick to begin to set the early pace, turned back challenge from NO MORE RINGS, was kept under steady handling through the stretch
and stayed clear. VALENTINO ROSSA raced wide through the backstretch, drifted in at the head of the lane, and improved under mild handling. NO MORE
RINGS stalked five wide early, moved up alongside SAVYSKYE nearing the quarter pole then drifted wide off the final turn, kept on evenly under
encouragement and held show. LASKA raced at the back of the pack, and offered a late mild bid. SARASOTA SALSA lacked early speed, bid inside then
angled out sharply to the three path, and passed tiring rival late. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL tracked inside, and came up empty in drive. LULABELLE hustled
away, and was outrun. SOLANA stalked the pace while three wide, and was done early.

Footnotes
NORTHERN DREAMIN moved to the rail quickly leaving the chute, saved ground while showing the way, responded to looming threat from QUINTO SOL,
and held under pressure through the drive. QUINTO SOL settled outside well off the pace, took closer order in the far turn, kept pressure on leader through
the stretch and missed. BODEMONSTER saved in second flight, advanced four wide in the final turn, and bid evenly through stretch. WYE CROSS settled
on rail and lacked kick needed. BUCK WEST hurried away, chased into the lane, and passed tiring rival late. ROLL THE STONE raced in closest pursuit,
dropped back and faded through stretch. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART lacked serious bid. FULL VELOCITY was not a factor. PHANTOM MAC settled three
wide early then had no response when called and tired.

DAZZLING CHIC unhurried away, rallied outside bumping CONVINCE, closed determinedly and got up in the last yards, won driving. KISSABLE U vied
outside for the early lead, moved up alongside MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER to contest the lead, edged clear late and was nipped at the wire.
MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER contested the early pace, dueled inside of KISSABLE U, and weakened late stretch. JODEAN reserved early, drifted out in the
final turn, bumped into CONVINCE at the head of the stretch, and rallied belatedly. LUCY TREASURE chased outside leaving the backstretch, gained
closer order and lacked a closing response. LETS GO ALL THEWAY trailed the field early, angled to rail sharply, and finished with good energy.
CONVINCE angled to the three path leaving the backstretch, carried wide at the quarter pole, then was squeezed out at the eighth marker and yielded.
WHEELSUPINTHIRTY sat in striking distance while five wide, angled in to the two path into the far turn, and chased to no avail through stretch. FAIRY
BARB tracked inside, and failed to threaten in drive. *JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of CONVINCE against the rider of both
JODEAN and DAZZLING CHIC alleging interference near the eighth pole was not allowed and no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
THE RIVER GREY vied for the early lead outside of LIL MISS MUD, gained a short lead in the far turn, opened up through the stretch under a strong hand
ride to an handy victory. PERPETUAL BLISS hurried away, swung out at the head of the lane, gained steadily outside but was no match for the winner and
finished clear second best. LIL MISS MUD was outsprinted to the turn, chased the leader into the stretch, and flattened out. TAKE ME TO BATTLE stalked
four wide, chased through the stretch, and improve position in stretch. HIGHKELLLY SUE unhurried early, and bid belatedly. SMOKEDYA stalked from rail,
and lacked a kick. ZHAVIA advanced outside in the final turn, and showed a mild interest late. PEARLS AND CURLS sat mid pack and failed to produce a
bid. BLANCA chased and never reached contention. BAMBITO chased five wide in the backstretch and had nothing left in reserve.
