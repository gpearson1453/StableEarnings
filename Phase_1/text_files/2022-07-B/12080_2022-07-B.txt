Footnotes
PRINCESS PAYTON was reserved off the dueling leaders, moved forward on the turn, angled out three-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
with a rush to be up in the final strides. NANA'S ANGELS dueled with Miss Bella for the lead from along the inside, shook that one off entering the stretch
and just failed to last. GOLD COAST GIRL saved ground while being unhurried, slipped through during the drive and finished fast. TOE DANCER dwelt at
the start to get away well behind her field, then raced four-wide and finished willingly. MISS BELLA vied for the lead to the stretch from along the outside
and tired. MARIA KNOWS was outrun while racing three-wide.

Footnotes
ASK ALICE saved ground stalking the pace, angled out two-wide entering the stretch, took command nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear.
CHIPPEWA sprinted clear early, saved ground setting the pace, was unable to resist the winner but continued on well for the place. GRAZED N'
CONFUSED was prominent placed from along the outside of Ask Alice, came three-wide into the stretch and finished fairly well. ILA VEIW TOO was
unhurried early and finished in a mild rally while racing along the inside. YOGYA was in tight early racing along the inside, dropped back and angled out to
be four-wide and found her best stride too late. SPARKLES AND SPURS was allowed to settle early, came three-wide into the stretch, but lacked a rally.
OUT OF STARS failed to threaten while racing five-wide. DISTINCTIVE DEB gave way after showing brief speed. ISLAND BEAUTY was forwardly placed
early while racing three-wide and tired.

BOOK SMART vied for the lead with Poverty Bay for the lead from the outset and prevailed in a prolonged drive. POVERTY BAY dueled for the lead
throughout from along the inside, could not stay with the winner late but held on gamely for the place. BRANNIGAN was three-wide on the turn, came
five-wide into the stretch and gained some ground late. NAPOLETANO finished in a mild rally while racing two-wide. HICKORY WIND was allowed to settle
in stride while saving ground, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GYPSY GUN saved ground to near the stretch, angled out five-wide and
was not a factor. ALPHABETICAL was forwardly placed early while racing two-wide and tired.

WIREWYRE was allowed to settle in stride while racing along the outside, was five-wide entering the stretch and was up with a rush to win going away. J
C'S A LEGEND dueled for the lead from the outside along the inside, responded to pressure and while unable to resist the winner continued on gamely for
the place. SUPERMAX disputed the pace from between J C's a Legend and Contejas and held on well during the drive for the show. CONTEJAS vied for
the lead into the stretch while racing three-wide and weakened slightly late. SOLDATNA was off a step slow, then saved ground and finished well while
improving his position. KNOCKOUT GUY raced three-wide and lacked a rally. SIX SHOTS OF T bumped at the start with Exit Stage Left, then raced
four-wide and failed to threaten. MY MAN BIGGIE gave way after showing brief speed from between horses. KAHALA dropped back early and failed to
menace. EXIT STAGE LEFT bumped with Six Shots of T at the start, then showed little while racing wide.

UNION BLISS was off a step slow, then was allowed to settle, rallied four-wide the final quarter and was up in the final strides. LOCHNESS stalked the pace
racing three-wide, gained a slight advantage nearing the eighth pole but couldn't quite resist the winner late. MANCUSO AT THE MIC was unhurried early,
saved ground, slipped through during the drive and finished strongly. ROUGH RIDE saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out slightly entering
the stretch and weakened. CAPTAIN DASHI was in tight while racing along the inside, got shuffled back nearing the three-eighths pole, came three-wide
into the stretch and finished willingly. SHAKELAS DESTINY dropped back early and failed to threaten while racing five-wide into the stretch. MOBJACK
prompted the pace for a half mile and tired.

SLACK TIDE vied for the lead with Unsolved Mystery from along the inside, gained command nearing the eighth pole and quickly drew clear. UNSOLVED
MYSTERY set the pressured pace from the outside to near the eighth pole, could not match strides with the winner late but continued on gamely for the
place. GOLD N GLITTER saved ground while being unhurried, improved her position on the turn, angled out inside the eighth pole and finished full of run.
ROPERS N WRANGLERS was allowed to settle in stride, rallied four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. TIZ A MACHO GIRL was bumped at the
start by Zazen, then was unhurried, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KORON was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and
weakened. ZAZEN bobbled at the start and went out to bump Tiz a Macho Girl, then rushed up between horses to reach contention before going a quarter
mile but stopped before going a half mile.

Footnotes
ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE vied for the lead from the start while racing two-wide, responded to pressure during the drive and was all out to prevail narrowly.
EXECUTIVE CHEF was allowed to settle in stride, rallied five-wide final quarter and finished strongly to just miss. A VIEW FROM ABOVE dueled for the
lead throughout from along the inside but wasn't quite good enough in a game effort. LITTLE CASINO prompted the issue to the stretch while racing
three-wide and weakened. MR. MISCHIEF was prominent early, steadied briefly from between horses nearing the half mile pole, then was forwardly placed
but lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT MOJO saved ground while being unhurried early, angled for the drive but failed to seriously threaten. CRYSTAL BANDIT
dropped back early and was not a factor while racing five-wide into the stretch. SMOKEN SHADOW was forwardly placed early, steadied in tight nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, was shuffled back and failed to recover.

Footnotes
MAGGIE FITZGERALD saved ground setting the pace, responded when asked and just lasted while drifting out late. PATRICIA L was allowed to settle in
stride, moved up between horses to launch her bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole while three-wide and finished strongly to just miss. NOOSITA broke out
to bump with Sweet Katie O at the start, then steadied shortly after, moved up along the inside on the turn, came three-wide into the stretch and finished
fast. SHARP CURVE broke in to bump with Sweet Katie O, then was prominent early, steadied from between horses nearing the half mile pole, then saved
ground and finished willingly. EASY DOES IT dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SWEET KATIE O was bumped
from both sides at the start, then rushed up along the inside to prompt the issue to the stretch and tired. CUTETIP was forwardly place early while racing
two-wide, drifted out to be four-wide entering the stretch and tired. A WHOLE LOTTA HULA was prominent early while three-wide, came five-wide into the
stretch and gave way.
