remaining, gained a slim advantage while dueling past the sixteenth marker, exchanged brushes and got the bob. TATE drifted in at the break and brushed
with a rival, settled back off the pace, moved up off the rail leaving the three eighths, ranged up five wide outside rivals to challenge in mid stretch, came in a
bit while battling with the winner, exchanged some brushes and just missed. CONSULTANT , four deep into and around the first turn, dropped in a couple of
paths and edged up near the half mile marker, bid to engage the leader with a quarter to go, dueled inside runners while holding a slim lead past mid stretch
then gave way grudgingly. GREAT IDEA , between runners early, was rated back and angled out nearing the five eighths, advanced three wide approaching
the stretch, shifted four wide soon after, had aim leaving the three sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving the furlong grounds and faded. COSMICALITY vied
outside a runner early then cleared through the backstretch run, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure nearing the lane, stayed on past the three
sixteenths then faded. STIMULUS MAKER , brushed at the break, raced three wide between rivals early, failed to respond. H R H JELLYBEAN lacked
speed, saved ground and dropped back past the five eighths, was under pressure around the final turn, failed to respond and angled out. NEVER
SILENCED vied inside a rival early, chased two wide heading to the half mile marker then retreated.

MET IN MIAMI settled well off the loose leader while saving ground, eased out and split rivals leaving the far turn, angled four wide to progress into the lane,
shifted out wider past the three sixteenths, made a grinding run under strong handling, took over outside POUNDING MUSIC in deep stretch and was going
away at the wire. POUNDING MUSIC , under a snug hold while saving ground, moved up in hand near the half, shifted out from behind rivals with three
eighths to go, rallied four wide into the lane, joined EVANGELINE ALLONS near mid stretch, dueled, led inside the sixteenth marker then gave way
grudgingly. EVANGELINE ALLONS rated three wide early on, took closer order leaving the far turn, moved up to engage the leader into the lane, took a
short lead and dug in when meeting a challenge in mid stretch, sparred inside POUNDING MUSIC to the sixteenth pole then faded. FOXTROT SEVILLE ,
far back early, moved up between runners mid way on the final turn, angled five wide and had a belated gain while not threatening. GIRL'S ON FIRE , two
wide early, edged up leaving the far turn, saved ground with pursuit into the lane but failed to follow through in the final furlong. ROMANTIC COMEDY vied
briefly then opened up, set the pace towards the inside, raced two wide when collared into the lane and gave way. TORRE BRANCA , three wide, failed to
respond. EXTRA CRUNCHY disputed the early pace outside a rival, dropped to chase, checked when trying to lug out nearing the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SASSY BABE had speed to the inside then rated back and eased off the inside, steadily progressed two wide to engage the leader soon into the lane,
dueled and gained a slim lead in mid stretch, kept up the battle past the sixteenth marker then edged clear late under a drive. LA FAMILIA sprinted clear
early, dropped in and set a rated pace, dug in when joined into the lane, dueled inside the winner past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly in deep stretch and
saved the place. SIDNEY SUE , taken to rate off the pace, took closer order while saving ground mid turn, eased out past the quarter pole and rallied
between rivals. ICY REPLY , brushed at the break, edged up and chased between foes, shifted out around the turn then through the drive and churned on
between runners. YIRA , hung out very wide, steadily advanced outside rivals past the furlong grounds and kept on with effort to gain. CHARGINA , well
placed while saving ground, edged up a bit nearing mid stretch but failed to kick on. DEEMED ESSENTIAL , four deep nearing the turn, pursued four wide
outside rivals into the lane, had aim in mid stretch but lacked a serious finish. MAMBA QUEEN , three wide chasing, remained a presence to mid stretch
then faded. IF THEN , off the pace, saved ground into the lane but lacked a bid.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) , sent to the early lead, opened up on the backstretch, drifted out approaching the sixteenth pole and prevailed under brisk urging. PIT
BOSS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and offered a mild rally. FORTUNE'S FOOL , well placed in the two path on the far turn, drifted
out in mid stretch and flattened out. WALK AWAY JOE was outrun. THE STIFF , three wide the first turn, dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
FLIMSY pulled her way clear early and secured the inside, handled pressure while well in hand entering the far turn, shook clear of rivals when let out some
entering the lane, wandered about through the final furlong and held firm while ridden out. NIBBLES , three deep in close attendance, applied more pressure
leaving the far turn, chased into the lane and kept on with good energy to cut back into the gap. LUMINIST , taken wide early on, edged up a bit while
remaining wide into the far turn, circled under pressure and churned. BOURBON SWING forced the pace between rivals, was under a ride chasing past the
three sixteenths but lacked the needed finish. MORETHANASTORM , well placed tracked towards the rail, lacked a bid. EMPIRE MISS , hesitated at the
break and was away last, was within range past the five eighths, failed to kick on into the far turn and retreated.
