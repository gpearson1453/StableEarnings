Footnotes
APPRAISE (IRE) brushed with a rival at the start while coming out in front, chased the leading duo down the backstretch, went around the turn in the three
path, gained the advantage into upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong marker then came under a left-handed crop, dug in gamely when challenged
by the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead inside that pole and held determinedly. INFLATION NATION (IRE) brushed
with a rival at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, went three wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, gained outside under a
left-handed crop, made a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, reached even terms with the winner in the final sixteenth but was denied while well clear for the
place. WICO (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path then
moved out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) was restless in the gate then slow
into stride, spotted the front a couple lengths, was urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch then
moved further out, remained on his inside lead while outside in the drive and failed to rally. DATAMAN stood in the gate when the doors opened and was off
a few lengths behind the front, angled in at the back then was urged along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, shifted four wide into the
stretch, drifted in while remaining on his inside lead near the eighth-pole, continued on his inside lead in the final furlong and was no factor. ALIBI IKE
disputed the pace on the outside through quick fractions, vied in the two to three path while getting some extra left-rein pressure around the turn, dropped
back while shortening stride in upper stretch and tired. CLUBHOUSE bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled to the lead, disputed the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied while moving from the two path to near the rail around the turn, dropped back while shortening stride in upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
IMPULSIVENESS broke inwards coaxed from the gate and bumped GROWTH CAPITAL, raced three wide into the first turn holding narrow command and
tucked to the two path forcing GROWTH CAPITAL to alter in and then steady off his heels seven furlongs from home, showed the way rated along the
inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under challenge for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. INDEMNIFY (FR) tracked the pace along the inside well rated until set down angling five wide into upper
stretch, rallied willingly through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the finish. OGLETHORPE three wide through the first turn, settled under a firm
hold in closest aim of the leader three wide, tucked to the two path placing GROWTH CAPITAL in a bit tight briefly and got bumped askew in the
hindquarters with nine-sixteenths to go when that rival begged to the outside from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths now just off the
inside, spun three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors clear of the rest. THE PRINCE'S SPUR coaxed from the gate, was briefly
taken hold of in behind GROWTH CAPITAL and grew rank spinning three to four paths off the inside into the first turn getting corrected with right taps of the
crop, settled just off the inside at the tail of the compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and
stayed on one paced to the finish. GROWTH CAPITAL bumped at the start by IMPULSIVENESS, was under restraint when in the two path when forced to
alter in and then steady off the heels of IMPULSIVENESS tucking directly in front into the first turn and in turn forced THE PREINCE'S SPUR to tap on the
brakes briefly in behind, tracked just off the inside into the backstretch and had OGLETHORPE lean inwards again having to alter slightly inwards before
deciding to tip out bumping with that rival at the nine-sixteenths and knocking him briefly askew when making contact with his hindquarters, tipped three
wide and went two to three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. CLUBBING broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole,
angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and had no kick.

LASTCHANCEATGLORY went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path, controlled the action around the final turn, spun three into
the stretch then was given his cue under threat from the runner-up coming to the three-sixteenths, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong
marker, disposed of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. PIONEER SPIRIT was hustled from the start, showed
speed inside of the winner on the first turn, was eased back off the pace late on that bend, settled just behind the leader down the backstretch, was asked in
the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive then make a bid inside of the winner under the crop at the three-sixteenths, battled with
that foe into the final furlong then was turned away and outfinished while able to get the place. AMERICAN RULE went around the first turn in the three
path, stalked the pace on the outside, was roused in the three path on the far turn, chased four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two to the wire and
lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. MOUNT TRAVERS was caught four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, chased
four wide around the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and tired. HAMMERIN AAMER saved ground on the first turn, moved off the rail outside
the five-eighths, went two then three wide under urging on the far turn and failed to threaten. LONG TERM THINKING raced between horses in the two path
around the opening bend, settled towards the rear, was roused inside on the far turn and failed to respond. AMOUNT went three wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, was coaxed along late on the backstretch, went three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide at the three-eighths, passed the
five-sixteenths under a strong drive, spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
RHOMBIQUE saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge in concert with MISS BONNIE T to overthrow the leader a sixteenth from home, came in under a right handed crop bumping her main danger
when dueling to the finish seventy yards from home and gamely prevailed to get up at the end. MISS BONNIE T tracked the pace along the inside coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with the aforementioned foe to her outside taking command a
sixteenth from home, then dueled to the finish getting bumped seventy yards out as RHOMBIQUE came in under a right handed crop and was nailed at the
end. WHISKEY LULLABY coaxed from the start, showed the way rated along the inside under attendance from I'M GLAD to the outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under threat from a pair, got collared at
the sixteenth marker and ran on to preserve the show honors. CANDLESTICK MAKER saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish. AWESOME ALLY VEE two to three wide in pursuit, tipped three
then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and offered no rally. REGINA just off the inside tracking the pace from
mid pack, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and tipped three wide, went three to four wide for home and drifted out weakening to the wire. I'M
GLAD (IRE) grew rank under restraint forwardly placed just off the inside into the first turn, settled attending the leader from the outside down the
backstretch, remained on hold until let out swinging three wide into upper stretch, came up empty and tired.

BRICCO settled comfortably on the inside, was roused on the far turn, moved to the two path while gaining late on that bend, rallied to the lead into upper
stretch, remained on his inside lead to just outside the eighth-pole then swapped to the proper lead, responded well under threat in the final furlong and held
under strong urging. FUTURE VICTORY went three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside with cover, bumped with a rival near the three-eighths,
raced three wide on the far turn, moved out inside the three-sixteenths then shifted further out at the eighth-pole, rallied outside in the final furlong and
closed fast but was too late while just able to get the place. CHESS'S DREAM was taken in hand early, pulled keenly on the bit under restraint in the two
path around the first turn, was reserved off the pace, traveled in the two path around the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, moved out in pursuit of the
leader in upper stretch, chased behind that foe into the final sixteenth, found clearance in front late and was gaining at the wire but just missed the place
while able to get the show. BARNEGAT LIGHT went to the front, showed the way on the inside with company to his outside, was asked near the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, kept on well to the wire but was outfinished while able to get a share of fourth. GUSSY
MAC (IRE) broke out and brushed the gate, was a bit keen under restraint into the first turn, tucked into the two path around that bend, was well placed
while rated in third position, tipped out leaving the backstretch, was given his cue in the three then four path on the far turn, chased under a drive in the
stretch and was out-kicked but willingly shared the last spot in the superfecta. SONIC SPEED broke out and brushed the gate, was taken in hand early,
jostled with a foe into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled outside but with cover, was roused while moving from three to five wide around the
far turn, came seven wide into the stretch, raced outside into the final furlong, bumped with a rival outside the sixteenth-pole and gained ground but missed
the superfecta. VOLIERO was hustled from the gate, went three wide through the first turn, settled on the outside with cover, was asked while four then five
wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, came out just inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. GIRL DAD was wrestled
back between foes while in tight early, bumped with a foe into the first turn, saved ground under restraint on that bend, was reserved at the rear, raced
inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved in inside the furlong marker and gained ground but failed to impact. OUR
COUNTRY traveled three wide around the first turn, settled on the outside with cover, went three then four wide on the far turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, came six wide into the stretch, raced inside a foe into the final furlong, bumped with that foe outside the sixteenth-pole, was crowded while
brushing with that one in the late stages and failed to threaten. PRAYER BOOK went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, bumped with
a foe near the three-eighths, rounded the far turn in the two path, dropped to the rail and cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
SPECTATORLESS was hustled from the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two then
three path around the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
RIA'S ANGEL got bumped at the start by SOUTHERN CIVILITY, who broke inwards, tipped out soon after the start to chase two then three wide, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the front taking over command swinging five wide into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive
getting geared down inside the final seventy yards to the wire. DATESFREEDOM five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while well clear of the rest to be along second best. LUCKY MUCHO MAN coaxed from
the gate, chased four then five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to
improve position and just secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair. MAKART coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home, lugged in losing his action in a pair of awkward steps just inside the eighth pole, continued
on weakening to the finish and was nailed for the show honors on the line. TUESDAY'S CHILD vied early between foes from the two path before getting
shaken off into the backstretch, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, was not
persevered with to the finish when tiring in the drive. SLOW DECISION coaxed from the start, vied early inside a pair before emerging to duel with
CLINGMAN to his outside down the backstretch and into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got overhauled in tandem with his main
pace foe near the quarter pole when taking the inside route into upper stretch, faltered and was eased to the finish. TYRANNOSAURUS REX stumbled at
the start pecking the ground, chased along the inside through the first turn before tipping four then three wide into the far turn, tucked in to spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, tired and was eased home to the wire. CLINGMAN vied from the three path before dueling with SLOW DECISION to his inside
tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch overthrown in concert with
his main pace rival at that juncture, gave way straightened away for home and was eased. SOUTHERN CIVILITY broke in at the start bumping RIA'S
ANGEL, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, folded and was eased to the finish.

Footnotes
KEEPMEINMIND was reserved under restraint while saving ground around the first turn, tugged keenly at the bit while off heels early on the backstretch,
leveled out before the five-eighths, was roused in the two path on the far turn, rallied five wide to make a bid into upper stretch, gained the lead under a
strong-hand ride nearing the furlong marker, moved clear under a solid-hand ride while being flashed with the whip once from the left-side into the final
sixteenth and proved best under good handling. NAVAL AVIATOR was bumped hard at the start and off a step slow, went around the first turn in the two
path, settled at the rear, raced three wide early on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, came seven wide into upper
stretch under a drive, chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while up for the place. TIWANAKU was hustled to the front, showed the
way while well rated in the two path, came under increased pressure while spinning three wide into the stretch then was asked for his best, lost the lead to
the winner approaching the furlong marker and proved no match then lost the place while just able to hold the show. COMPLETE AGENDA broke in and
bumped hard with an opponent at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, raced in the two path early on the far turn,
shifted three wide while given his cue in the vicinity of the three-eighths, chased six wide into upper stretch, moved in outside the furlong marker and
weakened then just missed the trifecta. SKYLANDER was coaxed along early then rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging near the
half-mile pole, chased along the rail on the far turn and came up empty. EFFICIENCY went three wide around the opening bend, tracked the pace down the
backstretch, dropped back three to four wide around the far turn and retreated. FIGHTER IN THE WIN rounded the first turn in the four path, settled on the
outside, dropped back four to five wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
DOLCE ZEL (FR) bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the leader on the final
turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to near the furlong marker, was roused to come through a tight opening against the rail shortly thereafter,
burst through to take a short lead at the sixteenth-pole, battled on even terms with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong handling.
EMINENT VICTOR stumbled at the start then bumped with foes on both sides, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, came under
coaxing late on the backstretch, was asked in the three to four path on the far turn, chased under a drive in upper stretch, made a bid inside the furlong
marker, fought on even terms with the winner in the final sixteenth and was denied while clear for the place. KOALA PRINCESS bumped hard with an
opponent at the start, was unhurried towards the back while saving ground, came off the rail on the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, chased
outside in the drive and finished willingly to just get the show. AL QAHIRA went to the front, showed the way in hand while racing inside to the two path, was
given her cue near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led into the final furlong, was collared outside the sixteenth-pole, vied between
foes into the final sixteenth, paused while in tight between the top two late and was taken in hand then lost the show at the wire. SKIMS (GB) was taken in
hand early, rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved on the outside, traveled two then three wide around the final turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SISTER LOU ANN hit the inside of the gate at the start then bumped with a
foe, stalked the pace on the outside in the two to three path, made a bid on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and was out-kicked. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the final turn
then driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HEAVENLY HELLOS settled at the rear on the inside, was asked on the far turn, turned into the
stretch in the two path then moved further out under a drive and failed to rally.

Footnotes
LET HER INSPIRE U six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn patiently handled until set down angled four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive to prevail. SILVER FIST dueled five paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn with CINDERELLA'S CAUSE to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, got overtaken in tandem with her main rival at the three-sixteenths and kept on to preserve the place honors. FANCY FELINE
coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside put to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled back out four wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to procure the show honors. LEELOO coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five
wide for home and improved position for the last major share. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE dueled from the two path with SILVER FIST to her outside, tucked
inside and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, got collared with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the
finish. TRUE EMPRESS chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
CARAMOCHA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. GRINGOTTS
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. HANNAH DANCES three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and was ridden along
with seven-sixteenths to go, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. READY A. P. chased five then four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, tired. QUEEN ARELLA hustled from the gate, showed brief speed five to six paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was pushed along at the three-eighths in retreat, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
faltered. Please note, due to a technical issue with starting gate stall eight, each of CARAMOCHA, TRUE EMPRESS, LET HER INSPIRE U, READY A. P.,
AND HANNAH DANCES started one additional stall outwards then scheduled as that stall required being left vacant for the start.
