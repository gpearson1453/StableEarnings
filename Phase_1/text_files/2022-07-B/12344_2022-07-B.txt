NAUTICAL MISS was taken in hand around the first turn and stalked the pace through the backstretch, tracked the top pair late on the turn then shifted four
wide heading into the lane, gathered momentum under right handed urging, seized command near mid-stretch and finished going away. KAYLOR set the
pace through early stages, vied for the lead with TAPITS LADY at the quarter pole, shook free and held a slim lead at the furlong marker then got overtaken
by the winner. TAPIT'S LADY tracked the early pace three wide then headed in pursuit entering the far turn, vied with KAYLOR at the quarter pole and
sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. DIAMOND OF EKATI was forwardly placed through the backstretch, chased three wide around the far
turn then faded in the lane. BIT A BAD NEWS hesitated and came away slowly from the gate, raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. RUDY
TOOTY bore out around the first turn and trailed throughout.

HIS GIANT sped to the lead soon after the start and held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, held clear a furlong out then came under
attack from KNOCKS BIG THIRST, fought back from the inside and refused to let rival by. KNOCKS BIG THIRST tracked the pace through the backstretch
and remained forwardly placed around the turn, given cue three wide at the head of the lane, roused forward to challenge HIS GIANT for the lead in the final
furlong, dug in under pressure but failed to get by game winner. HOLDING FAST was forwardly placed entering the turn, chased two wide into upper stretch
and stayed on for a share. DISCREET INVASION raced inside off the early pace, shifted four wide late on the turn and lacked a needed rally. SACRED
OATH raced off the second flight heading into the turn, saved ground into the lane and failed to threaten. FIVE O ONE lacked speed and raced in the back,
came two wide into the lane and never menaced.

then got carried in by CLASSIC BET and bumped with rivals at the start, dueled for the early lead with CLASSIC BET, battled on around the turn then tired
in the drive. LOOKIN' BOMBED lacked speed and raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and never threatened. BORK got bumped repeatedly and

Footnotes
SHEMEANSBIZNESS sped to the lead at the start and held clear around the turn, came two to three wide into upper stretch and pulled away while ridden
out. FLAT OUT STORMIN tracked outside in early stages then hustled along three to four wide around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but
sustained bid and finished clearly second best. ANNIEWAY U WANT IT was forwardly placed soon after the start, chased inside around the turn, cut the
corner entering the lane and just lasted for show. BUG A BOO lacked speed and raced well off the pace, hustled along four to five wide in the drive and
improved position. JIBE tracked the pace four wide in early stages then hustled up for response around the turn, came two wide into the lane and narrowly
missed show. KASA raced off the early pace, coaxed four to five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. READY TO GET LOUD was forwardly placed soon
after the start, chased after the leader around the turn then faded in the lane. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE showed brief response in early stages then
retreated.

Footnotes
ROCK CITY ROCKET raced up close into the turn, moved up three wide and cleared the lead at the quarter pole, repelled the bid from MY BOY GUS
leaving the furlong marker, widened advantage and kept to task. FINISH LINE tracked the top trio into the turn, roused three to four wide into the lane and
got up late for place. MY BOY GUS was forwardly placed around the turn then launched an inside bid at the head of the lane, raced in striking distance a
furlong out then weakened off the winner and got edged late for place. ANDIAMO GIACOMO raced off the early pace, chased four wide around the turn and
improved position without threatening. HALO JAX raced midpack in early stages, chased three wide around the turn and faded in the lane. VISION OF
ELIAS raced in the back, came two wide into the lane and never threatened. NASTY EXAGGERATOR raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn
and had no response. LAUNCHED held a slim lead in opening stages then vied into the turn, got overtaken by the winner at the quarter pole and retreated
turning for home.
