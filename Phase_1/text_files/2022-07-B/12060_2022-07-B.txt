wide, took the lead midway around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on for the place. H P BIG HOPE settled off the
pace while racing two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch and was along for the show. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR stumbled at the start, raced well back four
wide and improved position in the lane. PERSONAL MEADOW set a pressured pace inside and tired in the lane. OCEAN RIDE played no factor while
racing two wide.

PACHUCA was devoid of speed, raced four wide, kicked in nearing the eighth pole, swept to the front near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. NICE
BABY set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and held well enough for the place. MY CAJUN LADY tracked the pace three wide down the
backstretch and two wide around most of the turn, had aim outside of the pacesetter in upper stretch but lacked a rally. GO NIKKI GO failed to menace
while racing two and three wide and was vanned off. XTRASAUCEWELLDONE played no factor while racing two wide. WICKLOW GAL was outrun while
racing three wide. LADY HAMILTON had brief speed two wide.

SHE'S CLASSY settled off the early pace along the inside, split rivals in upper stretch, closed inside and was up in deep stretch. MUGURUZA stalked the
pace two and three wide, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear in midstretch but could not hold off the winner late. FOR EVER OURS raced off the pace
three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for the show. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME dueled two wide to upper stretch, continued on the
left lead in the lane and weakened. CANDYMEISTER was off a step slow, saved ground and never threatened. TRULY AMBITIOUS dueled along the rail to
upper stretch and tired. BLACK SILK was outrun inside.

Footnotes
T VILLE set a rated pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted out a bit and held clear. FREDDY'S MUSIC tracked the pace three wide
between foes, could not gain on the winner in the lane but finished gamely inside a foe for the place. PAPA CHARLES saved ground off the pace, advanced
four wide around the far turn then lost the place duel. MID ATLANTIC failed to menace while racing three wide. OVER CALENDARED pressed the pace
outside of the winner and faltered in the lane. GLORY AND VICTORY chase the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. DEVIL'S MYTH bumped with
TWELVE O'CLOCK at the start, raced up close four wide and retreated nearing the lane. TWELVE O'CLOCK bumped with DEVIL'S MYTH at the start,
steadied nearing the first turn and trailed in two and three paths.

Footnotes
CAJUN HOPE bobbled soon after the start, prompted the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths pole then drew off under a drive in the
lane. KEANU was away alertly, set the pace in the two path, could not resist the winner late on the turn but stayed on willingly to hold the place. LIVE IS
LIFE tracked the pace four wide and was one-paced through the lane to maintain third. MOUNSIEUR COCO was bumped soon after the start, saved
ground in range and lacked a rally. CONGRUENT chased the pace five wide and lacked a closing bid. BOLD MAJESTIC lunged at the start then came in
and bumped MOUNSIEUR COCO, raced four wide and played no further factor. TIGRE raced greenly inside down the backstretch, steadied near the
half-mile pole and made little impact. LUKA GRAZIE played no factor while racing two wide. MR. ASH was outrun inside. MAN ICE broke slowly and trailed
inside.

Footnotes
LAST LEAF settled off the early pace outside, cruised up four wide around the turn, took over in the three path nearing the quarter pole and quickly drew off
while ridden out. MARYQUITECONTRARY stalked the pace two wide, could not keep pace with the winner from the quarter pole but finished gamely inside
of foes to hold the place. STELLAR RIDE prompted the pace three and four wide and was one-paced through the lane to gain the show. HA' PENNY raced
well back two wide, angled five wide turning for home and improved position outside. POIEMA set the pace in the two path and wilted in the lane.
RAPTUROUS chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. EASY COME EASY GO trailed inside.
