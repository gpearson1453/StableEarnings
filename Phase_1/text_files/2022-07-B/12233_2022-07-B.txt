INDIRECTLY well placed behind the dueling leaders, split foes into the stretch and eagerly drew away under moderate coaxing. I SAW IT ALL earned a
narrow lead between foes, could not resist the winner but continued well for the place. GOLDEN SPOKE forced the pace along the inside then weakened
slightly. SPECTACULAR KID prompted the pace four wide to the stretch and faltered. LONGTAIL battled for the lead three wide between rivals and came
up empty. VERO SUN lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

TALENTED MAN alternated for the advantage inside, dueled to the final sixteenth and gamely edged away driving. BAAGY vied for the lead outside and
continued willingly to the finish. PRINCE FILIP split rivals moving inside into the far turn then made a gradual stretch gain. REX KWON DO broke slowest,
chased inside, was in tight and steadied into the far turn. CAPTAIN CHAZZ raced close up between foes, was squeezed back and steadied into the far turn.
UNCLE GARY G forced the pace between rivals to the three eighths pole and gave way.

out into the stretch and continued willingly. KINGSVILLE set a pressured pace inside, was collared into the stretch and faltered. HARD STING lacked speed,
advanced inside then flattened out late. SUPER DUDE prompted the pacesetter outside for five furlongs and tired. MY FRIENDS BEER moved close up in
the two path then gave way before half a mile. JUMP FOR ALEX lagged far behind and was never in contention.

JACOHARE set a pressured pace inside, repelled repeated challenges then pulled away through the stretch while kept to his business. EXIT RIGHT stalked
the pace three wide for half a mile then was outfinished through the stretch. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL dropped back inside, bid into the stretch then flattened
out. HIDDEN PROMISE saved ground early, bid between rivals into the far turn then faded. MISSISSIPPI dropped back early, moved wide in the stretch
and was no factor. DOUBLE THE HEART pressed the winner outside to the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
CHARGE THROUGH cruised to the front on the turn, widened and remained safe under moderate pressure. CLASSY SADIE rallied wide on the turn then
made a gradual gain in the stretch. PRINCESS KAIRA far behind early, moved very wide into the stretch, angled in and continued well. MISS ALEX was
outrun early then passed rivals inside without menacing. K COTTEE raced just off the leaders for half a mile and faltered. HIT A HOMER HONEY saved
ground off the pace then flattened out through the stretch. PEARLBDANCING hustled just off the pace then began fading into the far turn. FALL CAMPAIGN
underwent a shoe repair in the paddock then gave way in the race. FRIEDER FANATIC dropped back at the start and was always outrun. SEVEN YEARS
LATER led narrowly along the inside briefly then stopped abruptly.
