TIO WIL outrun early, swung very wide into the stretch, offered a late rush to get up in time in a tight finish. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE dueled throughout,
alternated for the lead and continued very gamely to the wire. GET THE W settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out in the lane, loomed a threat but
could not get by. LITTLE HARBOUR broke slowest, chased between rivals and continued willingly. FEDERAL CASE chased close up wide throughout then
flattened out late. FRAN'S WORRIER earned a narrow lead inside, battled to the final yards and tired. TOWN JAK dropped back wide and was finished after
half a mile.

MISS PEPPINA eased back in traffic into the far turn, angled out in the stretch and was just up between opponents. WISHES AND DREAMS settled very
wide, rallied in the stretch, closed gamely but was outfinished. BLUNT FORCE stalked the pacesetter, bid to the front into the stretch, moved clear but
weakened. TILSA saved ground, slipped through on the turn, loomed a threat but flattened out. GLOWING STAR hustled to a clear lead for half a mile then
faded in the final furlong. PER RULING #22206PP FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, MISS PEPPINA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st
TO UNPLACED DUE TO HISA RULE 2280 (USE OF RIDING CROP) AND A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
FLOR DE SOMBRA quickly took control, widened in hand on the turn, maintained a long advantage and was being geared down late. TIZ SPEEDY
steadied in the opening quarter, angled out, rallied very wide and was up for the place. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO chased the winner three wide and
continued well while no match. ALL EYES ON YOU raced off the pace between rivals and flattened out in the stretch. IRA THE ICON angled inside early
then proved empty in the stretch. THE COUNT dropped back early in the two path and was never a factor. RETWEET chased inside and gave way readily.
SON OF A BUCK lagged far behind throughout. SKYHOOK lacked speed and was always far back.

HE HATE ME dueled three wide then wore down the pacesetter in the final furlong in a determined effort. PASSAGE OF LINES battled pair of rivals along
the inside and continued gamely to the wire. RACK GIN vied between rivals to the stretch and weakened. JAMMINWITHBRANDON angled inside early,
rushed up then flattened out. THE BIG BLUFF dropped back early near the inside and lacked a rally. MACH TRIAL raced just off the pace in the two path
and faded. HEALY'S HOPE lagged far behind then passed stopping rival. HORSE GREEDY lacked speed then continued to falter while far back.

EXTREME FORCE stalked the pacesetter outside, vied through the turn, edged clear holding outside rival safe. SILVER FURY settled inside the leaders,
angled out on the turn, loomed a threat then went evenly. FAST BREAK hustled to the front inside, dueled on the turn then tired in the lane. TACTICAL
PLAN lacked speed, advanced inside and failed to menace. GLACIER EXPRESS lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. WILD UNION chased within
range in the two path and faltered. FOREST FIRE raced wide and gave way readily. LAZARETTO was a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track
veterinarian.
