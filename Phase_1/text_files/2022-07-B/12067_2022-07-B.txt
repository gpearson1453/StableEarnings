HAZARDOUS HUMOR stalked the pacesetter, commenced her bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of KAMENSHEK, gained command at the sixteenth
marker, then dug in gamely to hold off the runner up. PRUDENT SONG raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, dug in gamely
outside in deep stretch and needed a bit more. EPIC QUEEN raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly between foes and earned the
show spot. KAMENSHEK set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner in upper stretch and then weakened. ALWAYS AWARE chased two wide,
lacked a rally and tired. MAEVE THE BRAVE (IRE) chased inside and had no rally. NEVER (IRE) was bumped hard by an injured rival at the half mile
marker, forced to steady and then outrun. PLAYALINDA was injured and pulled up at the half mile marker, vanned off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the
incident, the race was declared official.

Footnotes
BENBANG set the pace on the inside, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run, turned back a bid from DELMONA (IRE) at the sixteenth marker and edged
away for the win. DELMONA (IRE) steadied in the chute, raced off the pace between rivals, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, bid in midstretch,
dug in gamely outside but second best. MAC THE PEE H DEE stalked close up outside, bid on the turn, dueled between rivals turning for home, weakened
and held on for third. INSATIABLE raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole, made a late bid and just missed for the show spot. MARISSA'S LADY
chased three wide, moved up at the quarter pole, then lacked a stretch bid. LADY ZETA chased on the inside, raced inside on the turn and lacked a rally.
DISCO EBO raced close up inside, got shuffled back leaving the chute, then did not factor.
