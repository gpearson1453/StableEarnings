drive. DANCER'S MELODY , off the early pace, found a stalking position while racing four wide down the backstretch, asked to quicken around the turn,
moved out five wide after the quarter pole, finished willingly. MISS BETTY ,broke a step slow away from the gate, keen to run on down the backstretch,
stayed along the inside while around the turn, asked to quicken at the quarter pole, finished even late. MIDDIE broke inward leaving the gate, found three
wide stalking trip down the backside, asked early into the turn to quicken, could not stay with leader, faded late in deep stretch. HONOR YOUR MOTHER ,

COLD FEET set the pace racing with a clear lead, moved away on the turn, responded when roused, drew off, widened in the final furlong and was in hand
late. MEAN TWEETS was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, rallied three wide in the stretch run and finished well for second. GETTIN'DOWNONIT
raced off the pace, rallied outside in the stretch and closed late to get third. THE COLORA KID stalked close up early, chased the winner on the turn and
weakened in the lane. HESFIREDUP chased on the inside, raced inside on the turn and lacked a rally. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN chased between rivals, went
three wide past the quarter pole and tired. BETTER BEFORE chased three wide, went four wide past the quarter pole and tired. WHISKEY RICARDO was
bumped and had the rider lose the irons after the start, outrun and eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
CASHING BIG CHECKS set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, dug in gamely and held on late for the win.
GLOSSAMER was a bit reluctant loading, tracked close up on the inside, saved ground n the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely outside
of CASHING BIG CHECKS and battled to the wire. DOWNTOWN KATIE raced off the pace inside, made a four wide run into contention nearing the quarter
pole, went six wide turning for home and rallied mildly outside. NEON CITY trailed the field, moved up at the quarter pole, came wide into the stretch and
gained mildly outside. LOOKS DON'T LIE raced three wide early, stalked outside a rival, bid three wide on the far turn and weakened. DARE ME raced off
the pace between horses and had no rally. TAK E LADY pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid on the far turn, dueled with the winner and faded in
the lane. PRACTICALLY THERE raced off the pace, had an inside trip and tired. IRAZU raced five wide early, then two wide off the pace and failed to
threaten. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL steadied nearing the first turn, raced four wide on that turn, then three wide and gave way.

Footnotes
AMERICAN D'ORO stalked three wide, continued off the leaders on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed outside in midstretch, dug in
gamely in the final sixteenth and surged at wire to get the nod. XY TIME set the pace on the inside, dueled with CALL CURT on the far turn, dug in gamely
inside in the stretch drive, battled to the wire and just missed. CALL CURT stalked close up two wide, bid on the turn, dueled with XY TIME, dug in gamely
between rivals in the final furlong and continued willingly to the finish. EKATI'S VERVE raced off the pace inside, rallied mildly between horses in the stretch
and got up for fourth. PASSPORT was reluctant to load, settled off the rail, off the pace, came five wide into the lane and gained mildly outside. HARD
STRIKE raced four wide early, settled two wide off the pace, came five wide into the lane and lacked a bid. MR. SHADES OF GRAY pulled in the early
stages, raced four wide into the clubhouse turn, settled two wide off the pace and had no rally. LOOSE ENDS stalked between rivals, the chased, checked
between horses on the far turn and tired. ROBERT'S LUXURY trailed the field and did not factor. STACKS OF SILVER tracked on the inside and faded.
JUSTINTHENICKOTIME raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
