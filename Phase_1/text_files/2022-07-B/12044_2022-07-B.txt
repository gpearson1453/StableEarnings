Footnotes
MUROMEC stalked mid pack on the rail to begin, circled runners five wide on the far turn and battled through the stretch with the runner up inching away
the last sixteenth. COUSIN BOB tracked in third down the backstretch, loomed into contention turning for home four wide while splitting runners, battled
down the lane with the winner outside and gave way late. ADMONISH was allowed to settle at the back saving ground in the beginning, started his rally with
a half mile to go passing foes on the inside, ran on into the stretch to get third just levelling out the final sixteenth. PERFECT PLAY was placed near the
back in the beginning, started a run mid way through the far turn angling out to the six path entering the stretch and passed tiring rivals to garner a minor
share. DAWSON SILVER chased the speed from the onset, offered a bid between runners while three wide entering the stretch and weakened in the late
stages of the race. LATE SURGE stalked mid pack throughout while racing just outside, roused on the far turn and had no response. UNSPEAKABLE
showed good early speed to take command clearing from the outside to get to the rail, was collared at the three sixteenth pole and backed up through the
field in the final eighth.

Footnotes
BAYTOWN ELVIS moved clear into the first turn shifting in first to the three then two path, dictated terms around that bend and up the backstretch, was
given some pressure by an outside rival into the far turn, edged away from that one in mid-stretch but just held under steady handling. GRAND GIZMO rated
into the first turn off the aforementioned and switched outside that one later on that bend to stalk, took closer order into the far turn, drew nearly even while
three wide at the top of the stretch, lost some ground by mid-stretch but kept on under strong urging and just missed. NORTHERN CONQUEST stalked
three wide, was within range leaving the far turn but proved on match for the top pair while capturing show honors. SOCIAL JUSTICE shifted in heading to
the first turn, tracked inside the second flight, ran evenly and lacked the needed late kick. THE COACHMAN settled at the rear racing off the inside, was
encouraged along periodically up the backstretch and into the far turn, swung five wide turning for home, asked for more, drifted out a couple paths and had
no response. SOCIETY EXPRESS broke inwardly, was in a bit tight in behind rivals two wide into the first turn, settled mid-pack, raced between foes on the
far turn while asked for more, failed to rally and ran on evenly. CLASS IN MAX raced two to three wide early in the back half of the field, dropped back and
shifted in on the far turn, failed to rally. WHY NOT BOURBON was well-placed mid-pack racing outside foes four wide, steadily weakened through the
stretch. TIMMINS stumbled at the start, settled toward the rear racing outside, entered the first turn four wide, still at the back went four wide into the far turn
swinging eight deep turning for home, shifted in at that juncture and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
CEDAR VALLEY made an early move to get a good position going into the far turn, assumed command at the quarter pole and was drawing away in the
late stages. DEVIL'S BIT got shuffled back a bit entering the turn on the inside, then rallied on the fence through the turn and into the stretch running
willingly to just get up for second at the wire. FIRE EMOJI set the pace from the start, was headed at the quarter pole by the winner but fought on down the
stretch finishing well just losing second late at the wire. ROAD MAP chased the pace outside, loomed into contention at the quarter pole and ran even
through the lane for a minor share. CHANCEWORTHTAKING was away a bit slow on the break, trailing early on, ridden through the turn and split runners
entering the lane passing tiring rivals in the final eighth. CRYSTAL CRESCENT stalked outside of runners going three wide in the turn and had little to offer
down the stretch. REMEMBERING RHODA brushed the gate on the break, rated mid pack between runners throughout, was asked on the turn and never
factored through the lane.

Footnotes
INVISIBLE FRIEND was bumped at the break then strongly urged forward inside to track the pace from a closer position, had room to bid up the rail in
upper stretch and quickly took command, drew clear under steady handling. J AND B IN CRUMLIN broke in just a bit then was coaxed forward and rapidly
advance inside rivals to get clear and dictate the pace racing just off the rail, was overtaken in upper stretch and no match for the winner but held place
securely. DIXIE BIN bumped the inner rival at the start, settled off the pace, was forced outside a rival four wide into the turn eventually moving in two wide
on that bend, found room between foes at the top of the stretch, took over third and held that position to the wire. TARADAR pursued the pace from outside
going five wide on the turn, ran on evenly. AORISTOS chased the pace from between runners four wide, dropped back on the turn and moved out late on
that bend, lacked the needed late kick. MAMMOTH SPRING raced just off the leaders, got closer three wide between foes late on the turn but could not
sustain the effort for the stretch run. PAPA DOBLES raced off the pace three deep into the turn, shifted to the rail passing the three-eighths pole, failed to
rally. WHERE'S NED broke a step slowly then steadied soon after when a rival veered in, trailed early switching out to go two to three wide on the turn and
failed to make a bid. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF veered in after the break, saved ground on the turn, was never near enough to threaten.

SELFMADE tracked just behind the pacesetters through the backstretch, angled outside those foes to take command at the quarter pole and quickly opened
up through mid stretch to win comfortably at the end. COURTLY MANNER dueled with an outside rival to set the pace, was headed while inside of horses at
the quarter pole and while no match for the winner finished up well running on end the hold second clearly. GIANT CRITIC was mid pack stalking outside,
angled out to the five path turning for home to get a clear run and closed belatedly to win the three horse photo for show. MOON OVER MONTANA stalked
the pace on the rail, was ridden on the far turn to keep up and kept to the task between runners through the lane just losing out on a three horse photo.
SOBERANO (FR) stalked inside throughout, made a mild rally on the fence entering the lane and fought on with two other runners for the show award
settling for the smaller share. TAOS (FR) trailed and never was involved. BOURBON EXTENSION battled for the lead outside till the quarter pole where he
was headed and faded between runners the last eighth. REDOUTE'S LIGHT broke in at the start, was asked in the far turn and had no response.

Footnotes
CRAFTY CONQUEST moved clear to dictate terms from off the inside but shifting in a bit, led in the two path through the turn, was given moderate
hand-urging through upper stretch then right-handed encouragement from the crop at the furlong marker and held under continued urging. HONEY WON'T
stalked from outside four wide through the turn, gained steadily and slowly in the lane but was second best. TRANQUILITY BASE got away well and was
forwardly-positioned early then settled in to track from inside, came off the fence a bit turning for home, kept on in the drive to get show honors. BEN
LOMOND settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn, showed late interest inside. TOMATO BILL got away well but ceded the lead content to stalk,
went three wide on the turn just off the leader, lacked the needed late kick. EXECUTIVE SIGHT brushed with a rival lightly at the start, was close up racing
outside four to five wide, needed more. INGORDWETRUST was lightly brushed at the start, bumped with a rival heading up the backstretch, angled in
entering the turn to go two to three wide on that bend and drifting out a bit turning for home, was guided back inside and improved position. WHISKEY
VICTOR raced mid-pack two to three wide between foes, lacked a rally. TALL WATER was bumped very lightly after the start, in tight up behind rivals early,
bumped with a foe up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to make a bid. DE ONLY SOLUTION got away just a hair slowly then
settled inside, angled seven wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CHASING VINNY was brushed lightly at the start, raced well back four wide through the
turn coming out six deep in upper stretch, failed to produce a bid.

Footnotes
CANADIAN PHAROAH rated mid pack between runners on the first turn, slowly was gaining on the leaders through the backstretch, started to rally at the
three eighths pole and gradually wore down the frontrunner late inside the sixteenth pole. HUNT MASTER hopped at the start, tracked on the rail through
the half, angled outside on the far turn to make a bid entering the stretch and was grinding down the lane to get second place late. GIANT TEDDY was
brushed at the break, chased the pace into the first turn, assumed command at the five eighths pole and opened up through the far turn to lead into the
stretch and faded badly the last sixteenth losing a couple of positions late. GREEN FLEET stalked mid pack inside through the backstretch, was coaxed on
the far turn and closed on the rail through the stretch with some late interest to get a minor share. RELIABILITY was asked between runners through the far
turn and ran evenly in the stretch. HELL BENT was four wide entering the first turn, roused while in the three path through the far turn and levelled out down
the lane. GOSPEL WAY broke out at the start, took command to lead till the five eighths pole, was ridden to keep up into the far turn , began to weaken
inside and retreated through the lane. ARGENTIUM rated near the back early, was hard ridden in the final turn and had nothing to offer. HIT THE POINT
trailed and never was a presence.

Footnotes
READY HERO tucked in behind rivals off the leaders three to four wide into the turn, came out seven wide for room in upper stretch, struck the lead past the
furlong marker and edged clear. POINT TO THE STARS shifted in tracking along the inside up close to the leaders, saved ground through the turn, drifted in
and out a path repeatedly in the stretch but kicked on while no match for the winner. SUNRISE DRIVE was brushed just lightly at the start, had forward
position stalking two to three wide between runners in the second flight, lost some position on the turn, kept on in the lane to gain show honors. BENLION
angled in early settled well back, took closer order after saving ground through the turn, lacked room inside in upper stretch then again later in the stretch
but ran on willingly. SMALL TALK was caught outside heading to the turn racing off the pace, moved in to go mostly three to four wide on that bend, came
out in mid-stretch for room and improved position. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN stalked outside four to five wide, was carried seven deep into upper stretch,
bid at the furlong marker but could not sustain the effort. UNILATERAL settled at the rear, saved some ground on the turn, angled eight deep in upper
stretch and showed late interest. ADELAIDE COURT brushed a rival lightly at the start, moved forward to stalk then advanced promptly four wide about the
half to prompt the pacesetter, was carried six wide by that one, drifted a bit in the lane while weakening. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was forwardly-placed
between runners early then stalking two to three wide through the turn, was within contention in upper stretch but came up empty late. AMMUNITION
stalked from outside mid-pack five to six wide, came out eight wide into upper stretch, dropped back and faded. HULLABALOO set the pace off the rail, was
pressured through the turn and getting out a bit, drifted five wide into upper stretch, came up empty.
