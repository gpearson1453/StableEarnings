JULIAISON shared the early lead from outside, moved ahead when allowed while three wide on the second turn, was roused leaving that bend then steadily
opened up under a drive through the lane. MARIA'S GIFT rated off the rail, picked up her pace after a half mile, came into contention just off the inside on
the second turn, moved out widest upper stretch and gained second inside the final sixteenth. A KITTEN FOR KATIE contested the pace between rivals, did
not stay with JULIAISON on the second turn, took over second inside the last furlong but leveled off in the waning yards. EMILY LANE vied for the early
lead from inside, was also no match for JULIAISON when set down for the drive and flattened out the final eighth. DIAMOND STELLAR was steadied back
from crowding leaving the first bend, moved to the inside on the backstretch and steadily yielded.

Footnotes
MIKE'S LADY rated from outside, commenced her bid after a half mile, took over from outside on the second bend, was asked leaving that turn then drew
away from the rest under hand urging in the stretch. BEZEL SET progressed between horses on the backstretch, reached contention three wide on the
second turn, floated out to path five for the stretch run, gained second inside the last furlong, lugged in with a sixteenth left and steadily opened up on the
rest for the place. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN bumped at the start, was in the second flight early, went for the lead between horses into the second turn, moved
clear for second approaching the end of six furlongs then wore down just off the inside the last eighth. MEXIA raced in contention between rivals but faded
three wide on the second bend. THEYCALLHERPINKY broke outward, bumping AIKEN TO BE TAKIN, contested the pace outside THE MORE I BURN for
five furlongs then began to yield. THE MORE I BURN displayed early speed from inside but also gave way with three furlongs left.

FAST JACK was hustled to a clear early lead, rated from inside once along the rail, roused again at the top of the lane and gradually lengthened command
under urging. RIDE INTO THE SKY forwardly placed toward the outside, took over second two wide between horses on the bend then could only pull clear
for the place late. ART HEIST progressed three wide on the turn, lacked a rally in the stretch but gained third inside the final sixteenth. LAKE MILLS
prominent just outside FAST JACK, moved to the inside on the bend and gradually yielded the rest of the way. PACHI raced in contention between horses,
retreated some on the turn and ran evenly the last quarter mile. LONESOME DREAM forwardly placed from inside, gave way after three furlongs.

GHAALEB'S DOMAIN shared the early lead from inside, moved clear when asked upper stretch, was kept to task in the late going and maintained control.
GHAALEB'S RANGER well back early, angled out as she picked up her pace on the turn, came four wide into the lane, surged the last furlong, took over
second inside the sixteenth marker and lugged in through the waning yards as she closed the gap on the leader. JUST A WONDER bumped with
STARSOVERPARADISE at the start, progressed two wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the stretch, angled in with a furlong left and gained third
just after GHAALEB'S RANGER took second inside the final sixteenth. DOLLY'S LINE contested the pace just outside GHAALEB'S DOMAIN, could not stay
with that one upper stretch and flattened out between rivals in the late going. STARSOVERPARADISE bumped with JUST A WONDER at the break,
chased from inside, began to retreat on the turn, swung out into the lane, angled out widest upper stretch and had no late bid. DRAGONFLY KISSES
showed little.

Footnotes
PRINCESS MANDII shared the lead outside ABBMAR, was asked as she floated out some into the lane, edged ahead under urging upper stretch, drifted
out inside the final furlong, kept a straight path the last sixteenth and began to draw off. AH LEAH forwardly placed between horses, was three wide on the
bend, rallied belatedly outside PRINCESS MANDII deep stretch but caught ABBMAR for second near the wire. ABBMAR broke on top, vied for the lead
from inside and slowly wore down for the drive. PRINCESS CONSUELA angled toward the outside early on, lost ground four then five wide through the turn
but was closing the gap some deep stretch. HOOSIER GOLD CASE crowded briefly leaving the chute, soon trailed running widest, angled in to be just off
the inside on the bend, fanned to path three for the stretch run and made up some ground the last furlong without threatening. PRETTY GITA broke
outward, chased from midpack, was two wide on the turn, swung widest for the drive and had no late bid. HEART OF REASON was away slowly, moved to
the inside early on, gradually advanced along or just off the rail to midstretch then gave way. CARMEN O'ELECTRA chased from inside and began to fade
before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
STOPSHOPPINGAMY angled out between rivals after a furlong, took over second into the bend, was roused from path three leaving the turn, under steady
urging through the lane, engaged TIZ HOPPIN inside the last furlong and gradually edged ahead inside the final sixteenth. TIZ HOPPIN moved clear after
travelling the first furlong, showed the way just off the rail, was put to urging in the stretch, did not have enough left the last sixteenth but was clearly second
best. WAR COLORS prominent from outside, advanced four wide on the bend, fought to keep third upper stretch then could only pull clear for the show in
the late going. KHOZYS CROWN broke on top, was soon overtaken, moved outside TIZ HOPPIN midway on the backstretch, moved back to the rail into the
turn and began to yield. SAMARITA chased from outside, was two wide on the turn, angled outside upper stretch and had no late bid. LINDALOUIMAGE
was a step slow at the break, chased from inside then faded after three furlongs.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S SUCCESS urged from the gate, was steadied briefly behind traffic into the first turn, angled to the outside, rated off the early speed, was let out
after a half mile, progressed three wide, took the advantage under urging midstretch then gradually lugged in as he pulled away under a steady drive the
last furlong. SYMBOLIST soon had the lead and the inside, was challenged on the backstretch, moved ahead into the second turn, did not have enough left
to hold off KHOZAN'S SUCCESS in the lane but held on for second under a late drive. THE LAST OPTION hesitated the made a small leap from the gate,
chased running widest, came into contention four wide on the second turn, moved clear for third upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader the
final eighth but was easily best of the rest. BABA'S BOY chased from inside, angled to the outside upper stretch and had no late bid. ONE WAY HOME
displayed early speed outside SYMBOLIST but began to fade before finishing six furlongs. GAGOOTS soon trailed, was unresponsive to hand
encouragement in the stretch, eased in the late going and walked off.
