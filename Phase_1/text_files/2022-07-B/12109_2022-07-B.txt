Footnotes
NEW STRIPE advanced along the inside at the three eighths pole and took over the lead, came two wide into the upper stretch, widened to a clear
advantage then held late under a driving finish. CORRENTE DE OURO tracked the top trio then launched a four wide bid at the quarter pole, sustained bid
into the lane and was gaining on the winner in final strides. CYBER MONDAY raced off the early pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and gained a
share. STRONG STORM lacked speed and raced in the back, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. ROBERT WHO vied for the lead in early
stages, chased up close around the turn then faded. HEART HEADED ARKY vied for the lead through the backstretch, chased the winner around the turn
then came up empty in the lane. WILD APPEAL raced just off midpack entering the turn, saved ground into the lane and faded.

HAVE A PLAN raced just off the early leader then dueled for command around the turn, shook free in upper stretch and finished clear. AMERICAIN JOEY
tracked the pace in early stages, launched a two wide bid a furlong out and gained second best. CAPTAIN DON chased in contention around the turn,
sustained a three wide bid through the lane and secured a share. DRILL'S LI'L MAN picked up the pace four wide midway through the turn, continued in
range a furlong out then ran on evenly. CALCULATING KING raced off the early pace, hustled along three to four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. EL
VALE led the way through the backstretch, dueled for the lead with the winner around the turn then tired in the drive. ATTAIN SUCCESS lacked speed and
raced in the back, saved ground into the lane and never threatened.

tempo four wide midway around the far turn, ran on determinedly through the lane and was getting to the winner late. BOOTLEGGING GIRL led the way
around the first turn then dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle for command around the far turn, failed to match strides with eventual winner past
upper stretch and stayed on for a share. SUE HAPPY rated off the early pace, was ridden three wide around the far turn and lacked a needed rally.
MIZHIPZLETUS dueled for the lead up the backstretch, battled between rivals around the far turn then came up empty in the upper stretch. BRINA tracked
the pace three wide through the backstretch, hustled up off the top trio midway around the far turn but had no response and steadily retreated. DREAM
PIRE was not too far back through early stages, failed to respond under pressure around the far turn and faltered through the lane.

final furlong and held clear under a driving finish. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was reserved and raced well off the early pace, saved ground and cut the corner
entering the lane, shifted out four wide, responded willingly and gained to the wire. TIME GOES ON stalked the leader through the backstretch then
launched a bid at the quarter pole, sustained an inside bid through the lane and secured a share. MINECRAFT MANIAC tracked the early pace, launched a
three wide bid around the far turn, held a slim lead at the furlong marker then yielded. GO ADMIRAL GO raced in range through early stages, chased three
to four wide around the far turn and failed to move on in the lane. JOHN R raced off the pace, came wide into the lane and never threatened. TIN BADGE
set the pace up the backstretch and held a slim lead around the far turn then came up empty a furlong out. SMART N INTUITIVE stalked the pace through
the backstretch, failed to advance under pressure around the far turn and steadily weakened. MAHOMES was not too far back early on then weakened
around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane. OBJECTION POSTED, SMART N INTUITIVE AGAINST GO ADMIRAL GO FOR INTERFERENCE IN
