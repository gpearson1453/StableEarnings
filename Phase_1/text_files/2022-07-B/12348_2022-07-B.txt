Footnotes
FEELTHEBEAT took command soon after the break, was well rated through the turn on the rail, opened up in upper stretch and was not challenged while
being kept to the task. JACKIE'S PRIDE settled at the back shortly after the start, moved into a good tracking position on the rail entering the turn behind the
frontrunners, advanced inside with a quarter to go but could not gain on the winner through the stretch. ICING settled near the back early, started to rally at
the three eighths pole, angled outside of horses turning for home and passed tiring runners to get up for show. WOOD BE WILD tracked the pace running
three off the fence down the backside, continued that route through the turn, could not challenge the winner in upper stretch and levelled out the last
sixteenth losing third money. UNABLE chased between runners for the first half, was roused at the quarter pole to go after the front running winner and
offered no response weakening through the stretch. TRIGGER'S BAY trailed down the backstretch outside of runners, was ridden while three wide on the
turn and could not get into contention.

Footnotes
FOUR BOUNCE stalked the leader under light rating tactics from outside, was carried from four to five wide on the turn losing ground on the leading pair,
rallied strongly outside dueling late and got up late. ULTIMATE ANSWER tracked in behind the leaders off the inside early, came out four wide leaving the
turn, bid inside FOUR BOUNCE in mid-stretch taking a narrow and brief lead about the sixteenth pole, dueled with the aforementioned but was outfinished.
LIONESQUE was urged at the break, edged closer into the turn pressing two wide and between, continued to apply pressure through the bend, dueled in
upper- to mid-stretch, outfinished the sparring partner but was no match for the top pair. PAPA DOBLES set the pace in the clear shifting in, was pressured
through the turn, dueled inside in upper stretch, was outkicked. AORISTOS broke outwardly, raced off the pace four wide on the turn, ran on. CANT GLIDE
BY KATZ reared at the start and was off slowly, saved ground. BOLD DIAMONDS BFF broke a step slowly, lacked early speed despite some urging, went
two wide on the turn, was never a threat. THE BAND COMING went three wide on the turn racing off the leaders and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LOVE THE GAME was allowed to settle behind multiple runners chasing for the lead early, moved into a good tracking position on the rail entering the turn,
settled nicely behind pressing runners with three eighths left, split rivals in the three path in upper stretch and took command at the eighth pole inching away
at the wire. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI tracked three wide through the backstretch, engaged the for the lead on the outside at the quarter pole, fought gamely
outside through the lane with the winner but could not get by. WHERE IS ESSA battled for the lead through the far turn on the rail, was roused with a
quarter to go, could not keep up with the outside closers in the final eighth but fought on to the wire winning the contest for show money. BOXER BRIEF
was away alertly pressing between runners for the lead throughout the turn, took command briefly with three sixteenths to go and faded between runners
through the stretch for a minor role. COLLABORATIVE was ridden early leaving the chute to keep inside position, got shuffled back on the rail entering the
turn to be near the back and could not be a factor down the stretch. DRAGON'S KEY broke sharp, was reined back to trail runners at the half and could
never get involved afterwards. C C'S KINGDOM showed early speed outside of runners down the backside to be in front, surrendered the lead to multiple
inside rivals at the half, retreated while hard ridden through the turn and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
MUSICAL SPELL shifted in early settling off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn inside a rival, came out six then seven wide in upper stretch, put
to steady urging and got up late. ALLEN DIGGS stalked the pace from outside two to three wide, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths, drifted in and out a
bit in upper- to mid-stretch then drifted out several paths in late stretch, was outfinished. HILARIOUS AFFAIR exchanged a bump and stumbled at the start
spotting the field several lengths, was encouraged along but raced well back early, saved ground on the turn, came out turning into upper stretch, gained
late between and inside rivals. RAT PORTAGE exchanged a bump at the start, settled mid-pack along the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out at
the furlong marker then, was gaining but carried out late by a drifting foe. MAGNIFICENT MARIO settled off the pace outside going three to four wide on the
turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, gained mildly but needed more. CEREBRO was brushed lightly at the start, raced between foes into the turn in the
second flight going mostly two wide on that bend, came out four wide in upper stretch, was forced out five deep later in the drive and placed in tight quarters
late. BEE BEE THE KING set the pace inside, gave way in the stretch. RAISE A PROFIT stalked from outside three to four wide on the turn, came out
further for the stretch run, weakened. AGILE DANCER broke outwardly brushing a rival lightly, dropped back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SAILOR'S PASSION took a good tracking position on the rail with a half mile to run behind a contested pace, waited at the quarter pole for room to run,
found a seam mid stretch in the two path splitting rivals and began to pull away in the final sixteenth. LIARS CLUB was between runners challenging for the
lead through the first half, took back to track the pacesetters outside on the far turn, advanced to the leaders at the quarter pole, assumed command with a
furlong to go but could not hold off the winner in the last sixteenth. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN stalked mid pack inside early on, was asked while three wide
going into the far turn, angled just outside a bit more for a stretch rally and finished with some late interest while outside runners to get up for the show.
CHANCEL contested for the lead while going three wide on the first turn, continued that outside charge through backside and far turn, momentarily took
command turning for home between runners and faded the last eighth for a minor placing. COUSIN BOB broke out at the start, pressed for the lead on the
rail through the first half, was collared at the top of the stretch while inside and backed away the final furlong. QUIET REBEL settled near the back to begin,
advanced up the rail through the backstretch and had little to offer through the lane. DAWSON SILVER trailed into the first turn, was roused while four wide
into the far turn and offered no response coming up empty for the drive. INCENDIO took a good stalking position outside runners down the backstretch, was
ridden into the far turn only to lose position and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BOSS HOLIDAY broke outwardly lightly brushing a rival then was strongly urged to a forward position, engaged a rival in a brief duel before being reined in
and settled in to stalk that one from outside two to three wide, moved to the lead at the quarter pole, was clear in upper stretch, extended the margin in
mid-stretch under urging and held safe. HOUSEBUILDER settled into stride well back of the leading pair but clear of the rest into the turn racing off the rail,
swung four wide into the stretch, finished solidly but was gaining too late. ONE MORE BREW had some light brushes at the start, was allowed to settle into
stride, moved up willingly into the turn going two to three wide on that bend, came out five wide in upper stretch, ran on well but too late. TODAY broke just
a bit awkwardly, chased briefly inside but soon steadily retreated to the back of the pack, angled four wide into upper stretch, exchanged some bumps in
deep stretch but showed good late interest. RIVER OF BABYLON settled well back outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was carried six wide into
upper stretch, exchanged light bumps late but kept on. JIM'S HOPE altered outside TODAY about the seven-sixteenths, went between rivals on the turn and
into upper stretch moving out five wide, was bumped between rivals late. DON'T STOP DREAMIN was brushed lightly at the break then urged but lacked
sufficient speed, chased mid-pack, shifted to the rail about the three-eighths, weakened. BIG INVESTMENT was urged at the break, dueled briefly then
went on to dictate terms with a narrow advantage racing inside, was overtaken leaving the turn, faltered and faded in the stretch.

EXECUTIVE SIGHT stalked outside runners on the turn, angled out to the four path for a clear run at the top of the stretch and was full of run late getting up
just before the finish. IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) was allowed to settle in the early stages, commenced his rally mid turn circling four wide and found his best
stride late running outside of runners just missing getting up for the win. CRAFTY CONQUEST tracked the speed just outside throughout, pressed for the
lead at the top of the stretch, led at the eighth pole but could not hold off the late closer nearing the wire. TRICKY MAGICIAN stalked behind the pacesetters
on the rail through the turn, attempted to angle out for the stretch run but could not get a clear path, was in tight between runners with a furlong to go
steadying briefly but still ran on determinedly to the finish. TALL WATER made an early inside move up the rail to contend with three eighths to go, was in
tight on the turn steadying briefly nearing the quarter pole and could not offer stretch run inside of runners through the lane. ALACRITOUS broke sharp to
lead, repelled a brief challenge on the turn, was headed on the rail mid stretch and stopped the final sixteenth. GASCONADE rated mid pack outside
runners on the backstretch, roused on the rail through the turn and was not a factor in the run down the stretch. BIG LEAGUE stumbled at the start to trail,
offered a brief run on the turn and retreated in the stretch. JOCKEYS CLAIM OF FOUL #1 TRICKY MAGICIAN AGAINST BOTH #5 CRAFTY CONQUEST
AND #8 EXECUTIVE SIGHT THROUGH THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED

Footnotes
TWENTY FOUR MAMBA broke outwardly, settled between runners off the leading pair into the turn two wide, moved out four deep by the end of that bend
taking closer order and swinging five to six wide into upper stretch, bid at the furlong marker putting a short head in front just after, dueled then inched away
under steady handling. SOUPER LEGACY stalked the pace just off the leader and outside, went three to four wide on the turn, dueled inside the winner in
mid-stretch but was outfinished. SUGAR RAY set the pace racing off the rail, was no match for the top pair. EMMELINE saved ground racing inside, went
evenly. CITY LEGEND raced outside the second flight three then four wide on the turn and failed to rally. ROCKSTAR RO was forced out and shut off at the
start, raced outside at the rear, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CHELSEA DAGGER broke outwardly bothering a rival in the process,
went mostly two wide on the turn racing back of the leaders, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
JIBARO took command soon after the break, was left unchallenged through the turn, opened up at the three sixteenth pole and won comfortably at the
finish. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ settled near the back early on, weaved his way through traffic in upper stretch, found clear running room with a furlong to
go in the five path and was closing resolutely to get for second. REGAL INTENT chased the leader between runners through the turn, roused at the quarter
pole and could not threaten the winner but ran on well through the lane just missing holding onto place award late. AL HEYBAY saved ground throughout
the turn, began angling out midway through the stretch to the four path and finished with some late energy for a minor share. SMALL TALK made an early
outside move four wide passing runners at the half mile pole, was in contention with a quarter to go but could not sustain his run and faded the final eighth.
BULLET SPEED tracked mid pack through the turn, shuffled back a touch between runners at the top of the stretch and ran evenly to the finish line.
PRINCE OF THIEVES rated outside rivals four wide through the turn, angled out widest at the quarter pole in the eight path, offered a mild rally upper
stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. VIEW FROM EGBERT brushed the gate on the break, chased inside through the turn and weakened on the fence
in the stretch. TOURIST'S DREAM trailed early from the outside and was never involved.
