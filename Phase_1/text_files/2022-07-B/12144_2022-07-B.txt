Footnotes
CARTIER CAT was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the four path when gaining through the turn, swung into the lane with good momentum,
took aim on the leader when straightening, caught that one outside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. KILLER BEE was void of early speed and trailed into
the turn, followed the top one into the lane from the three path and rallied to be just up for the place spot. SKYLINE set the pace into the far turn, shook off a
couple of challenges in mid-turn, re-cleared into the lane, widened to the eighth pole then could not hold off the top one and lost the place spot at the wire.
ASCENDING MOON was in the four path into the far turn, took first run into the lane to get closest to the leader then could not keep the momenutm.
FERRYBOAT chased the pace from the two path through mid-turn, was asked for more n late turn and into the lane and faded. POPSTER chased the pace
from the three path into the turn, moved three wide when menacing then was empty entering the lane. DROP ANCHOR tracked the pace into the far turn,
pressed the leader to mid-turn then faltered.

Footnotes
CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY raced through the inside on the first turn, continued while moving off the inside into the far turn, advanced from the four path
and three wide in late turn, bid into the lane, quickly gained the lead when straightening then widened to the sixteenth pole before being mildly ridden to the
end. AUNT RUTH was unhurried into the far turn, continued in the two or three path when near the back, angled into the six path entering the lane and
rallied from mid-track to be well clear for the place spot while no threat to the winner. MISS MATCHMAKER saved ground into the far turn, moved off the rail
in mid-turn, came into the lane with momentum, was blocked and steadied near the eighth pole when losing her path, angled into the seven path and moved
up. BLUE OYSTER saved ground through mid-turn, came off the rail to pass a slower rival in late turn, bid into the lane from the three or four path, was a
serious threat with an eighth to go then could not sustain the effort. COCOA COLADA saved ground into the lane and lacked a closing response. MOSE
DEFINITELY tracked the pace through the far turn when in the two path, came into the lane from the four path, remained a threat with an eighth to go then
tired. SHRIMPIE set the pace early then chased the pace through the turn, bid into the lane from the two path and gave way. LOTTA ROSES never a factor
while in the three or four path through the turns. ADMIRAL'S GARNET moved wide through the first turn and into the backstretch, moved to gain a clear
lead through mid-turn then gave way. HAPPY SAILS was done on mid-turn while in the three or four path.

UNBRIDLED BEAST was unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide through the turn and into the lane, edged to the lead outside the eighth pole,
continued to lead until late and was caught at the wire and finished on even terms. HOPPED UP raced in the three path into the far turn, when gaining
momentum, checked sharply and lost a couple of lengths when hole closed, regained momentum into the lane, advanced from the four path through the
lane, split rivals inside the sixteenth pole and got up to get a piece of the win. SEMINOLE JUSTICE raced well off the inside into the far turn, bid five wide
through mid-turn, continued well off the inside into the lane, bid from the five path after straightening in the lane, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go
then could weakened late. PURPLE SHIRT trailed into the lane while in the two or three path, angled into the seven path and offered a belated gain. TWO
LAST WORDS chased the pace from the two path into the lane and weakened. EL BOHEMIO set the pace along the inside and gave way outside the
eighth pole. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER raced in the three or four path through the turns and tired. SOLITAIRE GAME steadily faded while along the inside.

BOA NOVA (IRE) stalked the pace inside, angled five wide at the quarter pole, rallied, was floated out late and offered a mild drive. ROLIN WITH OLIN was
clear early inside, drew off in the stretch and then drifted out late, interfering with a rival. MR MANNING pressed the early pace, bid at the eighth pole, was
steadied when ROLIN WITH OLIN drifted out, then came again. LITTLE KANSAS was unrushed, rallied at the top of the stretch, angled to the rail late to
avoid trouble and closed sharply. CARAMELITO trailed before rallying outside at the top of the stretch to close well. WINGING WAYS raced evenly in the
three path. CRIME SPREE saved ground. STAR OF KODIAK pulled up early, then walked off. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE
RIDER OF MR MANNING, ROLIN WITH OLIN WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

twice, right-handed then widened to the wire while ridden out. MARIACHI JUSTICE raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the
seven path and rallied from mid-track to be clear for the place spot. REITERATION was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four
path and was gaining energy late while splitting rivals. LOGAN ATTACK set the pace from the three to the two path into the lane, remained with a short lead
with an eighth left and yielded. JUSTICEONEMORETIME was bumped at the start, raced in contention through the turn while in the three path, continued
well placed while in the five path through the lane then flattened out late. SIR RONALDO chased the pace through the turn while in the two path then

slow away and settled along the inside, continued to save ground into the lane and moved up. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE never a factor while in the three or
