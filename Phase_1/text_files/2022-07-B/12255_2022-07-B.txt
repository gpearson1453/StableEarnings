CHEATIN CHARLIE broke alertly, dueled up front in the two path into the turn, shook off the other speed inside the furlong ground, held the runner up
comfortably safe late under steady handling. IDE LIKE HAWAII last away, void of early foot, angled out four wide turning for home, finished up willingly to be
slowly closing the gap on the winner late, well clear of the others. GRAND PRODUCTION moved up to duel inside the winner for three furlongs, fell off that
rival a bit into the lane, continued to weaken a bit the final furlong to prove no match for the winner while comfortably saving the show. BIG SESSY within
striking distance early, moved out and advanced to press the issue three wide into the turn, steadily weakened before a half. CORN SOUP moved closer
four wide into the turn, also began to back up just before four furlongs.

Footnotes
OVERDELIVER broke with the field, settled in the second flight while in the two path into the turn, split foes just inside the furlong marker when moving to
engage the leader and wore that rival down under firm handling. PAPA BRO dueled up front closest to the inside, put the other speed away a furlong out
just as the winner was moving to challenge, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, well clear of the others. ENCHANTED MOON away well, dueled up front in
the two path, began to weaken in the three path while allowing the winner through with a furlong remaining, continued to falter and narrowly managed to
save the show late. FAZIO void of speed for a half, shifted out a bit for room when straightened for home, finished well while too late for the show.
SUNNYONASTORMYDAY broke well, quickly fell back, continued to lag turn, came four wide for the drive, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. B W P SPECIAL settled in mid pack then came up empty for the drive. HONORARIAN forwardly placed in the early going, tired.

EASY IS GOOD last away, moved up the opening quarter to race in mid pack, challenged three wide late in the bend, repelled the runner up with a
sixteenth remaining and edged clear. LA DANTA in the second flight while off the inside, ranged up to challenge four wide and outside the winner turning for
home, pressed that one past the furlong marker then could not keep up late. SOUVENIR CHANNEL fell back after the start, continued to lag up the
backstretch and into the turn, angled out a bit to be in the two path entering the stretch, staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top two. GRACE'S
VISION lacked speed while racing outside, came three wide and under the crop into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response.
HAIRTRIGGER HEART dueled up front closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. GOODBYE ROSIE was never a threat. POSEIDON'S QUEEN broke on
top, dueled up front in the two path, stopped late in the turn, jogged in far back.

AFLEET ASCENT took command into the first turn, headed before a half, regained the advantage when straightened for home, put that rival away late and
narrowly gained the nod at the wire. ALIGNED INTEREST unhurried early while saving ground, continued inside, steered out for room past the furlong
marker, late push to close the gap on the winner, missed. PEPPER JACK with the pace along the inside after breaking on top, alternated the middle half,
headed by the winner upper stretch, weakened late, lasted for the show. VARNISHED within striking distance early off the inside, fell back to race with the
second flight final turn, slow gain late to attempt to retake the show spot. POSEIDON WRATH off the early pace, moved closer in the four path into the far
turn, failed to sustain that advance in the run to the wire. OCTOBER SURPRISE finished early, trailed home.

WENDY WILECAT with the early pace inside up the backstretch, shook clear in the turn, increased advantage in upper stretch then held the runner up safe
late under a steady right handed crop. THAT'S MY MAMA in the second flight early toward the inside, swung out four wide turning for home, finished
willingly to be steadily closing the gap on the winner late. SUNSHINE STAR broke well, vied up front between foes and outside the winner early, chased that
rival out of the turn and through upper stretch, had little for the runner up the final furlong, narrowly lasted for the show. CRYPTO BRAVE balked a bit at
loading, broke with the field, four wide when off the pace through the turn, floated out a bit wider by the runner up exiting the turn, modest late interest to be
gaining for the show. MYDEALOFTHEDAY with the pace three wide up the backstretch and into the turn, faltered in the drive. JANISTHEBEAUTY fell back
after a quarter, eased upper stretch then was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
JIMMIE'S HALO in the second flight up the backstretch while between horses, moved closer four wide through the turn, three wide into the lane, engaged
the leader late, wore that rival down to prove best. LUCK OF THE STARS close up from the start, vied three wide into the turn, took over and showed the
way into the stretch in the two path, clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner, far clear of the others. R T'S IRON MAN last away, raced back early,
improved while four wide through the turn, was clear of the rest at the wire while not a threat to the top pair. BIG TIME BANDIT with the pace after breaking
with the leaders, vied between horses for a half and began to weaken. ORPHAN CREEK lacked speed inside, two path and between foes into the lane,
lacked a closing response. ANGOLA VACATION devoid of speed, moved to the inside, improved position while never dangerous. K V TARGET in mid pack
for five furlongs, came up empty for the drive. CHELSEA'S GLORY flashed some early foot along the inside, gave way. NVRFORGET URDREAMS was
finished early while racing wide. DIGNIFIED N KRAFTY brief speed, stopped.
