Footnotes
WANTA BALLERINA rounded the opening turn in the five path then stalked three wide into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths
pole, took the lead two deep into the far turn, ran clear midway through the turn and held well under steady stretch handling. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER
saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed steadily in the three path of the far turn, left the turn outside, picked up second
mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner while running out of ground. MANGORITA settled off the rail early, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, ran evenly in the lane and just got up for third. DIXIE DIVA took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and
moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail toward the quarter, dropped back
midway on the far turn then nipped from third under the wire. FESSIN UP was not a factor while saving ground. SUNSET QUEEN rounded the opening turn
about the three path, challenged toward the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn.

just lasted. JUBA'S NOTION gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn, finished well and just missed. AYE WROTE THE SONG was hustled to even terms past
the three eighths pole and had a brief lead, but dropped back in the three path midway on the turn and flattened in the lane. JUST A FLIRT was reluctant to
load, gave chase through the backstretch, ran in the three path of the turn then flattened. XIT NOW gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened
in the lane. NO LOVE FOR JUBA proved no factor and rounded the turn in the four and five paths. TWO ROOM SCHOOL was never a factor and raced

the rail on the turn and was steadily handled to hold on. TRUE FLIRT gave chase and raced close off the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the eighth pole and
finished well at the outside girth of the winner. DIXIE YODELER chased through the backstretch, ran close near the rail on the turn but flattened inside the
eighth pole. DENALI D'ORO chased the early pace inside, ran off the rail on the turn then eased to the outside leaving the turn and passed rivals. REAL
APPEAL gave chase, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and showed little in the lane. SHENANDOAH CAT gave close early chase then faded off
the rail on the turn. YESSIROFFICER saved ground.

Footnotes
PENGUIN PARADE tapered in to stalk about the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled for the nod two deep approaching the head of the
lane and dug in under steady handling to hold on. C R'S UNCLE LINO settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
steadily improved in the four path of the far turn, dug in for second later yards and was gaining on the winner. NOID stalked off the rail, rallied to the front
two deep approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was met into the lane and relented the final sixteenth. AZURE
FIRE was bumped leaving the gate and raced well back off the rail the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled
to the outside leaving the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. FREEDOM RIDER rated close toward the inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. MY BOY CLYDE raced well back about the three path the first turn and was not a factor.
STRONG LIL KOKORO broke inward and made contact with Azure Fire, then saved ground. HOPPING HENRY took the lead at the three quarter pole and
moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was caught and checked in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole
and gave way in the three path of the far turn.

THE SKY IS FALLING stalked off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and moved to even terms toward the top of the lane, dueled clear past the
eighth pole and held well with steady handling. HESSICA angled in and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, ran at the rail on
the far turn, was met into the lane, dropped back past the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. SENECA ROCKS bobbled at the rail in the vicinity of
the eleven sixteenths pole then stalked inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced wide on the far turn but
came along for third late yards. AIM'S JUBILEE bobbled at the break then settled back in the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole
but flattened in the four path of the far turn. MY JUBA saved ground.

FREE SAILIN saved ground close to the pace, closed the gap from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, left the turn three wide, dug in for
the lead later yards and ran clear toward the wire. JUNGLE BEAST settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid approaching the three eighths
pole and took the lead past the five sixteenths, drew clear midway on the far turn, but was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. STORMIN ROCKET
stalked from the four path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, drifted into the lane but
came back to recover third inside the sixteenth pole. PRIMETIME JET rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole but
was met past the pole, dropped back at the rail leaving the quarter pole then flattened in the lane. LATE IN THE GAME came away a bit awkwardly and
raced well back from early contention, rounded the far turn about the five path and passed rivals in the lane. RUN TO DAYLIGHT saved ground, bid mildly
leaving the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. SPIRIT OF WINDSOR rated close to the early pace inside, picked up the chase
nearing the three eighths pole but faded toward the far turn. WELL EQUIPPED stalked the early pace about the three path then faded through the
backstretch.
