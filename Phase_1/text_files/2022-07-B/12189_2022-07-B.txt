Footnotes
GHOSTLY NIGHT , a forward factor three deep around the turn, gained the lead outside horses near the eighth pole and lasted. MADE MY WISH reared at
the break, raced two wide on the turn, moved outside in upper stretch and rallied. GIFT OF GAB , up close around the turn, advanced along the inner rail to
bid for the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. TIPSY TOURIST sprinted clear early, was in the two path turning for home and weakened the final furlong.
LOTTACLASS LILSASS lacked speed, swung outside in mid stretch and passed tired foes. AMARETTO SOUR raced between horses in the stretch and
was not a factor. HOV LANE ,a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, gave way in the stretch. SANCTIFIED TIME trailed after a sluggish start.
There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
JIMMY THE KID had speed between rivals then was rated back off the dueling leaders nearing the half mile pole, eased out to the three path approaching
the stretch, moved up under left handed asking and engaged FREE DANCER from his outside with a furlong to go, dueled, gained a slim lead inside the
sixteenth pole then was edging away at the wire. FREE DANCER sped to the early lead while off the inside, was joined from his inside by STROLL SMOKIN
leaving the five eighths, vied with that one while under rating, spurted clear heading towards the lane, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, fought gamely
but wasn't quite good enough through the final yards. TOMMY SHELBY lagged well back while saving ground, eased out a bit entering the lane, moved up
near mid stretch, shifted in and continued with interest to the wire. YES SIR ROBERT stalked outside the winner, ranged up four wide into the lane had aim
in mid stretch, failed to kick on past the sixteenth pole and faded. STROLL SMOKIN broke a bit slow then was hustled up along the rail to join FREE
DANCER, disputed the pace to mid turn, failed to match strides heading into the lane, chased to the three sixteenths then weakened.

Footnotes
MUSIC QUEEN saved ground around the turn, lacked room along the rail approaching the eighth pole, altered course to the four path, closed and gained
the lead late. BIZZY BIZZY lacked speed, was caught behind horses mid way on the turn, swung out turning for home, was fanned to the six path in mid
stretch and rallied outside foes. TANKA TOUGH , a forward factor in the three path on the turn, bid for the lead in mid stretch and weakened late. PRAY
FOR THE U S A , under urging soon after the break, chased the pace outside DEVIOUS, challenged for the lead between horses near the eighth pole and
faded. IN HER CUPS , fractious in the starting gate, came in at the break, floated five deep turning for home and lacked the needed rally. DEVIOUS sped to
the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way. LITTLE MISS MINION broke through the starting gate before the race, was two wide on the
turn and failed to menace. EXCUSEMEMISSMARGOT hugged the inner rail on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
DON'T TELL DEREN was hard sent from the gate and cleared early, set the pace towards the rail, turned away a challenge from CAMI RACHELLE entering
the lane, responded to right handed asking, drew away and was kept to a strong hand ride to deep stretch. MISS FUSSY PANTS chased the pace two to
three wide, shifted in past mid stretch and kept on willingly to gain the place. NAMAJUNAS bobbled slightly in behind at the gate, settled off the pace and
outside a rival, angled four wide gathering some steam into the lane, moved up past mid stretch, dropped in some late and kept on with interest between
runners. CAMI RACHELLE broke slowly, rushed up between runners soon after and stalked the pace, moved up two wide to loom a danger entering the
lane, was turned away by the winner soon after, chased to about the sixteenth pole then tired. MEAT SWEATS , three to four wide with pursuit, faded.
GRASS CUTTER , sluggish early, dropped in and failed to respond.

Footnotes
ANTIPOISON , unhurried down the backstretch, advanced three deep on the turn, gained command in upper stretch and held sway under steady handling.
DRIVE BY LAYOVER , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, raced inside the winner in the stretch and flattened out. FIVE STAR PHIL raced in
the two path on the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and passed tired horses. HAIR OF THE DOG , rated back from between horses near the six
furlongs pole, hugged the inner rail around the turn and faded in the drive. DIVINE PROPORTION , three deep on the turn, was not a factor. PIT STOP
MAN sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
BLAME THE IRISH rated kindly while about two wide, edged up a bit near the half mile marker and stalked, closed in and engaged the leader with a furlong
remaining, dueled under stout left handed encouragement, wrested command in deep stretch and prevailed. MISSAWLET advanced outside rivals nearing
the first turn to entertain the pace, took the lead outside IMINCHARGENOW and went clear into the backstretch, dropped in and set a rated pace, dug in
when confronted near the furlong grounds, sparred from there and just failed in a sharp effort. LIKE N' EAGLE , taken to rate off the inside, raced three wide
into the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, straightened and steadily closed the gap. FIRST LADY DI DA saved ground while not far back, eased out to
go between runners near the quarter pole, dropped back in, made progress past the sixteenth pole but was out kicked late. EXOTIC CAT rated three wide,
steadily moved up into the lane, chased between rivals in mid stretch then flattened out. WAY LUCKY drafted back off the pace, saved ground past the five
sixteenths, shifted out and had a mild kick through the final furlong. SALAGADOOLA , off the pace while saving ground, swung out in upper stretch but
lacked a serious run. IMINCHARGENOW led early and secured the inside, was headed from her outside around the first turn, rated back to stalk, stayed in
range to the quarter pole then weakened.

in mid stretch and had a slight rally. VOLNAY , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, drifted three wide turning for home and weakened. MI

Footnotes
ROYAL ENGAGEMENT settled off of a rapid pace while saving ground, eased out with run nearing mid stretch, closed in under a drive, took over to the
inside of a drifting FAST LANI with about seventy yards to go and kicked clear. FAST LANI vied inside a rival before pulling her way clear into the turn, set a
rapid pace under some rating, widened nearing mid stretch while off the inside, wandered outward through the final sixteenth, gave way grudgingly and just
saved the place. EIFS chased the pace, raced three wide in upper stretch, shifted in and rallied. CHROMEPLATED HEART broke sharply and disputed the
pace outside FAST LANI through the opening three sixteenths, rated back off that one and stalked around the turn, was under pressure chasing from upper
stretch, challenged between runners inside the sixteenth pole but was out kicked. TRITONE GAL settled off the pace while saving ground, angled four wide
into the lane but lacked a serious finish. ESCAPE FUND , a bit fractious in the gate, dropped off the early pace and failed to respond.

Footnotes
NOBLE BID bore in soon after the break, accelerated to the early lead, saved ground around the turn and steadily drew out through the stretch under a
hand ride. CANOODLE , pinched back after breaking a bit slowly, moved up on the turn, was well placed near the inner rail in upper stretch and gained the
place. COMBAT QUEEN , outside NOBLE BID around the turn, chased that one to mid stretch and weakened. TWEET AWAY ROBIN bore out leaving the
starting gate, chased the pace for three furlongs and drifted wide approaching the stretch. FORTES trailed. An objection by the rider of CANOODLE against
the winner for alleged interference leaving the starting gate was not allowed.

Footnotes
DR. FERBER broke outward, raced four wide into the first turn then dropped to the rail and settled well off of a spirited duel, gained while saving ground into
the far turn, eased out and knifed between foes past the three eighths, made a bold run to engage the leader near the quarter pole, seized command in
upper stretch and drew out under a drive. KNOWHOWIKNOW dueled outside HIGH PRINT through brisk opening fractions, shook clear leaving the far turn,
could not contain the winner's outside charge entering the lane but stayed on valiantly to be clear of the rest. KRUG , well placed off of the embattled
leaders, saved ground under pressure leaving the five sixteenths but lacked a serious stretch run. GHOST ON A MISSION , well back early and four wide
past the three quarter pole, dropped in some nearing the far turn, came back out in the drive and finished with interest. LAKE NAKURU , between rivals
while off the early pace, angled out leaving the far turn, made some progress when circling four to five wide into the lane but lacked a further response.
HIGH PRINT dueled inside through a strong pace, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and weakened. SILENT SERVICE , outside a rival while early
chase, moved up some past the three eighths, was lightly steadied near the quarter pole and tired.
