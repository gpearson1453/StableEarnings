Footnotes
TRINITY TITOLI was hustled from the start, established position just behind the leader, chased while moving from the inside to the three path around the
turn, took a short lead under a drive into upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, was given one final pop of a right-handed crop
outside the sixteenth-pole then drew clear under a hand-ride to prove much the best. MOMMASGOTTARUN came in a bit at the start then bumped a foe
with her hindquarters, moved up to press the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path around the turn, gained the lead inside the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive into upper stretch, came out under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, battled inside of the
winner into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the place. WATERS OF MEROM bumped with foes on both sides at the start and was last
away, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and tired while clear for the show. GRIS TORMENTA
was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, angled out at the
three-sixteenths and failed to threaten.. LEVIOSA came away well and went straight to the front, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied along
the rail on the turn, lost the lead inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way. AMORE FIRE bumped with a rival at the start
then was taken in hand, was allowed to drop to the rear under some restraint, fell well behind late on the backstretch while still in hand, went around the turn
in the four path, was shaken up briefly outside the quarter-pole then taken back in hand into upper stretch and was eased then walked off.

ZOOMER was hustled from the gate, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, took the lead with seven-sixteenths to run, was roused outside the
quarter-pole, extended the advantage while put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. TWO THIRTY FIVE went four wide
around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide around the far turn, chased outside into upper stretch, pursued the
winner under a drive into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead coming to the sixteenth-pole and earned the place. WAR STOPPER was hustled
from the start, saved ground on the first turn, came a bit off the rail down the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the far turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and tired while well clear for the show. LOCALLY OWNED went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, went
three then four wide while roused on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came up empty. INDIMAAJ was hustled to the front, set the pace
under pressure to his outside, lost the lead along the rail at the seven-sixteenths and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off. CRAFTY

Footnotes
YARROW chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied with good energy
digging in to the inside of a quartet seventy yards from home and was up in the very last jumps to the wire. NEURO got steadied after the start when
SHERIFF BIANCO came outwards slightly taking over the lane and conceded three to four lengths of ground before settling into stride, chased just off the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and nudged TWO DOWN to the seven path straightened away when floating
six wide, closed well outside a quartet and missed at the end. SHERIFF BIANCO got bumped at the start by TWO DOWN, who broke outwards, raced three
then two wide in closest aim of the leader applying pressure through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, took over narrow command spinning
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on when clinging to command over a foursome inside the final sixteenth but was nailed on the
end. ATHENRY four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied
to get on near even terms for the front a furlong out, battled on to the finish amongst a quintet and was out-finished in the final strides. VETERANS BEACH
tracked the pace along the inside coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a bid but
was out-finished. TWO DOWN broke out at the start brushing the off side stall before bumping SHERIFF BIANCO and was away awkwardly conceding four
to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
was nudged seven wide straightened away by NEURO, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. DISCO DEANO established the front and showed the way
in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and was displaced from the front at that
station when spinning from the two path into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent to the eighth pole before weakening in the late stages. BE THE
BOSS tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SARATOGA PROMISE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
tipped four to five wide for home and tired.

with a foe at the start, went to the front, set the pace on the outside under pressure to his inside, vied in the two path around the turn, was asked inside the
five-sixteenths, dueled outside of the winner while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and was denied while just able to hold the place. MAJESTIC
TIGER settled well off the pace, went three then two wide around the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, gained under a
left-handed crop into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole then had the rider switch the crop to his right-hand, saw the rider drop his reins
just inside the sixteenth-pole and closed fast while drifting back in some but was too late while clear for the show. FORESTWOOD LANE settled off the
pace, was roused while moving from the rail to the two path around the turn and gained some but failed to menace. SCORPION DYNASTY had a shoe
repaired in the paddock, raced well back in the field, was urged three wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

SUCCESS was urged along in the front half of the field, went two then three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty.
JUMPSTER settled on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went five to six wide around the turn and was no factor. REVENIO was
bumped solidly in the hindquarters just after the start, raced outside under urging, brushed with a foe around the half-mile pole, went five wide on the turn
and failed to respond. BRUNATE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, brushed with a rival near the half-mile pole, went four

Footnotes
LADY THORNHILL settled unhurried just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go and came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths tipping out to swing six wide for home when let out for the drive, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, came in under a right
handed crop forcing RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA to shy in which in turn pushed FIST FULL OF DICE in behind NEW GINYA causing her to steady off that
leader's heels, got pulled outwards and dug in to just get up on the wire and prevail. NEW GINYA tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until
roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command at the three-sixteenths getting brushed and nudged by JUST OK IS NOT OK
due to pressure from FIST FULL OF DICE coming inwards, dug in under threat from a trio to the sixteenth marker when LADY THORNHILL came inwards
putting a pause on a pair and was nailed on the wire by the lone rival left from the fracas of the stretch run. RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA got steadied off the
heels of a rival into the first turn as I'M FINE also steadied briefly in front, tracked the pace just off the inside from near the rear of the field, tucked briefly
inside before tipping back to the two path put to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the
final furlong, shied in when LADY THORNHILL came inwards a sixteenth out and was paused when nudging FIST FULL OF DICE in behind NEW GINYA,
then kept on to preserve the show honors on the wire. MASTEROF THE TUNES three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. FIST FULL OF DICE hustled from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the front, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, came in at the three-sixteenths when getting on near even terms for command and bumped
and forced JUST OK IS NOT OK to check out between rivals at that station which in turn also forced an additional pair of I'M FINE and BELLA
PRINCIPESSA to steady and alter in behind, dug in latched on the leader, began to be shaken off and was bumped inwards by RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA
when LADY THORNTON came inwards under a right handed crop forcing RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA to shy in and continued on in hand to the wire. I'M FINE
steadied briefly into the first turn, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, got
forced to take very brief hold and was altered out as JUST OK IS NOT OK checked in front and was outkicked thereafter. JUST OK IS NOT OK showed the
way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in between foes and had FIST FULL OF
DICE come inwards and was nudged and forced to check out in tight just inside the three-sixteenths which in turn forced an additional pair to s. BELLA
PRINCIPESSA coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got set down continuing just off the inside for home, got forced to
steady and alter just inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish. STARSHIP BELMONT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and offered no response. VALLELUJAH chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
went four to five wide for home and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA and FIST FULL OF DICE
which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
BIG INVASION was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, raced in the two path under tight restraint early on
the turn, jostled with NOBALS while shifting three wide for room at the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead inside the
three-sixteenths, inched away into the final furlong and extended the advantage to the wire under strong handling. RUN CURTIS RUN brushed the outside
of the gate at the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, turned two to three wide into upper stretch under a drive,
battled inside of the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished while able to get the place. SURPRISE BOSS was hustled to the front, showed the way
under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into
the final furlong and weakened. SKY AND SAND settled on the inside, saved ground around the turn, was roused in the two path into the stretch then
moved out around the three-sixteenths, chased while remaining on his inside lead to the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that juncture and just
missed the show. ASYMMETRIC (IRE) was taken in hand early then reserved off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, bumped with
NOBALS and forced his way out five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. NOBALS settled on the outside, went three wide early on the turn,
was jostled and forced out to the four path at the five-sixteenths then bumped and forced out to the six path into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
THREE TWO ZONE five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from near the rear of the field, tucked three wide into the turn and steadily
advanced coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and floated briefly four wide before being corrected to the three
path so as not to open a seam for SOUND MONEY in behind the top trio, got floated outwards by GUN IT just outside the eighth pole heads part for
command now with a pair, seized command inside that station and edged away kept to task to score. SOUND MONEY coaxed from the gate, raced four
paths off the inside until tucked to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, tucked inside half a mile out before coming under coaxing at the three-eighths
back in the two path, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, was in behind rivals when GUN IT came outwards slightly under a left handed stick
nearing the eighth pole and bid through the now open seam to get on near even terms at that station, then ran on to chase the winner home clear for the
place honors. GUN IT five paths off the inside down the backstretch, advanced on the front nearing the half mile pole and tucked to the two path at that
station, took over narrow command at the three-eighths, knocked heads with NIGHT TIME through the latter portion of the turn and continued just off the
inside for home, drifted out under a left handed crop nearing the eighth pole carrying THREE TWO ZONE to the four path, then weakened in the late stages
while well clear for the show honors. FORTIN HILL broke inwards striking the near side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened. NIGHT TIME coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside
half a mile from home, got headed midway on the turn and dueled through to inside the three-sixteenths, yielded at that juncture and weakened.
SUPREMACY hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no
impact. AMERICAN POWER hustled from the start, showed brief speed three wide pressing the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths when in
retreat, continued three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
OUR JESSICA was taken in hand early, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated outside down the backstretch, raced three wide while roused
on the far turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch and powered away under steady urging. OAK LOVES A FIGHT moved in early, settled in the two path,
was roused on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place. JANNIE MAE was hustled to the front, showed the way on
the inside, extended the advantage around the far turn, lost the advantage under urging in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened
but held the show. DATS A SUPERSTAR settled on the inside, shifted three wide at the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick. SKYWARD PRINCESS went two to three wide on the turns, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. INKBLOT was well
placed on the inside, continued to save ground while asked on the final turn and came up empty. TAPPLE CIDER angled in nicely down the initial
straightaway, was reserved on the inside, came under urging on the final turn, cut the corner into the stretch, chased against the rail into the final furlong,
checked while blocked behind horses into the final sixteenth and lost any chance at the minor awards. MUCHO MAMA MIA broke a bit slow, moved in near
the back early, went around the first turn in the two path, raced at the rear, came under coaxing prior to the half-mile pole, was roused in the two path on the
far turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. MISS MALALA rounded the first turn in the three path, settled near the middle of the field, was
roused in the two path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. LOLA LOLA prompted the pace on the outside in the two path, dropped back
outside the half-mile pole, was asked in two path on the far turn and also came up empty. I'LL GO ALL IN broke out then was corrected the rider, went three
wide on the first turn, settled outside near the back, was roused four wide on the far turn, moved out around the furlong marker and was no factor. DANCE
FOR BOURBON went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn and failed to respond.
