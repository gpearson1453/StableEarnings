POSITIVE POWER was well rated along the inside, made steady advance along the inside, shifted out and made a four wide bid leaving the turn and drew
off in the final furlong to prove much the best, driving. ANNA ROCKS set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the turn and proved to be no match
for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. SUGAR STREAK chased the pace four to three wide and weakened, bested rest. TIZ A SHARPIE
was settled four to five wide and was not a threat. BETTER YET stalked the pace three wide and stopped on the turn, eased through the lane, walked off.

best under a mild drive. THE TRAIN vied for the lead between horses, then was two wide by the quarter pole and kept on gamely to the wire to be second
best. SURFER BOY GEORGE tracked the pace four wide and had no late kick while being up for the show award. ESPRESSO CALIENTE was rated along
the inside, shifted out in the drive and had a belated rally while in traffic. TERRY'S CHARM was allowed to settle, came five wide into the drive and had a
belated rally to finish on even terms for the fourth position. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was settled from between rivals, then was bumped in the drive and had no
rally. MINE TO HOLD vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the drive.

TROUBLE COFFEE was well rated early on the inside, advanced in hand on the turn to be in the pocket behind the pace setters by the quarter pole, angled
out wide leaving the turn and closed well on the outside to edge away late, driving. DRAMATIZED pressed the pace from between horses into the first turn,
then made a two to three wide bid on the turn and led by the sixteenth pole but was caught. LEAVE 'EM LOADED set a pressured pace on the inside and
dug in gamely in the drive but gave way grudgingly. TEMPUS was reserved early, came seven wide into the lane and had a late rally. VISHNU pressed the
pace four to three wide and weakened. ABDAA tracked the pace four to three wide and then came up empty. BREVARD PLACE was settled on the inside
and had no response.

SHANIA SEA stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then drew clear leaving the turn and then held sway under strong
left handed crop urging. AUTOMATED TELLER was reserved early, made a four wide move on the turn and came five wide into the drive and closed well
late. FEARLESS GIRL chased the pace and was o0n the inside on the turn, then was slowly gaining late but needed more, held show award. VALENTINA'S
CUPID was allowed to settle early, then was two to three wide on the turn, in a little tight by the quarter pole and then had a mild late rally. ASGATA was
away alertly to set the early pace, then was headed on the turn and blew the turn, weakened on the far outside in the lane. MADAMME IN LOVE was off
slowly and had no speed, not a factor. VICTORY REIGNS chased the early pace, then dropped to the inside by the three eighths marker, stopped.
