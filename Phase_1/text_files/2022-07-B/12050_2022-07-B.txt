FAST CASH settled early, bid outside on the turn, drifted out very wide into the stretch, took over nearing the eighth pole and moved clear in a moderate
drive. BIG HAMBONE well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out near the quarter pole then rallied to be second best. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN
alternated for the lead inside, led into the stretch then weakened. THE EXCEPTION chased off the pace wide, moved extremely wide into the stretch and
was no threat. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN eased back in the early stages, angled inside soon after and lacked a bid. LINDA'S NEKIA broke slowest and raced
far back throughout. HAZELS LITTLE MAN dueled outside, led briefly midway on the turn then gave way.

SHED A TEAR drew the perfect spot right outside the leader, quickened mid point on the turn, drew off, driving. BRACES broke sharp, relaxed three wide in
good stalking position, moved four wide through the turn, could not keep pace with winner, finished willingly. BIG IRISH EYES away last at the start, was
pushed along while inside runners, angled out five wide at the top of the stretch, and was trying through the lane. JOHNNY SWISH rushed up early to grab

Footnotes
THE ELLE TRAIN (IRE) firmly rated outside, bid into the stretch, collared the pacesetter, drew away and was being geared down late. BETTER CALL
MAMA quickly took control inside, was challenged into the stretch but proved no match for the winner. BETHPAGE chased within striking range outside then
rallied mildly while no threat to the top pair. DON DIVA raced closed up along the inside and began tiring on the turn. WIND TRYST trailed early then
passed fading rivals. DRINK THE TAP outrun from the start, moved closer to the inside on the turn and was no factor. GREAT DEVOTION fractious in the
gate, broke alertly and flashed speed briefly before stopping.

Footnotes
MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT reserved well back, moved boldly inside to the front, moved clear on the final turn and coasted home handily. SPRITE'S LADY
settled just behind the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn but was no match for the winner. NEW YORK ROCK STAR shuffled back between rivals into the
far turn then rallied wide while no threat to the top pair. RAPIDAMENTE moved closer to the contention wide before half a mile then faded. COME
STORMING angled inside on the first turn, chased within range and faltered. NANCY WORK dropped far behind and was always outrun. MISS IS ZIPPY
alternated for the advantage outside then was finished by the final turn. LADY WOOD set a pressured pace inside for half a mile then stopped. TIMES

Footnotes
LITTLEBITAMEDAL lacked speed, circled very wide advancing into the stretch then offered a late surge to get up in time. JUDICIAL MANDATE vied inside,
moved clear on the turn, continued well but was nailed late. FIRSTCADETE advanced three wide on the turn, drifted wide into the lane and finished willingly.
SHOULDA HAD IT prompted the leaders between foes then flattened out in the stretch. SEANY P was urged close up early along the inside then faltered in
the stretch. CLASSY SOLUTION dropped well behind and was never in contention. VEGAS LIFE alternated for the lead outside to the turn and faded.
MEGA MILLIONS raced far behind, moved wide on the turn and trailed.
