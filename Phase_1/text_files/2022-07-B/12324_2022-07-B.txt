Footnotes
OUR DREAM RYE'D broke a bit slow then was taken up off heels, spotted the front several lengths, saved ground on the first turn, moved out entering the
backstretch, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged three wide around the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into
the final furlong, drifted in coming to the sixteenth and held under confident handling late. DETERMINEDLY broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe, was
reserved while saving ground, raced behind horses while moving closer on the far turn, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to near the eighth-pole,
found room at that point then accelerated in pursuit of the winner, moved out to go around around a weakening foe in the final sixteenth and finished with
good energy for the place. RARIFIED FLAIR settled on the inside, moved closer on the far turn, shifted to the two path late on that bend, waited under
restraint while blocked from the quarter-pole to near the eighth-pole, altered out for room at that juncture and also finished with good energy while up for the
show. C'EST MAGNIFIQUE went three wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was roused while moving from the two path to the four path
around the final turn, rallied outside into the stretch then swept to the front at the three-sixteenths, drifted in nearing the eighth-pole, lost the advantage to
the winner into the final furlong and was out-kicked. AMERICA'S GUEST was backed out of the gate then reloaded, leaned in at the start then was urged for
several strides before being taken under a tight hold, tugged keenly at the bit into the first turn, saved ground while reserved towards the back, came under
urging near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out, lugged in a bit late and improved
position. AMERICAN HUSTLE bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, moved closer in the two then
three path around the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. SON OF A BIRCH brushed with a rival at the start, was taken in hand
while moving towards the front early, tucked into the two path while pulling hard nearing the first turn, moved out entering the backstretch, was rank while
hard to rate on the outside, made a three wide bid on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. GOOD RAPPORT broke out and brushed with
a foe, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, was urged along while inside to the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the
stretch, drifted in while still on his inside lead outside the furlong marker and was no factor. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) showed early speed, lugged out while
keen into the first turn, went four wide around that bend, tracked the pace under restraint down the backstretch, made a bid between foes in the two path
under urging on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. MONTEPULCIANO went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two
path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside under threat on the far turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
UNION DOLLY lunged at the start then brushed with a foe, settled towards the rear, slipped safely around several horses who were in trouble in the four
path nearing the five-sixteenths then tucked into the three path, raced in hand while off heels into upper stretch then tipped out for room, rallied on the
outside, closed fast to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. DIAMANT DAMHSA (IRE) disputed the pace on the inside
of a rival, inched clear along the rail on the turn, responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was
overtaken while clear for the place. DEVILLY was sent hard from the start, raced between horses under strong urging, chased three wide while still between
foes on the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but just held the show. LADY FIREFOOT broke a bit slow and was
last to commence, raced under restraint towards the rear, departed the backstretch along the rail, checked behind foes multiple times between the
three-eighths and five-sixteenths, moved to the four path shortly thereafter, angled out nearing the furlong marker and improved position to just miss the
show in a good effort. HOPE OVER FEAR brushed with an opponent at the start, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, spun five wide
into the stretch and tired. TREVISE was fractious in the gate, broke near the back of the field, settled at the rear, started the turn in the two then three path,
steadied behind foes outside the five-sixteenths then swerved five to six wide, was fanned out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response.
OUR SOUPER LOVE was urged along between horses, chased while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path
and came up empty. SPARKLING WATER moved in while settling under some urging, jostled with a foe leaving the backstretch, went three wide on the
turn, had a foe clip her heels outside the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. QUEEN DE LA CREME was sent hard from the start, disputed the pace on
the outside, chased in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and tired. CREEMORE was fractious in the gate, established a good
position after being hustled from the break, was taken up significantly while inside early on the turn, dropped back quickly against the rail and capitulated.
JABBERWOCK was urged along off the pace, jostled with a foe while lugging out leaving the backstretch, clipped heels outside the five-sixteenths then
checked, was taken wide into stretch and eased but walked off.

Footnotes
AMUNDSON coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace of HOT ROD RUMBLE from the outside four to five paths off the rail down the backstretch before
tucking two to three wide through the turn, took over command inside the five-sixteenths and began to shake away urged just off the inside into upper
stretch, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. QUICKFLASH six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four then three wide through the turn
under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home safe for the place honors. BIG BOBBY four paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the inside half a mile from home, came out a path under coaxing at the three-eighths and bumped MASKED
MARAUDER into BIG ENGINE at that station, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. BRONX BOMBER five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. FLYING EMPEROR bobbled at the break and was bumped between foes who each broke his way conceding a
length to the front, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MASKED
MARAUDER seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, got bumped three wide by BIG BOBBY and in turn
bumped BIG ENGINE four wide at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HOT ROD RUMBLE broke in a step
at the start bumping FLYING EMPEROR in tandem with BANK ON SHEA, showed the way from the two path under pressure from the get go from
AMUNDSON to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and was headed inside that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. BIG ENGINE eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn and was bumped four wide at the three-eighths by
MASKED MARAUDER due to pressure from BIG BOBBY, got coaxed along inside that station and swung three wide into upper stretch, then made no
impact. BANK ON SHEA broke out a step at the start bumping FLYING EMPEROR in concert with HOT ROD RUMBLE, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MARVELOUS MAUDE was taken up behind horses nearing the first turn, saved ground around that bend, settled a bit off the rail on the backstretch, went
two then three wide around the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, drifted in while making a bid coming to the sixteenth-pole,
took the advantage shortly thereafter and prevailed. FINEST WORK was in tight off heels nearing the first turn, raced inside to the two path while pulling
under stout restraint on that bend, was rated under a very tight hold, saved ground on the far turn,was asked at the quarter-pole, came between horses in
upper stretch, had dead aim on the leader into the final furlong then steadied when that foe came out in front, altered in some then regained momentum into
the final sixteenth and finished well to get the place. MISSY GREER went to the front, was well rated while inside to the two path, came under a drive in
upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, came out when switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and was
overtaken while able to hold the show. WICKED GROOVE was brushed in the hindquarters at the start, traveled around the opening bend in the two path,
was reserved on the outside, came under urging in the two path on the final turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, chased between foes in upper stretch,
made a bid between horses coming to the sixteenth-pole, was bumped then steadied shortly thereafter and lost her best chance while finishing willingly to
the wire. MALIBU CURL moved in early, was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick. ENSEMBLE (IRE) stalked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased between foes into the
final furlong, dropped back outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened. BLISSFUL broke awkwardly then bumped with a foe while last to commence, was
taken under tight restraint early, saved ground towards the rear, was urged on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch then moved further out and was
no factor. LADY EMILY was bumped in the hindquarters near the seven-eighths, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three
then four wide around the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. LINNY KATE bumped with a rival at the start then was
taken in hand early, became very rank nearing the first turn, came out and bumped the hindquarters of a foe at the seven-eighths then was checked while
bearing out eight to nine wide into the bend, dropped in before the three-quarter pole, settled at the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path and was no
factor.

MISTER CHAIRMAN just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong to knock heads with the runner up, bobbled awkwardly just inside the sixteenth
marker but got the nod on the wire to prevail. HEYMACKIT'SJACK brushed at the start by BUILT TO LAST, who broke out a step, chased just off the inside
in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong out, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe through to the finish but lost the bob on the line. FEATHERS ROAD saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took the inside route into upper stretch, ran on with good energy inside the
top pair to secure the show honors clear of the rest. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. FUOCO just off the duel five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn
advancing to take over three furlongs from home, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught a furlong out, then
weakened to the finish. KIMBO DANCER chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered no
response. CENTRAL PRIDE stumbled at the start and lost his lane, chased just off the inside under light coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and had no response. BUILT TO LAST broke out at the start brushing HEYMACKIT'SJACK, dueled from the two path with
HERONEANDONLY to the outside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, yielded the front at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened. BUCKORTWO three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, paused briefly off the heels of HERONEANDONLY
at the quarter pole before swinging seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HERONEANDONLY dueled three then two wide getting overtaken in
tandem with his main pace rival at the three-eighths, faded under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and swung five wide for home, then tired in the stretch.

JACKIE'S WARRIOR came away in good order, showed speed on the inside of DOC AMSTER, was eased back nearing the nine-sixteenths then switched
out over heels, moved back up to re-engage the aforementioned opponent with half-mile to run, cruised around the turn in the three then four path, took over
around the five-sixteenths, accelerated clear without being asked into upper stretch, extended the advantage with the rider poised like a statue in the irons
into the final furlong, remained well clear without the rider moving his hands an inch into the final sixteenth and prevailed very handily. KNEEDEEPINSNOW
moved out near the five-eighths pole, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged three then four wide around the turn then driven six wide into the stretch,
gained outside on the un-asked winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. WILLY BOI was well placed down the backstretch, chased two
then three wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive, moved in some around the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while
able to get third money. NY TRAFFIC settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
DOC AMSTER was hustled from the start, showed speed on the outside then moved clear briefly around the nine-sixteenths, was challenged by the winner
on the outside with a half-mile to turn, vied a bit off the rail on the turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.
LONG RANGE TODDY was hustled from the gate, raced on the outside under urging, was carried out by the winner at the nine-sixteenths, chased on the
outside, went four then five wide around the turn, dropped back under the crop into upper stretch and tired.

EPICENTER saved ground through the first turn at the tail of the compact field before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch, raced just off the
inside through the far turn patiently handled as rivals got busy in front of him midway and through the latter portion of the bend, got given a cue angling five
wide into upper stretch, quickly rallied under light hand urging to take command at the eighth pole, then edged clear lightly urged to the sixteenth marker
before being taken back in hand in the final jumps to the finish. ZANDON three wide through the first turn, tracked his barn mate four paths off the inside
down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive heads apart for command a furlong from home, then ran on to chase the winner home safely securing the place honors over a rival at the
end. TAWNY PORT bobbled at the break recovering outwards and trading a bump with EARLY VOTING, saved ground through the first turn before tracking
the leader the innermost of the quartet from the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and advanced mildly coming under light
coaxing three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch and rallied up an inside seam as the quartet stacked across the track at the eighth pole, then
kept on to the finish unable to match the top pair late. EARLY VOTING bobbled at the break recovering inwards and trading a bump with TAWNY PORT,
established the front a jump or two after the showed the way three wide through the first turn before settling in hand two to three wide down the backstretch,
remained patiently handled and uncontested through to nearing the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside
into upper stretch loosely between foes, dug in under a drive under threat from a trio and was collared at the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages
to the end.

Footnotes
RICOCHET went around the first turn in the two path, was rated under a tight hold in the second flight while inside of a foe, traveled around the far turn in
the two path, rallied four wide into stretch, closed strongly to make a bid into the final furlong, took the lead at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong
urging. ORCHESTRATION brushed with foes while between horses nearing the first turn, settled in the two path, was roused on the far turn, came four wide
into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, moved out some near the sixteenth-pole and finished well to just get the place. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY
bumped with a foe at the start, brushed with rivals nearing the first turn, went around that bend in the two path, was reserved towards the back, raced three
then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch, was fanned out near the furlong marker and finished with good energy to just miss the place
while up for the show. C FALLS went to the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was asked on the far turn, battled with IRWIN under a drive
into the final furlong, fought on well into the final sixteenth but was outfinished while able to share the last spot in the superfecta. IRWIN (IRE) prompted the
pace on the outside in the three path, drew even with the leader on the far turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, dueled outside of C FALLS into the final
furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked but shared the last spot in the superfecta. CAPENSIS was asked leaving the gate, went
five then four wide around the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, came in a bit while still on his inside lead in upper
stretch then swapped to the proper lead while corrected by the rider, pursued the vanguard between foes into the final sixteenth and was eased up in the
final strides then missed the superfecta. BAY STREET MONEY was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
asked three wide on the far turn, chased into the final furlong, lacked room behind horses outside the sixteenth-pole then altered course towards the outside
and finished willingly but missed the superfecta. EXULT was coaxed along early, brushed with rivals while between horses nearing the first turn then
steadied early on that bend, dropped from the three path to the rail, settled near the back, saved ground on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path and lacked the needed response. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) moved in early, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged
along late on the backstretch, raced two then three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths and was no
factor. AIRMAN bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, saved ground while reserved off the pace, came under urging on the far turn and failed to
rally. COLOSSEO went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside in the second flight, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and capitulated.

Footnotes
MAD MUNNYS coaxed from the gate to be forwardly placed, got conceded the lead by MO READY into the first turn when that rival got wrangled off the
front, showed the way in hand along the inside uncontested through sensible splits patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to the finish from late closing rivals. BARLEEWON got brushed at the start by MO
READY, chased two to three wide from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild kick to just latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the wire. THE LAST ZIP grew fractious in the gate rearing up and tossing the rider out the rear
prior to the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the
show honors. JACK THE CAT broke in at the start bumping TROUBLING MOON chased just off the inside until tucked inside midway down the backstretch,
came under coaxing along the fence three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up late foot. HEALING chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. BIG AGENDA chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home, made no impact. TROUBLING MOON got bumped at the start by JACK THE CAT, who broke
inwards, chased along the inside until tipped three wide through the far turn getting put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. HIEROGLYPHICS chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide at the head of
the stretch, came up empty. MO READY broke outwards brushing the off side stall and then brushed BARLEEWON, took command and came under a firm
hold getting wrangled back off the lead conceding the front to MAD MUNNYS, settled three then two wide in closest pursuit of that rival, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BAD GUY raced sluggish early on just off the inside through the first turn
quickly growing detached at the tail of the field, got guided outside down the backstretch and was placed to a protective hold and eased up before being
pulled up in the vicinity of the nine-sixteenths and was subsequently vanned off.
