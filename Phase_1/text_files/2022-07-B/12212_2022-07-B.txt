pressure. TRUE RUNNER stalked the pace, moved up four wide between rivals in the stretch run, surged late and just missed in a game effort. LOST WISH

break, dropped back early on, moved up through the far turn, swung seven wide into the upper stretch and gained ground well late. STALEMATE stalked
the pace from the inside and had no final winning bid. TEXAS THUNDER was quick to begin to cross over to the rail to set the early pace and gave way the

Footnotes
BRATTON tracked the early leader down the backstretch, moved up two to three wide in the stretch run and finished well to edge clear late under strong
pressure. MOHAYMEN HOLIDAY showed good early speed from the outside to cross over to the rail to set the early pace, dug in near the eighth pole but
couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. TAPADINE stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths
pole and made a good late gain. CAPITAL JOKE stalked the pace, raced along the inside at the quarter pole, shifted three to four wide and had no final
response. SPEIGH AMONGST US stalked the early going, raced towards the inside and had not enough. EXCAPING THE BLUES was forced to check
sharply early down the backstretch, raced four to five wide in the drive and lacked a rally. BAY BE GONE was unhurried early on, raced five into the upper
stretch and never threatened. WI SAPA was slow early and never threatened. RAIL TOWN settled off the pace, checked in the early stages, raced three
wide and never was a factor. HE SAID WAIT checked near the half mile pole and tired.

Footnotes
CLIFF DIVER settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the half mile pole, moved up three wide into the upper stretch and was well clear late under
steady handling. RED DEVIL was off a step slow, raced off the early going, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and was no match for the winner late.
GOLD PRIZE settled to the second flight, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and made a good late bid. GOLDEN PEGASUS was unhurried early
on, moved up five wide in the lane and showed good late interest. OPTIMAL TRIP stalked the pace, moved up three wide between rivals through the upper
stretch and flattened out. CUNNING stalked the pace from the outside and tired while racing three wide. SAINT PIO showed good early speed to set the
early pace along the inside and gave way while continuing to race near the rail. GOLDEN FLASH stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide near
the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. SECRET SURVIVOR dropped back early, raced towards the inside and had no response. PLUTONIUM
raced near the inside at the quarter pole and never was a factor. SIGNE was slow early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and never menaced. RED
BIRD'S STORM showed good early speed, was done early and eased up through the stretch run.

Footnotes
MIZONEY was out alertly then settled back and chased the leaders while two wide, was four wide coming into the stretch, dug in gamely and surged to the
wire to be up in time. BLAME IT ON MAMIE dueled from the inside into the turn, then rallied mid stretch, gained command by a neck and was in a hard drive
in the final furlong but was caught at the wire. MORNING TWILIGHT raced in the middle of the field along the rail into the turn, then menaced gamely in the
stretch and surged to the finish line to be up for the show prize. STACI'S RED DRESS dueled while two wide into the stretch, was in a hard drive but hung in
the end. MIDYEAR was unhurried early then came out five wide in the stretch to rally but it was too little too late. MY GOLDEN BLING chased the pace from
the inside, then came out three wide in upper stretch to menace but gave way in the end. COBRA CASABLANCA raced in the middle of the pack while two
wide then rallied in early stretch then flattened out in the end and was no threat. FAYETTE BLUE was unhurried early and no menace.
