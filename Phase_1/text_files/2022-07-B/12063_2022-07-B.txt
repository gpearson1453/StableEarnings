Footnotes
PRINCESS JAVONCIA stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, gained command in upper stretch and drew
clear under brisk urging. HOT CHOICE , kept outside horses down the backstretch, steadied behind the winner approaching the five sixteenths pole, was
four deep turning for home and rallied outside horses. BULLETS LADY , along the rail down the backstretch and around the far turn, eased out in upper
stretch and finished gamely between rivals. CHICA RABIOSA , rank entering the backstretch, chased the pace, moved up in the two path on the far turn and
weakened the final furlong. REAWAKENED set the pace along the inner rail and gave way approaching the eighth pole. APPALACHIANHEIGHTS ,
unhurried early, trailed. An objection by the rider of HOT CHOICE against the winner for alleged interference near the five sixteenths pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
MO MONEY MO HONEY broke a step slow, recovered and accelerated to the inside of rivals to take command, set a rated pace towards the inside, entered
the lane in the two path, moved away without being asked past the three sixteenths and remained under confident handling to the wire. ELUSIVE AGENT ,
forced in at the break, settled off the pace while two wide, moved up between runners entering the stretch and continued with good energy to be clear for
the place. PHRA PHROM was put in tight and steadied at the break, dropped off the early pace while saving ground, was under a hustling ride past the
three eighths, stayed inside for the stretch run and kept on with effort. HE ROLLS chased the pace towards the inside, angled four wide under pressure into
the lane and faded. FLAVIAN came in at the break bothering foes, straightened and moved up three wide to prompt the pace outside the winner, was under
a ride mid turn, failed to go on through the drive and faded. SURPRISE HELLO , off the rail, failed to keep pace.

Footnotes
GENERAL'S DUTY , three wide the first turn, raced in the three path around the far turn, was behind several horses in upper stretch, moved to the five path
in mid stretch, closed outside FLEETING ATTE and gained the lead approaching the finish. FLEETING ATTE saved ground around the turns, was under
urging entering the far turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, gained the lead near the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. THE LAST
SCIP stalked the pace, moved up in the three path on the far turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch, failed to sustain the move and steadied on the
heels of the winner when drifting out approaching the finish. RIPKEN , kept outside horses down the backstretch, circled five deep leaving the far turn and
lacked the necessary late response. WONDER WATER appeared to have energy between horses in upper stretch then was steadied in tight quarters
approaching the eighth pole. BOFFO KID , along the inner rail most of the trip, lacked a rally. SPIRITUAL GHOST , very wide the far turn, lacked a serious
rally. SEE OUT prompted the pace outside AMARILLO and gave way in upper stretch. SWALLOW BEACH was not a factor. AMARILLO , clear leaving the
first turn, set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and faltered. Objections by the rider of THE LAST SCIP against GENERAL'S DUTY
and FLEETING ATTE for alleged interference in deep stretch were not allowed.

Footnotes
SOARING BIRD rated kindly outside a rival while tracking a contested pace, took closer order mid turn, went on the attack four wide outside the leaders
approaching the lane, responded when set down soon after, quickly cleared under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. CROUCHELLI
lagged back off the embattled leaders, saved ground into the lane, got through towards the rail when advancing past mid stretch and kept on willingly to gain
the place. PIT BOSS settled off the rail and raced in the clear leaving the far turn, swung seven wide for the drive, made a mild run and just got the show in
the final jumps. HONOR THE FLEET , inside the winner while stalking the pace, shifted out five wide for the drive, moved up some in mid stretch then
flattened out. ALGEBRAIC disputed the pace to the inside of GLORY SONG, maintained a tenuous advantage to the quarter pole, stayed on a bit longer
then faded. GLORY SONG showed speed and vied outside ALGEBRAIC, stayed on to battle past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on while between
runners into the lane then weakened. RISING PERRY , between foes early, failed to keep pace and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
SOROLLA , unhurried three wide on the first turn, advanced four deep on the far turn, closed resolutely outside SOLOMON'S CHOICE, gained the lead late
and drove clear. SOLOMON'S CHOICE , three wide the first turn, gained the lead well off the inner rail on the far turn, held a clear advantage in mid stretch
and failed to hold off the winner. EYE'N A DEAL , rated when eager to go soon after the break, raced in the three path between horses on the far turn,
eased outside for the drive and rallied nicely. ORO GRIS raced inside horses throughout and finished willingly. ICANDOTHAT gained a two wide lead
leaving the backstretch, lost the advantage on the far turn, chased the leader while between horses in the stretch and faded late. GALWAY LAD , along the
inner rail chasing the pace down the backstretch, lacked a rally. PHOTO COPY , three wide the far turn, was not a factor. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON was
not a factor. HOOKEAI showed speed along the inner rail and gave way on the far turn. BOURBONONTHEROCKS , wide on the first turn, gave way on the
far turn and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
GERRYS GEM quickly went clear, set a rated pace just off the inside, was guided out a bit further and put to a ride nearing the lane, responded when set
down right handed past the furlong grounds and eagerly drew away. BOWIE TWO STEP stalked the winner two wide, shifted four wide soon into the lane,
gave game chase to the wire and was clearly best of the rest. AMICALOLA FALLS , off the early pace, raced three deep approaching the turn, circled and
offered a mild response. DISPUTED NOTION rated behind foes near the half mile marker, angled out leaving the three eighths, made a four to five wide run
into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then flattened out. UNCOMMON VALOR , bumped and in tight at the break, raced well back into the turn, angled
eight wide for the drive and finished with interest. NO MONEY DOWN saved ground chasing the pace and came up empty. DONTFORGETTOBLINK drifted
in at the break, was sent up between runners soon after but failed to get on track. WINSTON'S GOLD , jostled at the break, raced well back early, angled
six wide into the stretch but failed to make any headway. FRANCIS X. edged up four wide nearing the half mile marker, pursued off the rail to the head of
the lane then gave way.

Footnotes
ENGLISH TAVERN lacked speed, circled horses while four deep around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and
bumped EONS in deep stretch when drifting out. EONS , rated back soon after the start, raced in the three path inside ENGLISH TAVERN on the far turn,
failed to keep up with that one entering the stretch, eased outside ENGLISH TAVERN in upper stretch, was herded a bit in mid stretch and just missed after
being bumped in deep stretch. PIXELATE , along the inner rail stalking the pace, was in hand while blocked from the head of the stretch to the three
sixteenths pole, angled out for room in mid stretch and rallied late inside the top two. NICK PAPAGIORGIO showed speed, dropped back between horses
leaving the backstretch, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. NATHAN DETROIT showed speed, offered a two wide bid for the lead on
the far turn and tired in the drive. BEACON HILL set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. Following a stewards' inquiry and an
objection by the rider of EONS, ENGLISH TAVERN was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
CHUB WAGON , nudged from the gate to get the early advantage, was joined from her inside after a furlong then ceded briefly to CHEETARA (CHI),
sparred with that rival while under rating, regained command three furlongs out, went clear under some coaxing approaching the lane, thwarted a challenge
from KAYLASAURUS then kicked away when put to a drive soon after, drifted in some under right handed asking then straightened and proved resolute to
the wire. KAYLASAURUS rated off the leaders while about three wide early on, responded when put to asking and advanced four wide past the five
sixteenths, had her sights on the winner entering the stretch, failed to kick on with that one but gave game chase to the end. CHEETARA (CHI) was sent up
to the inside of the winner and gained a short advantage, dueled into the turn and past the three eighths, failed keep pace while under heavy pressure past
the quarter pole but continued to give good effort to the finish. BUY THE BEST steadied at the break, angled in early and edged up to stalk the leaders,
shifted out five wide for the drive, gave hard chase to mid stretch then failed to sustain. FILLE D'ESPRIT was thrashing around in the gate pre race, was
backed out and examined, dropped off the early pace, failed to respond past the five sixteenths and was eased late.

narrow quarters to challenge for the lead near the eighth pole then failed to sustain the bid. COCONUT CAKE raced in the three path on the far turn reached
contention between horses in upper stretch and lacked the needed late response. PETRICOR (GB) , lightly steadied at the break, was taken to the inner rail
approaching the first turn, remained along the rail down the backstretch, encountered traffic entering the far turn, checked lacking room near the quarter
pole, worked through a maze in mid stretch and steadied lacking room in deep stretch. ALMS chased the pace two wide down the backstretch, bid for the
lead on the far turn, remained battling inside horses to the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. TIC TIC TIC BOOM stalked the pace down the
backstretch, moved up three deep to challenge for the lead mid way on the far turn, remained prominent to the eighth pole then weakened. TIGHTLY
TWISTED raced in mid pack and lacked a rally. DOUBLE FIREBALL set a pressured pace along the inner rail, weakened leaving the far turn and was

Footnotes
BEREN vied between rivals, took over while under a light hold nearing the quarter pole, responded to firmer asking and kicked clear leaving the three
sixteenths, kept on under solid right hand encouragement inside the furlong grounds then held firm while kept alert. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS , three deep
attending the pace, moved to near even terms mid turn, failed to kick on with the winner in upper stretch but kept on with solid effort to be clearly second
best. PICKIN' TIME , off the pace and outside a rival, swung seven wide for the drive, straightened away and closed steadily. WAR TOCSIN , under asking
to the inside of rivals while chasing the pace, eased off the rail for the drive, came out bothering KARAN'S NOTION near mid stretch then churned on with
interest. THREES OVER DEUCES , three deep pursuing the three leaders, angled five wide into the lane, drifted in some near mid stretch then lacked the
needed kick. ROYAL URN , off the pace while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch and offered a mild kick. SPECIAL RESERVE broke sharply and
took the early lead, was hounded by rivals to his outside, dueled from the five sixteenths, was under asking heading into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch
then gave way. KARAN'S NOTION , between runners chasing the pace, checked when put in tight near mid stretch and dropped back.

clear. SOMMER VELVET dueled outside NO MORE MASK, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and weakened late. SHINY PENNY , soundly bumped by
SPECIAL FREEDOM leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, eased out for the drive, drifted out in mid stretch and rallied. NO MORE MASK

leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace, drifted wide in upper stretch and faltered. SPECIAL FREEDOM soundly bumped SHINY PENNY when bearing in
leaving the starting gate then trailed.
