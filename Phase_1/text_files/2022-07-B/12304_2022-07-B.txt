Footnotes
TOP OF MY GAME broke out, chased the speedy trio from outside, bid four deep on the turn, moved in while dueling with PAT'S PADDOCK past the
quarter pole, maintained a short lead to midstretch and drew away late. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK broke a step slow then went up to take control, vied outside
rivals up the backstretch, inched ahead on the turn, put away inner rivals and angled to the inside while dueling with TOP OF MY GAME, fought back to the
sixteenth pole and could not match the winner late while clearly second best. CORTESE broke inward at the start, lugged in shortly after, challenge inside a
pair of rivals for the lead, lost contact with a quarter mile left to run and stayed on to hold third. SUBURBAN PRINCE broke out, raced off the pace early on,
took the turn four to five wide and improved position. SABURO'S GRACE broke slow, asked two then three wide on the turn and could not rally. LORD OF
LIGHT dropped back early, rounded the bend three then two wide, angled out entering the drive and failed to rally. CAPACITY stumbled a bit at the start,
saved ground through the turn and failed to menace. TRUSTY RUSTY vied for the lead between rivals, could not keep up with the leaders midway around
the turn, went two wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MOBOU went four wide around the first turn, moved into range in the middle stages, bid four deep and took over at the quarter pole, cleared leaving the
bend and drew off under right-handed urging. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE got shuffled between rivals entering the first turn, went four to five wide around that
bend, gained while still widest through the far turn, rallied for the place but could not get to the winner. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT stalked in the two path early,
entered the far turn along the inside then eased out to the four path leaving the bend and kept on to gain the show. HOTROD RIDE angled to the inside
early from off the pace, tipped out leaving the far turn and summoned a mild response to round out the superfecta. NOLONGERAHOBBY stalked outside a
rival or three wide early, challenged three deep on the far turn, took over at the five-sixteenth pole, relinquished the lead near the quarter pole and
weakened in the lane. HAPI HAPI angled to the inside trailing early, moved off the rail on the far turn and came three wide into the stretch and passed tired
rivals. HOOP DREAM raced off the rail early, came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. QUICK BUCK set the pace from inside under
pressure, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole and folded. MAJESTIC WIND away well then pressed from outside in hand, bid between foes on the far
turn, could not keep up with a quarter mile left to run and faded.

Footnotes
COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) got shuffled between rivals early, stalked inside, between on the backstretch, coaxed two wide on the far turn, rallied from
outside and closed fast to overtaken the runner-up late. GREEN EYED LADY pressed the pace from inside, moved up to duel and took control on the
backstretch, disposed of outside rival at the five-sixteenths pole, led clear into the final sixteenth and got run down late. FREE AND HUMBLE stalked two
wide early, moved out to the thee path on the far turn then took aim two wide into the stretch, finished willingly through the lane but lacked the needed late
punch. QUARANTELLA raced two wide near the back early, between foes in the middle stages, altered out from behind troubled rival at the quarter pole,
came three wide into the stretch and kept on to best the rest. ALWAYS AT EASE broke a step slow in the beginning, raced a bit green early, steadied
slightly off heels entering the far turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and improved position. DANCING MO became fractious in the gate,
broke out a step slow, got crowded and became rank early and on the first turn, got forced out at the quarter pole and came four wide into the stretch and
could not rally. LOLLIPOP GUMDROP settled on the inside, got put in a bit tight entering the far turn, tipped out to the two path and could not threaten in the
stretch. BOLD CONNECTION stalked the speed from inside, got impeded and checked hard at the quarter pole and weakened after. BOLT FOR ALLISON
broke a step slow from outside, went three wide on the first turn, traveled two then three wide on the second bend and weakened. DADDY CLASSY DILL
set the pace under pressure then dueled up the backstretch, lost contact with the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, chased and came in at the quarter pole
and faded.

two wide into the stretch, kept to task down the lane and missed the place. WEDDING GROOM stumbled leaving the gate, set the pace inside a trio of
rivals, went two to three wide around the turn, lost command into the stretch and flattened late to lose the place and show. QUICK INTRO settled five deep
early, took the turn three then four wide outside rivals and could not find more in deep stretch. THUNDERHEART bumped leaving the gate, showed early

MO THEM DOWN sped clear and angled to the rail, set the pace on the inside to the stretch, then drew away and remained strong to the wire. LAW
ABIDING forwardly placed in the two path leaving the chute and shifted in a bit shortly after, moved to the inside stalking the pace then became rank
entering the clubhouse turn, saved ground to the stretch, chased willingly through the drive but had to settle for second best. NAISMITH stalked outside a
rival or in the two path, chased between foes on the far turn then got crowded into the stretch, kept to task in the drive and edged rivals for the show honors.
MAYNARD trailed off the rail early, moved closer three deep up the backstretch, remained outside a pair of rivals into the stretch and lacked a late bid.
MITAD DEL MUNDO raced two wide and outside a rival early from off the pace, got bumped past the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane and
got edged for the show. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT angled to the inside early after dropping back, got boxed in early on the far turn, steered out into the stretch
and improved. CRYPTO MUNNY pulled between early then moved inside, stalked along the rail, drifted out, bumped rival and checked past the
five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN BOX came away slow, became very rank and was hard to ride early,
settled outside a rival in the middle stages, raced wide into the lane, moved out and could not rally. LOOKOUT POINT raced wo wide early then moved
inside near the back, tipped to the two path and went between foes at the quarter pole and failed to menace. FLYING FRED chased from inside then began
to pull first time in the stretch and continued to fight the rider through the clubhouse and onto the five-eighths pole, settled into stride and chased four wide
into the stretch and had little left for the drive. DUAL THREAT broke slow from inside, got floated out into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NEWGATE got bumped from inside at the start, raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, moved up to duel on the turn, disposed of HARD TO
FIGURE in upper stretch and drew away under hand urging. ARROWTHEGREAT broke slow to begin, settled in mid-pack well off the rail, went four then
three wide around the turn, rallied and gained the place. HARD TO FIGURE set the pace on the inside to the turn, dueled with the winner around the bend,
could not kick on with NEWGATE in upper stretch and flattened to third late. ODONATA forwardly placed in the early going from outside, urged while
rounding the bend three wide and lacked further response in the late stages. RIVERSIDE was off slow then steadied shortly after the start, steered to the
inside, moved out around the bend and came four wide into the stretch and produced a mild rally. SOUTH COAST ROUTE broke out and bumped rival,
race in range off the rail, lost ground three then two wide around the bend and weakened. GAME TIME was off a bit slow to start, stalked the speed from
inside into the turn, lost ground through the bend and weakened. KOLOMIO stumbled badly leaving the gate, angled to the rail on the turn then moved back
out nearing the stretch and was not a factor. MIDNIGHT TAXES was off slow to start, raced at the back outside a rival, went two to three wide around the
bend and failed to menace.

guided out and entered the lane four wide, put in mild bid in the stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. WHOOPING JAY vied for the lead between early,
fought with outside pair from the rail position around the bend, stayed on to the midstretch and weakened. COTOPAXI (IRE) brushed leaving the gate, vied

from inside, vied along the rail through the turn, then flattened in the late stages. PRINCIPE CARLO broke a step slow, went up to press from outside while
in hand, vied three deep around the bend, bumped with rival at the eighth pole and weakened. DRAIN THE CLOCK stumbled leaving the gate but recovered

remaining, was overtaken with a quarter mile remaining and weakened down the lane. DIAMOND OOPS sat off the pace, went three deep into the turn,
moved out and entered the lane four to five wide and could not summon the needed response. BAGBOSS was off a bit slow, chased on the inside then

Footnotes
GOLIAD showed early speed from inside and cleared rival on the clubhouse turn, opened up on the backstretch, remained clear into the lane and held
safely. COALINGA ROAD traveled along the inside well off the pace early, lacked room on the far turn, tipped out to a clear path, rallied and whittle the gap
on the winner late. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR was off slow to begin, raced three deep at the back on the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and rallied
for the show. LAMMAS (GB) rated early in the two path then moved inside, was closest in pursuit through the far turn and into the stretch, asked through the
drive but lacked a late bid. ONE FAST BRO raced near the back through the early stages, traveled four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, moved in a bit and
came three wide into the stretch and could not respond in the stretch. LIBERAL (IRE) was off a bit slow from inside, trailed early, came four wide into the
stretch and improved position. PETRUCHIO settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and could not rally. NERVES OF STEEL sat off the pace in
the two path early, went outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, came two wide into the drive and weakened. PEACE OF EKATI traveled along the inside
at the back, moved out a bit on the far turn and made no impact. SHADRACK raced off the pace early on, traveled two wide, three wide at the
five-sixteenths pole, went two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. AXEL STEEL showed early speed then chased the leader around the first turn, got
shuffled and dropped back on the second bend and tired.

Footnotes
ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) chased four deep around the clubhouse turn, challenged outside the top trio and took over with a quarter mile left to run, put away
inside rivals at the top of the stretch and stayed clear under hand urging. COUNTRY GRAMMER forwardly placed three wide early, bid three deep and
fought through the far turn, could not keep up with the winner in upper stretch but stayed well for a clear second. STILLETO BOY away quickly in the
beginning, was overtaken on the clubhouse turn, pressed the pace from outside, vied between through the far turn, flattened in the late stages but saved the
show. MANDALOUN became rank entering the first turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out and kept on for a minor award. PARNELLI tracked
between foes and ran up on heels on the first turn, raced three to four wide into the far turn, traveled five wide at the five-sixteenths pole, driven four wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. TRIPOLI broke well then settled in a stalking position, driven two wide into the lane and failed to respond. DEFUNDED was
fractious in the gate, broke a step slow then was sent to take the lead from inside, set a pressure pace up the backstretch, vied with rivals on the far turn and
gave way in the stretch. SENOR BUSCADOR broke slow, trailed to the far turn, exited that bend four wide, tipped out further and proved no menace.
THERE GOES HARVARD bobbled leaving the gate, became rank into the first turn, remained under a hold through the bend, dropped back to last on the
far turn and had little left for the drive.
