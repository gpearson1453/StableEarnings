ANOTHERSUNNYDAY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, turned back a challenge by JERSEY LILLIE through the turn, and drew clear late to prove best. JERSEY
LILLIE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backside while racing one out from the rail, set sail two wide after the leader entering the final turn,
was unable to match strides with that rival leaving the turn, but finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove second best. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted four wide for the drive, and closed with late
interest to garner a share. ICE BREAKER was away well, but settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced
her bid two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon. IRISH LUNA stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing
one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, steadied briefly when in tight quarters at the rail leaving the turn, but had little to offer in
the late stages. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of IRISH LUNA lodged a claim of foul against the rider of ICE
BREAKER for alleged interference leaving the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of
finish.

HE'S RELENTLESS tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue three wide from the outside of
ALL LIQUORED up in the run to the final turn, battled through the final turn one out from the rail, took control leaving the turn, and quickly drew clear as
much the best. PRINCE CAIRO tracked the leaders through the stretch at the back of a compact field, launched his bid one out from the rail entering the
final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove easily second best. ALL LIQUORD UP broke sharply and pressed the leader two wide from
between rivals through the stretch the first time, took a narrow advantage one out from the rail midway down the backstretch, battled through the final turn
from the inside of HE'S RELENTLESS, was unable to keep tabs on that rival entering the lane, and was outfinished in the drive. MAKEITORBREAKIT away
alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run through the stretch the first time
and into the backstretch, was overhauled midway to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong, while not being persevered with in the stretch drive.

AT ATTENTION was taken in hand early and allowed to settle well off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering he stretch the first
time, continued to bide his time well off the dueling leaders in the run down the backside, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, angled to the two
path midway through the turn, quickly split rivals one out from the rail leaving the turn to challenge for the lead entering he lane, and outfinished a very game
STAY FANTASTIC in a stretch long battle. STAY FANTASTIC away alertly and was quickly taken in hand and allowed to settle well of the early leaders
entering he lane the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, battled for the lead
into the stretch, and just missed following a stretch long battle with AT ATTENTION. CHA CHING unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to
the first turn, continued to bide her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed with late
interest four wide in the drive to get up for a share. SIR BREGOVIC vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to set a
pressured pace in the run down the backside, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, was collared entering the lane, and outfinished in the drive.
CASCADE BILLY rushed up three wide through the first turn to press the leaders entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue three wide in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded in the late going. SMART LAD dueled for the lead from between rivals entering the lane the first
time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep tabs on SIR BREGOVIC entering the final turn, and weakened
over the final furlong.

TAKE CHARGE GWEN rushed up three wide entering the first turn and cleared to take the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, dictated the
pace in the run down the backstretch, held a clear lead into the final turn, and was never threatened late as much the best. MAKIN IT UP away alertly and
raced to the lead from along the rail in the run to the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip from along the rail entering he backstretch, rallied smartly
from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the inside in the drive to get the place. ZETAMARIE away well and tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to
garner a share in an even effort. HARLAN'S ANGEL stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her
bid two wide entering he final turn, but was unable to improve her position over the final furlong while finishing three out from the rail in the drive.
FOURTOWIN unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and improved her position over the final
furlong without ever threatening. TIMELESS SHRUG settled off the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail
entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. GEM OF INCEPTION steadied from along the rail approaching the wire
the first time when put in tight quarters at the rail, settled behind the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, saved ground
throughout, but failed to make a serious impact. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry as well as a jockey's claim of foul. The
rider of GEM OF INCEPTION lodged a claim of foul against the rider of MAKIN IT UP for alleged interference approaching the wire the first time. After
review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

willingly three wide in the drive to grab the place. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first
time, pulled his way into a stalking trip by saving ground at the rail through the second turn, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished

continued with a wide trip through the second turn, advanced four wide midway down the backside and into the final turn, and finished three out from the rail
in the drive. MY COLLEGE FUND broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue

ALWAYS IN CHARGE broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from the inside of PAGODA
RIDGE in the run down the backside and through the final turn, repelled the challenge of that rival entering the lane, and quickly drew clear to prove best.
PAGODA RIDGE away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, struggled to match strides with ALWAYS IN CHARGE turning for home, but finished willingly three wide in the drive to
prove clearly second best. TEXAS LEGACY stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing four wide, rallied two out from the rail entering
the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to get up for a share. INDYGOGOLD missed the break and was slow into stride while trailing the field into the
first turn, began to advance five wide soon after straightening down the backside, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain
that bid in the lane in a troubled debut. CATTITUDE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, advanced into a tracking trip
in the run to the final turn, raced two wide through the turn, but weakened in the late stages. QUALITY PLUS settled at the back of the field while saving
ground in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but was never a factor. REMARKABLE GIRL away alertly and tracked
the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, was pushed along to try to maintain her position in the run to the final turn, began to drop
back entering the turn, and had little to offer over the final furlong.
