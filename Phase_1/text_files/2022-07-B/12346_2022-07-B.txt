APPROVAL GIVEN hopped at the start, made contact with THREE TIMES A LADY leaving the break, struck the front, was challenged late by the runner-up
and dug in to prevail. THREE TIMES A LADY broke in at the start and made contact with APPROVAL GIVEN, rallied in mid-stretch, pressured the winner
late and missed for the win, while getting up to secure second. MISS FANCY ALLEIA was off a step slowly, was put to firm urging and was outkicked late,
but got up for third at the end. YELLOW EAGLE broke well, was outrun in the early stages, and could not produce the needed late response. THE RIDER
OF THREE TIMES A LADY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF APPROVAL GIVEN AND THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THAT
OBJECTION, RULING THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SWANEE tracked the quick early fractions, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, struck the front nearing the eighth pole and drove clear under
steady handling in the final stages. TONI TWO POCKET was hustled leaving the break and dueled through quick early fractions, was confronted and
passed by the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong, while holding safely at the end for second. EYE ON TIGER stalked the early
solid pace, came four wide while advancing on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and could not muster a final bid, while clear for third. KAYLA'S
COWGIRL broke alertly, engaged with TONI TWO POCKET and dueled through quick fractions with that rival, lost ground in upper stretch and faded late.
ZELAIA was crowded at the start and was off slowly, lacked speed while under a ride through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JUNE GLOOM was sent leaving the break and pressed the quick pace to the turn, advanced to duel with LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS through the turn and
into upper stretch, continued that duel to deep stretch, shook free late and held gamely over the quickly oncoming runner-up. CONTINENTAL UNION
stalked the quick early pace, came four wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, launched a bold late rally and just missed for the win on the
wire, while getting up in the final strides for second. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS showed good early speed while in hand, set fast disputed fractions through
the turn, dueled with JUNE GLOOM through the drive and into the final furlong, was outfinished by the top pair but was clear for third in the end. SATANTA
lacked early speed, angled out at the top of the lane, was unable to impact the top three but found his best stride late and was gaining at the end.
LESSONS OF AUTISM chased the quick early pace, lost position on the turn and lacked a late response.

PIPER'S CAUSEWAY broke sharply and was sent to the early lead, kicked clear leaving the three-furlong marker, extended the lead in upper stretch and
was geared down at the end as much the best. LET THERE BE PEACE was unprepared at the start and was off slowly, chased the early pace, swung
widest into the drive and showed good late interest in the end to get up for place. EL CAPRICHO was hustled to dispute the pace to the turn, lost ground to
the winner leaving the three-furlong marker, chased the winner into the stretch and was edged for second at the end, while holding for third. WOLF'S LIFE
lacked early speed, was outrun through the turn and into upper stretch, improved position inside of the furlong marker and just missed for third at the end.
OLD SEVENTEEN tracked the early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run. HOPS FOR POPS chased the pace, dropped back
in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.

INTO BOURBON was hard sent leaving the start, set solid fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and kept to task under mild hand
urging at the end. REALLY EASY chased the pace from midpack, gained ground four wide on the turn, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch but
stayed on to be best of the rest. THE CALABRESE KID lacked early speed, improved position four wide on the turn, was outfinished by the top two in the
stretch drive but gained ground late to be clear for third. THECHIEFHASTRICKS tracked the solid pace, came under a ride nearing the top of the lane and
weakened in the stretch run. PEQUENO AVELITO chased the pace from the inside, lost position on the turn and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
SUGAR BEETS raced outside of rivals early on and tracked the moderate pace, loomed four wide on the second turn, struck the front in upper stretch and
proved best in the final stages. HANS GRUBER stalked the pace while saving ground, ran evenly through the backstretch run, came in tight and lacked
room on the second turn, swung out to be four wide at the top of the stretch, was outfinished in the stretch run but stayed on to secure second in the late
stages. GOVERNOR ARTHUR was a bit rank early while close to the early pace, tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch run, vied for the lead while
between rivals nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth, while well clear of the rest for third. TWIRLING
DERBY was unhurried early on, saved ground into the second turn, was unable to impact the top three in the stretch and passed tiring rivals late. PIVOTAL
FEVER was sent to the early lead and cleared the field into the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing
the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded in the late going. TOM'S MOON settled three wide off of the early pace, maintained position
through the second turn and did not offer a late response.

WETHERLY stumbled leaving the start, recovered to be prominent into the turn, took a narrow lead while three wide nearing the quarter pole, extended the
lead in upper stretch and drove clear late. BIG FAME was shuffled at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, improved position
approaching the quarter marker, continued that bid into the drive and was up in the final strides for second. LADY BLACKBIRD tracked the early pace,
gained ground three wide in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final furlong and was just edged for second while holding safely for third. CAL ROUGH
showed early speed and vied for the early lead while between rivals, lost position on the turn, remained in contention to mid-stretch and weakened in the
late stages. INEXPENSIVE STAR broke in at the start, was hustled along to show early speed and contested the pace through the turn, could not match
strides in the drive and gave way in the final furlong. BELLA VINO broke in at the start, chased the early pace, ran evenly while four wide through the turn
and into upper stretch and was not a factor in the late going. HILLSDALE NATION broke alertly, bolted to the outside rail soon after the break, lost position
through the turn, corrected course nearing the top of the lane and was not a threat in the stretch.

TIGER QUEEN was away alertly, established a short lead while well within himself, repelled a bid from DAMN THE TORPEDOES at the quarter pole and
drew off while being ridden out. DAMN THE TORPEDOES got away well, tracked the leaders from a four-wide position to the turn, launched a bid around
the turn while in hand and loomed a threat entering the stretch but was second best. LA AGUILILLA lacked early speed, tracked the pacesetters while three
wide, was put into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, swung widest of all into the stretch and finished well but was unable to threaten the top pair.
SWIFT NONNI broke in at the start, straightened and moved up to track TIGER QUEEN to the turn, was between horses entering the turn where he
appeared to brush slightly with DAMN THE TORPEDOES, was asked to pick up the pace from that point but was unable to muster a response. RUNNIN
DIVA off a bit slow, stayed on the rail throughout but was never a threat.

Footnotes
GREAT STORY broke sharply and sped to the early lead, set quick fractions while pressed through the turn, shook free in upper stretch, was kept to task
through the drive and drew clear in the final sixteenth. AWESOME DUDE was off slowly and lacked speed to the turn, trailed to the quarter marker, rallied
inside in upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages but stayed on well to get up for second in the final strides. TIZ VICIOUS chased the pace while in
tight quarters to the turn, was shuffled back while four wide between foes leaving the three-furlong marker, advanced in upper stretch and was outkicked by
the top pair in the final stages, while holding safely for third. CIVIL SUIT tracked the pacesetter, gained ground on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch
and did not mount a late rally. CORSICAN was bumped by HAY JUAN leaving the start, pressed the solid early pace, advanced nearing the quarter marker,
was not able to keep pace with GREAT STORY in the drive and gave way in the final stages. THUNDER OF ZION chased the pace while three wide
between rivals, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HAY JUAN broke out at the start and made contact with CORSICAN leaving
the break, chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, gained ground five wide nearing the quarter marker, drifted out at the top of the lane, lost action
inside of the furlong marker, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.
