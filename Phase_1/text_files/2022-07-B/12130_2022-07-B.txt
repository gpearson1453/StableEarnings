Footnotes
EASY CHANCE broke sharp to clear soon after the start, in hand when showing the the way through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to task. SWIFT N TRAFFIC closest to the winner just off the inside, narrowed the gap a bit early in the
turn, fell back off that same rival while first lugging in then out in upper stretch, proved no match the final furlong, saved the place. LIFEASWEKNOWIT back
off the early pace, moved a bit closer to head up the second flight by late in the turn, shifted out for the drive, closed the gap on the runner up steadily the
final furlong. THE BOSS SOSS broke back and to the outside, was straightened to race outside, came four wide for the drive, managed to close the gap on
the top three with some moderate late interest. PAYOFF CYCLE went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. BUCK'S GLORY closest to the top
two into the turn, began to give way soon after, continued to fade through the stretch.

CHIMNEY ROCK last to leave, raced back and outside into the turn, four wide into the straight, rallied down the center of the course to be up in time. JAKE
THE BAND MAN off the pace inside, continued to save ground turn, moved out into the two path for the drive, late bid between rivals, put a nose in front
late, missed. BINDING AGREEMENT closest to the leader off the inside, three wide into the lane, continued to grind and also lodged a bid with less than a
sixteenth remaining, not enough in the waning strides while between horses. ROCKY BAR SIX cleared to the inside soon after the start, set all the pace only
to falter in the late going while closest to the inside of the first flight. HALF OURS N STORMY behind the leader inside, shuffled back then steadied along
the rail early in the turn, fell back, moved out three wide and went evenly through the stretch. HEZA PRIORITY fell back to trail after the start, failed to
menace in lacking a closing response. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MR. PRIORITY off a step slow, trailed early when unhurried, moved closer behind traffic toward the inside late in the turn, swung out four wide for room
entering the stretch, challenged widest of the lead flight past the furlong marker, late duel, gained the nod to narrowly prevail. WHY JOEY WHY with the
pace from the start three wide, continued to vie through the turn, took over entering the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, dueled to
the wire inside the winner and proved stubborn to narrowly miss. WARRIORS GEM broke well, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and through
the turn along the inside, headed by the top two when straightened for home, proved no match for that pair while saving the show spot. GUILTY AGAIN vied
up front between horses, had little left in weakening ,through the lane. ADIOS YANKEE within striking distance off the inside, floated out five wide turning
into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE JEN unhurried in the early going, began to advance three wide far turn, chased the leader into the stretch, collared that one a furlong out, edged
clear. IZEONPOINT also lacked speed while unhurried in the early going, continued back while three wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be in time for
the runner up spot. HAVINFUNYET last away, devoid of speed in trailing into the first turn, advanced steadily after a half in the two path, continued to
improve through the lane, outkicked late for the runner up position. BE A BANDIT broke on top, dueled early closest to the inside, shook well clear before a
half, continued to lead by a considerable margin into the stretch, caved in late when confronted by the top three. J Z'S FIRST settled in the second flight off
the inside, had little left for the stretch run. MALARTACH well off the issue early, saved ground to no avail in remaining back. PRETTY PRODUCTION away
in good order, dueled on the outside into the first turn, chased the leader in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HIGH CRUISE off a step slow, moved out and advanced to a forward position out of the chute, dueled into and through the far turn, disposed of the other
speed entering the stretch to be clear, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. UNION STATION lacked early foot, continued to race in the main
body while three wide into and through the turn, rallied to be clearly second best, not a serious threat to the winner. COMMON LAW CAT broke back, lacked
speed for four furlongs in the two path, steered out widest for the drive, improved position well out in the strip while not a match for the top pair. NOSY
BANKER broke sharp, showed the way out of the chute, dueled into the turn inside the winner, first to blink up front when turning for home. BIRTHDAY
PARTY forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady fade before a half. FREE INDEED in the second group, had little for the drive. THREE
QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

MONEY WELL SPENT away in good order, settled behind the lead pack inside, swept up four wide to challenge turning for home, quickly clear, rider lost
crop with just under a furlong to run, drew out anyway to win ridden out. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE broke on top, dueled early inside, fell back along the rail
in the far turn, moved out, followed the winner into the straight on the outside, no match for that one to the wire while coming again for the place. ANGEL OF
VERDUN forwardly placed off the inside, advanced and challenged between horses before a half, continued to vie while between rivals second turn, offered
little resistance to the winner into the stretch, chased that one past the furlong marker, weakened late to lose the second spot. SAVVY SHIPMAN four wide
through the first turn when within striking distance continued outside and challenged in the four path into the far bend, vied then also weakened through the
stretch. SMOK'N RITA last to leave, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. BROKE FINANCING dueled early outside the runner up, continued to
contest the pace far turn closest to the inside, backed up through the lane.

BAYOU JAM rated off the leaders and the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide and outside that pair second turn, wore that same duo down by the
furlong marker, drew clear under a brisk left handed crop. COMMANDER SCOTT broke well, dueled up front in the two path through some soft splits, vied
between horses into the lane, proved no match for the winner late, saved the place. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST closest to the two early leaders inside the
winner, failed to go with that rival into the stretch, leaned out under a firm left handed crop nearing midstretch, up late for the show. EASY RUNNER away in
good order, helped set those soft fractions while along the inside, gradually weakened in the run through the lane. WISH UPON A STAR last to leave,
remained back in failing to mount a bid. COOL INDIVIDUAL fell back to trail after the start, never menaced in showing little.

Footnotes
CUSTOM GUITAR off the pace and the inside, knifed through in the two path and between rivals into the stretch, drove well clear under steady handling.
BET ON BOURBON in the main body outside, three wide through the turn, staged a moderate rally while remaining out in the strip to be clear for the runner
up spot, not a threat to the winner. SABERFIGHT last away, trailed early, swung out five wide turning for home rallied a bit then flattened a bit in the final
furlong to finish up best of the rest. CUPIE CUTIE back off the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane, switch out well wide when straightened for
home, improved position. SHOOTING STICK forwardly placed for a half while three wide, weakened through the stretch. SHEEZA PRIORITY went one
paced along the inside in lacking a closing response. ST JOAN moved up to narrowly take control along the inside late backstretch, shook briefly clear late
in the turn then faltered through the stretch. STERLING MEMORY void of speed, was six wide late in the turn, remained always back. HALOS ALARM
dueled up front for almost a half in the two path and gave way. GYPSY MISS fell back when sluggish after the start, fell far back, distanced after losing
contact with the field, jogged in.
