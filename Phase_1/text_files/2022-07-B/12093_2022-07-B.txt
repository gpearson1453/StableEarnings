Footnotes
FLATOUTANDFOXY saved ground around the first turn then rated off the second flight midway up the backstretch, swung five wide into the lane, rallied
along the outside and edged away. SOCIAL CIRCLE tracked the top flight through early stages, chased three wide around the far turn, sustained a four
wide bid into the lane, steadily edged up closer in deep stretch and captured place. DIXIELAND CANDY tracked the pace through early stages and chased
two wide around the far turn, sustained three wide bid into the lane, briefly held the lead at the sixteenth pole then got outfinished. DIANNA'S JET prompted
the pace through the backstretch and dueled for the lead with DIXIELAND CANDY around the far turn, battled for command into the lane, held a slight edge
into the final furlong then got collared at the sixteenth pole and faded. LONG MONDAY prompted the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command
around the far turn, continued to battle in striking distance into the final furlong then gave way. AND I KNOW raced in the back, came three wide into the
lane and lacked a rally.

GOLDEN DAY chased three wide in contention around the turn, stayed on determinedly in pursuit of the leader through the lane, steadily edged up closer in
deep stretch but failed to get by in time. PEGGY RULES raced off the second flight heading into the turn, swung four to five wide into the lane and gained a
share. SABRIA was forwardly placed three wide in early stages then dropped to the rail approaching the head of the lane, sustained inside bid just past the
furlong marker then gave way. ZOFIA chased in contention along the inside then flattened mid-way around the turn, shifted out approaching upper stretch
and offered no late bid. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DEANOS CAPE rated off the pair of duelers through the backstretch, picked up the tempo three wide midway around the far turn, roused left handed at the
head of the lane, responded gamely, surged to the lead near mid-stretch and finished going away. JOE FRAZIER dueled inside of ITS A WRAP through the
backstretch while racing well clear over the next flight, shook clear approaching the quarter pole, continued with the advantage a furlong out then failed to be
a match when the winner swept by. ITS A WRAP dueled for the early lead racing outside of JOE FRAZIER and raced well clear the next flight through the
backstretch, failed to match strides with rival approaching the quarter pole, weakened off the top pair but remained clear for a share. PRINCIPE
GUILHERME was reserved and raced in the back, hustled along five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HUNKA BURNING LOVE rated off the duel
through the backstretch then steadily weakened around the far turn. DUE TO TIMER MALFUCTION RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
KWIK rated off the pace in early stages, launched a three wide bid midway around the far turn, edged closer then dug in determinedly in pursuit of JERRYS
PRIDENJOY through the lane and forged clear in deep stretch. JERRYS PRIDENJOY cleared the lead around the first turn and set the pace through the
backstretch, held a clear advantage past the furlong marker then got reeled in late. WACO KID was reserved and raced well off the early pace, swung five
wide into the upper stretch and finished with good response. MOON IN THE SKY was unhurried and raced well off the pace, urged three to four wide into
the lane and passed tiring foes. MONSTER RIVER tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch, roused along the inside around the final turn then faded
at the head of the lane. FINISH LINE stalked the pace through early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn then retreated. OPLIN retreated after
a half and jogged in.
