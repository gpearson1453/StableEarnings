Footnotes
ESTABLISHED pressed the pace from between runners, vied for command and took a narrow lead around the turn, cleared nearing the sixteenth pole and
remained strong to the line. ITALIANO stalked the speed from inside, eased off the rail while put to a drive two to three wide leaving the bend, angled to the
outside of the top trio in the lane and finished willingly to earn the place. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH away quickly to clear the field and crossed over, set the
pace under pressure into the turn, vied with a pair of foes through the turn, lost contact with the winner with a furlong left to run and stayed on to regain the
show. JOE DON LOONEY raced up close outside the top pair, fought three deep around the bend, got outkicked in the final furlong and was edged for the
show. HEARTFULLOFSTARS came away last, chased five wide into the turn, moved into the four path around the bend, kept to task through the drive but
failed to threaten. HORN OF PLENTY tracked the pacesetter from outside, rounded the turn four then three wide and weakened. MAJESTIC WEST broke a
step slow to start, trailed two wide into the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
MOVINGLIKEAWINNER was off slow and began to climb for a bit early, swung six wide into the stretch and overtook the runner-up in the final sixteenth.
SHEMAKESCENTS stalked the leader from outside early then drew alongside and dueled past the seven-sixteenths pole, disposed of WETHERLY nearing
the quarter pole, fought with an outside pair while in the three path entering the stretch, cleared briefly past the eighth pole but could not fend off the winner
late. BIG JOLT tracked along the inside then tipped two wide to go around WETHERLY on the turn, found the rail in the stretch and showed a mild response
to nail TAP ME A TEXT for the show. TAP ME A TEXT stalked between rivals, bid three then four wide on the turn, faltered in the late stages but managed
to save the show. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ bobbled shortly after the start, stalked the pace outside a rival then four deep leaving the backstretch, bid four
then five wide on the turn and flattened out in deep stretch. WETHERLY cleared and was taken in hand while pulling a bit early, allowed
SHEMAKESCENTS to come up on the outside, dueled into and around the turn, could not keep pace approaching the quarter pole and gave way inside.

command from inside to upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. CONSTERNATION (IRE) came away a bit slow, sat off the pace through the
early going, angled five wide leaving the far turn and failed to respond when called upon. KITTYHAWK LASS became a bit rank and tossed her head
between rivals at the start, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. FEATHERS (IRE) raced in range in the two path or outside a rival, moved out
and traveled four deep on the far turn then weakened down the lane. MY KENTUCKY GIRL pulled around the clubhouse turn, stalked off the inside, came
three wide into the stretch, crowded between rivals in upper stretch, weakened after, bled following the race and walked off.

Footnotes
SATIN DOLL brushed the gate to come away a step slow, chased off the rail, rounded the turn four then five wide, rallied under the left hand and drew clear.
HALOSNHEAVEN forwardly placed early outside the top pair, challenged three deep on the turn, cleared at the top of the stretch and yielded in the final
sixteenth. SPICYBUG bobbled leaving the gate, showed brief speed then dropped back a bit to chase the pace, came two wide into the lane and finished
willingly to earn the show. AND TELL ME NOLIES traveled in mid-pack outside rivals, got squeezed between rivals late on the turn, recovered and kept on
through the lane to round out the superfecta. FLYING CONNECTION chased out of range, came out past the quarter pole, bumped with rival and lost his
path at the top of the stretch and was ridden out. GOOD AS GONE set the pace inside a pair of rivals, vied for the lead through the turn and weakened in
the lane. RIGHT REASONS came away slow from inside, traveled along the inside then eased off the rail around the turn and improved position. OTTER
POP settled between early, angled in around the turn and failed to rally. MUNNY ONE pressed the leader from outside, vied between foes around the turn,
bumped with rival at the top of the stretch and faded. DUTTON'S EMPIRE broke a step slow, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. THE
TRAINER OF AND TELL ME NOLIES LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER SATIN DOLL FOR INTERFENCE LATE ON THE TURN AND
ALSO A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING THE SAME INCIDENT. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THE VIDEO WAS
INCONCLUSIVE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) came away slow, angled to the inside, traveled in mid-pack, cut the corner into the stretch, launched a bid from the fence
and got outkicked by the top pair. SPYCATCHER broke a step slow, became rank early, settled into stride on the inside, angled out at the quarter pole,
came three wide into the stretch, steered out in the drive and summoned a mild rally for a minor award. BEEF WINSLOW showed early speed and pulled
first time through the stretch, set the pace under pressure from outside, dueled around the far turn and into the stretch, then faltered in the late stages.
DEGREE OF RISK bobbled at the start, pressed the pace from outside then battled around the far turn, fought into the furlong grounds and lacked the
needed late kick in the final sixteenth. RESULTANT was off slow from outside, trailed along the rail into the stretch and showed a mild response to improve
placings. SYDNEY STREET (GB) settled in the two path then outside a rival, got forced out with a quarter mile left to run then again in upper stretch and
could not rally after. LUCKY BOSS traveled near the back early on, came three wide into the lane, moved out further in the drive and failed to menace.

pace off the inside, exited the far turn three wide and weakened. SO I'M TOLD tracked in the two path on the first turn, got floated out near the quarter pole

Footnotes
SUMO tracked the pace off the inside, bid five then four deep around the bend, fought three deep in the drive, reached the front with a sixteenth remaining
and edged clear. SONIC BREES chased the top trio outside rivals to the turn, bid four then three deep through the bend, carried a short lead into the
stretch, lost command near the sixteenth pole and stayed on to the wire.2. SUPERMAN SHAQ vied inside a pair of rivals for command, battled through the
turn and into the stretch, fought to midstretch then flattened to third. TOM BOMBADIL was off a bit slow to start, got put in tight between foes early, ran up
on heels and had to steady, stalked the leading trio to the turn, coaxed two then three wide around the bend, tipped out in the lane and lacked a late bid.
WARRENS CANDY MAN had the rider lose the left-iron early but was able to regain a foothold not too long after, came five wide into the stretch and
produced a mild rally. DRAW THE FOUL vied between rivals into and around the turn, lost touch leaving the bend and gave way. GATOR SHINING chased
on the inside then a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out in the drive and never offered the needed response. MARINERS WAY vied outside rivals to
the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired in the stretch. LITTLE MISCHIEF chased between rivals, got blocked behind MARINERS WAY on the turn
and had to alter to the inside, then weakened in the lane. SIERRA PASS stumbled leaving the gate, dropped far back early, trailed on the inside into the
stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHISMOSA was hard to load prior to the start, came away slow, pulled between rivals early on the turn and had pause behind a rival, went two wide into the
lane, moved out and drew alongside the leader midstretch and drove clear. FUN MONEY chased three wide leaving the backstretch, became rank early on
the turn and lost ground, angled out and exited the bend five wide, became rank again at the top of the stretch, leveled out nicely and closed well to get up
for second. CHOLLY vied for command on the inside, dueled around the turn, cleared approaching the final furlong, was overtaken at the sixteenth pole and
got nailed for the place. WARREN'S PARADICE broke slow from inside, came out on the turn and entered the stretch five wide and summoned a mild rally.
COWGIRL CHARLI chased on the inside into the turn, got shuffled early on the bend, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and improved position.
ORGANIC vied three deep up the backstretch, dueled outside a rival on the turn, then weakened in the lane. THANK YOU KERA broke in and bumped rival,
chased five then four wide on the turn and weakened. ZZYZX stumbled and bumped in the beginning, tracked four then three wide on the turn and
weakened. LOYAL TO A FAULT pressed the pace from between rivals, lost ground and angled in on the turn, then faded down the lane. SMOKIN KISSES
refused to leave when the gates opened and was. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE START OF SMOKIN KISSES AND RULED
THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS BY REFUSING AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) unhurried in the early going and moved inside, moved off the rail and tried to advance through traffic on the far turn, steered out
in upper stretch, closed fast and proved best late. HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) sped clear and moved to the inside, padded the lead on the backstretch, roused
in upper stretch then put to right-handed urging, led clear into the final sixteenth but was overtaken by the winner and managed to save the place.
ROCKING REDHEAD tracked in the two path, entered the stretch a bit off the rail, tipped out in the drive, rallied and missed the place. QUATTROELLE
(IRE) broke a step slow, settled on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, summoned a mild response and earned a minor award. CARPE VINUM got
bumped between rivals entering the first turn, tipped out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch and needed to find more in deep stretch. EVER
SMART bumped with rival while three deep into the first turn, remained three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SASSYSERB trailed two wide into the
stretch, lacked room midstretch, gained a clear path but could not make an impact late. AMY C (GB) angled to the inside early, chased from the rail to the
stretch, asked right-handed in the lane and weakened. BUYBACK stalked in the two path and faded down the lane. BYE BYE BERTIE traveled near the
back outside a rival, went three deep into the far turn, moved out and came five wide into the drive and failed to menace. QUIET SECRETARY stalked the
lone leader three deep, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
