A. P. PHAROAH pressed the leader two out from he rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue three wide through the final turn, got the
better of his pace rival entering the lane, and quickly drew clear in the stretch drive to prove best. DOUBLE SAW away alertly and raced to the lead entering
the first turn while racing just out from the rail, set a pressured pace one out from the rail in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable
to match strides with the winner entering the lane, but finished willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. BAKALLEY broke sharply and
tracked the leaders in the run down the backside while saving ground at the rail, hesitated briefly while trying to slip through at the rail approaching the final
turn, continued to save ground through the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. ROYAL AIR FORCE stalked the leaders at the back of
a compact field entering the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, saved ground entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
JACK'S REIGN broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run
to the final turn, battled for the lead through the turn from the outside of CALAMAZEUS, got the better of that rival leaving the turn, and drew clear late.
APPELLANT stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. YOU DON'T OWN ME stalked the
leaders while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, held his position while gaining ground on the top pair in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and drifted four wide in deep stretch to get up for a share. CALAMAZEUS away alertly and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and into the backstretch, battled through the final turn from
the inside of JACK'S REIGN, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the lane, and was outfinished late. CALGARY CAPER unhurried early
while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, continued to bide his time at the back of pack through the second turn and in the run down the
backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, and found his best stride late, but was unable to make a serious late impact.

BLOWINGWITHTHEWIND away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the turn, was collared by ROAD CLOSURE leaving the turn, and
battled gamely from along the inside in the drive to prevail. ROAD CLOSURE was off a step slow, and rushed up three wide entering the turn, challenged for
the lead from the outside of BLOWINGWITHTHEWIND leaving the turn, but was unable to get the better of that stubborn rival following a stretch long battle.
LICORICE away well and chased the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, and closed best of all three wide in the drive while gaining late.
ACCORDINGLY chased the leaders through the turn while racing one out from the rail, and drifted five wide in the drive while finishing evenly. MATSQUI
broke sharply, but checked slightly from along the rail entering the turn, saved ground through the turn and closed evenly from along the rail in the drive.
CURLIN ROCKS was devoid of early speed while racing along the inside entering the turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to make a late
impact. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY was devoid of early speed while racing three wide into the turn, and failed to make a late impact while finishing two out from
the rail in the drive.

COUNTERACT away well and vied for the lead entering the turn while racing just out from the rail, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to
prevail. FILLY FATALE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of COUNTERACT through the turn, and finished willingly three wide in the
drive to hold the place. AIR FORCE pressed the leaders three wide through the turn, and closed evenly four wide in the drive to garner a share.
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND chased the leaders into the turn while racing two out from the rail, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. ABOVE AVERAGE
ducked in at the start to get away slowly, chased the pacesetters two wide into the turn, and finished with some late interest five wide in the drive.
LILSISTERLEE away alertly and chased the leaders to the turn while saving ground at the rail, took up slightly entering the turn, and faded in the late
stages. SILARONE was slow into stride, and trailed the field throughout, while racing three wide.

Footnotes
AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue three wide
in the run to the final turn, battled through the turn from the outside of HE'S A SAINT, got the better of that rival leaving the turn, and held STORMY BLUE
safely at bay in the stretch drive. STORMY BLUE tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, slipped through along
the rail midway down the backstretch to briefly challenge for the lead, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the
inside in the drive to get up for a place. WISELY PLAYED broke sharply and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the
first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in deep stretch to get up
for a share. REMARKABLE ANGEL tugged her way into a tracking position while racing four wide into the stretch the first time, maintained her position while
continuing with a wide trip in the run down the backside, rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the
drive while finishing four wide in the drive. HE'S A SAINT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the lane the first time, set a
pressured pace two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was overhauled entering the lane, and outfinished in the drive. DYNAMITER
was slow into stride and trailed the field into the stretch the first time, advanced seven wide entering the backstretch to gain a striking position approaching
the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
NEW CHASER away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, came away with the lead entering the lane, and held the closers safely at bay late while drifting towards the middle of the
track. SHOWMAN settled off the early pace while racing just out from the rail for the run down the backstretch, launched his bid two wide entering the final
turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to prove second best. CASSIDY COWBOY broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of NEW
CHASER entering the first turn, forced the issue from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, was unable to
keep tabs on his pace rival entering te lane, but held on for a share while finishing two wide in the drive. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT was pinched back at the start, but
rushed up three wide entering the first turn while bumping with UNBROKEN, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backside, was unable to match
strides with his pace rivals while racing three wide entering the turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. UNBROKEN away well and chased
the leaders three wide into the first turn, before getting bumped entering the turn, held a tracking trip four wide in the run down the backstretch, continued
three out from the rail into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BECKAS BOY chased the field eight wide into the first
turn, continued with a wide trip throughout, and was never a factor. MONTE broke outwards and was bumped in the opening strides, chased six wide into
the first turn, before assuming a stalking trip four out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, began to lose position in the run to the final turn, and
wasn't persevered with over the final furlong. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted two separate inquiries. One into the start of the race,
and another into the run into the first turn. After review there was no change made to the original order of finish.
