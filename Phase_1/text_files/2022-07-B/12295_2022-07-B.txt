Footnotes
DOER NOT A FAKER was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off
while racing in hand. BYE BYE BROOKY chased the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best.
STORMY DAME broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. PRETTY PEPPY was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and gradually gave way. LADIES SISTER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
ROCKETT'S RED CITY lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. VIPERS PRINCESS was off a step slow, lacked early
foot, saved ground through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BETTER BELIEVE broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off as a
handy winner. SHEZA HAILSTORM pressed the pace of the winner from the inside, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. BRYNS
MARK pressed the pace from between foes and gave way after going a half. MAMA WAS A ROCKET settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. ATILLAS ANGEL settled off the leaders from the inside, lugged in through the lane and failed to gain late.
METROS LIL POLLIE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. BELLAMUNDO was off slow, raced unhurried
early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NEW MEXICO LINDY was off slow then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn
and failed to menace. LEAP YEAR NIGHT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

STORM LEADER dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, vied into deep stretch and drew clear late. RATTILA was away in good order to dispute the
pace with the winner from the inside, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and gave way grudgingly late. MR RIGGER vied for the lead while racing
four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. MUSICS MY VICE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. NEW
MEXICO JEREMY settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. SENSE OF URGENCY was off slow, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. DRINKROUNDTHETRUTH raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and weakened. ATTILAS
TORNADO settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. LAUGHTEN was void of early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor.

ANTONIOS MARK raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and bumped with GEORGE WHO, was
straightened away quickly and drew off with little urging. GEORGE WHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, bumped
with the winner into the stretch, was no match for that rival but clearly second best. PAINTED SMOKE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled
inside into the stretch and finished full of run. HENNESSY LOOKER RF disputed the pace from between foes and gave way through the final furlong.
TARDY CAT dueled for the lead from the inside and also gave way through the final furlong. BYE BYE HEATH settle off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened. FLAG THE FOOTNOTE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LEAVE THEM BEHIND pressed the pace of NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN while racing along the inside, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run
and edged away late. NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN was away alertly then set a pressured pace while racing five-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane but
could not resist the winner late. VALENTINO WHO lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with good late energy.
PLAYTHEMARKER was void of early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. THRUTHESTORM settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. WF FRANKLY MY DEAR was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn
and gradually gave way. PERFECT IMAGE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way. SWAYEM raced off the
leaders throughout and weakened. AWAY I GO showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
