ISABELLE'S JOY was positioned just off the pace then moved to engage the leader with three furlongs left and edged away at the quarter pole and drew
away in the stretch. FIVE B C raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch from the three path then dropped in going into the turn and moved back
out the two or three wide in upper stretch and rallied to be up for the place. ULTRA CORDIAL tracked the leaders from the two path while giving an even
effort. MILLI STARR was sent to a clear lead from the inside and gave way at the quarter pole. MACHOS VISION was fractious as the gates opened then
veered out spotting the field several lengths, was hustled to the rail to save ground around the turn moved out to three to four path in upper stretch but was
not a factor. POLLY WAR CRY raced near the back and was not a threat. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE FOR MACHOS
VISION AFTER A REVIEW STEWARDS DECLARED MACHOS VISION A STARTER AS SHE WAS THE CAUSE OF HER OWN PROBLEMS.

FRIENDLY FOE tracked the leader from the two path and wore down the leader in the stretch to be up in final jumps. PACIFIC HARBOR was hustled to the
lead but couldn't last. DOX BIZ raced in the middle of the pack in the three path and improved position late. TATES QUIK START stalked the pace from the
three path and faded in the stretch. GREAT AWAKENING broke to the outside then raced near the back and was not a threat. REAL BULL was steadied
after the bread and was never a factor.

COLLUSIONIST tracked the leaders down the backstretch from the two path moved out the to make a bid on the turn edged clear in upper stretch and
sailed home. VERRAZANO FIRST saved ground through the turn and slipped through an opening in upper stretch to prove second best. GREY ROGUE
pressed the pace from the two path then moved to engage the leader with three furlongs left but was no match for the top two in the stretch drive.
BEDROCK raced back in the three path then made an advance on the turn went four to five wide in upper stretch but was not enough. OURBESTFRIEND D
L was just off the pace in the two path but lacked a the late response. GETALOADOFTHIS roused to the lead from the inside and weakened in mid stretch.
