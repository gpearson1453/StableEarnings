Footnotes
MISS ALPHA BELLA tracked the duel up into the backstretch then took over the lead at the half mile marker, widened advantage around the far turn and
held safe late under a driving finish. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE rated off the top trio in the backstretch, picked up the tempo midway around the far turn, dug in
three wide through the lane and finished clearly second best. DERONDA hopped then got pushed outward at the start losing ground, raced off the early
pace, hustled up entering the far turn, came three wide into the lane and gained a share. HOT CAVIAR dueled for the early lead into the backstretch, got
overtaken by the winner at the half mile marker, chased through the far turn then gave way. PREF RIGHT raced in the last flight, came four to five wide into
the lane and never threatened. GIROLAMO LUCY raced in the last flight, saved ground into the lane and had no response. GOVENESS SHEILA dueled for
the lead into the backstretch, got overtaken at the half mile marker and steadily retreated.

ADD IT ALL UP chased two wide around the turn, tipped four wide at the head of the lane, kicked in gamely, rallied to the front in the final furlong and
finished going away. REMITTANCE SENT dueled outside of DELUSION into the turn, continued to battle for command into the final furlong then got
overtaken late and ran on for place. DELUSION dueled inside of REMITTANCE SENT for the lead soon after the start, battled back gamely a furlong out,
held a slight edge then got overtaken by the winner at the sixteenth pole and flattened out. GARBO SPEAKS chased the top pair around the turn, came
three to four wide into the lane and offered no late bid. CAMCORDIA was off a step slow at the start and failed to move into contention. PRAIRIE FIREBALL
saved ground and failed to threaten. YOU JUST WATCHME showed early response then came up empty.

Footnotes
CASEYS MEMORY was allowed to settle early then edged closer entering the far turn, was ridden along two wide at the quarter pole, came three to four
wide into the lane, kicked in gamely under left handed pressure, surged to the wire in late stages and got up in time. MACHINEGUNPREACHER rated
inside through the backstretch, waited for a clear path late on the turn, got clear and roused forward at the head of the lane, continued with the advantage in
deep stretch then got nipped on the wire. SMOKIN BOOTS raced off the pace then circled up into close contention at the quarter pole, continued in striking
distance past the furlong marker then finished evenly. WENT set a pressured pace through the backstretch, continued with a slim lead around the far turn,
got collared at the head of the lane and faded. GHOST STRATEGY prompted the pace to the far turn, chased three wide in close contention past the
quarter pole then tired in the drive. WEST TEXAS RAIN stalked the top pair to the far turn and came up empty near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MISS PEACH was well reserved racing in the back, picked up the tempo midway around the far turn, came four to five wide into the lane, rallied gamely and
a nose up in time. INTERSTELLA vied for the early lead, shook clear near the quarter pole, stayed on with good response and got nipped in final stride.
MAJESTIC WAYS rated near midpack, launched a four wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained two wide bid into the lane and secured a share.
DEMIDANU dueled inside through the backstretch and into the far turn then faded in the final furlong. PLENTY OF VISION raced in range through early
stages, chased three wide around the far turn then came up empty. SAMIRA urged three to four wide around the far turn and failed to rally. EBONY PEARL
raced midpack through the backstretch, swung five wide into the upper stretch and faded. AMERICAN SUE failed to move into contention. ADRIA dueled for
the early lead, battled on into the far turn, came up empty near the quarter pole and retreated.

JIBE broke alertly and settled back to track the top pair into the turn, launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, took command from ADDABABY in the
final furlong and finished going away. I THINK I KNOW YOU raced in early contention, chased four wide around the turn, sustained response into the stretch
and gained place. ADDABABY dueled for the early lead, shook clear at the head of the lane then got overtaken by the winner in the final furlong. KAYLOR
vied for the lead with ADDABABY around the turn then gave way. CAN'T MAKE ME raced midpack, saved ground around the turn and failed to kick on in
the lane. SHELBY TO chased three wide on the turn and lacked a needed rally. LUCKYHOTSTUFF veered in, got bumped and steadied at the start, raced
off the pace and failed to gain close contention. GOTTA HAVE FAITH raced near midpack in early stages, chased three to four wide around the turn then
faded. CONFETTI BETTY broke inward at the start and failed to move into contention. RISKY WHISKY failed to gain contention. ADIOS OKOBOJI trailed
