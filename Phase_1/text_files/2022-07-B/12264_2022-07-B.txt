Footnotes
SAHM TEQUILA vied for the early lead from the inside, raced just off the inside in the stretch run and kicked clear under steady pressure. KOVACS was
coaxed along while racing four wide down the backstretch, dug in through the upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the drive. BIG BOY MCCOY
pressed the pace while racing between rivals and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. MYNAMEIS PRINCE bumped soundly with Brother Harold in the
early stages, settled off the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch run and lacked a rally. BROTHER HAROLD was
bumped early, settled off the early going, raced two wide near the quarter pole, angled out in the stretch run to race wide and had no response. DEPUTY
LAW was hustled along while racing the five path early on, raced towards the outside in the drive and faded.

TIME HEIST pressed the early pace while racing between rivals, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and prevailed late under all out pressure. PERFECT
WAGER settled off the early pace, moved two wide near the quarter pole, angled out through the upper stretch, surged late and missed in a game effort.
MAY WE ALL pressed the early pace while racing three wide early, dug in near the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. RELEASE THE BEAST stalked the
pace from the inside, angled widest through the lane and had not enough late. JILOTEPEC was coaxed from the outside early while racing four wide and
weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. CANNONBALL COMIN vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened. EMOJI GUY dropped back early on,
raced six deep into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. GAINER was slow early, raced towards the outside and never threatened.
