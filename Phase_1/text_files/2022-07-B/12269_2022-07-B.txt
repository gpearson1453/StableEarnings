but came along for second inside the sixteenth pole. TAPTAP chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, drifted leaving the turn and
came along for third later yards. PIPERS GOLD contested the early pace and pressured the winner toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the
turn then flattened in the lane. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and was not a factor. TRACE ESTATE saved

Footnotes
GEMS MINESHAFT RVF settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, threatened into the lane and dug in determinedly for the nod
mid-stretch. SCOTTSDALE took the lead four wide into the opening turn then angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths pole, was met leaving the far turn and gave up the nod mid-stretch. BIG RINNE settled just off the early pace about the three path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage three wide through the far turn but dropped back flattening stride leaving the turn.
BOATSWAIN settled off the rail early, bid leaving the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. STEP OUT DANCING was shuffled back
into the opening turn and raced well back early, left the second turn outside and showed little response. ENVISION SUCCESS became a bit edgy in the
gate then rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened on the far turn.

lane. WINDSOR'S PLAY gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly through the lane. CASTLE LIGHTS chased up the backstretch,

the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the turn then flattened. COUSIN WINNIE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four and
five paths then flattened the final sixteenth. SISTER JOANN veered out leaving the gate, gave chase and rounded the turn about the five path and showed

NO CHANGE closed to a stalking position two deep and between horses at the eleven sixteenths pole, took the nod into the backstretch, raced clear at the
rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. RUNNIN'TOLUVYA set the early pace inside, was met into the backstretch and raced close
from that point, but steadied from tight quarters at the rail into the far turn, dueled through the stretch for second but couldn't improve on the winner. CANDY
INVASION settled inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well while
gaining on the runner-up. MARTIN MAN settled close inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran
evenly in the lane. COMMAND THE CAT stalked four wide on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn
then flattened in later yards. HERO'S MAN stalked the early pace off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the three
path of the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of No Change, lodged by the rider of Runnin'toluvya for alleged interference into
the far turn, but decided on no action.

Footnotes
HEY CONGRATS chased through the backstretch, took the lead at the rail approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear midway on the turn and was steadily
handled to hold on. ZAINO BOYZ gave chase, raced close in the three path of the turn and finished well at the outside girth of the winner.
REVOLUTIONARY ROAD broke inward then gave early chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the eight path
approaching the top of the lane and finished well to take third later yards. KUKULKAN gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path then flattened in the
lane. FLUENT IN SARCASM was pinched back at the break and angled out to give chase, rounded the turn about the nine path and passed some rivals
widest. I'D LIKE TO KNOW chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and showed little
further. STRONG LIKE BULL set a pressured early pace, was met nearing the quarter pole, faded at the rail on the turn and was eased in the stretch.
ALLTHEWAY TO CAIRO gave only brief early chase and was eased past the five sixteenths pole.
