down abreast foe through the stretch matching strides there being denied in the end. YA GOTTA WANNA raced evenly throughout lacking more. LETCHER

PONT DU GARD set a pressured pace through the backside shaking clear into the far turn taking a breather outside the quarter pole responding with plenty
left along the inside down the stretch. GALLANT STAR unhurried early advanced to threaten on the far turn looming outside the leader in upper stretch
making no headway on rival late proving second best. VINCITORE was well back throughout. DEWY'S HIT prompted the pace through the backside then
tired on the far turn easing in upper stretch.

on the backside moving evenly on the inside to upper stretch angling out four wide in mid stretch lacking punch at the end. ESCAPE VELOCITY stalked the
pace through the backside chasing on the far turn weakening in upper stretch. ROYAL LUCK (CHI) was always a step slow trying to mount a bid on the far
turn leveling off near mid track in upper stretch. MUTAKATIF (IRE) raced evenly for a half then wore down on the far turn. DON'T POKE THE CAT tracked
the early pace then faded on the far turn. GRACEFUL KITTEN dropped back early.

backside edging to daylight on the far turn digging in between horses down the lane holding firm the final sixteenth. PRETTY LOUD stalked the pace bidding
under a drive from the quarter pole extending outside the leader at mid track down the lane weakening late hanging on for place. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS

ceding on the far turn racing evenly near mid track down the lane. IN SEARCH OF well back early raced six wide through the lane. HERO DRAGON had
brief speed then gave way on the backside.
