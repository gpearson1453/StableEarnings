Footnotes
BRUCELEA bid for the lead while three wide into the turn, was steady urging in the stretch and closed fastest to be up at the wire. HEZA FREAK set the
pace from the inside, cleared the turn, was in a hard drive down the lane but gave way at the end. WILTON tracked the pace while three wide then made a
gamely rally between rivals in upper stretch and was closing willingly. HARD CANDY tracked the pace while four wide then menaced on the turn but came
up evenly in the lane. BIG WAVE JAMES bid for the lead in the three path then rallied in upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. WILLACY bid for
the lead between rivals, then rallied mildly on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. PRAIRIE DOLLAR was unhurried early then bid along the rail in the
stretch and was no threat. JERSEY JOE bid for the lead from the inside, was in a hard drive on the turn into early stretch then weakened in the end.
STORM THREAT was unhurried early and no factor. LOUISIANA TRIP bid in close early then dropped back and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DON'TASK DON'TTELL was well rated while two wide, then was gaining ground on the far turn, took command and held on well down the stretch drive to
prevail. COLOSI was reserved on the backstretch, then was in a steady drive on the far turn to rally in the stretch drive and was closing fast but it was not
enough to catch the leader. PALUXY was allowed to settle along the rail then came out four wide on the far turn to menace in the stretch and was closing
strong but it was not enough. BIZZY LEGS tracked the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive entering the far turn, then rallied in upper stretch and
missed the show prize in the end. SUNRISE KITTEN was unhurried early then swung five wide on the far turn to bid in the stretch but it was too little too
late. COWBOY COOL tracked the pace from the inside, then made a mild bid on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch and was no threat. MOONLITE
GRAHAM set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive then faltered on the far turn. ENGLANDER raced in the middle of the field while four wide then
dropped back entering the far turn and failed to respond.
