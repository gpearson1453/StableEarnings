OAK HILL SOLUTION broke on top, dueled up front through the first turn under firm restraint, narrowly showed the way into and through the final turn inside,
battled on through the lane, and dug in late to narrowly prevail in determined fashion. HESACALENDARBOY came out soon after the start, within striking
distance off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide before a half, dueled outside the winner second turn and through the stretch, could not get by
that rival to be outkicked at the wire. PROUDTOWN moved up to duel in the two path and outside the winner early, vied up the backstretch, shuffled back a
bit from between rivals into the far turn, steered out, coming again late while widest of the first flight at the wire. VERDUNVILLE went one paced throughout
while saving ground. FOTHERINGAY back off the pace and the inside, lodged a bid three wide far turn, came four wide into the lane and tired to the wire.
WILDCARD GOLD off a step slow then was bothered, trailed throughout and was never a factor.

BLUE RIDGE HEAT broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, continued to set a pressured pace off the inside up the backstretch, shook
clear turning for home and maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under steady handling. TWO WITH A TEN pressed the winner early from along
the inside, fell back off that one late in the turn, extended battle through the stretch for the second spot while remaining along the rail, proved game to
prevail for that position at the end. APHRODITES REVENGE also pressed the winner for over a half, three wide, lugged out a bit upper stretch, outfinished
for the second spot while remaining out in the strip. TAKENFORGRANTED went evenly throughout after moving off the inside, lacked a closing kick.
CITIZENS REWARD last to leave, moved out and came four wide for the drive, also lacked a closing response. MISSGREELEY'SSONG remained back
while racing three wide.

CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST allowed the dueling leaders to go early, collared that pair turning for home, drew clear, drifted in a bit past midstretch when
widening, continued to increase that advantage while kept to pressure. FULL OF GLORY dueled up front on the outside, vied briefly between horses and
inside the winner turning for home, proved no match in the run to the wire, lasted for theplace. DOCTRINAIRE bobbled at the start, raced well back off the
pace, four wide into the stretch, getting to the runner up late. ARGYBARGY BUCK broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, weakened a bit in the
drive, caught late for the show. CARRIES MAN fell back after the start, continued sluggish off the inside, never menaced. COACH HUDSON finished early,
stopped upper stretch, eased to the wire after losing contact with the field, walked off.

IMPACT PLAYER devoid of speed in trailing for three furlongs off the inside, three wide into the lane, set down, rallied willingly through traffic to be up in
time inside the late leader in a well judged ride. CURTIN'S UP broke well, worked his way clear and toward the inside, continued to show the way into the
stretch, two path to the wire, could not contain the winner late while remaining clear for the runner up spot. REECE'S PRIORITY moved up to race closest to
the runner up, chased that one into the lane, lacked a winning kick the final sixteenth while saving the show. MUCHO MARVIN settled off the pace in the
two path, came three wide out of the turn, flat late to also be found lacking. WHENTHEDOVESCRY last to leave, was never a serious threat while three
down to two wide through the turn. COCO TIGER in the main group early outside, moved closer in the four path turning for home, failed to sustain that
advance through the stretch. WAR SONG within striking distance early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

L G GIRL stalked the leader off the inside, engaged that one in the two path far turn, shrugged off a mild bid from the runner up a furlong out and outclassed
her and the rest of her rivals to the wire to draw away at the end. LUMBERJACK EMPIRE lacked speed while saving ground, moved closer along the inside
second turn, angled out to be three wide into the lane, lodged a brief and mild bid outside the winner a furlong out, proved no match for that one, clearly
second best. TOOSIE broke on top, clear early, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, responded when confronted by the winner far turn, raced on
equal terms with that one into the stretch then could not keep up through the lane nor contend with the runner up, remained clear of the others. ERIN'S
CREATION went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. BABY MAYBE broke out to be last away, moved out four wide early first turn,
continued outside and was five wide into the lane, lacked a rally.

Footnotes
LIL ALLIE DANCER broke back, lacked early foot, began to advance off the inside turn, came in the two path for the stretch turn, challenged inside a drifting
in leader inside the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling. PEACEFUL VISION behind the early pace in the two path for a half, angled out three
wide when moving to confront the pair of leaders into the stretch, took over, clear a furlong out, drifted in as she was being challenged, outkicked in the late
going, remained well clear of the others. SWEET PRAYERS moved up to duel along the inside up the backstretch and through the turn,contnued to vie
briefly into the stretch, could not keep pace with the winner nor contain the runner up, finished up best of the rest. ROSE CROWN in the main body outside,
raced five wide out of the turn, displayed only modest late interest to improve slightly while remaining well out in the strip. KICK N KISS last away, trailed in
lacking any early foot, saved ground into the lane then improved position up the inside after the issue had been decided. JENNIFER'S ARCH set or forced
the pace four a half in the two path, gave way from between horses entering the stretch. KEHRON'S CREED remained back in failing to threaten. MAW
MAW'S SOPHIA forwardly placed out in the strip, was floated out four wide by the winner exiting the turn, backed up through the stretch.

CYPRESS QUEEN last away, moved up to duel in the two path first turn,continued to alternate up the backstretch, disposed of the other speed turning for
home and kicked clear under steady handling. CUSTOM MAIDEN in the second flight along the inside, asked along far turn, moved out to the two path for
the drive and closed with good resolve to be up in time for the place. FISH N CHICK moved up to duel inside the winner into the first turn, continued on
equal terms with that one the middle half mile, could not keep pace in the stretch, lasted for the show spot. MSCHITCHATTOUR in the second group
outside the runner up, continued one paced and off the inside for the drive to finish up evenly. US SECOND CUTE PIE void of speed just off the inside,
steered out four wide when being called on for run late in the final turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. FLURRY OF FEATHERS fell back
while four wide into the first turn, continued well off the inside in showing little. APRIORITY LADY moved out to be four wide in the first turn, remained back
in failing to threaten. NIN TO WIN moved up to race in mid pack the middle half, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
JUST A WIN forwardly placed along the inside, crept slightly closer into the turn, saw the progress stall by late in the bend, tipped out to be three wide past
the furlong marker when in a drive, displayed good resolve late to be up at the wire. ROSEISALWAYSRITE pressed the issue outside the winner, advanced
on the leader exiting the turn from the outside, dueled past the furlong marker, gained the advantage and led late only to be run down by the winner while
inside that one at the wire. EXPECT A DANCER broke alertly, clear before a quarter, extended that advantage late in the turn, dueled with the runner up
inside that one past the furlong marker, weakened when headed by that one, lasted for the show. PAGE SIX PRINCESS off slowly, trailed for three furlongs,
swung out five wide into the lane, improved position while not a serious threat. VISIONLADY in mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked closing response
through the lane. SONGS DISCREET CAT off slow, remained back in failing to threaten. CAESAR'S CALPURNIA four wide through the turn, tired in the
drive.
