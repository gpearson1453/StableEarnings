DIXIE STREET was quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside and built a long lead through the stretch while being kept to pressure. LT. BONURA
was off a step slow, tracked Dixie Street down the backstretch and was no match for the winner in the stretch run to finish second best. COHERE was off
slowly, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole, raced along the inside at the quarter pole and had not enough. BINDING was slow in the early stages,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no rally. DISIDE failed to sustain a bid.

between foes in the stretch run and moved up late. WONDER RUN was coaxed along early from the inside and never threatened. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT

Footnotes
MISS TARGET was rated along in the early stages to the outside of Miss Patty Jo, was asked just past the three eighths pole and drew off to be well clear
under steady handling. MO BLING was off a step slow, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole while racing between, raced four deep in the drive and
was no match for the winner late. CUTE DINERO QUEEN dropped back early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and moved up. MISS PATTY
JO showed good early speed from the inside and weakened in the stretch run. ISN'T IT TIME coaxed along early, raced five wide through the upper stretch
and weakened. DEROUTANTE was jostled at the break, raced towards the outside in the lane and had no response.

early going, raced near the inside and moved up late to improve position. SKY WATCH was hustled early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and
