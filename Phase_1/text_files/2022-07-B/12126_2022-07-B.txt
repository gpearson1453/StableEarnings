Footnotes
MUCHO EXPRESS stalked off the rail, made a good advance four wide on the final turn, finished well between horses to take over late, held KING WITT to
his outside safe to the wire. KING WITT dueled inside early, opened up out of the first turn, increased margin, took a good lead into the stretch, drifted out
and appeared to be stopping in early stretch, was passed by three horses to his inside, started to run again when the winner went by him on the inside just
after passing the eighth pole, gave his best from mid stretch to the wire lapped on the winner, couldn't get to that one. NOTABLE NORA, bumped mildly at
the break by BELBEDEVIL when that one veered in, well placed off the rail, advance final turn, challenged into stretch, made a bid between horses to
passing the sixteenth pole, gave way. L'ETAT (GER), bumped mildly at the break with ZURI RISASI, saved ground, advanced off the rail to challenge into
the stretch, made a bid between horses to passing the sixteenth pole, gave way. SPEIGHTSFORCE dueled between horses early, moved inside on the
backstretch, advanced to take over inside in early stretch as KING WITT drifted out, battled to mid stretch before giving way. ZURI RISASI steadied mildly at
the break after bumping mildly with L'ETAT, wide on the backstretch, advanced outside on the final turn, rallied to mid stretch, tired. BELBEDEVIL veered in
and bumped NOTABLE NORA at the break, wide on the first turn, remained wide to the final turn, dropped back, lacked needed rally. TRIBAL
CONFERENCE dueled outside early, dropped back to stalk, faded between horses into the final turn.
