STRANGE ARRANGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task.
CHEROKEE CHATTER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out and closed well for the
place. TOTAL DISTRACTION never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and evened out. LET PEACE
PREVAIL well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and weakened late. ECHO ALPHA SIX
unhurried, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and flattened out. DIALED UP broke slowly brushing the gate and
was never involved.

drew off and lasted. VALENTINE BUG mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed the gap on the
winner late. WHERE YOU WAS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, angled around a tiring rival and
lacked the needed late kick. SUMMERFEST never far back, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and evened out.
LIFE DON'T OWE YOU set a pressured pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then faded the final furlong. BUTTON BOX vied
for the early lead on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
KEEP SCROLLING mid pack, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain, edged ahead and held.
ANOTHERMANICMONDAY well placed, gained position two and three wide through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. LOOKING FOR LOVE sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was no match and held the
show. PIVOTAL WOMAN (FR) allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain,
angled in late for clear racing room and edged up for a share. SHOMETHESISTERS unhurried in the early going, moved up on the two path through the
turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted out slightly and had a mild gain. SUMMER HELPER allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through
the turn, angled widest into the stretch and improved her position. TRUDIAN'S PROMISE allowed to settle, moved up inside through the turn, came through
into the stretch and evened out. COUPLE OF NIKKIS well placed, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch
and faded. DONTLOSETHATNUMBER mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and faded. SATURDAYS
VAPOR well placed, moved up three and four wide through the turn, drifted out into the stretch and faded. TAILADIOS broke awkwardly from the gate,
drifted out, then was pulled up and walked off.
