STREET OF JEWELS drifted out a few strides after the start, stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in late and got up in the final strides while out in the
seven path. JUSTASMALLTOWNGIRL broke in front, set a pressured pace along the rail and held on for second. HUSH GORGEOUS pressed the pace two
wide and finished with good courage. POOLSIDE COCKTAILS with the second flight along the rail, altered course to the eight path nearing the sixteenth
pole then finished evenly. TELL ME A SECRET had good early speed along the inside then faded. YAQUESITA bobbled then was forced out at the start
and trailed throughout.

IMMACULATE HEART battled four the lead four wide, drifted in through deep stretch and proved best by a narrow margin. GOLDEN NOLE contested the
lead three wide, was in tight between rivals approximately sixty yards from the wire and just missed. TEL AVIV had speed along the inside and finished
determinedly. OPEONGO pressed the pace between rivals two wide, was squeezed in deep stretch causing her rider to check hard then lost just a bit of
ground. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF OPEONGO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
IMMACULATE HEART FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE WINNER AND PLACED
