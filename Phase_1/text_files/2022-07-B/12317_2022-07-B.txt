MUSTAFA prompted the pace while three wide, bid five wide at the top of the lane and drew clear. REDSON trailed early from inside, was hustled along
moving up inside around the turn, and ran on for place. STOP THE MADNESS rushed up to set the pace, was ridden in the three path at the top of the lane,
but finished evenly to show. THIS FRIDAY raced in midpack from the three path, was coaxed four wide at the top of the lane, but flattened. SNAKEBIT was
well back in the four path and no threat. SOUTHERN BLUSH pressed between foes but backed out around the turn.

Footnotes
AKHNAS stalked from the three path, bid for the lead from the five path at the top of the stretch, and was driven clear. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS pressed
while two wide, led two wide rounding the turn, yielded to the eventual winner but held on for place. FREDONIAN raced in midpack from the rail, tipped into
the seven path coming into the stretch, and ran on for show. MAJOR KONG rated from the four path, was hustled along while continuing to race in the four
path coming into the stretch, but finished evenly. OUTERBANKS set the pace inside but yielded at the top of the lane. TIZ MCNAMARA tracked from the
four path but was empty at the top of the stretch. FLASHYMEISTER was well back in the three path and never a factor. CABO'S RUMOR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RACY JAYCEE raced from well back in the three path, fanned into the five path at the top of the lane, and rallied down the center. BIRDIE CALL prompted
the pace from the three path, bid two wide around the turn, and ran on for place. STARRGARITA trailed two wide, was ridden into the six path at the top of
the stretch, and stayed on for show. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE tracked from the three path, was driven between rivals into the stretch, but finished evenly.
GOLD INCLUDED rated inside but was never a threat. SIMPLE PLEASURE stalked inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but was no
menace. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT set the pace inside but yielded at the top of the stretch.
