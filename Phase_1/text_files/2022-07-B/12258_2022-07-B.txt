D BLACK MAMBA prompted the pace outside then wore down the pacesetter through the final eighth while kept to a drive. TOUGH WORKOUT hustled to a
clear lead from the rail, was collared in midstretch and yielded. SOCIAL JOE trailed early, advanced inside but was no threat to the top pair. KANE chased
in the two path and weakened steadily. ASH OF MY ENEMY moved just off leaders in the two path and gave way. ALIGNMENT fanned wide early then
stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

just off the pacesetters and lacked a rally. LADY MISTRESS dropped far behind and was never in contention. RISEN CHANGE broke slowest and chased
far behind throughout. ALMOST EVIL was urged close up three wide down the backstretch and stopped.

show. GONE DREAMING raced close up, swung wide to avoid injured rival into the far turn and was outrun. PLATINUM ICE was leading in the two path
when she suffered a catastrophic injury near the far turn, was pulled up and subsequently euthanized..

MY TRAIN stalked the pace very wide, bid three wide on the turn then was just up in a tight finish after an extended stretch battle. WENTZ earned a narrow
lead inside to midstretch and continued gamely just missing. STRUM AND PLUCK dropped far behind, moved very wide in the stretch and surged too late.
STILL HAVING FUN awaited room behind rivals on the turn, swung wide into the stretch then flattened out. HIBACHI lacked speed, was taken up trying to
split rivals near the sixteenth pole and continued well. GENGHIS moved closer inside into the far turn then weakened slightly. DECKOLOGY prompted the
pace outside to midstretch and faltered.

Footnotes
NIMBLE BEAST broke alertly and moved clear inside then widened throughout while driving to late stages then taken in hand. CONQUISTADOR broke
awkwardly, rushed to contention and was no match for the winner. VICTOR'S DYNASTY close up early, raced wide and continued well while no threat.
PENNSYLVANIA STEEL trailed early chasing inside and was never a factor. O'BRIEN was urged close up outside to the far turn then gave way readily.

Footnotes
SOLEMN OATH controlled slow fractions inside then drew away through the stretch while ridden out. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD settled close up inside,
angled out on the final turn, tired but lasted for the place. LONDONDERRY dropped far behind, offered a menacing wide bid on the final turn then rallied
mildly. LADY BREXIT prompted the pace three wide for half a mile and gave way.
