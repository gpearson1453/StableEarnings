WILD SAINT set a pressured pace from the two path cleared in mid turn and just lasted. LUNA ROSE pressed the pace from the three path through out and
proved second best. O'LORDY LORD broke to the outside then saved ground through out and was a game third. KISSA DONNA DE BUY raced near the
back and was not a serious threat. PLAYAS GEMELAS lost contact early and had no impact. PERFECT LILCHARLIE tracked the leaders from the two path
then moved out three to four wide in upper stretch and faded in the drive.
