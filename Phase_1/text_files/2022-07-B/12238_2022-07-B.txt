Footnotes
GET UP EARLY advanced to short lead inside before a quarter had been run, opened up early turn, took a good lead into the stretch, held well. STEELY
CAPER pressed three-wide, gave best stretch, second best. DEVILS TIME stalked outside early, between horses into turn, rallied evenly for the show. OH
MAN OH MAN, unprepared at the start, broke slow, trailed to stretch, rallied belatedly. ROGER THAT B, well placed outside early, moved inside turn,
advanced into stretch, tired. NONOJOJO led outside early, passed before a quarter had been run, gave way into the turn, faded. MOSIE'S ON MAIN
showed little widest. There was an Inquiry into the start of the race. OH MAN OH MAN was deemed to have received an unfair start. All monies wagered on
OH MAN OH MAN were refunded, except for multi-race wagers, in which the favourite at post time was substituted.
