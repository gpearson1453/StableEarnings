from the gate lagged back to the turn with a widest run in the stretch, coming on too late. FLAT FUN no speed to the turn, improved position in the lane for
show spot. AIN'T STRAIGHT chased pace from inside to the stretch but weakened through the final furlong. DESOTO'S WAR rushed inside with a brief duel
and gave way readily into the turn. CUT GLASS tried to keep up outside to the stretch but gave way readily late.

Footnotes
MY GOOD GIRL had a tardy break, settled in and put to a drive into the turn, continued on well to go clear while handled stoutly in a good effort. YOGURT
never far back outside, rallied to a short lead in mid stretch but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. DOCS SEVEN pressed leader to turn, gained a short
lead into the stretch but faltered late. COWGIRL KIMMIE saved ground to no avail while evenly throughout. BOURBON SOCIAL tried to keep up outside to
the turn but wilted in the stretch run. MY TOMMY LEE close up to the stretch run but weakened readily in the final stages. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY had an
awkward start with no speed and only improved position while no threat. AUJARA never menaced. YES TO MISCHIEF had an awkward start from the gate,
rushed inside but was used up and dropped far back in the stretch run.
