Footnotes
JUMEIRAH COAST attended the pace in the four path, dropped back leaving the backstretch, drove three wide into the stretch under handling, and
prevailed under a drive. EXHI KID tracked the early pacesetters, drove five wide leaving the final turn, and closed with good energy getting by with time for
place. RED CHOCOLATE tracked inside, found running room inside at the head of the lane, dueled inside of JUMEIRAH COAST and flattened late stretch.
TANGERINE TAXI set a pressured pace, gained a short advantage in the final turn, and lacked the rally required. FIRST PRINCE pressed the pace from
between foes, and faded steadily after passing the quarter pole. BEAUTIFUL BABE trailed throughout.

AMEER tracked inside under a strong hold, found running room at the quarter pole along the rail, angled out at the head of the stretch, closed determinedly
and nipped the leader deep stretch. SOMETHIN HAPPENIN quickly went to the front, led the field to the quarter pole, responded to looming threat and was
caught late. GOLD'S UP unhurried early, drove four wide entering the stretch, closed gamely and was along in time for show honors. MEAN STREAK
stalked the pacesetters from the four path, lodged a bid near the three eighths marker, drifted in early stretch, and flattened late. REMAIN CALM trailed
inside, lodged a mild bid and finished evenly. SPIRIT RACER chased the early pace while three wide, and faded gradually. WIDE EYED WILEY settled
outside early, and lacked a serious bid.

MAKE GOOD CHOICES sat in striking distance from the four path, drove four to five wide coming off the final turn, gained the lead under encouragement
and drew clear. EVER TRUE set the early pace from just off the rail, lacked the rally needed into the stretch, and held for place. TANNIN prompted the early
pace from the three path, was unable to move on with rival and finished evenly. WEEKEND WIZARD saved ground inside, took closer order in the final turn,
and was edged out late. CONCUR trailed throughout.

SOUTHERN WARLORD raced wide through the backstretch, fanned three wide in the far turn, was set down at the head of the lane, and held sway.
SPORTSCARR trailed early, angled out to the four path at the quarter pole, rallied determinedly into the stretch under urging, and held on for place.
TACOFLAVOREDKISSES tracked three wide, drove four to five wide then dueled outside of SPORTSCARR in the lane then was bumped, and was out
finished for place. MR. ARTISTIC set the pace from the rail, was overtaken then stayed on inside, and weakened late stretch. CABOT TRAIL pressed the
pace outside of MR. ARTISTIC, was unable to move into the lane and faded gradually. STORMCHASER raced wide through the backstretch, and tired
early. PADDYSDAYCHARM showed good speed outside, and was done early.

lead nearing the quarter pole, was under attack at the head of the stretch, and was caught late. WHISKARITA raced four to five wide into the opening turn,
gained closer order leaving the backstretch, closed steadily outside and was up just in time for show. CONVINCE settled in second flight, lodged a bid
nearing the quarter pole, angled down to the rail in the final furlong, and was caught late. WE ARE FREE trailed the field, gained closer contention and

Footnotes
GET BAKK broke sharply then vied for the early lead, emerged the leader into the final turn, was under pressure into the stretch, and drove clear late.
MOON AMOUR hustled three wide, pressed the pace from the rail, weakened late stretch and held place. MUSICAL RELOAD sent for inside speed, lodged
a bid into the stretch and missed. SOPHIE MCTROPHY saved early and rallied belatedly. PRECIOUS NOTES chased four wide, hung at the head of the
stretch and finished evenly. GOTCHA JENNY never far back and lacked a closing response. WICKED WOMAN was no a factor.

Footnotes
CAPA BELLA sprinted clear at once, turned back challenge from IM A WHISKY GAL, and held safely under a late drive. JODEAN unhurried early, cut the
corner leaving the backstretch, swung five wide into the lane, closed steadily and finished well for second. IM A WHISKY GAL drifted out leaving the
backstretch, stalked three wide in the far turn, moved up menacingly near the three sixteenth pole but could not stall the eventual winner, and finished even
late. FOREVER LADY saved ground inside, and lacked the kicked needed. STOLEN JEWEL chased outside, angled to the four path leaving the
backstretch, and bid belatedly. CORDILLERA hustled early, and lodged a late bid. MISYA GIRL brushed leaving the backstretch, fanned four wide, and
came up empty in the drive. CUVEE TEE chased outside and was outrun.
