CYBERKNIFE settled off the pace on the inside, advanced inside nearing the far turn, waited for room behind rivals approaching the quarter pole, came two
wide into the stretch, angled to the rail nearing the furlong marker, responded when shown a clear path, rallied on the rail, put a head in front at the sixteenth
marker, dueled with TAIBA and dug in determinedly to prevail. TAIBA tracked close up on the inside, dropped back a bit nearing the far turn, responded
when asked at the quarter pole, rallied four wide into the lane, closed willingly outside, put a head in front past the eighth pole, then dug in gamely outside
and dueled with CYBERKNIFE to the finish. JACK CHRISTOPHER rated comfortably off of BENEVENGO entering the clubhouse turn, stalked close up two
wide, then pressed the pace, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled on the turn, put a head front at the quarter pole, dug in gamely between rivals in
midstretch and then yielded to the top pair. HOWLING TIME raced three wide early, stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled between
horses turning for home, dug in gamely to midstretch, then weakened. BENEVENGO cleared the field entering the clubhouse turn, set the pace on the
inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled inside rivals and faded in the lane. KING OF HOLLYWOOD trailed the field, saved ground and did not
factor. WHITE ABARRIO raced four wide early, settled two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and gave way. ONE TIME WILLARD pulled and was
steadied entering the first turn, pulled between rivals entering the backside, then stalked two or three wide and gave way at the quarter pole.
