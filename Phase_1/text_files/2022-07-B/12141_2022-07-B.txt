through the far turn, raced towards the outside in the stretch run and moved up late. CAPRICHOSA stalked the pace, took aim while racing five wide
through the upper stretch and flattened out. KISSES FOR HANNAH chased the early pace, moved up three wide at the quarter pole, raced six deep through
the upper stretch, angled in late and raced evenly to the wire. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE was off slowly, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and

Footnotes
LADY SIMPATIA showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and held gamely in the drive to remain clear under strong encouragement.
GLEAMING BRUTALITY chased the top pair from the inside while continuing to race from the inside and kept on to the wire. ASHARA was coaxed along
throughout, raced three deep and finished willingly to the wire. SPECIAL ASSISTANT stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four to five wide through
the upper stretch and had not enough. ILLUSION OF HOPE dropped back early, raced four wide through the upper lane and made a mild late gain. IVY
WAY dropped back early on, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no late response. DURA THE EXPLORER could not
keep pace early on, raced along the inside at the quarter pole and lacked a bid. CIRCLE OF COURAGE was hustled along early, raced three wide between
rivals through the upper lane and never threatened. LAPUA BRASS was off slowly, raced a bit wide early, angled in and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
THE SKIPSTER showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace, repelled bid of Spanish Czar just past the three eighths pole, raced near the
rail in the stretch run and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. OUT OF TOWNER settled off the early pace to race midpack early on, moved up
around the far turn, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, shifted out five to six wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. LYING
JEFF settled off the pace, moved up five wide through the upper stretch and closed in well in the latter stages. SPANISH CZAR stalked the pace, was hard
ridden near the three eighths pole to challenge the leader and weakened a bit through the final eighth of a mile while racing two wide. DOUBLE O OTTO
dropped towards the back of the pack early on, moved up through the far turn, raced near the rail through the far turn through the stretch run and had not
enough late. DON CICCIO settled to the midpack early on, raced just off the inside around the far turn, raced three wide in the drive and had not enough.
WEBB was unhurried in the early stages, raced near the rail into the upper stretch and never threatened. THE MONK tracked the early leader from the
inside and weakened in the stretch run. HIDDEN ROD raced seven wide into the first turn, raced near the back early on, was fanned six to seven wide
through the upper lane and never threatened after experiencing a wide trip. SETTE STELLE angled six wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a
rally. TUCKER ROAD dropped back early on failed to respond. MISSION CANYON stalked the early pace while racing between rivals and faded. RACE

Footnotes
SUMMER TO REMEMBER showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in nearing the sixteenth pole and prevailed under all out pressure.
SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued his run from the inside around the far turn, angled three wide
through the upper lane and finished gamely to just miss. ANGELUS WARRIOR was unhurried early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, shifted out
four wide and kept on to the wire. J BERESFORD TIPTON settled off the early going, moved up from the inside and showed good late interest. EPIC LUCK
tracked the leader just from the outside while racing two wide and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing four wide. SIGILOSO stalked the pace
from the outside and weakened while racing three wide. U S CONSTITUTION settled off the pace, raced two wide around the far turn, raced near the inside
in the lane and had no late rally. TIMES UPDATED AFTER VIDEO REVIEW

Footnotes
SILENT MALICE , last around the first turn, stayed well back off the pace, unleashed tremendous closing kick around the far turn, shifting in and out through
traffic, split horses at the quarter pole, rolled up outside leader, quickly gained control and drew off. ARTISTIC REASON , stalked the pace setters around
the first turn, was rated back till nearing far turn, shifted outside runners, quickly took command , opened up till inside the furlong marker, was no match for
winner. clearly second best. BOSS LOGIC found the inside route around the first turn, settled into a stalking position down the backstretch, shifted out
around the turn, could not keep pace with top pair, finished even late. THORNY TALE , had good rail trip around the first turn, rated back off leader to stalk
from inside, urged on for run nearing the three eighths, weakened late. FINANCIAL SYSTEM , good early foot first turn, raced three wide down the
backstretch, came under pressure entering turn, ridden for best effort drifting out at the quarter pole, flattened out stretch. MAJESTIC FRONTIER , lacked
early pace , raced along the inside mid pack, called on for run nearing three eighths, came up empty.
