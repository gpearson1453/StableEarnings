Footnotes
COWBOY CHARLIE set the pace on the inside while pressure, maintained a short lead under a hold on the turn, kicked clear into the stretch and held well
in the closing moments. BOCHOMBO chased the leading duo outside a rival, spun three wide into the stretch, finished well through the lane to gain late on
the winner and held the place. HIJO GALANTE was off a bit slow to begin, traveled along the inside near the back then tipped two wide while starting to
make a run on the turn, had to pause briefly entering the stretch, rallied between foes in the lane and missed the place. STREET ART chased from the rail
into the turn, had to pause momentarily near the quarter pole, tipped out in the lane and finished evenly. WINTER FALCON settled in mid-pack, angled out
and came four wide into the stretch, chased five deep in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. ROCKY GIBRALTAR broke slow, raced outside a rival near the
back, exited the turn three wide and lacked a rally. FIREMAN DAN dropped back early, saved ground trailing around the turn and was not a factor.
TWOKIDSFROMDABRONX pressed the winner from outside into and around the turn, lost touch entering the stretch and faded.

LITTLE DEMON vied for the lead three deep early, kept the pressure on from outside up the backstretch, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared and
moved into the two path leaving the far turn, then drew off under left and right-handed urging. FAMILY BIZ was off slow in the beginning, settled in the two
path then between foes, remained two wide into the stretch and rallied for the place. PAINT ME LUCKY vied for the lead between rivals, dueled up the
backstretch, battled between runners on the far turn, could not keep up with the winner leaving the bend, kept on through the lane and got edged for
second. CAJUN TREASURE away well to take the front and moved to the rail, vied for command from inside around the first turn, dueled up the
backstretch, fought through the far turn, lost touch with a quarter mile left to run and flattened to fourth. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE broke out, forwardly
placed four deep into the first turn then moved to the three path, stayed outside rivals and went three then four wide on the far turn and could not rally in the
stretch. THE BEAT broke slow and got forced out a bit at the start, went four wide into the turn then got floated out to the five path around the bend,
remained wide to the stretch and failed to menace. OUTRIGHT broke awkwardly in the beginning, started to pull and was rank around the first turn,
continued to tug early on the backstretch, raced outside a trio of rivals then four wide on the far turn and weakened. UNBROKEN STAR was off slow and

Footnotes
MAVEN away quickly in the beginning, cleared and angled to the inside, led along the rail into the stretch and stayed clear under urging. KING OF SPEED
forwardly placed inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and finished well but had to settle for second best. REDLINE got crowded
between rivals early, tracked three deep, got bumped from inside entering the stretch and gained the show. BIARRITZ up close early outside a rival, chased
two wide through the turn and flattened to fourth. STAR RACER settled on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked a rally. LINCOLN CITY
broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, was off a step slow then got bumped from outside, raced behind a wall of rivals and steered out on the turn,
was bothered in upper stretch and kept on to improve position. ELEVADO chased between rivals then in the two path, came out and bumped rival at the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. IKIGAI was off slow to begin, shifted in and bumped rival shortly after, drifted out in upper stretch and could not rally.
GOLDEN IMAGE broke a step slow then got knocked into inside rival at the start, raced between rivals near the back, rounded the turn two wide and made
no impact.

SLAMMED broke out a bit while still away quickly from outside, sped to the front and set the pace outside a pair of rivals, cleared nearing the turn, opened
up around the bend, given her cue with a quarter mile left to run, flagged with the whip through the lane and won easily. GRACE ADLER settled off the rail,
rounded the turn four wide, finished well through the lane and was clearly second best. MIDNIGHT MEMORIES reared up and almost fell in the paddock,
broke out a bit leaving the gate, pressed the pace from inside to the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the winner along the rail then two wide on the turn, could
not summon a rally in the lane but was able to save the show. MY DESTINY bumped with inner rival at the start, tracked off the rail then outside rivals,
entered the lane three wide and missed the show. DANCE TO THE MUSIC got bumped from both sides and bobbled at the start, saved ground through the
turn, angled out in the lane and made no impact. NEVER FOR MONEY bumped at the start, pressed between early, chased the winner into the turn,
dropped back around the bend and tired.

FUN TO DREAM bumped with CONNIE SWINGLE at the start, stalked outside a rival early on, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, took over at the
five-sixteenths marker, cleared with a quarter mile left to run and drew off under left-handed urging and steady handling late. ROSE DAWSON raced off the
pace then took closer order up the backstretch, looked to launch a bid inside the top pair but got put in tight and steadied past the five-sixteenths pole,
recovered and tipped out to go between rivals leaving the bend and ran on to best the rest. CONNIE SWINGLE bumped leaving the gate, check off heels
near the nine-sixteenths pole, entered the turn between foes, exited three deep and lacked a bid in the drive. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL was rank early on the
backstretch, tracked four wide around the turn and earned a minor award while failing to threaten. OPENING BUZZ stumbled badly leaving the gate then
went up to take command while under pressure, relinquished the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, chased near the inside leaving the bend and tired.
GIANNA'S WILD CAT pressed the pace from outside early, dropped back around the bend, trailed off the inside into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KINGS RIVER KNIGHT was off slow from outside, went up to take command, cleared into the first turn then angled to the inside, set the pace under
pressure from outside up the backstretch, put away QUEEN'S CODE at the quarter pole, then drew away under right-handed encouragement. FORE FLAG
stalked the pace from inside, urged while saving ground on the far turn, tipped out midstretch and finished willingly to earn the place honors. OUBABE
forwardly placed three to four wide on the first turn, traveled three deep leaving the backstretch, came four wide into the drive and outkicked HOT LEGS
ROMOLO for third. HOT LEGS ROMOLO settled inside, tipped out leaving the far turn, angled out further in the stretch and missed the show. QUEEN'S
CODE broke well then began to pull into the first turn, went outside the leader to apply pressure, lost contact with a quarter mile left to run, drifted out past
the eighth pole and weakened. DARK MARCUS was off a bit slow to begin, pulled early while off the rail then went three to four wide on the first turn,
traveled three then four deep on the second bend and lacked a rally. ATTENZIONE was a bit rank on the first turn, raced two wide or outside a rival off the
pace, angled four wide into the stretch and could not rally. EREBUS got bumped repeatedly entering the first turn, chased from between rivals, mid-pack up
the backstretch, got blocked briefly past the five-sixteenths pole, gained room in the two path and failed to respond after. NAUGHTY NIKO broke a step
slow, got crowded between runners early, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. THREECARDMONTE came away slow, pulled early along the
inside, moved out and trailed four wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact. RANCHO RED broke a step slow, got crowded between rivals and
bumped repeatedly with EREBUS into the first turn, went three deep around that bend, remained three wide into the stretch and came up empty in the lane.
