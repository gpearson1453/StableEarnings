TREASURE OF WAR set the pace early along the first turn, was overtaken and backed off down the backstretch, came again nearing the lane, was in the
two path into the lane, reclaimed the lead then spurted clear near the eighth pole and held off rivals in the final stages while between foes. ELLE EST
FORTE raced back early on, was in the two path entering the lane, altered in and out down the lane while making a bid, had a late rush three wide but did
not have enough in the late stages. SHE'S GONE was bumped at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the three path into the lane, rallied in the
stretch, had a late surge up the inside but missed in the final stages. MALIBU MARLEE chased the pace along the first turn, was pulled to the front in the
backstretch and took over command under a middle move, raced in the three path entering the lane and yielded once in the stretch. LIVY B stalked the pace
early on, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. LUCY'S CAKES FLY broke out at the start, tracked the pace early from
the inside, was in the five path entering the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. TWILIGHT raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane
while making a bid but faded late in the stretch.

held off rival in the final stages. CHROME'S RIGHT tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied in the stretch with a late bid but did not
have enough in the final stages. THOUGHT dueled early on from the inside, was in the two path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.

lane and improved position in the stretch run. BAD DECISIONS was through after a half. T MONEY tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane
and faded down the lane. EXTRAVAGATE was never a factor. DOWN TO BIZZNESS was done early. LEAD ACTOR was a bit slow at the start and never a

bid but weakened late in the stretch run. HEIR TO GREATNESS pressed the pace early, was in the two path into the lane, shuffled back down the lane but
came again in the final stages. INBOUND chased the pace early, was in the two path entering the lane while blocked, made a bid up the inside in the stretch

KENTUCKY MIST was bumped at the start, vied for the lead early, took over command, was in the two path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. HE'S
A ANGEL was never a threat. G FLAT chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and empty late in the stretch drive. ROARING GAP was
