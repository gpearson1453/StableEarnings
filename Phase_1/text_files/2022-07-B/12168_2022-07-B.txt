Footnotes
RB BAMER set a well handled pace from the start, drew clear in upper stretch and was clearly much the best. RB RATHOWAYNE chas4ed the pace while
inside, made a bid on the turn but was no match for the winner in late stretch. JOB AA rallied two wide into the turn making a bid then flattened out in the
drive. WMA FIREBALL chased the pace while three wide into the turn then failed to menace in the stretch. RB RATH was allowed to settle while racing
three wide into the turn and was no threat. SOUTHERN BELL MHF was allowed to settled while inside and was no threat. RB RAAMPAGE had no speed
from the gate and trailed throughout.
