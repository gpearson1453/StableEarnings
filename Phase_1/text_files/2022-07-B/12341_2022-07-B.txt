home, finished willingly and kicked clear under urging. FERAL'S JOY raced off the pace inside, advanced at the quarter pole, rallied between rivals in
midstretch and finished well for second. SUPERR RON pulled in the early stages, rated off the pacesetter, stalked EL CONEJITO on the backside, chased
on the far turn, made a bid entering the stretch, dug in and weakened late. EDITOR'S CHOICE broke in bumping a rival at the start, raced two wide off the
pace, advanced inside at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. BERNARDO'S LEGACY chased close up three wide early, then stalked the pace, chased on
the far turn and tired. ANTONOV raced off the pace inside and did not factor. A B CHEVY was bumped at the start, outrun early, went three wide on the far
