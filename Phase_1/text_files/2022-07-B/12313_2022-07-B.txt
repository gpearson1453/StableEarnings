Footnotes
BIRDNOTE settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn, made progress two wide around the far turn, waited for room nearing the lane,
swung out in in upper stretch, kicked in, seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive. CAPTURE MI pressed the pace three wide
around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was clearly second best.
VOICE OF NOW was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, was no threat to the top two in the lane but
won a duel for the show. SILVER MATT lacked early speed outside, tucked into the two path early on the first turn, edged a bit closer two wide around the
far turn, lacked the needed rally and just missed third. SEVENTYTIMESSEVEN was bumped at the start, raced in range four wide around the first turn and
three wide around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. GRAVE DANGER dueled along the rail and tired in the drive. ANYTHINGBUTSUBTLE was up
close two wide but was through after a half. GO CRISTIAN was outrun while saving some ground early and going five wide around the far turn.
BROADWAY RUCKUS was outrun inside. CATCHING MAGIC played no factor while racing two and three wide. GLORY AND VICTORY had his head
turned at the start, saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. JOHNNIE GOT JETS dueled two wide between
foes and retreated around the far turn.

X Y POINT set the pace alternating between the two and three paths, drew clear around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under a
drive. COMPANUEVO lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. PRUDENCIO stalked the
pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane and held well enough to save the show. DELLACROCE had early speed inside of the
winner and tired in the lane. HOLLYWOOD HERO hit the starting gate, shied a bit early, saved ground and never threatened. CADDY MAN steadied early,
raced four and five wide and made little impact. BLACK FURY was outrun while racing three wide.

WORA stalked the pace three wide, took over near the eighth pole and drove clear. TORETTO was forced in and bumped ENSIGN PARKER not long after
the start, was angled out nearing the far turn, advanced four wide around the turn, bid in midstretch but was outkicked by the winner. LOYAL LOUIE raced
off the pace five wide and rallied for the show. STARLITE WALKER saved ground in range, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide soon
after, split rivals in upper stretch, bid near the eighth pole but flattened out. ENSIGN PARKER was bumped and forced to check early on, saved ground and
never threatened. PUTMAN stalked the pace two and three wide, led late on the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and wilted. LOVIELEE set the
pace along the rail and retreated through the stretch. HIGHLY NOTED played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
CAPRIDREY lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn, took over in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and drew clear under a
moderate urging. TWIRLING GRACE tracked the pace three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on for the
place. SHE'S OUTTA HERE set the pace in the two path, yielded in upper stretch and kept on well enough to hold third. ANGELIC STORM was bumped
between foes at the start, raced off the pace three wide, shifted widest in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and improved position. BELLA
MIURA was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. PRETTY DEVIL broke inwardly and bumped foes at the start, chased the pace
inside and retreated after a half. PROTULLIO was reluctant to load, chased the pace four wide and was through early. PRETTYASAPENNY hit the starting
gate, raced three wide and played no factor. KAREN'S REVENGE had brief speed two wide. BALMEDIE hit the starting gate and was outrun inside.

Footnotes
RACE DAY SPEED rated in the clear in the three path behind a runaway pacesetter, cruised up two wide around the far turn, seized command near the
five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared, continued on the left lead in the lane and held safe under a steady drive. FLYING BLACK settled off the pace along the
inside, angled three wide early on the far turn, had aim on the winner turning for home but was held at bay. MIDNIGHT BELLA settled off the pace three
wide, advanced four wide around the far turn but could only gain slightly in the lane. SMART SPENDING trailed inside early, advanced between rivals
around the far turn, made progress in upper stretch but flattened out. PASSION PLUS failed to menace while racing two wide. LA RUSIA chased the pace
three wide and lacked a closing bid. ZODIAC PRINCESS set a clear pace inside and faltered nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
POCO CHARLIE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, drifted out in the stretch and held firm. BENELUX was off a bit slow,
advanced outside, was bumped entering the first turn, moved four wide around that bend into a stalking position, remained perched outside of the winner
around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch, was herded slightly and was unable to get by. KOBLA MAS lacked speed, saved ground well back, tipped
three wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. AMERICAN NINJA came out slightly and bumped MR MATUSCHEK into BENELUX entering the first
turn, tracked the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. GO MIKE checked off heels entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace, went four wide
around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. MR MATUSCHEK was bumped between foes entering the first turn, chased the pace three and four wide and
came up empty in the lane. LONG BEACH KID was outrun while racing two and three wide. BENEFACTOR set the pace along the rail and retreated
nearing the lane. STAGE READY broke in a tangle, raced two wide and made little impact. OUTSHINE chased the pace inside and was through after a half.
AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BENELUX AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
GRAND DAVID prompted the pace in the three path, took over two wide near the three-eighths pole, vied between rivals around most of the far turn, shook
clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. CALIFORNIA FROLIC was shuffled back nearing the first turn, angled out early on that bend to race four
wide, advanced between foes down the backstretch, continued to gain still four wide around the far turn and finished willingly to gain the place. MARWAD
(GB) hit the starting gate, raced off the pace inside, checked late on the first turn, moved up three wide around the far turn, shifted further out in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH was bumped at the start, checked midway around the first turn, chased the pace three wide, bid
three deep around the far turn, reached the quarter pole on near even terms just outside of the winner, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened
late. K. C. CHIEF was in range inside and lacked the needed rally. SPACE RUNNER saved ground and failed to menace. TREASURE KING stumbled at
the start, raced five wide around most of the first turn, made a wide middle move down backstretch, continued five wide around the far turn and came up
empty in the lane. ALWAYS GAMBLING was bumped at the start, raced in range two and three wide and retreated around the far turn. REDDINGTON set
the pace in the two path then faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
KUHL STAR settled off the pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn, closed steadily and was up in the final strides. ORIENTAL PARK was bumped
at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, briefly led near the five-sixteenths marker, could not match strides with SIXTY ONE turning for home, kept
plugging away through the lane, re-bid between foes late and just missed. SIXTY ONE tracked the pace inside, came through at the rail nearing the quarter
pole, burst clear in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, held clear past the sixteenth pole but weakened late. GRAN ANDREWS had early speed
between foes, bumped entering the turn, raced three wide around that bend and lacked a rally. BOBBY'S GIFT failed to menace while racing three wide.
AWKWARD PAUSE was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. AWESOME PUDDING set the pace in the two path and gave way near
the five-sixteenths marker. LIL BULL was outrun inside. LORD DARNLEY played no factor while racing two wide. LOST A LEGEND prompted the pace
three wide, bumped entering the turn, bid between foes near the five-sixteenths pole then wilted in the lane and was eased.
