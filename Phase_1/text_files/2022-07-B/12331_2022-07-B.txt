Footnotes
JACKSTOWN coaxed leaving the gate and took control early, set the pace on the inside to the stretch, urged left-handed a few times in the final furlong and
held well under strong handling. ABELIEFINTHISLIVIN tracked three deep into the turn, remained three wide into the stretch, finished well and closed the
gap on the winner. MASSIMO was closest in pursuit of the leader into and around the turn in the two path and finished evenly in the final furlong.
OMNIPRESENT broke slow from inside, chased within striking distance to the turn on the rail, angled out and came three wide into the stretch but could not
summon a late rally. COSMIC SOUL was off slow and last at the start, traveled four wide around the turn and never responded to urging. STRUT ON LOUIE
broke out and bumped rival then lost his path shortly after, began to climb and was taken out wide into the clear, traveled four then three wide on the turn
and failed to menace. GIOVINAZZO got bumped from outside at the start then shifted in shortly after, got shuffled back at the three-eighths pole and
weakened. KEEN TO GO stumbled leaving the gate, angled in on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LAUREL RIVER off alertly then was overtaken and pressed from inside, inched ahead nearing the far turn, cleared at the quarter pole and drew off under
mild hand urging. AMERICAN ADMIRAL was off a bit slow in the beginning, tracked on the inside then tipped out into the stretch and closed to gain the
place. AFFABLE brushed leaving the gate, stalked four then three wide on the first turn, moved up to press from outside, bid three deep on the far turn,
failed to match strides with the winner at the quarter pole, flattened in the lane and lost the place. WICKED TRICK stumbled slightly at the start, traveled two
then three wide on the first turn, rounded the far turn three to fur wide, drifted out in the lane and lacked a rally. ELECTOR brushed with AFFABLE at the
start, sped to the front three then two wide on the first turn and then was taken in hand to ration the speed, set the pace outside a rival then lost command
leaving the backstretch, vied between foes then got put in tight and shuffled at the five-sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
CASTLEKNOCK sped to the front and was steered to the inside, kicked clear past the five-sixteenths pole and padded the margin in the lane. RUSSELLS
HUSTLE fractious in the gate, chased between and got put in a bit tight entering the first turn, saved ground on the far turn and cut the corner into the
stretch, rallied up the fence and gained the place. ROENICK pulled on the inside into the first turn, moved off the inside on the backstretch, ran up on heels
at the half-mile pole, waited for room on the far turn, tipped out into the stretch, ran on and got edged for second. THE SLAP fractious in the gate, settled on
the inside, tugged on the backstretch, angled out into the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. EAGLES LANDING stalked the pace on the inside,
had to pause briefly behind the leader at the three-eighths and lost some ground, stayed inside to the stretch and weakened. WESTERBERG broke a step
slow, stalked in the two path, remained two wide into the lane and weakened. EXCESS ENGLISH turned his head and came away slow, tracked two wide
then raced three deep into and around the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened. ROAD OF LOVE was off slow in the beginning, began to
pull shortly after before settling three deep off the pace, remained off the rail and came four wide into the drive and failed to menace. BRING HIM HOME
was off slow to begin, traveled two wide then between rivals at the back, trailed two wide into the stretch and was not a factor. TELOS was off slow and
veered in leaving the gate, traveled three wide around the first turn, advanced up the backstretch, got floated out into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
V BUCKS became fractious in the gate, forwardly placed outside a rival into the turn, drew alongside the leader and took over at the quarter pole, kicked
clear four wide late on the bend, put to a drive in the lane and held safely. BACK ON THE STREET traveled in mid-pack early, raced three deep into the
turn, exited five wide, rallied and closed the gap on the winner while gaining second. AWESOME PAMELA was off slow in the beginning, raced at the back
well off the rail, came six wide into the stretch and was along for the show. BONITA LEONA got bumped hard between rivals at the start, went up to stalk
close up to the leader, lacked room behind the top pair at the quarter pole, drifted out in the stretch and lacked a late bid. LADY IN A HURRY broke slow
from inside, angled out on the turn and came five wide into the stretch and kept on through the lane. LADY COMMISH traveled in the second flight early on,
exited the far turn four wide and improved position. DRIZELLA tracked three deep early on, came four wide into the drive and weakened. HILLSTONE
MARTINI broke in and bumped hard with rival, chased between then outside a rival into and around the bend and weakened. SUEZAAANA was fractious in
the gate, bumped at the start, tracked on the inside then lost ground around the turn, entered the lane a bit off the rail and weakened. CREATING
MEMORIES was off slow, rank early, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. CARELESS STAR sped clear and angled to the inside, lost
command at the quarter pole and folded.

PERFECTIBLE LADY raced in mid-pack from the rail, angled out in upper stretch, overtook the leader in midstretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth.
SUNROOF stalked on the inside, coaxed into the far turn, had no where to go when boxed in at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped out with a quarter mile left to
run, moved out further in the lane, rallied and was clearly second best. LOOKINTOGETEVEN chased wide through the first turn, remained four deep up the
backstretch, challenged four then three deep on the second bend, carried a small and advantage into the final furlong, relinquished the lead shortly after and
yielded in the final sixteenth. DEAR BEAU (IRE) traveled two wide outside a rival near the back, waited for room on the far turn, gained room to run and was
pushed upon leaving the turn, tipped out in the lane and summoned a mild rally. SUPER RENEE set the pace on the inside, vied with rivals on the second
bend, fought back to midstretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) raced off the pace between rivals, angled out and came
four to five wide into the stretch but failed to respond in the lane. IN YOUR FACE raced in range two wide and between rivals, tipped four wide on the far
turn and could not rally. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) stalked three deep early, fought between on the far turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the furlong
grounds. VIOLET STORM traveled along the inside and began to pull early on near the back, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. TEAM
CONCEPT pulled early from off the rail, went three deep on the first turn off the pace, left the far turn four wide and came up empty. TROJAN WAY was
moving around just before the gate opened then broke in the air to drop well back, trailed to the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
FLAPS UP rated early in the two path to the outside the pacesetter, applied pressure on the backstretch, got shuffled between and dropped back on the far
turn and faded.

Footnotes
MERIT SONG away quickly in the beginning and steered inward, lost command but stayed alongside to prompt the pace, took over at the five-sixteenths
pole, cleared past the quarter pole and drew off under urging. CANDY'S WILDCAT broke a step slow and went up to attend the pace three deep, vied with
inner rivals around the bend, lost touch past the quarter pole and churned on through the lane to hold the place. REEF CITY broke a step slow, chased from
inside then tipped out into the stretch and gained the show. MENTIROSA got crowded between rivals early, coaxed from off the pace, traveled four deep or
five wide leaving the bend, got pushed out a bit to the six path on the turn and kept on for a minor award. MR. FIGHTER was off a bit slow then lost his path
shortly after, traveled three deep into the turn, moved out five wide around the turn and could not rally. WEASLEY steadied off heels early, raced along the
rail then eased out to the three path on the turn and failed to threaten. DUPLICATION brushed the gate in the beginning, altered out from behind MERIT
SONG shortly after, went up to grab the lead and set the pace between rivals, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, fought on to the quarter pole then
tired. MISSING THEM forwardly placed four deep into the turn, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. THIRSTY COWBOY dwelt at the start,
trailed early on, rounded the turn five wide and never got involved. STANFORD MAN raced in range outside a rival, angled in past the quarter pole and had
little left.

five-sixteenths pole and raced in a bit tight on the far turn, finished well through the lane and gained the place. BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) sat well off the

bid. SPEED LANE pulled briefly early then settled off the rail, raced in mid-pack then took closer order into the far turn, remained wide around the bend and

moments. AAS DE FAUST (GB) got bumped on both sides at the start, pulled and became rank early, checked behind rivals at the five-sixteenths pole,

Footnotes
JUSTIQUE hesitated leaving the gate to come away slow, advanced off the rail through the turn, closed fast through the lane under mild urging, surged by
the top pair while in hand and had the rider lose his whip at the wire. KISSED BY FIRE away quickly in the beginning, settled in a stalking position chasing
the top pair, bid three deep on the turn and outside HOME COOKING leaving the bend, took over in upper stretch and yielded to the winner in the final
sixteenth. HOME COOKING dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn, fought back into deep stretch but was no match for the winner.
FUNKHOUSER chased five wide into the turn, moved in some and entered the lane three wide and flattened out. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE stumbled and
broke out, raced five wide through the turn and improved position. AMI PLEASE broke a step slow, tracked between rivals into the turn, came three wide
into the stretch and weakened. TEA N CONVERSATION fractious in the gate, chased inside a trio of rivals into the turn, exited the turn a bit off the rail and
lacked a rally. FOURTH STREET dueled for the lead up the backstretch, fought on to the quarter pole then gave way. ANACARO raced greenly down on
the inside, went wide into the stretch and was never a factor. DRAMA DIVA lost her path briefly when FOURTH STREET came over, chased three deep into
the turn, dropped back around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
MASTER PIECE (CHI) came in and bumped rival soon after the start, moved down to the three path leaving the chute then raced in the two path off the
pace, got put tight early on the far turn, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in upper stretch and surged clear to win going away. HONG KONG HARRY
(IRE) got pinballed and had to check soon after the start, settled between foes then three deep on the backstretch, got bothered a bit entering the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and rallied to best the rest. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) got pinballed between rivals in the beginning, checked between foes first
time through the stretch, moved to the inside trailing early, raced in tight at the five-sixteenths pole, tipped two wide around the bend, rallied between in the
stretch and got up for the show. HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) got bumped from outside early, raced three deep off the pace, lost positions on the backstretch,
came four wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and missed the show. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS dueled for the lead from inside, chased past the
nine-sixteenths pole, re-bid between foes on the far turn, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. BEYOND BRILLIANT dueled for command from
outside, cleared on the backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals on the far turn, battled in the lane and weakened late. TANGO TANGO TANGO tracked two
wide then moved inside, shifted out leaving the backstretch and launched a bid three deep on the far turn, fought four wide into the lane, drifted out in upper
stretch and weakened. CASH EQUITY (FR) got crowded between rivals at the start, tracked from inside, moved out at the seven-sixteenths pole, got forced
out into the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. ECRIVAIN (FR) stumbled badly at the start, raced on the inside near the back,
advanced in the middle stages, took aim three wide into the lane but weakened in the furlong grounds. KING CAUSE broke well, tracked from off the rail,
three to four deep on the backstretch, entered the stretch five wide and tired. THE TRAINER OF HONG KONG HARRY (IRE) AND CATHKIN PEAK (IRE)
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE MASTER PIECE (IRE) ALLEGING INTEREFENCE AT THE START. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH MASTER PIECE (IRE) DID COME IN AND CAUSE INTERFERENCE TO BOTH RIVALS AT THE START, IT WAS
NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
I'M CORFU prompted the pace from outside, dueled around the turn, held a short lead into the stretch moved clear at the eighth pole and held late.
HANDSOME CAT chased off the rail, three wide leaving the bend, closed well and kept gaining to the wire. OCTOPUS threw his head and came away slow,
chased off the pace, four wide into the lane, finished willingly down the lane while drifting out but lacked the needed extra kick late. MISTER BOLD bumped
at the start, traveled near the back early, lugged out and came with a late rally from outside the top trio to round out the superfecta. SLAM DUNK SERMON
lost his path briefly early, trailed two wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. SENOR JOBIM raced off the pace up the backstretch, came four wide into
the lane and failed to menace. MOLTO VIVACE chased on the inside through the turn and weakened. FENESTRA broke in and bumped rival then shifted
out in the beginning, went up to set the pace under pressure, dueled inside a rival around the bend, fought to upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
CLADDAGH CURE tracked out of range early, raced between rivals into the far turn, angled five wide leaving the far turn, rallied five deep in the lane and
drove clear. EMERALD LAKE chased three deep early, exited the far turn four to five wide, came in and brushed rival in upper stretch, took over past the
eighth pole and got outkicked by the winner. SUNSHINE BABE tracked the pace from inside, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out and brushed with
EMERALD LAKE in upper stretch, bid between rivals with a furlong left to run and stayed on willingly inside the top pair late. SKY ON ICE came away
cleanly then dropped back early, raced near the back of the pack on the inside, moved outside a rival on the backstretch, swung out leaving the far turn and
summoned a mild rally. YOUTE dueled for command from outside, held a short lead entering the stretch, lost command past the eight pole and weakened
late. CURRENT MOOD stalked off the inside, chased the two pair three wide into the lane, got crowded in upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire.
WARRIOR'S MOON unhurried on the inside, coaxed around the far turn and left that bend two wide, steered out in the lane and lacked a rally. HOT ON
THE TRAIL stalked between rivals, waited on the far turn then tipped four wide for room but failed to respond when asked in the drive. QUEEN OF POMPEII
dueled for command from inside, fought to the eighth pole and weakened. BUSKER ALLIE was off slow to begin, trailed into the far turn, swung out leaving
the second bend and was not a factor. LIVIN' AT THE BU became rank entering the first turn, sat off the pace outside rivals, entered the lane four wide,
steered in upper stretch and failed to rally. NORAH'S PRINCESS tracked on the inside, moved closer into the far turn, took aim two wide, had her path
taken and checked in upper stretch and faded.
