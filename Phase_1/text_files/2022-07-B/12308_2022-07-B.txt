handling. PERFECT ONE settled off the early pace, moved up through the far turn around the far turn, continued its bid from the inside in the drive and
finished willingly to the wire. WARRIORS HERO settled off the early pace, moved up two wide near the quarter pole, shifted out four wide through the

off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and moved up on the drive to improve position. SADIE'S SNOWSTORM off a step slow, chased the
pace from the inside and weakened in the stretch run. I AM YOURS coaxed along early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no
response. LAFONDA was unhurried early, raced five wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor.

under strong pressure. KISS RIDE GOODBYE settled off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, swung six wide into the upper stretch and
slowly closed in on the winner late to finish second best. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was off slowly, chased three wide early, angled out to make an outside bid

MONIQUE was allowed to settle early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough. MAGGIE FITZGERALD dropped back early,
raced towards the outside in the lane and had no late rally. FLYIN BY was hustled along between, raced in the two path in the far turn and weakened the

TORPEDO AWAY was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside at the quarter pole, made a good rail bid in the stretch run and finished well to get up
strong handling. NINE ONE ONE was bumped soundly at the break, showed good early speed from the outside, dug in through the stretch but couldn't
match strides with the winner late to finish willingly late. COASTAL JAZZ chased the pace from the inside and kept on to the wire. EL ALTO HOMBRE was
bumped hard at the break, forwardly placed to lay up close and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. MR. STANG was hustled along early, raced five
wide through the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. BOBBY BRINKLEY dropped back early, angled widest through the lane and never
threatened. DEFENSE WINS failed to sustain a bid.
