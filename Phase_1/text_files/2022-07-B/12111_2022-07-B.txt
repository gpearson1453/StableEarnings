Footnotes
STUNNING BABY was never far back early, awaited room at the quarter pole, split horses at the top of the stretch, battled throughout the stretch and
prevailed late. REINSURE was well placed just off the speed, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, held grudgingly in the stretch drive and just missed.
VALIANT THOR dueled on the lead until the top of the stretch, then tired. LONESOME PHIL pressed the pace three wide, then weakened in the lane.
UHAVETOBEKITTENME had speed for a half on the rail, then gave way.
