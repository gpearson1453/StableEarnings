EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted away from the field early, held sway without challenge and lasted under steady pressure. YES IT'S ERIE allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed. THISAINTJUMPSTREET well placed and
inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, weakened late and held the show. ULTIMATE BARONESS well placed
and off the rail, held position on the two path through the turn, checked for racing room into the stretch, came through, then closed willingly and missed the
show. COZAR'S QUEEN well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded the final furlong. THE
TWO NANCY'S broke a step slowly from the gate and was never involved.

then made a steady gain and drew off the final furlong. ALATION allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the stretch and closed well
for the place. RAINAS ROLLIN set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. HIDDEN
MEDAL stalked the pace from between rivals, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out.
TUDOX I DON'T BRAG well placed and outside, lost some ground through the turn, then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
CASTLE KING unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch, dueled late and edged ahead in the final strides.
FIERCE WARRIOR allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, came five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged
ahead late, then dueled and was outfinished. ATLANTIC RULER mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out and closed for the show. CHAOS KID stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn, then weakened
late and held a share. MARKET MOVER hopped at the start, tracked the pace, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. PREQUALIFIED set the early pace inside, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded in the
stretch. NO DRAMA well placed and outside, held position four wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. TRAFFIC THIEF was never
involved.
