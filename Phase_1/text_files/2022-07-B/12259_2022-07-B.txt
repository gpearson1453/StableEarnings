Footnotes
OUR GAILYNN B was brushed at the start, then settled into stride and on the inside on the turn, angled out four wide for clear aim leaving the turn, closed
well to win going away late under a mild drive. FREYDIS tracked the early pace on the inside on the turn, made a bid between horses leaving the turn,
shook clear in the furlong grounds but could not go with winner late, second best. MATTY BO showed good speed on the inside early, then was rated back
and shifted out three wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole to vie for command by the furlong marker but flattened out. ALL HAIL MO was
out sprinted early, then was two wide on the turn and swung out eight wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally. OUTSPEND passed the tiring rivals.
ROSE OF SHANAKILL raced wide and had no rally. ORGANIZED CHAOS showed good early speed and was clear on the turn and then was headed
leaving the turn and faltered in the drive. QUEEN WIGGY chased the pace and was three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MORNING MARCH was well placed and drafted behind the duel on the turn on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and closed well to draw
clear under left handed crop urging. SIR STEELE was settled early, coaxed along on the inside on the turn, angled out in upper stretch for racing room and
rallied well to get the bob for the place award. TUFF CONSTITUTION was off a beat slow at the break, then raced on the outside and checked entering the
far turn, then got back into stride and came five wide into the lane and rallied, missed place award. T C GREELEY dueled for the lead and made a inside bid
on the turn and shook clear leaving the turn but faded the final furlong. SWILL MERCHANT dueled for the lead on the outside and was three wide into the
lane and weakened. NOTORIOUS REY chased the early pace, and then eased out to be three wide by the quarter pole and weakened. JEKYLL ISLAND
was reserved on the inside and then was wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat.

Footnotes
LOXODROME was rated three wide to the three eighths marker, then dropped to the inside and was coaxed along on the far turn, angled out in the stretch
for racing room, closed well late to get up in time under a drive. DISTRACTANDATTACK prompted the pace and made a three wide bid in the lane, but was
outfinished late by the winner. BE YOURSELF was reserved early, then went up between rivals on the backstretch, then advanced two wide on the turn,
swung out five wide for the drive and rallied. FAVORITE IMAGE set a pressured pace while working way over to the inside, then had a long drive but gave
way grudgingly late. LACCO AMENO was reserved early, then was on the inside on the backstretch and had a belated rally late. REPEATED PROMISE
was settled four wide early, made a three wide bid on the turn, then steadied slightly in mid stretch while fading. FIGHTINIRISHTABIT was reserved on the
inside, came widest into the lane and had no rally. CLEVER FELLOW was settled four to three wide and had no rally. LUPI chased the pace on the inside
and weakened. COOL YOUR BOOTS was well placed on the inside and tired.

Footnotes
VITESSE was allowed to settle on the inside throughout, angled off the inside leaving the turn, closed full of run to win going away under a drive.
WAHOOWA WAHOOWA had a slight bobble at the start, set a pressured pace off the inside on the first turn, then vied for command by the half mile marker
on the outside of SPIN CYCLE then made a bid to put that rival away by the quarter pole, then drifted out in the lane and faded the final sixteenth of a mile,
second best. THE ROBERT was allowed to settle and was wide on the backstretch, then came five wide into the drive and had a late rally to gain the show
award. SPIN CYCLE was well placed early on the inside, made a middle move on the inside to gain a short lead by the half mile marker, then weakened
and lost the show award on the wire. SACRED MOUNTAIN pressed the pace three wide and weakened. PAL CAL pressed the early pace four wide and
tired.

turn to duel for command outside the winner, but could not go with that rival in the final furlong, clearly second best. BOYS OF QUEENS was reserved early
three wide, came five wide into the drive and had a belated rally to best the rest. HERE'S WALDO dueled for the lead outside the winner early, fell back on
the turn and was two wide by the quarter pole and weakened. ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT chased the pace on the inside and had no rally. TRADERS LUCK hit

THAT'S MY BOI TOY was well rated early, made a inside move nearing the quarter pole and drew clear leaving the turn and then held sway late to prove
best under left handed crop urging. MY MAN GEORGIO was bumped at the start, reserved early, advanced on the turn and was five wide by the quarter
pole, closed well late but was too late. KNOCKDOWN KID dueled for the lead on the inside of a rival while in the two path, then weakened in the drive,
bested rest. SCYNTZ was settled early, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive. MY WALLY stumbled at the start, then
went up to duel for the lead three wide and then stopped by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LOVELY MELAYRA was rated early, advanced three wide by the quarter pole, angled in by the three sixteenths, closed well up the inside and got up late
under a drive. GO HALAINN vied for the lead four wide, made a four to three wide bid on the turn and was clear leaving the turn, then was caught late to just
fail late. MISSING A SOCK was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive and had a mild rally but needed more. CEETA passed the tiring rivals.
FUELED UP vied for the lead between rivals three wide and weakened. MISCHIEF MELODY vied for the early lead between horses two wide and stopped.
LUCYS GIRL vied for the lead on the inside and stopped.
