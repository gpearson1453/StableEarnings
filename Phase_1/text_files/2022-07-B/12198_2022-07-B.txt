Footnotes
ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) rated off of the reasonable pace outside of rivals, made a four wide move into the drive, overtook the leading pair in upper
stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prove best. FOGGY BOTTOM settled off of the pace, was roused three wide into the drive, angled out in upper
stretch, was unable to reel in the winner in the final furlong but was up in the final strides to get the nod for second. BRITE TAN prompted the decent pace
while three wide through the backstretch run, vied for the lead in upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner in the drive and was just edged out for second.
KITTYBE QUICK broke in at the start and was bumped by GARDEES WORLD as that rival went ahead at the start, saved all of the ground, advanced in
upper stretch but could not sustain that run and lacked the needed late response. GARDEES WORLD was sent to the early lead, set reasonable fractions
through the backstretch run, came under pressure on the far turn, was overtaken in upper stretch, stayed on through the furlong marker and weakened in
the late going.

Footnotes
CRAZY DREAMS was in tight leaving the break, was sent to the early lead and opened to a clear advantage into the backstretch run, was given a breather
through the backside while carving out solid fractions, was kept to task along the far turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and drew off late as much the
best. CANELITO settled just off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground to the winner on the second turn, was no
match for CRAZY DREAMS in the final stages but stayed on to be second best. CAT GAMER hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled four wide
off of the pace, was no match for the top two in the final furlong and passed a tiring rival to be clear for third. IL CAPITANO showed early speed and stalked
the solid pace through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, could not keep pace with CRAZY DREAMS on the second turn and
faded in the stretch drive. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM stumbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going, maintained a five wide path
through the second turn and gave out in the stretch.

Footnotes
COOLCROSS broke alertly and took back to track the moderate pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, overtook UNPOSSIBLE leaving the
quarter marker and took command into the stretch run, was kept to task through the lane and held safely for the win at the end. DUB TOWN settled three
wide off of the early pace, made a steady advance at the half-mile marker and through the second turn, came within aim of COOLCROSS in upper stretch
but was outfinished by that one in the drive and held safely for second. KNOWN settled off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch
run, came within range on the second turn, came in tight and was boxed in approaching the quarter pole and into upper stretch, found room in the final
furlong but was outkicked late, while clear for third. CANYON CREST settled off of the early pace, was unhurried through the backstretch run, mounted a
four wide bid on the far turn but could not sustain that run and flattened out in the stretch. UNPOSSIBLE was asked for early speed leaving the break, set
moderate fractions while prompted by the winner, could not off COOLCROSS leaving the second turn and faded in the stretch run. MEGAMEISTER was
away in good order, took a bad step leaving the seven-eighths marker, was pulled up and was vanned off.

KAYLA'S COWGIRL broke alertly and contested the solid early pace to the turn, overtook CHULA GIRL nearing the quarter pole, opened to a clear lead in
upper stretch, had the margin cut into a bit at the end by the runner-up but held sway in the final stages. SPUN AWAY tracked the solid early pace, gained
ground three wide on the turn, made a steady close on the winner in the final furlong and was not able to reel in KAYLA'S COWGIRL in the end but was
second best. ALESHA lacked early speed, made a steady advance in upper stretch and through the drive, the rider lost his crop inside of the sixteenth
marker, and was up in time to claim third. MERGIE TROID chased the early pace, lost ground four wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. CHULA
GIRL was sent to contest the early lead, dueled with the winner through the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the drive. PULPIT
SINGER chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while five wide and was outrun in the stretch. GEE STREET was a bit slow into early stride, lacked
speed through the turn and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHANCERY WAY was sent to dispute the early pace, shook free of HAPPY IS through the backstretch run and set quick fractions into the second turn, was
confronted inside of the furlong marker by SKY MAKER, was all out in the final sixteenth and held for the win under firm urging. SKY MAKER was content to
settle in the early stages, maintained position through the backstretch run, was steered four wide on the second turn, came within aim of the leader nearing
mid-stretch, dove to the inside for the final sixteenth, challenged for the win in the final stages and was gamely bested, while well clear of the rest for the
place. VRONSKY FEINT stalked the early solid pace, gained ground along the backstretch run, ran evenly through the second turn, was no match for the
top pair in the drive and passed a tiring rival to secure third. HAPPY IS was hustled leaving the start and disputed the early pace, could not keep pace with
CHANCERY WAY through the backstretch run and dropped back into the second turn, was asked for a response in the drive and came up empty in the late
stages. DISTORTED QUEEN stalked the early pace three wide, made a middle move to come within aim of the leader nearing the half-mile marker, was
shuffled back a bit while three wide on the far turn and tired in the stretch.

EMPIRE HOUSE was hustled to be close to the early pace, pressed the fast fractions through the turn, battled with CAROLINA MIA in upper stretch then
overtook that rival into the final furlong and determinedly dug in to prevail. CAROLINA MIA broke alertly and showed early speed while setting fast and
contested fractions, battled with EMPIRE HOUSE in upper stretch and gamely stayed on through the lane but was bested in the final stages, while clear of
the rest for second. DAY PLAN broke in at the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the quick pace from the inside through the turn, was outkicked in upper
stretch but kept to secure third. WARM SUMMER chased the pace, improved position five wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in
the stretch drive. TIP TOP GAL showed early speed and pressed the fast early pace to the turn, lost position four wide on the bend, could not match strides

Footnotes
STOIC LUNA broke well and was with the leaders into the first turn while racing three-wide, settled comfortably near the rear while still wide down the
backstretch, surged into contention around the far turn while four-wide, took over the lead at the top of the stretch and drew off under brisk urging to the
wire. BORN TO REIGN broke well, established inside position around the first turn, had a short lead down the back stretch, responded when engaged by
CLASS CODE through the far turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but stayed on to be best of the rest. CLASS CODE away well, tracked just to
the outside of BORN TO REIGN down the backstretch, made a strong bid for the lead around the turn but lost some ground to that rival at the top of the
stretch and held at the end for show. MALIBU JEWEL broke in at the start, causing DANGEROUS ILLUSION to have to take up, once straightened out
found herself behind the leading pack, moved up into contention down the backstretch but could not produce the needed response in the late stages. TURA
LURA was away the best but ceded the lead into the first turn, tracked comfortably from the outside, made a strong three-wide bid on the turn but was
unable to sustain. ARISTEIA broke alertly but was allowed to settle off the early leaders, moved up steadily exiting the first turn and down the back stretch
while racing near the rail, made the lead for a moment then dropped back steadily to last but managed to out-finish a tiring DANGEROUS ILLUSION.
DANGEROUS ILLUSION took up at the start when MALIBU JEWEL took her path out of the gate, spotting the field a couple of lengths, remained at the
back of the pack and was unable to make up any ground, and was not persevered with late.
