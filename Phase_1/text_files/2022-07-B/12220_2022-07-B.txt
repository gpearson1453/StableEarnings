Footnotes
IDAHO ONCE ducked in sharply at the start, was forwardly placed to the turn, overtook SEIGE THE DAY leaving the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, was
kept to task through the drive and drew clear in the final stages. SEIGE THE DAY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was confronted by IDAHO
ONCE nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace with that rival in the drive and held for second at the end. TRINIDAD was shuffled at the start and
was off slowly, recovered to be just off of the pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the top of the stretch, was outfinished in the final furlong and was well
clear of the rest for third. HAPPY DOES was bothered at the start, lacked speed through the turn and was not able to produce a late rally. CALCULATED
SPIN chased the moderate pace and tired in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND RULED THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH.

in the early going, contested the pace through the backstretch run, vied for the lead with three rivals nearing the quarter marker and into upper stretch, was
outfinished in the drive and was clear for third at the end. SAFE COMBINATION was brushed by CHIEF JACKSON leaving the start and was sent to the
early lead, contested the pace with that rival through the backstretch run, came in tight while three wide between runners on the far turn, battled for the lead
in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LEAVEITONTHEFIELD settled off of the early pace, gained ground along the backside, was outrun on the

MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke sharply and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while clear through the backstretch run, came back to the field a bit
on the second turn, was set down for the drive and held at the end over the oncoming runner-up. AMERICAN FARMER broke out at the start and was off a
step slowly, was allowed to settle, was roused four wide on the far turn, found his best stride in the final stages and just missed for the win at the end, while
holding safely for second. HARMON broke in at the start, settled just off of the early pace, was under a tight hold into the backstretch, advanced on the
second turn and chased the winner into upper stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished, while well clear of the rest for
third. AGENT ZERO lunged at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried through the backstretch run, lost contact on the second turn and was not a factor.
NOLDE bobbled at the start but recovered to stalk the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, lost ground on the far turn and came up
empty in the stretch.

RUSSELL was unprepared at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, improved position three wide nearing the quarter marker,
advanced in upper stretch, dove inside inside nearing the sixteenth-marker, made a strong late rally and was up in time to prevail. OAKDALE ROAD tracked
the early pace, advanced on IRISH IMMIGRANT on the turn, was outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, re-rallied in the final stages and was outfinished by
the winner while getting up to secure second. IRISH IMMIGRANT broke sharply and sped to a clear early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, was
confronted nearing the quarter marker and quickened to re-establish a clear lead in upper stretch, was tiring in the final sixteenth and was overtaken by the
top pair while holding safely for third. GLORY CITIZEN stumbled at the start, chased the early pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the stretch and
was outkicked in the drive. OBJECTIVLYPERFECT chased the early pace, lost position on the turn and did not produce a late rally. MIQUEAS chased the
moderate early pace, was outrun on the turn and was not a factor.

BERNIE'S BIG BOY was a bit slow into early stride, gained ground outside of rivals on the turn, continued that advance in upper stretch, closed
determinedly in the final stages and was kept to task to prevail. FULL OF LIFE was sent leaving the start, tracked the solid early pace to the turn, advanced
on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, battled with SONORA SERMON into upper stretch, took a narrow lead into the final furlong and was edged out in
the final stages, while holding safely for second. CASH LIMIT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and
found his best stride late to be clear for third at the end. SONORA SERMON was sent to the early lead, was confronted along the turn, battled with FULL OF
LIFE into upper stretch, could not keep pace in the drive and weakened in the final stages. OFFICER OF WAR was hustled leaving the start, ran close to
the early pace while saving ground, lost position on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

JUNE GLOOM vied for the early lead outside of rivals, came four wide on the turn while contesting the pace, gained ground in upper stretch and confronted
COLORMEMONEY nearing the eighth pole, dueled gamely with the runner-up through the final furlong and won the nod on the wire to prevail.
COLORMEMONEY showed early speed and dueled for pace duties to the turn, took a narrow advantage leaving the quarter pole, was engaged by JUNE
GLOOM in mid-stretch, dueled to the wire with that rival and was gamely bested at the end, while holding safely for second. PRINCE DE PRINCE was a bit
slow into early stride, chased the pace to the turn, checked in tight at the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch, split foes nearing the furlong grounds
and closed with good interest late to be clear for third. SIERRA MELODY broke alertly and vied for the early lead to the turn, lost a bit of ground while
contesting the pace on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and lacked a late response. WHOA BUDDY stumbled sharply at the start and was off slowly,
chased the early pace, ran evenly while not far back on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and could not muster a late rally. SUNSET DRAGUNN was
hustled to contend for the early lead leaving the break, lost position on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

TIZ AN EDVENTURE settled just off of the early pace, maintained position through the backstretch run, was roused leaving the three-furlong marker,
mounted a three wide bid into the drive, confronted SHEZAGHOST approaching the furlong marker and edged away at the end to prove best.
SHEZAGHOST was hustled to be forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace to the second turn, made a two wide bid to overtake the pacesetter into upper
stretch, met the bid of the winner in mid-stretch and was outfinished by TIZ AN EDVENTURE in the end, while well clear of the rest. MISTY CAT was
unhurried in the early stages, trailed through the backstretch run and into the far turn, improved position in upper stretch and passed tiring foes in the late
going to secure the show. PROOF OF JAZZ was asked for early speed and cleared the field into the first turn to set the pace, carved out moderate fractions
through the backstretch run, was overtaken leaving the second turn and tired in the drive. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU stalked the early pace while outside of
rivals, gained a bit of ground on the winner along the backstretch run, lost position on the second turn and faded in the late going.

A MAN'S MAN settled off of the early pace while in the second flight, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the drive, came to even terms with BLACK CASPIAN nearing the eighth pole and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. BLACK
CASPIAN (IRE) came three wide while rating just off of the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run, continued that bid into the second turn, vied for the
lead in upper stretch, battled gamely with the winner through the final furlong and was outfinished at the end, while besting the rest. SEA OF LIBERTY
hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace, made a long drive along the backstretch run and into the second turn, swung widest
into the stretch to be seven wide at the top of the lane, was outkicked in the final stages but was up for third in the final strides. VANTAGE POINT stalked
the early pace, made a steady advance on the pacesetter along the backstretch run and into the far turn, confronted U. S. DANGER approaching the
quarter pole, could not sustain that run in the drive and was outfinished late. GOVENOR'S PARTY was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through
the backstretch run and into the second turn, advanced in upper stretch but lacked a final response. U. S. DANGER stumbled at the start then was hustled
to the early lead, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off advancing rivals in upper
stretch and faded in the stretch run. FAR WEST settled off of the early pace, jumped shadows approaching the six-furlong marker and was erratic into the
backstretch run, trailed and lost contact into the second turn, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power.
