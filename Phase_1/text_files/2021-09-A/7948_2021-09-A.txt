moved to position into the turn, saved ground on the two path, then bid three wide and closed well for the place. UNWANTED INPUT never far back, moved
up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then angled out for clear racing room and got up for the show. CRAZY DELIGHT mid
pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and got up for a share. WHISPERING WANDA allowed to settle, saved
ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. PRAIRIE CITIZEN allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide
through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and improved her position. LYNBROOKE well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the
turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened. HONEY BEEST well placed and inside, lost some ground through the turn, then faded in the
stretch. ESTELLINA was no factor. BLUE ROCKETTE mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally.

Footnotes
ENJOY THE MUSIC tracked the pace well back, looped to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, shook clear, then drew
off and was kept to the task. POWERFUL POINT mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady
gain and closed well for the place. WHOOPS allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out for
clear racing room and closed well for the show. CHARLIE'S TRAFFIC never far back, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide
into the lane and flattened out. BOARDWALK BOB set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong.
STARE DECISIS stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground through the second turn, then faded in the lane. TRAIN IN VAIN allowed to settle,
looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path and had no stretch rally. PULL RANK was never involved.
