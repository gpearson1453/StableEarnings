ALL THREES vied inside of CHALICE MALICE into the turn, shook free turning for home then widened advantage under steady pressure. CHALICE
MALICE vied outside the winner around the turn, could not match strides with the winner in the upper strech but stayed on and finsihed second best. OUT
WORK'N raced two wide in pursuit around the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the final furlong and held show. DASHING CIRCLES raced in range
through early stages, hustled up four wide at the head of the lane and needed more for late impact. SMALL FIELD hustled along in steady pursuit, roused
up the inside in the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. ODDS AND ENDS chased along the outside into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
CHINA BEACH raced three to four wide around the turn, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened. A GREAT AFFAIR raced off the top pair
around the turn, sustained a steady bid to the eighth pole then gave way. MILENITA raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn and failed to move
into contention. SECOND ENCORE was off a step slow at the start, raced two wide around the turn and never menaced. COUNCIL MOJO saved ground
around the turn and lacked a needed rally. SMALL JOHN raced off the pace, chased two wide around the turn and failed to gain.

URBAN FAIRYTALE stalked the top pair through the backstretch, picked up the pace near the quarter pole, roused forward to challenge TASTING THE
STARS at the head of the lane, dueled gamely along the outside and edged away in the final sixteenth. TASTING THE STARS set the pace through early
stages, roused for more in the upper stretch, responded and fought back when URBAN FAIRYTALE moved up to challenge, dueled past the furlong marker
then failed to match strides in the final sixteenth. FIONNBHARR was allowed to settle through early stages, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole,
stayed on four wide into the lane and dug in to hold show. SWEET SANDY rated off the early pace, launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane and got
edged out late for show. SECRET OR NOT settled inside through early stages, launched a rail bid in the upper stretch, gained closer contention then gave
way. BLAZE FINERY stalked the pacesetter through the backstretch, coaxed two wide around the final turn then weakened through the lane.

VIRGINIA BEACH tracked the pacesetter through early stages, launched a two wide turning for home, roused forward to match strides with TEA IN CHINA
past the furlong marker then edged away under firm pressure. TEA IN CHINA vied in opening stages then shook free and held firm around the turn, fought
back when challenged by VIRGINIA BEACH in the stretch run but could not move on with rival in late stages. NOT MY MONEY gave chase around the turn,
sustained a steady three wide bid through the lane and cleared show. ASSUME vied for the lead in opening stages then remained forwardly placed around
the turn, saved ground entering the lane then gave way. KELLY GREEN lacked early speed, hustled along four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
GOLDEN GLOW sat off the early speed, went two wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. RSHEPHERDSGAIT saved ground around the turn
then retreated in the lane.

firm under steady encouragement. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL tracked inside through early stages, angled out and headed in pursuit near the quarter pole,
hustled up four wide in the lane and got a nose up for place. ROHRBACHER set a pressured pace through the backstretch, dueled inside of foes around the
final turn, got collared in the upper stretch but stayed on with response for show. HANALEI'S HOUDINI was unhurried and saved ground, given cue two
wide at the head of the lane and finished with a mild kick. CLINT MAROON (GB) raced up close three wide through early stages, dueled three deep around
the final turn then flattened in the final furlong. APRICOT was unhurried, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HOT BLOODED raced four
wide around the first turn, tracked the pace through the backstretch, remained in range around the final turn then gave way. VINTNER rated along the
outside through the backstretch and had no response when called upon. GOLD MONEY pressed the early pace, dueled between foes around the final turn

CHAOTIC TEMPO vied inside of COMMANDER BIZ through the backstretch, shook clear around the far turn, saved ground into the lane, remained clear on
top then drifted out near midstretch and held firm. TIGER TO REMEMBER raced off the second flight, roused four wide into the lane, raced in two path in
final stages, finished with response and gained place. GREAT BRITAIN rated through early stages, was ridden along four to five wide into the lane, stayed
on with response and got up for show. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid late on the final turn,
raced in close contention then finished evenly. TAPIT BRIO stalked the pace, roused two wide at the head of the lane, raced in contention then flattened in
the final furlong. WHEREDIDYOUGO settled through early stages, drifted wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. MUSICAL KING raced of the pace,
saved ground around the final turn and failed to move on. PLAYING GOLD rated off the second flight, stayed inside around the far turn then weakened.
COMMANDER BIZ vied outside of the winner through the backstretch, failed to match strides around the final turn then faded. RIVERLAND was slow into
stride and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PASSION PLAY was forwardly placed behind the leader through early stages, launched a two wide bid leaving the three eighths pole, took over the lead
late on the final turn, came under left handed pressure in the upper stretch, stayed sharp in response and finished clear. AMERICAN DUBAI stalked the top
two leaders through the backstretch, launched a four wide bid at the three sixteenths pole, sustained a steady bid through the lane and finsihed second
best. UNCLE ANDREW settled through early stages, saved ground around the final turn then launched a bid turning for home, came out a couple paths at
the head of the lane then angled back near the inside and captured show. GREAT CAMANOE set the early pace, got collared by the winner late on the final
turn, stayed on with response to mid-stretch then gave way. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY settled two wide through the early going, was ridden along the outside
in the upper stretch and failed to kick on. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY tracked the pace inside, tipped two wide at the head of the lane and lacked late
response. POINT OF GRACE raced in the last flight, was ridden three wide late on the final turn and never menaced.

Footnotes
BOLDOR was never too far back through early stages, given cue five wide turning for home, gathered momentum under steady pressure and forged clear.
ELUSIVE MISCHIEF sat off the top two early leaders then moved up three wide near the five sixteenths pole, held a slim lead at the eighth pole then failed
to hold off the winner in late stages. BRAXTON positioned two wide through early stages, angled out and hustled up at the head of the lane, gained closer
contention and secured a share. GOSPEL WAY tracked the early leaders, saved ground around the turn, tipped out two wide at the head of the lane and
lacked the needed surge for impact. BOONDOGGLE raced in range along he inside around the turn, hustled up three wide at the head of the lane, raced in
contention with a furlong left to run then flattened out. KENNY HAD A NOTION hustled up out of the gate, vied inside of TEMPTING MOMENT around the
turn, fought back at the eighth pole then gave way. TEMPTING MOMENT vied outside of KENNY HAD A NOTION around the turn then tired in the drive.
JIMMY LEGS raced in the back along the outside and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
SUNNYMEDE DREAM was never too far back while being rated off te early pace, roused two wide at the head of the lane, gained closer contention then
angled to the outside of GLORIOUS WEEKEND and drove by late. GLORIOUS WEEKEND was forwardly placed through the backstretch, took over the
lead near the quarter pole pole, remained clear on top at the eighth pole then got overtaken late. HELLFIRE BOB settled through early stages, loomed three
wide late on the final turn then sustained a steady bid through the lane and cleared show. HACHACHA raced in the back, hustled up along the outside in the
lane and passed tiring rivals. BOLD TREK raced off the pace, crept closer four wide around the final turn then failed to sustain bid in the lane. WHISTLE
PLAYER was allowed to settle inside through early stages, steadied entering the far turn then checked shortly after, lost all momentum and failed to move
on. MR. HAND FULL vied outside of rival through the backstretch, got collared late on the final turn then gave way. LUIS TWO GUNS rated three to four
wide through the backstretch and had no response when called upon. JUST PICK ONE tracked the pace through early stages, stayed on two wide around
the final turn then faded in the lane. PALIMPSEST vied inside through the backstretch then faded around the final turn.
