Footnotes
SAMARITA bumped with STARSOVERPARADISE shortly after the break, shared the lead outside that one on the backstretch, moved clear when allowed
on the bend, took the rail with a quarter mile left, was asked leaving the turn and steadily opened up on the rest while kept to a drive to the wire.
STARSOVERPARADISE very reluctant to load, broke a bit inward once the race began, bumped from both sides leaving the chute, hustled along to vie for
the lead from inside, angled outside SAMARITA at the quarter pole, was no match for the latter in the lane but held second under steady handling. TENSE
also bumped with STARSOVERPARADISE shortly after the start, chased from inside, swung outside the latter for the stretch run and failed to have a
significant response. BURNING BUSH broke outward, was corrected, widest taking the turn and steadily drifted out the final furlong. PRIDE ATTACK dwelt
at the start, loped from the gate many lengths behind the rest, did not gain a racing stride, was pulled up and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry into
PRIDE ATTACK'S start. It was deemed she had every chance to leave the gate with the rest and no action was taken by the stewards after their review.

DON'T HOLD QUEENS hesitated at the break, was hustled up and to the inside, progressed along the rail on the bend, squeezed inside SING KITTY SING
with a quarter mile to go, angled out to path four upper stretch, was all out and swept past TRYST CAT in the waning yards. TRYST CAT showed the way
just off the inside, roused leaving the turn, lengthened command under a drive in the lane, did not have enough left deep stretch but was clearly second
best. BOOHOO SUE broke on top, was soon chasing TRYST CAT from just outside, lacked a rally in the stretch, gradually wore down the final furlong but
was easily best of the others. MIZ CLIPPER moved toward the outside after the first eighth, was widest taking the bend and had no late bid. SING KITTY
SING chased from inside on the backstretch, was just off the on the turn and gave way from between rivals entering the lane.

Footnotes
PALAGO soon shared the early lead inside LINDALOUIMAGE but off the rail, was put to a drive leaving the quarter pole, drifted out considerably entering
the lane, edged ahead of the latter inside the last furlong, was all out under a stern drive and held sway. LINDALOUIMAGE disputed the pace from outside,
was carried out considerably into the stretch, fought gamely, did not have enough left but proved easily second best. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE broke alertly,
was soon chasing the top pair from outside, lost ground through the second turn, lacked a significant stretch bid but lasted for the show. DIAMOND GUCCI
soon trailed, stayed along the inside, swung out some to pass BULU near the quarter pole, closed the gap from path two upper stretch but leveled off the
final eighth. BULU was a step slow at the break, advanced to contention from outside, saved ground taking the second bend and flattened out the last
furlong. The half mile fraction is unavailable.

Footnotes
BEZEL SET was sent to get the lead and the inside, moved clear on the first bend, showed the way in hand just off the inside, was let out some along the
rail on the second turn, roused leaving the quarter pole, widened under a drive in the lane, bore out under left-handed pressure with seventy yards to go,
was corrected and proved much the best. NEXT TIME YOU WIN advanced between horses on the backstretch, was just off the rail taking the second turn,
battled inside SOUTHERN ATTACK in the stretch, edged ahead for second inside the last eighth and held onto the place. SOUTHERN ATTACK pressed
BEZEL SET from just outside, floated out some entering the lane, fought to keep second, lacked the extra needed in the late going but was easily best of
the others. GRAMMAR was prominent from outside for six furlongs then flattened out for the drive. UNIVERSIADE advanced to contention just off the inside
on the backstretch but faded along the rail on the second bend. RANGOON ATTACK faded from inside before finishing a half mile, was eased through the
stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
LAGRUE jostled briefly with GALLI ATTACK at the start, soon had the advantage and gradually angled in to show the way just off the inside, angled in some
nearing the three-furlong marker, moved clear just off the rail on the bend, roused leaving the turn, put to a drive the final furlong and held on. FINAL CALL
bumped with HE'S SO WILD when caught in tight quarters midway on the backstretch, was steadied several times in traffic going to the half mile marker,
angled out some to advance between rivals on the turn, swung out four wide into the lane, gradually drifted out upper stretch, held a straight path in the late
going, closed well, was too late but caught AWESOME SKIPPY for second. AWESOME SKIPPY a step slow at the break, was sent up from inside, bumped
with HE'S SO WILD midway on the backstretch, was checked when his path was compromised nearing the three-furlong marker, stayed prominent along
the rail through the bend but leveled off in the stretch. NUMERO PRIMO hesitated at the start, chased from outside, lost considerable ground widest on the
bend, came six wide into the stretch, rallied belatedly the final furlong, lugged in through the waning yards and bumped BULL ATTACK. The latter was
prominent toward the outside, jostled briefly with GALLI ATTACK at the half mile marker, was three wide taking the turn, began to wear down for the drive,
drifted out some inside the last eighth, veered out under left-handed pressure near the sixteenth marker, was quickly corrected then bumped nearing the
wire. INSTA GLAM forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch, began to fade four wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane and
gradually angled in as she continued to yield. HE'S SO WILD was pinched briefly between rivals midway on the backstretch, saved ground taking the turn
and had no late bid. GALLI ATTACK jostled briefly with LAGRUE at the break, was soon caught in tight quarters between horses, jostled briefly with BULL
ATTACK at the half mile pole then gave way three wide on the bend. The rider of AWESOME SKIPPY lodged an objection claiming interference from
LAGRUE into the turn. After their review, the stewards disqualified LAGRUE for that interference and placed him third.

Footnotes
D'ARCHER bobbled outward at the break, quickly recovered to stalk the early speed from outside, took over two wide on the bend, was asked leaving the
turn and gradually drew off under a steady drive through the stretch. CITY POSITION caught in tight between horses with a half mile to go, was steadied
back some into the turn, followed D'ARCHER on the bend, fanned outside that one for the drive, moved clear for second upper stretch, could not close the
gap on the leader the final furlong but lengthened his hold on the place. VIRGA chased from inside, reached a striking position as he angled out on the
bend, came widest into the stretch, gained third inside the last eighth then could only pull away for the show late. DR. LIECHTY was quickly clear, overtaken
from outside on the turn and gave way along the rail through the lane. BEL BIMBO made a slight hop from the gate, stayed off the inside and showed little.

Footnotes
PECOS AUTUMN broke alertly, was overtaken from outside after a furlong, moved outside CREAL SUGAR at the half mile marker, took the advantage
when asked two wide on the bend, moved clear under a drive in the lane, drifted out some under left-handed pressure inside the last furlong, was corrected
with a sixteenth left and kept SENORITA AURORA at bay. SENORITA AURORA was without early speed, picked up her pace along the rail on the turn,
angled out three wide at the top of the lane, rallied under a drive, was all out inside PECOS AUTUMN deep stretch, came up short but was easily second
best. CREAL SUGAR advanced from outside to gain the advantage after the first eighth, took the rail nearing the half mile pole, was headed on the bend,
flattened out for the stretch run but was unchallenged for third. PEYOTE PEGGY chased from outside, was three wide on the turn, swung out entering the
lane, altered in for a clear path upper stretch and passed inside a couple tired rivals. CHRISTY ATTACK chased from just off the inside, angled to the
outside at the top of the stretch and had no late bid. STARLET WARRIOR raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, was three wide on the bend,
fanned out some for the drive and gave way from between horses. MAUDE M came out of the gate bouncing and throwing her head then showed little once
under control.
