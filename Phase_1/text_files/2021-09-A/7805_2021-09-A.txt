the eighth pole, made a strong late run and got up for second. SINGLEBERYLBOURBON set the pace racing with a clear early lead, dueled inside on the
far turn and into the stretch, dug in gamely, gave way grudgingly and lost second at the wire. MOON UNIT ZAPPER stumbled at the start and was bumped,
raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and had no rally. HOT LITTLE NUMBER was bumped at the start and steadied, raced two wide off
the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. AGELESS ARTIST stalked three wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, then chased and

Footnotes
RUNUP set the pace racing with a clear lead, continued comfortably in front on the backside, responded when asked turning for home, drifted out a bit
passing the furlong marker and was ridden out. JUMEIRAH stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and
finished well to hold second. GIMMICK was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn, rallied inside in the final furlong and
earned the show spot. MICROBIOME was bumped at the start, stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and
weakened. YOU LOOK COLD was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. KINGDOM QUEEN raced off the
pace inside and did not factor.
