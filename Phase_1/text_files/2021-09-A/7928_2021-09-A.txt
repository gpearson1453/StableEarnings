stretch was all out. C BY THE SEA tracked the early leader and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick. WONNEFRAC was off the pace and had a
mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. P S CHARLIE BROWN was well back showed nothing and was

Footnotes
SAN NICOLA PRANCER stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
NATURAL HABITAT was in mid pace and roused on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch just missed. MARVEL tracked the early
leaders and had a good position on the far turn but needed more. MI TIA REGIS was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the five path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. WONDERFUL SOFIA was bumped at the start and closed the gap on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
had no impact. MADAME BOVERY set the pace and had the lead on the far turn but had nothing left. DOODLE DANDY had no speed, chased on the far
turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was outrun. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK was well back, showed little and from the six path at the top of the
stretch was not a factor. QUIET ASCOT had an unfair advantage at the start and was refunded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED
IN QUIET ASCOT BEING DISQUALIFIED FOR AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AT THE START AND WAS REFUNDED.

Footnotes
ICE CHALLENGE was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. LIQUID LOUIE tracked the
early leaders from the inside and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. KEEP GOING
stalked the early leader and had the lead on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. SHOW ME YOUR SPOTS was off the pace
and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. AMERICAN DRIVEN set the pace but lost ground on the far
turn and was outdistanced.
