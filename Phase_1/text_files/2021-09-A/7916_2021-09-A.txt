WATSONS BAY unhurried in the early part, moved up on the outside around the second turn, racing three wide, split rivals at the head of the stretch, dueled
late with GOLDBRIDGE and prevailed for the win. GOLDBRIDGE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished
for the win, but proved best of others. COSTELLO'S KITTEN pressed the pace, raced three wide around the second turn, weakened and proved no match
for the top two. RONALDS GATSBY sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded down the home stretch. RUNWILDWITHDREAMS broke a
step slow, raced in the back and showed little. CLASSIC'S OMEGA raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back. RACE

Footnotes
OUR BLUE JAY sprinted to the front, drove clear, pulled away and won handily. SPEEDOFTHESPEED hopped, bobbled at the start, pressed the pace,
couldn't catch OUR BLUE JAY, but was a clear second. A STAR IS BORN NOW unhurried in the early part, made a late bid and proved no match for the
top two. DOUBLE YOU raced within contention in the beginning, came around the turn three wide and hung down the lane. WICKED SMOKE broke a step
slow, racing near the back, showed late interest, while racing on the rail, but was no factor. SWEETSWEETSONG raced evenly near the back and was
never a factor. ENCHANTED MOON raced within striking distance and made a steady retreat. MAXIMUM FURY dwelt at the start and was never close.
GILDERSLEEVE raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning, dropped back and trailed late. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED CONCERNING
THE START OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

KIMBERLY'S JACKPOT raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and drove clear before the wire. BELINDA raced within striking distance,
forwardly placed throughout, made a late bid, four wide and got up for second. THURSDAY MORNING went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish.
EMILY WHO raced evenly near the middle of the pack and lacked a late kick. READY FOR ANOTHER void of early speed, improved position, but was no
factor. LILLIE AND NAN raced in the middle of the field, faded and was no threat late. ORENA STARSHINE always raced near the back and showed little.
