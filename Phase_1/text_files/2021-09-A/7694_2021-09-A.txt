inside rival early turn, was immediately pressured from the outside, turned back rival late turn, opened up stretch, tired late after a big try. DELVECCHIO,
well placed off rail, forced issue outside turn, bid, turned back late turn, gave best stretch. MR. DAZZLE broke a step slow, stalked inside, rallied late.
SHOOTIN MONEY had inside speed to press early, forced issue into turn, was turned back, advanced into stretch, rallied, tired. BUCKYS PICK stalked
back and off rail, rallied belatedly.
