SPECIAL MISSION traded pace duties with POGO through the second turn, lost the lead to that rival leaving the second turn but came back gamely and
won the head nod at the wire over an oncoming runner-up. MAGIC IS FLYING sat off of the early pacesetters, was three then four wide on the second turn,
swung out for the drive, was closing well in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while winning the head nod for the place. POGO contested the
early fractions with SPECIAL MISSION, took the lead from that foe leaving the second turn but was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for
second. ERRIGAL settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch drive. ANOTHER CHAPTER sat off of
the early pace while saving ground on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch. NO CHIEF TRICKS tracked the early leaders and was through after a
half-mile.

CHIRP chased the early leaders from a ground saving position and made a late bid in the stretch to win the head nod for third. CROWN KITTEN stalked the
early pace from a four wide running position and weakened in the stretch, just missing for third. MEET MISS KITTY chased the field from the rear, took up in
tight quarters entering the turn and finished evenly in the stretch. LORETTA chased the leaders from the middle of the field, was outrun on the turn and gave

Footnotes
U S DEPUTY broke on top and set the pace through the turn while saving ground, had a clear lead into the stretch and kept on to prevail. QUIRKY CHAOS
tracked the leader from a forward position while three wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch, but did hold on for the place. EDDIESPAGHETTI
was very green in the early going, chased the leader while two wide on the turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch to get up for third, while just missing
for second. OCTAVIUS PRIME chased the early leader, saved ground on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch, just missing for third. AWESOME
CURLIN chased from the rear of the field and showed late interest in the stretch run, while not challenging the leaders. UNUSUAL CODE tracked the pace
from a midfield position while three to five wide on the turn and did not make a late rally. RUNNING ON EMPTY stalked the pace while four wide on the turn
and weakened in the stretch run. WOLF MOON WILSON was a bit slow into stride, was hustled to chase the leaders from a ground saving position and had
no final kick in the stretch. TAMARANDO TIME was outrun in the first quarter-mile, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. TAMARANDO TIME
RAN UNDER THE NAME GENERAL TAM.

Footnotes
ROCKTILLYOUDROP sat just off of the early pace, improved position while four to five wide on the turn, struck the front leaving the turn and held in the final
sixteenth to prevail. ACE AND KINGS tracked the early leaders from a ground saving position, mounted a bid on the turn and into the stretch but could not
reel in the winner while besting the rest. MAYBE SOMETIME had no speed in the early stages, was four wide on the turn while trailing, swung out widest
into the stretch and rallied late, getting up for third. GOVERNOR ARTHUR chased from near the rear of the field, was three wide between horses on the
turn, was pinched nearing the top of the stretch when in tight quarters and finished evenly in the stretch run. BY MOONLIGHT tracked the leaders from a
two wide running position on the turn, gained ground heading into the stretch but weakened in the late going. BOURBONWITHATWIST prompted the early
pace, was still in close contention leaving the bend but gave way in deep stretch. ELUSIVE LOVE tracked the early leader from a forward position while
saving ground on the turn and tired in the stretch. MINEHUNTER set a quick pace while saving ground on the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DUTCH PAINTING (GB) broke alertly and set all of the pace, saved ground on the second turn, had a clear lead into the stretch and was mildly pressured in
the end by her stablemate but held for the win. TIME VOYAGE (IRE) sat off of the early pace while saving ground, swung out for the drive and was closing
well in the stretch but could not reel in the winner and bested the rest. FAIRY TALE BLISS tracked the pace while saving ground and was outfinished in the
stretch, while holding for third. BLUE DIVA settled near the rear of the field and made a late rally in the stretch, pressuring for third.
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was away last of the field and had no early speed, was four wide on the second turn and showed late interest in the stretch but
was not challenging the leaders. TIZ AN EDVENTURE stalked the pace from a midflight position, saved ground on the second turn and did not rally in the
stretch. TIZ FAKE NEWS prompted the early pace, was three wide on the second turn but dropped back off of the turn, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
WAR GAMES broke on top and dueled with IRREFUTABLE through the turn, put away that foe in the final sixteenth and held over an oncoming runner-up
to prevail. R M C HOOK'EM tracked the pace from a midflight position while saving ground, closed well in the stretch and put mild pressure on the winner
late while besting the rest. IRREFUTABLE dueled on the front with WAR GAMES through the turn, continued to battled the winner off of the turn but
relented in the last sixteenth and was outkicked by the runner-up in the final strides. COSMO was slow into stride early and chased the leaders, was three to
four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the late stages. PRINCE DE PRINCE stalked the pace from a forward position, was four wide on the turn and
tired in deep stretch. BENCH JUDGE tracked the leaders while three wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. JESS MO had no speed early, saved
ground on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. SUPERMAN SHAQ chased the early leaders, saved ground on the turn and faded in the late going.
