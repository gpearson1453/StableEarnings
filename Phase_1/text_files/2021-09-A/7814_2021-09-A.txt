BELLA NINA bumped DICTATE at the start, stalked the pace, closed on the far turn, bid in the final furlong and drove clear. A LITTLE VOODOO was rank
to mid backstretch but on the lead under restraint, finally she settled and set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, was clear into the stretch but was
passed in the final furlong and held place. SANSA'S VOW settled off the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn, launched a determined drive but was
outkicked. DICTATE, bumped into ADMONISH at the start, settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the far turn and chased gamely through the
stretch. RAVIR, in range, rode the rail on both turns but lacked a closing response. ERASMO'S GIRL settled off the pace, closed two-wide late turn and
chased through the stretch. ADMONISH, bumped at the outset, settled off the pace, closed along the rail late turn but lacked a rally.

DANGER raced in mid pack, was hustled hard two and three-wide on the far turn, gained steadily in the stretch and was up late. ENDORPHIN RUSH
stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide and bid late turn, dueled, ducked in upper stretch and lost ground then dug in late and outfinished the
early leader for place when a closer earned the grand prize. JUSTLEAVEITALONE led early, set the pace, was joined late on the far turn, led upper stretch
when her rival ducked in, but was caught late. ELEANOR POWELL raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then evened out in
deep stretch. CHOOSE HOPE settled in mid pack, raced three-wide through the first turn, was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch
but failed to menace. PACENZA, away a step slowly, settled off the pace, closed angling from two to six-wide through the far turn but never reached
contention. MIA AT MIDNIGHT stalked the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th. BLUEYED PRINCESS raced in
mid pack, dropped back on the far turn, was, however, hustled along but never reached contention. LOWER FOR LONGER (IRE) settled in range, rode the
rail on both turns but flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY SPEIGHTSPEARE led early, was stalked and pressed by a rival on the turn, shook that challenger off by upper stretch and was kept to her task down
the lane to maintain a safe margin. BROADWAY LADY sat along the rail in behind the winner, watched that one shake off a challenger before tipping out in
upper stretch to the four path and had dead aim but couldn't match, a clear second best today. NANTUCKET RED was rank early along the inside, came off
the fence to stalk and press the winner on the turn, stayed game until tiring in midstretch but holding on to the show spot handily. CHART had a brief lead
before allowing the winner to take the front, stalked but dropped back late backstretch and through the turn, re-rallied down the lane in behind runners to
grab a minor award. PEACE SEEKER settled in midpack early in the two path, was shuffled back into the turn before swinging out into the three path and
moving up midway on the bend, tipped out into the six path turning for home but her rally stalled in the final sixteenth. GOTE GO sat midpack along the
inside, was in behind the leaders in upper stretch but outkicked in the final sixteenth. COOL SHADOWS off the pace down the backside, came rail to three
wide on the turn and widest into the stretch but her mild rally could only get her past one tiring foe. ABOVE ALL NAMES was three wide in midpack before
moving up to look dangerous outside the leaders late on the turn but stalled turning for home and dropped back.

MOONLIGHT RAIN settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch, swept to the lead nearing the 16th pole and
held rivals safe under a drive. AMI'S LINK broke outward and settled in mid pack, chased hard three-wide on the far turn then gained steadily through the
stretch. ALICE'S WAR bobbled slightly leaving the gate, stalked the pace, pressed the leader into the turn then lapped on, led quickly, shook clear into the
stretch, was under an all out drive but was passed nearing the final 16th and chased to the end. LONDONDERRY settled off the pace, quickly closed two to
four-wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, lost ground then rallied determinedly. TIZ MY RIGHT sprinted clear and drew off a comfortable
lead, set a reserved pace, was pressured early turn and headed mid turn, stayed close to the stretch and faded. CRUMLIN TIME raced in mid pack, closed
inside rivals late on the backstretch, was hustled from the rail on the turn but evened out in the final furlong. BIONDETTI'S CHOICE was away slowly and
settled off the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide on both turns but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
PESARO broke outward, led quickly, set a reserved pace then held sway under light handling. CLIFF'S HEAD stalked the pace, chased from the rail to
three-wide on the turn, ran into traffic upper stretch then rallied gamely. NICE COMPANY stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, launched
her rally but could not gain in the late stages. SEA OF DIAMONDS broke inward, settled off the pace, closed along the rail late turn then finished evenly.
SHISHKA, in range, came two and three-wide on the turn but finished evenly. TREASURE QUEST broke inward, raced from off the pace, was hustled
two-wide late turn but failed to menace. SIMPLY A ZOOMER was herded outward at the start, stalked the pace, closed four then three-wide on the turn, was
all out in the stretch but evened out. VIANI ducked in at the start, raced in mid pack, chased from the rail to three-wide on the turn, made it to the outside but
failed to mence. VICTORIAVILLE, herded at the start, raced in mid pack, chased five-wide late turn but never reached contention. MY DAD ROCKS drifted
out leaving the gate, pressed the pace then forced the issue on the turn but tired upper stretch. TOP PRIZE GIRL was herded at the start, settled off the
pace, bolted early turn, was eased up, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SPEEDY LYNN chased the open length leader inside a rival, was closing in determinedly outside the leader down the stretch and got a fortuitous head bob
on the wire to nip the unfortunate rail closing rival. SEAMIALAUGH was along the rail and getting an open gap trip, stayed along the fence down the lane
and was closing inside the faltering pacesetter while the winner was outside, dropping a nasty head-bobbing decision right on the money. CLASSY N'
SILENT cleared off, held a open length advantage until deep stretch, passed inside and out in the final two jumps before the wire. LINDA LOVES LACE
hopped at the start, chased the open length leader three wide outside the eventual winner on the turn, hung tough until tiring in the final sixteenth. MISS
BOBBIT trailed, came outside a rival on the turn and beat that foe but never entered contention. SIMPLE SOUVENIR off the pace along the rail, never able
to make a run into a threatening position.

through the turn, chased into the stretch and showed a good late effort to get for place. SEA SCOUT bumped by BLACK HILLS BRONCO and in turn
bumped PATERNOSTER leaving the gate, forced the issue on the backstretch, stayed close on the turn then chased through the stretch but lost place
position in the late stages. CORRELATE settled in mid pack, was from the rail late turn, angled out in the stretch but failed to menace. SIR

two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished evenly. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS raced in mid pack early, closed five then four-wide on the
turn, encountered traffic in the stretch and evened out. BLACK HILLS BRONCO broke inward and bumped SEA SCOUT, raced from off the pace, chased
three to five-wide through the turn then finished in mid pack. GRAND ALLIANCE settled off the pace, came four-wide through the turn, ran into traffic in the
stretch and leveled off. RIGHT TO STRIKE settled off the pace, saved ground but lacked a closing response. PATERNOSTER was bumped by SEA
