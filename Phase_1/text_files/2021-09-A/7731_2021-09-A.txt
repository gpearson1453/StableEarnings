Footnotes
MS TEMPTATION prompted the pace three wide, vied turning for home, assumed command approaching the furlong pole, and drew off. SUNSET AT
MALLORY stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, chased MS TEMPTATION through midstretch as that foe kicked clear, then split foes
at the sixteenth pole to claim place. FANTASTIC RIVA vied for the lead two wide and between horses, briefly showed the way entering the lane, but proved
no match for her outer counterpart approaching the furlong pole, gave way passing that station, and held show. VENUS IN FURS tracked two wide, shifted
four wide entering the lane, but only produced a mild kick, chased through midstretch before being outkicked for place, then stayed on late but missed
reaching show. BEYOND A MILLION lied off of the pace in the three path around the turn, and made little impact. MAPPED OUT tossed her head at the
start and was off slowly, then got outrun. DECAF set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, but weakened passing the quarter pole.

COUSIN GREG dueled for the lead outside of WILLIE HAS HART, battled through the lane under a long drive, but got the better of his inner counterpart
passing the sixteenth pole. WILLIE HAS HART dueled for the lead inside of COUSIN GREG, gamely sustained the battle through midstretch while hanging
on his left lead, but gave in passing the sixteenth marker. WAR ALLY stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the top two at the five sixteenths
pole, then kept on through the lane to catch a tiring foe for show. SAUCED hopped at the start, then chased two wide, but weakened through the lane on
her left lead. CODE CLEAR failed to factor. SECRET EDGE hopped at the start while breaking a beat slowly, then got outrun. CACHIRULO pressed three
wide, but weakened at the three furlong pole.

GRAYSONSMACHO GAL managed a loose advantage while well in hand, responded when let out a notch entering the lane, and willingly widened his
margin while being ridden out. FIRE CORAL trailed, shifted three wide turning for home, and moved up to claim place at the sixteenth pole. GIANNA'S GIFT
stalked the loose leader two wide, but proved no match for that foe turning for home, then lost place at the sixteenth pole. DOUBLE DAWN stalked along the
inside, came under coaxing approaching the nine sixteenths pole, then failed to make a bid. ROLL UP MO MONEY was outrun and eased through the lane.

Footnotes
QUEEN LOUISE rated well while saving ground off of the pace, improved inside of foes into the far turn, swiftly split the leaders two wide at the quarter pole,
assumed command entering the lane, then drifted outwards at the sixteenth pole while maintaining a clear margin. Upon cooling out in the receiving barn, it
was determined that QUEEN LOUISE bled. I'M STYLIN dueled for the lead inside of SECRET REVOLUTION, disposed of that foe while meeting QUEE
LOUISE's bid at the quarter pole, got headed by that foe leaving that junction, but kept on well through the lane to firmly hold place. TEMPLE BELLE stalked
along the inside, tipped outside of the dueling pair into the far turn, produced a mild bid around that bend before being outkicked by an inner foe at the
quarter pole, chased that foe through the lane while in pursuit of I'M STYLIN for place, but hung and was denied that position. CANDY CALL broke multiple
lengths slowly, saved ground while trailing the field, improved inside of outer foes in upper stretch, but only managed to chase evenly through the final
furlong. PALACE MAGIC tracked two wide, came under urging passing the half mile pole between horses, then took the far turn three wide before chasing
through the lane while minorly lugging inwards. NORMA GEX lied off of the pace two wide, followed QUEEN LOUISE"s move around the far turn to track
from behind that foe entering the lane, but faltered between horses at the furlong grounds. DARK PHOENIX prompted the pace three wide, but failed to
keep pace with inner rivals into the backstretch, then faded four wide around the far turn. SECRET REVOLUTION dueled for the lead two wide while staying
in the three path around the first turn, but caved between horses turning for home, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
READY TO PURRFORM stalked three wide, ranged up to the leaders in midstretch while under a long drive to bid at the furlong grounds, forged an
advantage a sixteenth out, and held from the surging WESTERN RIVER late. WESTERN RIVER trailed early on, took the far turn three wide before
swinging five wide entering the lane, then sustained his rally outside of foes by surging late, but missed on the wire. HESTON settled off of the pace three
wide, gained ground four wide and outside of foes down the backstretch to a stalking position into the far turn, continued to grind away through upper
stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, then chased well through the late stages. STAR SHOPPING stalked two wide, bid for the lead in
upper stretch, led while meeting READY TO PURRFORM's bid at the furlong grounds, but yielded to him and outer foes passing the sixteenth pole. NEWT
tracked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but failed to threaten through the lane. TOMMY BEE tracked along the inside, but lost
momentum when paused behind the leading group in upper stretch, then lacked a response when called upon once clear. BUCKY BIK COIN set an
unpressured pace, but was headed in upper stretch, and gave way passing the furlong grounds. RELATIVLEA lied off of the pace two wide and between
horses around the first turn, then failed to factor. TIME TO RUN saved ground at the rear of the field, and was outrun.

Footnotes
JUJU'S MAP set the pace, drew clear from a pressing LOVELY LISA into the backstretch, widened her advantage under her own power around the far turn,
and held sway under a statuesque rider. EIVISSA stalked along the inside, and proved second best. BUNDUKI saved ground off of the pace, improved to a
tracking position into the far turn, then stayed on through the lane. LOVELY LISA pressed the eventual winner from the outside around the far turn, backed
off to stalk entering the backstretch, but only managed to chase that foe around the far turn before fading. LUCKYWISE lied off of the pace two wide, shifted
three wide in upper stretch, and moved up without threatening. MISS RAISON lied far off of the pace three wide around both turns, and failed to factor.
DAWSON SPRINGS was never involved. HANNAH'S HAVEN failed to factor. ACADEMIC HONOR got a bit restless waiting for the gates to open, then
broke slowly and was outrun. TACTICAL RANGE gained five wide around the first turn to achieve forwardly placed positioning but weakened into the far
turn. DUTCH CLOVER tracked two wide, checked from between horses into the backstretch, then weakened at the half mile pole, and plummeted through
the field into the far turn.

Footnotes
UNDISTURBED was bumped by an outer foe at the start, stalked two to three wide around the first turn, produced an early bid for the lead at the nine
sixteenths pole, cleared the early pace setter approaching the five sixteenths pole, held sway through midstretch, then lasted from an oncharging DAWN'S
DANCER late. DAWN'S DANCER settled off of the pace along the inside, patiently awaited racing room two wide and from between horses around the far
turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and rallied outside of foes through the final furlong to produce a late bid, but ran out of ground. POCA MUCHA
tracked from midpack two wide, came under coaxing into the far turn, turned for home three wide and between horses in pursuit of a clear UNDISTURBED,
then chased that foe home well before being outkicked for place late. RAPID TRANSIT settled at the rear of the field two wide, gained four wide around the
far turn to be in pursuit of the clear leader entering the lane, but flattened out in midstrech, and was outkicked for a minor placing late. MISS STELLA stalked
from the two path, chased the clear leader turning for home, but faded in midstretch. SWEET CAROLENA never got involved. AGOG bumped an inner foe
at the start, cleared around the first turn, met the eventual winner's bid down the backstretch, and weakened around the far turn.
