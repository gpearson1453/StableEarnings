DON'T RECALL lagged far behind, was asked for run on the turn, moved wide in the stretch then offered a late surge to get up in time. SPEIGHT vied along
the inside then battled back to the front then was nailed late. RISING STORM saved ground off the leaders, moved out in the stretch rallying. SAPONARA
vied outside, led narrowly in midstretch and finished gamely. SECRET MAGICIAN dropped back wide and closed the gap too late. DREAMING THOUSAND
raced outside in second flight and proved empty in the stretch. EXPENSIVE lacked speed and gave way readily.

Footnotes
BOOMERANG MISS settled close up outside, bid into the stretch and was just up after a long drive. WINGS OF FURY prompted the pace outside, edged to
the front into the stretch and continued gamely. JANELLE DREAMS trailed early, rallied into the stretch, steadied nearing the finish and altered course to the
inside. LADY MAGICA controlled the pace inside, was collared into the stretch and weakened. ALLERIA saved ground just off the leaders and faltered.
SIDEREAL dropped back early and was finished by the far turn. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong fraction was omitted.

Footnotes
END ALL GET ALL raced wide off the leaders, took over at the quarter pole and edged off driving. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM saved ground early, advanced,
swung wide in the stretch and gained late. GREENBACK forced the pace along the inside and faded then came again for the show. BOSTON LIGHT forced
the pace outside then led inside and proved empty in the stretch. SILVER FURY angled out early, stalked the pace then was finished on the final turn.
CAPE MAY STYLE dropped back early and was always outrun.
