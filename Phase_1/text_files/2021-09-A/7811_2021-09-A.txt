Footnotes
I'M PERFECT TOO three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and began to advanced through the latter portion of the turn,
continued three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong steadily gaining to be up in the final jumps to the finish.
EQUAL PAY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure early from MUN LUV, head
cocked to the left side, tucked inside into the turn and shook away to a safe advantage, remained patiently handled taking the inside route into upper stretch,
got roused at the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was nailed in the final strides
to the wire. MUN LUV forwardly placed three then two wide applying pressure early on, chased in closest aim through the turn under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BIG CITY MOMMA got bumped at the start by VENUS OYZO,
who broke outwards, and in turn bumped SOMEDAY MAYBE, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. SOMEDAY MAYBE bumped at the start by BIG CITY MOMMA
due to pressure from VENUS OYZO, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn ridden along from the
three-eighths, continued four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. VENUS OYZO broke out at the start bumping BIG CITY MOMMA into SOMEDAY
MAYBE, chased four to five wide until tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing four wide midway on the turn, continued four wide for
home and tired. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
ADVERSITY broke out and brushed the gate, showed good speed between horses, vied in the three path on the turn, fought outside of the runner-up while
still on her inside lead in the stretch and moved clear in the final sixteenth under strong handling. THE HONORABLE RUTH was sent hard from the start,
disputed the pace between horses then in the two path on the turn, battled inside of the winner to the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while able to get
the place. CARBON dropped off the pace while ridden along, went three wide on the turn, moved to the two path nearing the quarter-pole and improved
position for the show. BELARUS broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide outside the
five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong and weakened then lost the show. CARAGATE lost her
footing while away very awkwardly and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved out early then was urged along on the far outside, went five
wide on the turn and came up empty. SEDONA ROCKS was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, dropped well behind, raced inside early on the
turn, angled four wide at the five-sixteenths then shifted five wide, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CALL SIGN CHARLIE broke out and hit
the gate, showed speed on the outside of three rivals, chased four wide on the turn and retreated. CHIARA was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on
the inside of several foes, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and stopped then was eased into the final furlong but
walked off.

TELL YOUR DADDY established the front and showed the way rated along the inside through the first turn before taking to the two path down the
backstretch settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits, remained on hold marshaling the field into the far turn tucked back inside with
seven-sixteenths remaining, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide for home, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug
in and held safe to prevail. NO WORD tracked along the inside through the first turn before following the aforementioned foe in the two path down the
backstretch while tracking under rating, tucked back inside into the far turn and remained on hold until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung two to
three wide for home attempting to tip out straightened away and bumped with DREAMS OF TOMORROW at the three-sixteenths before angling back
inside, rallied up the rail running on willingly to the finish but was ultimately staved off. L'IMPERATOR (FR) settled unhurried at the tail of the field just off the
inside, tipped three wide at the three-eighths given some rein to work with and advanced, got placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish but was outkicked. DREAMS OF TOMORROW tracked the leader two to three wide in
closest aim, came under urging at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and was bumped by NO WORD attempting to tip out at the
three-sixteenths, then weakened to the finish.

Footnotes
FRILLS pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three then four path on the turn, took over into upper stretch then kicked clear, drew away
under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best. NO DEAL froze up a little over a sixteenth
of a mile from the gate during warm-up, refused to move for a few minutes while encouraged with many different methods, was eventually backed up for
around fifty yards then blindfolded, moved forward after blindfolded and went into the gate without issue, was hustled from the break, pressed the pace
loosely between foes, was hard ridden while two then three wide on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and proved no match for the winner but earned
the place. MY ROXY GIRL showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the
winner under strong urging into upper stretch and tired then lost the place but narrowly held the place. LADY BY CHOICE broke near the back of the field,
settled at the rear while moving out then back in again, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. SWEET MIA broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
ABAAN broke on top and vied briefly for command with ARUBA before establishing the front into the first turn from the two path, tucked inside midway on
that bend and showed the way in hand back to the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive kept to task to the wire. CONGLOMERATE tossed his head just as the latch
was sprung getting away a beat slow, saved ground at the tail of the field hard held early on, tipped to the two path into the far turn coming under urging at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild bid to secure the place honors. ARUBA vied
briefly for command and went three then two wide through the first turn in closest aim of the leader, prompted that rival to the outside coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMERICAN LAW four then three wide through the first turn, raced four
paths off the hedge down the backstretch, tucked to the two path seven-sixteenths from home, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, went four
wide into upper stretch and weakened. CANYOUHEARMENOW got bumped askew at the start when the stumbling REALM OF LAW recovered into him,
chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. TACKLE rode the hedge through the first turn
before taking to the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch and tired. REALM OF LAW stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and vaulting his rider into an agile and unavoidable jogging
dismount, recovered into CANYOUHEARMENOW bumping that rival solidly in the hindquarters sending him askew, then joined the race sans rider and was
apprehended after the finish by the outrider and walked off under his own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on REALM OF LAW
prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
DON'T WAIT UP ranged up after the start to take command five furlongs from home and showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. COMMANDPERFORMANCE lunged at the break and was bumped by MATT
DOYLE breaking inwards and then got bumped again more solidly but this time due to pressure from DON'T WAIT UP breaking inwards and conceded
three to four lengths to the front, chased along the inside until tipped out two then three wide nearing the three-eighths placed to coaxing, spun just off the
inside for home, tipped out four to five paths from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. FORCED
RANKING just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid a furlong from home, then weakened in the late stages. ROAD TO STARDOM came in after the start bumping and
pinching back DRAKON against FORCED RANKING, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and
weakened in the late going. MATT DOYLE broke in at the start bumping COMMANDPERFORMANCE and then got bumped by DON'T WAIT UP into that
rival once more and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide from near the rear under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six
wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. DRAKON hustled from the gate, got steadied and pinched just after the start when ROAD TO
STARDOM came inwards and lost about a length of ground before settling back into stride, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. PINE VALLEY led early on crossing to the
two path and then got displaced from command with five furlongs to go, chased two to three wide in closest aim down the backstretch and to the midway
point on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home in retreat and folded in the stretch. TORPEDO RUN five wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. LAKE TAHOE chased four wide throughout under a ride from the
five-sixteenths and faltered. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of COMMANDPERFORMANCE alleging interference against DON'T WAIT UP at
the start. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official. LAKE TAHOE RACED UNDER
THE NAME GRUDEN.

was asked to pick it up with a half-mile to run, chased inside early on the final turn, moved to the two path inside the five-sixteenths then made contact with
SILVERY RILL, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, kicked clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. HEDY LAMARR a bit reluctant to
load, was guided in early, settled while saving ground, was asked near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner under a
drive into the final furlong, drifted in around the sixteenth-pole and was second best. TOERIS saved ground around the opening bend, settled towards the
rear, was asked in the two path on the far turn, steadied briefly behind stopping foes midway through that bend then altered a bit to the inside, was driven

on the inside, lagged at the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved to the two path near
the furlong marker and improved position without threatening. SILVERY RILL traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, moved
closer with a half-mile to run, chased four then three wide on the far turn, was bumped lightly by the winner inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into
upper stretch and tired. POPULAR VOTE showed speed on the outside of two foes early, went around the first turn in the two path, showed the way on the
outside, moved clear inside the half-mile pole, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead into upper stretch then dropped back while remaining on her inside

MISS JIMMY hustled from the gate, chased along the inside in closest pursuit of AWESOME DEBATE early on, inherited the lead near the nine-sixteenths
when that rival suffered an injury and showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning along the inside route into upper stretch, came in
straightened away brushing the rail at the three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in a bit leg weary and held safe to prevail.
BETSY BLUE just off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, altered out three wide around an injured rival near the nine-sixteenths, went three to four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made mild gain on a spent leader in the late stages
to win the battle for the place honors. HONEY MONEY hustled from the gate, led early on four paths off the inside until displaced from command by
AWESOME DEBATE, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, came again mildly on the
tiring leader while heads apart with the aforementioned foe and got bested for the place honors while clear for the show. IFIHADACHANCE bumped at the
start by AWESOME DEBATE, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to the finish. PARTY AT PAGE'S three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. ROSSA VELOCE chased just off the inside until altered inside near the nine-sixteenths around an injured foe,
remained inside through the turn placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. A LIFE THAT'S
GOOD hustled from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the

Footnotes
GUNITE bumped with a rival at the start and was a bit slow into stride, rushed up to join the leaders at the nine-sixteenths, vied inside of two foes from that
point, shook clear inside the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch and drew away under strong urging. WIT
stumbled awkwardly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, made a steady advance under urging on the backstretch, chased inside
to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide in pursuit of the winner into the stretch and safely secured the place while unable to go with the winner.
KEVIN'S FOLLY showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back while moving from the two path to the rail on the turn and tired while able to get the
show. HIGH OAK was well placed while coaxed along down the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and came
up empty. POWER AGENDA lost his footing at the start then bumped with a foe after the break, was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BIG SCULLY bumped with a rival shortly after the start, was urged along towards the rear,
went four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. VOLCANIC broke out then hit the gate and was off a step slow, was urged
along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and never reached contention. HEADLINE REPORT showed good
speed and set the early pace, was joined near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three path while outside of two foes on the turn, dropped back four wide into
the stretch then drifted in at the three-sixteenths and capitulated. KITODAN bumped with a rival at the start then quickly dropped back, fell well behind,
raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide outside the five-sixteenths and was no factor. DEFEND broke out at the start, lugged out while showing
early speed, lost his footing coming to the three-quarter pole then was taken up, moved back up to dispute the pace between horses, vied in the two path
while still between foes on the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. STREET FIGHT
bumped with an opponent just after the start then was hustled, raced off the pace while ridden along, dropped back with a half-mile to run and also faltered
then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

ATONE raced three wide past the stands the initial time and was nudged inwards due to pressure from LA HARA and PERFORMING ARTS to his outside
tucking in and cut directly in front of COLD HARD CASH into the first turn forcing that rival to check sharply hurdling his heels into the first turn, settled in
pursuit along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths tipped to the two path, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the final furlong drifting out slightly near the sixteenth marker as COLD HARD CASH came inwards forcing GHOST GIANT to
pause in behind them and took command seventy yards from home, then held on at the end. COLD HARD CASH got pinched just after the star in tandem
with JOHNNY SACK when LA HARA came inwards forcing those rivals into GHOST GIANT, settled near the rear of the field just off the inside and was
checked sharply hurdling over the heels of ATONE into the first turn when he was forced in by the tandem of LA HARA and PERFORMING ARTS tucking
inwards from the outside, went three wide awkwardly into that bend before tucking back to the two path, remained just off the inside coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out to the five then six path a furlong out rallying under a drive to issue a challenge
through the final sixteenth, came inwards at that station in concert with ATONE coming out and forced GHOST GIANT to pause in behind and missed for it
all at the finish. KING CAUSE just off the pace three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and seized command
straightened away, edged away to the eighth pole, then dug in under growing threat and was caught seventy yards from home and was along for the show
honors. GHOST GIANT four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge through the final furlong when a pair of rivals came inwards and outwards into his lane, got forced to be taken in hand and paused a sixteenth out
and couldn't recover his momentum to the finish and was along for the last major share. KLICKITAT five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish passing tired rivals. LA HARA (IRE) came in after the start
squeezing back a pair of rivals, raced three wide briefly and grew a bit rank against the restraint of the rider tucking to the two path into the first turn and
nudging ATONE to the inside forcing that rival to saw off COLD HARD CASH, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home and offered no rally. JOHNNY SACK got pinched after the start in tandem with COLD HARD CASH due to pressure from LA HARA, chased
along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered no kick. PERFORMING ARTS four wide past the stands the
initial time, tucked three wide into the turn nudging a rank LA HARA into ATONE into the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and made no impact. MR. FIDGET two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, went
five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY tracked the pace just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed
along at the five-sixteenths, took over command near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, got displaced straightened away and tired.
UNITEDANDRESOLUTE showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and
took the inside route inside upper stretch to get back on near even terms before tiring to the finish. MISTER WINSTON chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths and tired. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of COLD HARD CASH alleging interference against ATONE into the first turn
which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the result standing and the race being declared official.

behind the gate, broke out then was corrected by the rider, disputed the pace on the outside, lugged out some late on the backstretch, vied in the three path
on the turn, shook clear into the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while able to get the show. NORMAN QUEEN disputed the pace
on the inside of a rival. vied inside that foe in the two path on the turn, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave
way. PATH LESS TAKEN was rated just off the pace, came under urging near the seven-sixteenths, chased in the two path through the turn and came up
empty. IDAKA brushed the inside of the gate at the start, bumped with a foe early, settled on the outside, was carried out late on the backstretch then
dropped in at the seven-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved out more, raced between foes in crowded
quarters into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. INOUAINTALKINTOME bumped with a rival early then was taken up and dropped back,
settled at the rear, lugged out a touch while three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OB LA DI chased the pace
on the inside, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. BLACK PANDA broke out and bumped hard with a rival, raced just
