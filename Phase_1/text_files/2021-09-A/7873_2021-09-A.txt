Footnotes
PRETTY PRINCESS settled off the pace while racing two wide between foes, waited for room nearing the lane, accelerated once clear nearing the eighth
pole and drew off under a drive. TRULY AMBITIOUS set a clear pace inside, led past the sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner but held clear of the
rest. AWESOME WINNA saved ground in midpack, swung out in upper stretch and was along for the show. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW stalked the pace two
wide in the clear, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. DRILLZILLA lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, swung seven wide
in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. RAIN OF BLESSING chased the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch, angled back in in midstretch and lacked a
closing bid. CIDSTAYINURLAINE broke a bit awkwardly, raced three and four wide and never threatened. OH NO ITS T B was in range three wide and
came up empty in the lane. PRINCESS SADIE was outrun inside. MISS YAYA played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM pressed GRAN CASIQUE from outside, took over at will before completing a half-mile, widened into the stretch under a drive, and
was geared down 70 yards out. MAN OF VISION stayed close early, came under a ride three wide on the turn, could not make an impression on
FINANCIAL SYSTEM and ran on to hold second. AIN'T WASTING TIME saved ground in range early, moved to the two-path approaching the stretch, and
had no rally. BENEFACTOR broke slowly, raced near the inside and failed to menace. UNCAPTURED KING was no factor two to three wide. GRAN
CASIQUE rushed through between horses leaving the chute, could not withstand the winner into the turn, and retreated. ALASTOR leapt at the start and
was off slowly, and retired early.

Footnotes
DON'T GET KHOZY tracked outside the early leaders, ranged up to challenge outside SKY CHASER with five-sixteenths remaining, gained the upper hand
leaving the furlong grounds and drew clear. SKY CHASER set the pace near the inside, dug in when confronted by DON'T GET KHOZY on the turn, dueled
to the eighth-pole before yielding, and remained clear of the rest. PANAREA brushed with STARSHIP MALLOMAR at the start, raced close up early inside,
moved out in upper stretch staying on her left lead, and could not reach the top two while much best of the others. STARSHIP MALLOMAR bobbled at the
break and brushed with PANAREA to get away slowest, and posed no threat inside. NATIONALIST stayed in range early, shifted out four wide approaching
the stretch, and came up empty. MIZZEN chased between horses to the turn, and gave way after a half-mile.

Footnotes
OCEAN SAFARI set the pace along the rail, drew off around the far turn and held clear under a drive. QUEEN MACHA saved ground off the pace, angled
three wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. MAGNOLIA ROAD chased the winner from the rail, could not keep pace with that foe nearing the
lane but stayed on well enough to save the show. BLAME THE VETS stalked the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. PALMACH had early speed
three wide between foes and faded around the far turn. KEEN CONTENDER hopped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. MARGEAUX
ROMANCE broke awkwardly, steadied off heels soon after the start, saved ground well back, went three wide around the far turn and made little impact.
SUPER FINE was hung out four to five wide around the first turn and was through after a half. DOMINANT JOY was in range inside, checked near the
three-eighths pole, dropped far back and was eased.

Footnotes
SPROUT WINGS pressed GITANA from outside right from the start, battled through the length of the stretch and was just up at the wire. GITANA set the
pace hounded throughout by SPROUT WINGS, dug in stubbornly on the rail through the lane and just missed. DEM A WONDER moved off the rail to the
three-path midway on the turn, had aim outside the dueling leaders into the stretch, and finished one-paced. CRUMB BUN was a step slow to begin, stayed
close early between horses, swung five wide leaving the turn, and made no headway. R PREROGATIVE pursued the leaders three wide, and faded
approaching the stretch. TWIRLING STAR broke a step slow, chased early four wide, and moved in tiring around the turn.

range inside, tipped two wide in upper stretch and narrowed the gap. KARENVILLE pressed the winner two wide, could keep pace with that foe nearing the
quarter pole but stayed on to save the show. JADA'S KINGDOM was squeezed back early, saved ground well back, went three wide around the far turn and
passed tiring rivals. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SISTER IS DEVIL was pulling early, raced up close two
wide between foes and tired in the drive. HARDLY SOCIAL tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. BLUE EYE KITTEN played no
