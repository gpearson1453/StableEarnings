Footnotes
ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES stalked the first flight under light reserve a bit off the inside racing to the turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and
produced a solid late response to wrest command and go clear under pressure. M AND M GIRL settled last along the rail racing through the backstretch,
angled outside rivals in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain the place honors in the closing stages. FLAN vied for command between foes
through the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing through the turn but yielded to the top pair in late stages. ICE POP broke sharply,
prompted the pace three deep racing into the turn and faded racing through upper stretch. FASHION ROSE, urged inside foes prompting the pace racing to
the turn, gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
SHIP IT RED settled into stride a bit off the inside in the opening stages, continued between foes racing into the turn, shifted out to race three deep between
rivals into upper stretch, then responded to firm encouragement in the final sixteenth to surge inside the pacesetter and just edge that foe in time under
strong handling. JO DEE'S ANGEL was rated just off the first flight shifting a bit off the rail racing to the turn, tipped out three wide in upper stretch while
being roused to advance, gained the advantage between calls leaving the furlong marker but couldn't contain the winner while grudgingly resisting that rival
to the end. SKIPPY'S STRIKE tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide in upper stretch and continued
evenly late while edging rivals for a share. JUST BLAZE, off a step slowly, settled last outside a rival in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn,
saved ground to the lane, then raced in tight quarters inside rivals in the stretch but continued to improve position late. MISTER BANJOMAN tracked off the
first flight along the inside to the turn, tipped out in upper stretch but had no rally. COLLEGE PARTY, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset
to upper stretch, gave out in late stages. ROYAL PRIVACY angled inwards while being urged along to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn,
gave way leaving midstretch.

Footnotes
STYLIN N PROFILIN broke readily, was urged inside rivals setting the pace into the turn, forged clear nearing upper stretch and widened the advantage
under mild hand urging. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN angled inwards while being urged to terms with the eventual winner prompting that rival's pace into the bend
and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. GOING RUNNING TOO tracked off the first flight along the inside to the turn, saved ground to
upper stretch and edged rivals for a share in the drive. DODROPIN, urged three wide between pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, faded into upper
stretch. THAT WOULD BE NICE, urged to a forward placing four wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, faded into upper stretch. ORTS
DREAM broke in the air while getting away last, was settled outside foes racing well off the leaders and proved no threat. TANTIMA settled between foes in
the last flight and never seriously menaced. BOOZIN AT BOZOS retreated early.

Footnotes
BELLA FIGURA (IRE) was rated attending a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, took over on the far turn, then kicked away through the stretch to prove
best under firm left handed encouragement. ACCORDING TO ASPEN tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the far turn,
shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and edged rivals for the place honors late. LULUMARU sped to the lead along the inside racing to the first
turn, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into the far turn and weakened in the drive while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share.
FRIENDLY AND KIND threw her head at the start, was righted, then angled to the rail tracking just off the leaders to the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch
and continued with a mild bid while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share. DEPUTY DORA, reserved between foes off the second flight racing to
the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch but made no impression. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE, reserved along the inside in the last flight
while pulling against restraint racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. SUNDEREYA settled three deep in the last flight racing to the backstretch
and retreated early.

SLIME QUEEN was rated between foes near the inside in early stages, switched outside foes racing into the backstretch, was prompted to advance four
wide nearing upper stretch, was bumped by PRETTY IN PINK racing past midstretch but went clear late under firm encouragement. LET'S SKEDADDLE
was rated between foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, gained position advancing in close quarters nearing upper stretch, then angled inside
foes in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors late. PRETTY IN PINK tracked just off the leaders inside foes racing to the first turn, switched out
three wide entering the backstretch moving to terms with the first flight, was urged to challenge in that path racing through the far turn, drifted out nearing
midstretch making contact with the eventual winner and faded when failing to match that rival. SHABAM, caught in tight quarters at the start, angled to the
inside while being rated out of striking distance to the far turn, shifted off the inside while angling five wide racing through the stretch but continued with an
effort to gain some position in late stages. FALL MOON ducked at the start, was reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, then tipped out three deep
in the closing stages to improve position between foes. COME ON SWEET PEA, off a step slowly, settled into stride outside foes to the backstretch, was
fanned six wide into upper stretch but made no impression. RENTAL POOL broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch,
dueled for command between foes to upper stretch and emptied out in the drive. MISSYINTOMISCHIEF tracked off the first flight outside foes racing four
wide to the backstretch, continued three deep between foes into the second bend and faded in the drive. ERIN'S CREATION angled inwards while settling
into stride between foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. TIMEINTHETAVERN was rated off the first flight while angling to the
inside and steadily faded racing into the far turn. LADY ASTRID tracked off the second flight three deep between foes, angled out five wide racing into upper
stretch and dropped out. SHIP'S CREEK, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dueled inside foes into the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
YESTERYEAR was rated off the second flight racing through the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the bend gaining position nearing upper stretch,
shifted out to split foes three wide in upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm left handed pressure. MACHO RAPIDO tracked
off the second flight outside rivals racing to the turn, came under pressure in a prolonged drive while angling five wide racing into the stretch but continued
with late interest to prevail for second late. SEATTLE SEE YA, urged to dispute the pace inside foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, dueled into
upper stretch and gave out late. ROVERTON, reserved between foes racing to the turn, angled out six wide in upper stretch and found some late stride to
close the gap. HARD TO PARK hopped at the start, settled inside foes in early stages, shifted out on the turn to improve position between foes in the
closing stages. BOSS HUGO angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes to the lane but
emptied out while being steadied out of close quarters late. POVERTY FLATS settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. JIMMIE T, urged
along five wide pursuing the leaders through the backstretch, took an awkward step nearing the three furlong marker momentarily dislodging his rider from
his right iron and faded from contention. JOSIE BOY switched out three wide tracking just off the leaders between foes racing through the backstretch and
emptied out early. THIRTYMINUTEMASS made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide between foes racing into the turn and gave way after a half. FRONT
OFFICE settled along the inside in the opening stages and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BLAZING CHARM angled inwards to stalk just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady advance to press the
leader racing through the far turn, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch and grudgingly held the challenge of LILA'S LUCKY LADY to the end in a
stiff drive. The latter broke out bumping GET ONE MORE, was righted to track just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the far turn, tipped outside
the eventual winner racing into upper stretch to advance between foes, continued willingly to close the gap on the winner to the end but came up second
best. EVERYBODY DOES IT tracked off the second flight outside foes, steadily advanced three wide on the far turn to upper stretch but had no final kick.
SNEAKY DIANNE was urged clear racing into the first turn while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside a
rival to upper stretch and gave way in the drive. SATTERSFIELD, pinched back at the start, settled last along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued with an effort to improve position. KIMBERLY FRANCES settled into stride off the inside, was fanned wide into upper stretch but lacked a rally.
REMARKABLE CHARM tracked off the second flight off the inside to the far turn but offered no rally. GET ONE MORE, bumped at the start, angled to the
inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch but faded early.

PRINCESS RENEE tracked the leaders along the rail racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to
advance, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. NORA'S LEGACY switched out three deep racing through the first turn while
being prompted to a contending position, moved to press the pacesetter after a half into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but
proved no match when confronted by the winner. INCLUDEANATTITUDE angled inwards to track the leaders three deep between foes in second flight
racing through the backstretch, was shuffled back avoiding close quarters entering the far turn, angled inside foes nearing the lane and continued well
enough just off the inside to prevail for a share late. WILLSHERWONTSHE, urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the first turn, set the pace on a
narrow advantage into the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn, then into upper stretch and gave way. WARREN'S WISH, urged
to a forward placing between foes prompting the pacesetter into the first turn, faded between foes entering the second bend. MAIDEN ROCK settled last
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. CSILLA, caught four wide racing to the backstretch while being prompted to contention, emptied out racing
through the far turn.
