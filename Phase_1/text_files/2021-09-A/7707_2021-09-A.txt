Footnotes
BOOBY TRAP was bumped and forced out shortly after the flag-fall, bobbled landing over fence one, was well placed on the inside while jumping
reasonably well, made an inside bid on the fourth turn, opened up a sizable advantage through the final turn, was asked into upper stretch, maintained a
clear advantage under urging into the final sixteenth then was eased up significantly to the wire while clearly best. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) stalked the
pace on the outside in the two path, chased the winner around the final turn, drifted out in upper stretch and finished willingly near the outside fence for the
place while gaining on an eased up winner. WEST NEWTON (GB) jumped reasonably well while traveling two to three wide on the outside, chased around
the final bend and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. PRAYER HOPE landing a bit awkwardly over fence one, saved ground on the
first two turns while towards the rear, went three wide on the final two turns and failed to rally. WIGHTMAN (IRE) struggled over fence three, saved ground
throughout and failed to respond. FIGHTINIRISHTABIT was slow into stride at the flagfall, raced near the back, hit fence eight and faltered. GLENCORRIB
SKY (IRE) struggled jumping several fences and also faltered. CHETZERON (FR) angled out and bumped a rival while rushing to the lead at the outset,
hesitated coming to fence three, continued in front until the fourth turn, fell back to the rear after fence nine and was pulled up then vanned off.

Footnotes
GRIT AND GLORY coaxed from the gate, dueled to the inside of FLOWERS FOR LISA while in hand, got briefly shaken off into the backstretch while still
latched on applying some pressure before coming again to knock heads five furlongs from home, remained patiently handled and shook off his main pace
rival near the quarter pole going three to four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a light drive to the eighth pole, then got geared down to finish under
his own power in the final sixteenth to the wire. HAWAIIAN NOISES struck the near side stall at the start, chased two to three wide through the first turn
before settling in pursuit four then three wide, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, drifted in forcing REVENIO to
steady near the three-sixteenths and ran on to secure the place honors. PLAYWRIGHT hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under prolonged
coaxing from the half mile pole, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. FLOWERS FOR LISA coaxed from the start, dueled
from the two path with GRIT AND GLORY to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got shaken off near the quarter pole and went four wide
into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. HAMMERIN AAMER three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide under prolonged coaxing
from the half mile pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and came up empty. REVENIO lunged at the break, raced four then three wide through the first
turn before giving chase three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, got forced to steady in tight
near the three-sixteenths when HAWAIIAN NOISES drifted inwards and tired.

Footnotes
STATIC FIRE was hustled to the front, lugged out while setting the pace, was guided around the turn while three then two wide, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, extended the advantage under a strong hand ride into the final furlong, came under a right-handed crop while drifting out approaching
the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. STILL MY BABE bumped with a rival at the start, chased the pace down the backstretch,
moved in near the seven-sixteenths, drafted inside while in dead-aim of the leader on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, pursued
the winner into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and narrowly earned the place. SWEET SURPRISE settled
under some urging, dropped back a bit leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch then bumped with
RAW HONEY coming to the three-sixteenths, came further out shortly thereafter and just missed the place while clear for the show. TIZMET broke a bit
slow, settled towards the rear, raced in the two path early on the turn, paused while shifting four wide coming to the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into
upper stretch then was fanned out more and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta. NEXT TUESDAY was hustled from the start, tracked the
pace on the outside, chased four then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch under a drive and weakened. DIAMOND STATUS broke a step
slow, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused into the stretch and failed to threaten. VEXEDNRELAXED broke a bit slow, settled at the
rear on the outside, went three then two wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and was no factor. MIRACLE MISCHIEF was hustled from
the start then urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. RAW HONEY was restless in
the gate, bumped with an opponent at the start, settled on the outside, was roused three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch then
bumped with SWEET SURPRISE nearing the three-sixteenths, drifted out some shortly thereafter and came up empty. MISPELLED MOOON turned her
head to the outside at the start and refused to break before being led out of the gate by an assistant starter then walked off.

Footnotes
LAKE LUCERNE just off the inside tracking the leader in close aim, tipped three wide into the far turn as IN A HURRY tipped to the two path from the
pocket, advanced outside the top pair to swing four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in to duel through the final furlong in game fashion
and just got the nod on the wire. IN A HURRY coaxed from the gate, led early on before easing off as TASS was intent on the front, tracked that rival along
the inside from the pocket, tipped out to the two path with seven-sixteenths to go and advanced on the front now between foes through the turn, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command a furlong from home, dueled through to the finish battling on gamely but was
nipped in the very last jump to the finish. CLARA PEETERS (GB) saved ground near the rear of the compact field, came under coaxing near the quarter
pole, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. CHOATE BRIDGE a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, tracked from the tail of
the field two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TASS hustled from the
gate, established the front after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits facing little pressure until engaged by a pair
into the far turn, faced intensified prompting from a duo to the outside through that turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole before being roused
taking the two path at that station, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, then weakened to the finish.

Footnotes
LOKOYA ROAD went four wide on the first turn, settled comfortably on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, chased the runner-up under a drive
while outside in the stretch, made a bid into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. SPEED EFFECT broke very fast and went to the front, set
an uncontested pace in the two path on an easy lead, controlled the tempo through the final turn, shook off OPERATIVE when asked at the quarter-pole,
came under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker, led under heavy threat into the final
sixteenth, drifted out late and was caught while able to get the place. JOHNNYPUMP was hustled from the gate, angled in at the rear, saved ground under
coaxing around the opening bend, was taken in hand while behind a foe entering the backstretch then settled, came under urging while two then three wide
on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. CHASE TRACKER was hustled from the start, settled just off the
pace on the inside, was asked to pick it up on the far turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, cut the corner under a drive into the stretch, dropped
back into the final furlong and had nothing left. OPERATIVE broke very fast, moved out into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, tracked the pace on
the outside, made a bid in the three path under urging on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. SUPER WICKED CHARM
was hustled leaving the gate, dropped from the five path to the two path early on the first turn then moved three wide, was urged along passing the
five-eighths, dropped back while three then two wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
JILL'S A HOT MESS broke out and bumped solidly with PROPER GRAMMAR then was pulled off that foe, showed speed along the hedge, was rated under
a strong hold while just behind the leader, drafted inside while still tugging at the bit on the turn, waited in the two path from the quarter-pole to inside the
three-sixteenths then was given her cue, rallied into the final furlong, gained to take the lead into the final sixteenth and prevailed under steady urging. TIS A
PITY brushed with a foe at the start, was reserved towards the back of the field, went three wide while still in reserve on the turn, was roused four wide into
the stretch then tipped to the six path at the three-sixteenths and finished willingly for the place. HIGHWAY QUEEN came away in good order, angled in
while showing good speed then set the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final sixteenth and weakened while just able to save the show. SHOW ME THE HONEY bumped
with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the front, chased four then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch under the crop,
pursued the leader into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. HERALD ANGEL broke well from the outside post, moved
in while displaying speed then tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid while three then two wide on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped
back under the crop into the final furlong and weakened. KREESA LA WROTE was brushed in the hindquarters at the start, settled while coaxed along, was
roused for more in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BIG AL'S GAL was taken back early then
reserved off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ATHENA
DANCER broke out and hit the gate then was bumped soundly on both sides, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the quarter-pole
then moved off the rail in upper stretch and also failed to rally. PROPER GRAMMAR broke in then bumped hard with a rival, settled at the rear, saved
ground on the turn, came off the rail into the stretch, moved out under a drive into the final furlong and was no factor. SHE'S NOT BLUFFING was hustled
from the start then urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BONUS BABY bumped with
an opponent at the start, settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to respond.

VINDICTIVE three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide from just off the pace, advanced through the far turn under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying and came inwards a furlong out brushing ANGKOR and forcing that foe to
briefly pause when in the midst of being shaken off between rivals, dug in head to head taking command a sixteenth from home and drifted out in tandem
with RUNNIN' RAY while gamely prevailing on the line. RUNNIN' RAY got away to a quick advantage timing the spring of door so as not to make contact
with it while breaking in concert under coaxing, showed the way in hand along the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits facing little
pressure until nearing the far turn, came under threat from a pair to the outside through the bend and was placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair to the eighth pole, then dueled to the finish with the aforementioned foe and was headed
a sixteenth out, fought on game drifting out as a tandem to the wire. ANGKOR four then three wide through the first turn, tucked to the two path nearing the
backstretch and chased two to three wide advancing on the leader into the far turn between foes, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was in the midst of being shaken off when brushed by VINDICTIVE and forced to pause just outside the eighth
pole, then weakened in the final furlong while just preserving the show honors. FIRST LINE bobbled at the break, raced three wide into the first turn before
tucking to the two path and then to the inside, chased inside under a hard hold early on, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch and weakened. TEXAS SWING broke a half a beat slow, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide
for home and tired. BUSINESS MODEL chased two to three wide until tipped four wide through the far turn coming under encouragement at the
three-eighths, cornered three to four wide at the head of the stretch and trailed.

COMPANY at the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked in the three path into the stretch, disposed of the aforementioned foe under a right-handed
crop into the final furlong and powered to the wire a front running victor. PORTFOLIO COMPANY was last to depart the gate, became very rank under
restraint in the two path, continued very rank through the first turn and early on the backstretch, was rated while tugging hard at the bit, ranged up while let
out on the final turn, made a bid in the three path at the five-sixteenths, was asked for his best while four wide into the stretch, battled outside of the winner
to the furlong marker then was turned away and outfinished but clear for the place. LIMITED LIABILITY rounded the first turn in the two path, settled near
the back, saved ground on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung out into upper stretch then moved further out under a drive and lacked the
needed response but was clear for the show. GOOCH GO BRAGH traveled around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace under coaxing, chased
three wide on the final turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, floated six wide into the stretch the drifted further out and tired. KAVOD went three
wide around the opening bend, moved up entering the backstretch then settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked in the vicinity of the
seven-sixteenths, went four wide under urging on the far turn and faltered. SILIPO was rated inside on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch,
settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond then also faltered.

Footnotes
RAINING CANDY just off the inside tracking from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue
a challenge through the final furlong altering out slightly a furlong out as LADU THORNHILL shied out and then being lightly herded a sixteenth out as that
foe shied out once more, took command inside that station and inched clear to the finish kept to task. LADY THORNHILL broke out at the start brushing the
off side stall, then continued outwards and was corrected, went four then three wide through the first turn settling in mid pack, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, rallied to take command a furlong out shying out at that station from a left handed crop, dug in under threat shying
out a sixteenth from home again under a left handed crop and was collared inside that station, then ran on to secure the place honors. TINGLING MINT just
off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled out five wide into upper stretch and closed well through to the
finish to secure the show honors. TAPPLE CIDER two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled out six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. FIST FULL OF DICE broke a half a beat slow and lost her lane to KILLOEAN
ROSE, chased along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch before tipping out three to four wide through the far turn placed to urging at
the five-sixteenths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and improved position with a mild kick. SALUKI three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, got
coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, went eight wide at the head of the stretch and kept on to the finish. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE established the front
after the start and a brief tussle with a pair before showing the way safely in front in hand along the inside, came under pressure for the initial time three
furlongs from home, got placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and spun three wide at the top of the stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a
furlong out, then weakened in the late stages. LA VICTORIA two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, went awkwardly
seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. KILLOEAN ROSE tracked the pace along the inside under encouragement from the five-sixteenths, cornered
just off the inside for home and weakened in the stretch. VIVAZANO just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival three furlongs from
home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ACUSHLA three wide through
the first turn, chased three wide offering up a mild bid under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired.
