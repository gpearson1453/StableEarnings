I IDOLIZE YOU was unhurried early, in tight on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch drew clear. A I INITIATIVE settled off the early leaders, was hustled
along on the far turn and vied from the three path through the stretch but was second best. FLORIDA WON stalked the leaders from the outside and was
roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. GIANT MINE set the pace, had the lead on the far turn but drifted out
at the top of the stretch and had nothing left. MARTINI SUE tracked the leaders from the inside and was a factor on the far turn but flattened out.

Footnotes
RED EQUINOX was in touch, checked on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. SUNSPRITE was off slow, closed the gap on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. BENNY'S BUTTON was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch needed more. CAREFUL JAVA broke poorly, moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. SILENT
GUROO stalked the early leaders and had a good position on the turn but had no late kick. REINE SECRET was away alertly and had the lead on the turn
but was headed at the top of the stretch and faded. RING THEM BELLS was off the pace, chased on the turn and had no impact. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

CLASSY VISION settled off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and angled out in mid stretch to get up in time. EIGHT SPEED set a pressured pace, had
the lead on the turn and a clear lead in upper stretch but was caught late. PASTEL EMILY was hustled from the inside and a factor on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. RI N GINGER was in touch and moved up on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no
real threat. MOON ROVER was away alertly and roused from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response.
DAD'S MISSY was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BLIND TRUST was up
close, forced the pace from between foes on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. SAVVY LAYLA tracked from the outside
and had a slim lead on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was all out. ALL CANADIAN stumbled at the start and closed the gap on the
turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more. FOREST SURVIVOR showed speed from the inside and dueled on the turn but had
nothing left. DRAGON'S BREW was off the pace, chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was no threat. EXCEED had no speed,
trailed the field on the turn and was outrun. GLITTER MOUNTAIN was hustled early and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT was away alertly and a factor on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch evened out. POUROSO was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. SEAMUS was
hustled early and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. DEPUTY OF EGBERT was in touch but chased on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

LOST CORSAGE set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. ENHANCED FINANCE was in touch, a
factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. TERMSANDCONDITIONS was off slow, raced evenly
on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. TARA EMPIRE was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch leveled off. PLAY IT SMART stalked from the inside and was roused on the turn but had no late kick. LEAVE IT WITH ME was
off slow and showed nothing in a dull effort.

the top of the stretch was all out. PRINCESS MORO stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
finished evenly. NAKED ILLUSION was in range and raced evenly on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch flattened out. CAPOEIRA
was well back, showed little and was never in contention. CHEEKY PINT was in touch early but trailed the field on the far turn and failed to fire.

HADDASSAH stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. HARLAN
ESTATE was in touch and moved up on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. KEEP GRINDING was in mid pack, raced
evenly on the far turn and angled out in mid stretch and finished well. H C HOLIDAY was unhurried early, in tight on the far turn and from the four path at the
top of the stretch finished evenly. CURLIN'S CATCH was off the pace and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no kick.
TIDAL FORCES tracked the leaders from the inside and had a good position on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch faded. AVOMAN
was well back, showed little and from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. READY AT DAWN set the pace but lost ground on the far turn
and was empty.

Footnotes
KLASSY DELIGHT was in mid pack, in tight on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. LOADED ONCE MORE forced the
early pace and dueled on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SAVOIA set a pressured pace and had a slim
lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. LIGHT IT UP was off slow, had a mild gain on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the
stretch was up for a share. TWICK was off slow and saved ground on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. SPLENDIDA was
away alertly but lost ground on the turn and from the four path at the to of the stretch was empty. TOURIST ATTRACTION was in range early but trailed the
field on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.
