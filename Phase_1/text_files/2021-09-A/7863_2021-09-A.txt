Footnotes
LIBERTY BELLE hopped at the start, was never far back, circled rivals rapidly five wide into the far turn, set the balance of the pace and widened through
the stretch to win as much the best while in hand. WICKED WAYS bumped at the start, led into the clubhouse turn, saved ground and finished second best.
SEE YOU AT THE BAR pressed the early pace two wide, split horses to make the lead before a half, had speed into the stretch then weakened.
HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE close up, failed to respond. BIG LIZ was no threat. MY OWN PASSION was bumped at the start, rushed to the lead widest on the first
turn, gave up the advantage before a half while three wide then stopped after a half.

best. SWINDLE broke in front, quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. K FOR KATHY well placed, failed to
respond. NATURAL BLING was no factor. HEIDI'S BACK bobbled at the start and was no threat.

GALTERO unhurried early, closed rapidly along the inside through the far turn, made the lead before the furlong maker and drew clear under a strong hand
ride. AXIS broke in front, set a pressured pace through the first turn, opened a daylight advantage before a half, drifted to the six path entering the stretch
giving up the lead then was no match for the winner while well clear for second. AWESOME STEEL far back early, altered course from the six path to the
rail sharply a furlong out then passed tiring rivals. SKYLIME well placed, failed to respond. PLONDER pressed the pace two wide around the firs turn,
remained a sharp threat into the stretch then gave way. WHEELBARRELBROTHRS trailed.
