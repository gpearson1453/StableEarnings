Footnotes
ALIBI FOR MISCHIEF took command of the early fractions, set all of the pace through the second turn while saving ground, was roused off of the turn and
won in a drive. DR. HOFFMAN was four wide on the first turn, settled in the midflight, was five wide on the second turn, made a late bid in the stretch and
closed willingly but settled for second best. RED HOT CAT sat off of the pace through the second turn, improved position on the second turn while three
wide but was outfinished in the stretch run. RUNAWAY KRISTIN stalked the early pace by the winner, was two wide on the second turn while gaining but
weakened in the late going. ROWDYROOSTER was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch
but was not challenging the leaders late. NACHO VICTORY settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second turn and did not rally in the
stretch drive. WYNNVILLE stalked the pace from a mid-pack position, lost ground on the second turn while two wide and gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SAINT IVES dueled on the front end with FASCINATED through the backstretch and turn, lost a bit of ground to that foe leaving the turn,drifted out leaving
the furlong marker and made contact with FASCINATED and gamely came back to win the head nod on the wire. FASCINATED dueled for pace duties with
SAINT IVES through the backstretch and turn, was three wide on the turn, opened up a bit of a lead on SAINT IVES off of the turn, was bumped by that rival
leaving the eighth pole, continued to duel and was nipped on the wire while a clear second. LUVTHEONEURWITH sat off of the dueling pacesetters while
two wide on the turn and closed willingly for the show in the stretch. MOB BOSS was unprepared at the start and was away slowly, chased from the rear
while three wide and weakened in the stretch run. LOVE THAT KID settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and did not offer a bid in
the stretch. DASHING DEMI chased the leaders while four wide on the turn and faded in the stretch run. STARRY SIERRA was outrun leaving the start,
was two wide on the turn and trailed throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE EIGHTH POLE
INVOLVING SAINT IVES AND FASCINATED AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT SAINT IVES DRIFTED OUT AND IMPEDED
FASCINATED AND DISQUALIFIED SAINT IVES FROM FIRST TO SECOND. THE JOCKEY ON FASCINATED ALSO LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST SAINT IVES FOR THE SAME INCIDENT.

Footnotes
VAPING ANGEL sat just off of the early pacesetter, saved ground on the second turn, mounted a stretch bid inside of the furlong marker, split horses inside
of the final sixteenth and gamely got up in the final yards to prevail. CARASYNTHIA prompted the early pace while three wide on the second turn, took the
lead from the pacesetter and led into the final sixteenth but was nailed in the final yards while holding on to second. REMEMBER SUE chased from the
midflight while three wide on the second turn, mounted a rally leaving the turn and just missed for the win and place, while holding on for the show.
VRONSKY FEINT broke alertly and set the pace through the second turn, led into the stretch but was confronted and outfinished in the drive. UPTOWN
RHAPSODY stalked the pace from the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn while two wide and was outkicked in the stretch. SILVER AFFAIR
tracked the pace from the middle of the field, was two wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run.

PROOF OF JAZZ broke on top and set all of the pace through the second turn, saved ground on that turn, extended the lead into the stretch and drew clear
in the end. BREAKING THE CODE settled near the rear of the field, improved position while saving ground on the second turn and was outkicked in the
stretch while besting the rest. MANGOTANGO had no speed in the early going, saved ground on the second turn while still toward the rear and made a late
bid in the stretch to claim the show. BLUSHING BAY attended to the early pace by PROOF OF JAZZ, continued to track the winner while two wide on the
second turn, was tiring and drifted out in the stretch and flattened out in the late going. SMILING ANN sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on the
second turn and weakened in the stretch run. AVALON RIDE was away a step slowly and chased the leader from toward the rear of the field, lost ground on

SENORITA ESTRELLA sat just off of the early quick pace by PROMOTE, was three wide on the turn, gained ground leaving the bend and in a quick rush
collared the pacesetter and edged clear late. BIG CHICK chased the early pace into the turn, mounted a bid while four wide on the turn and kept on in the
stretch to put mild pressure on the winner while besting the rest. MISS SKI was away a step slowly and chased the leaders from the rear, was three then
four wide on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch but was not challenging the top two. SPUN AWAY tracked the leaders from towards the rear of the
field, was two wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. PROMOTE (IRE) was sent to set the early quick pace, was two wide while showing the
way on the turn, led into the stretch but was quickly collared by the winner and tired in the late going. ROLINGA stalked the pace from a middle position,
saved ground on the turn and weakened in the stretch run.

REBALATION settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn, mounted a bid on the rail leaving the bend then swung out to confront ALLIE'S
PAL in the final sixteenth and had a late kick to just win the nod at the wire. ALLIE'S PAL was off sharply and set quick fractions into the turn while saving
ground, had a clear lead into the stretch but was confronted by REBALATION in the final sixteenth and was nipped on the wire while clear of the rest. NEW
DRAMA chased the early pace while saving ground on the turn and was outkicked in the stretch while holding for third. AUSTRIAN NAVY settled in the
middle of the field while saving ground on the turn, gained ground leaving the turn but lacked the needed late response. OSCAR NOD stalked the quick
early pace by ALLIE'S PAL, was two wide on the turn, lost ground off of the turn and was empty in the stretch run. SUGAR CRUSH was away slowly and
chased the field from the rear, was three wide on the turn and made a late bid in the stretch but was not challenging the leaders. LAUREN SQUARED
tracked the leaders in the first quarter-mile, lost ground while three wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch.

responded to collar CAROLINA MIA in the late going and pulled away in the end. CAROLINA MIA stalked the early pace, improved position while three wide

while two wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. TIGER QUEEN set the quick early fractions while in the two path on the turn, was confronted
off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SMILING SPIRIT was away a bit slowly and chased the pace from the rear, was two wide on the turn and
finished evenly in the stretch run. MUNN SHE'S PRETTY attended to the early pace from a ground saving position and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MEET THE SHERIFF sat just off of the early pace, improved position on the turn while saving ground, angled out for the drive, took the lead heading into
the lane and dug in in the final sixteenth to hold off oncoming challengers. BARHOPSKY was away a step slowly and tracked the leaders from the rear of
the field, was three wide on the turn, made a bold late bid in the stretch but could not reel in the winner while holding on for second. ROWDY OH prompted
the pace by WINNING MAGIC, was fanned five to six wide on the turn when EL BEAUTIFUL took up, vied for the lead heading into the stretch but was
outkicked while holding for third. ARICKAREE chased the early leaders from the mid-pack while two wide on the turn, gained off of the turn, continued that
run into the final sixteenth but waited for racing room then had to take up while in tight quarters in the late stages. WINNING MAGIC was hustled to set the
early fractions, was two wide on the turn, was confronted leaving the bend and weakened in the stretch run. UNION BOY tracked the leaders from toward
the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch drive. SON OF SMALLS prompted the early pace from a three wide position
and tired in the stretch run. BUHM'S CANDY BOY was outrun in the early going, was five wide on the turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch but was
not challenging the winners. EL BEAUTIFUL attended the early pace, took up in tight quarters leaving the five-sixteenths marker and fanned ROWDY OH
out by that action, was four wide on the turn and weakened in the late going.
