lane, made a steady gain and drove clear. TULA rated in the early going, angled out and pulled to contention, shook clear into the turn, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the place. LACEE stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position two and three wide
through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then flattened out and held the show. HOXIE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through
the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and ran evenly in the stretch. SENORITA SPARKPLUG was no factor. AT LEAST sprinted clear soon after the

TOTAL DISTRACTION sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the stretch, drew off, then lasted under steady pressure. ANOTHER
SOFTBALL mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, was blocked into the stretch, waited, came through, then angled out quickly, made a
steady gain and missed. FIGHTIN PHIL stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, weakened late and held the show. TRI TRY COLORS mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made
a steady gain and edged up for a share. STOCK CHAIN hard to rate in the early going, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the
lane and lacked the needed late kick. ZOODLES well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and
weakened the final furlong. MIKADO tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out.
HESASMOKIN allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and passed tiring rivals. PAWNBROKER ran
evenly. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR well placed and outside, moved up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally. CHUCKLES
CANDY dwelt and reared at the start, was never involved. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

COME ON LET'S RIDE set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and held under steady pressure. BOCA tracked the pace,
saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner and held the place safe. PATTI D mid pack,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and missed the place.
STANDUP OR SHUT UP allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and ran evenly. WILD IRISH well
placed, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. GOLDEN SWEETS stalked the pace on the
outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and weakened. CYCOLOGIST improved her position. THE X FACTOR allowed
to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside, then drifted out and could not gain. BELL THE CAT well placed, held position

Footnotes
CLOONTIA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then shook clear late and drew off while being kept to
the task. DETANGLER tracked the pace, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was
no match for that one and held the place safe. C THE KING well placed, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and flattened out. GO HIPPO GO mid pack, gained a striking position four wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened
the final furlong. MAD JACK allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and improved his position.
DOUBLE RAINBOW allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. BLACK TIE
EVENT well placed and off the rail, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no stretch rally. GOLD WING
was never involved.
