Footnotes
SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE broke sharply, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, bid three wide from the seven sixteenths, loomed three wide past
the five sixteenths, battled to the lead past the three sixteenths, kept on gamely between horses to the wire and held. FINNEGAN (IRE) was bumped by
WILL KNOWS in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, chased the leading trio while racing in the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane,
chased the leading trio through upper stretch, engaged outside of SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE and DARK NINJA past the furlong mark, continued to gradually
gain while all out, got up for place in time but missed catching the winner. DARK NINJA hounded the pace outside of DIVE DEEP down the backstretch and
around the far turn, continued to vie between horses in the leading flight into the lane, was headed by SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE past the furlong mark,
could not retake the lead from that foe despite continuing to battle gamely inside him to the finish, and lost the place in the final jumps. WILL KNOWS came
in and bumped FINNEGAN in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path around the far turn, was driven into the lane, drifted out
in upper stretch, and chased on evenly late. DIVE DEEP was sent for speed, made the early pace while pressured by DARK NINJA to his outside, saved
ground on the turn while continuing to take pace pressure from that one, vied at the inside of the leading flight while driven into upper stretch, proved no
match past the three sixteenths and emptied out.

Footnotes
OL GREY GHOST chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive. TOM'S LAST GENERAL raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path
nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch in the three path and gained ground on the outside late. OUTRIDER raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, gained ground in upper
stretch and was outkicked late. COCO BRAVADO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, entered the turn between horses, angled in to save
ground from there, improved position in upper stretch and was outkicked while drifting out in late stretch. RIP IT RYAN hit the gate and hopped up at the
break, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, still well behind the others, and made up some ground down the lane
while never threatening. UPBEAT MELODY led the field up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired from the rail in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
SEVEN SEVENTEEN settled near the rear outside of CLOSE TO ME into the clubhouse turn, settled back to the rear near the seven furlong mark,
continued patiently down the backstretch, rallied three to four wide around the far turn after being asked past the half, was driven four wide into the lane,
sustained her rally, led near the furlong mark and cleared. HERO ALEXANDRA chased the leading pair outside of SHE'S HOT TODAY early, took closer
order in tandem with that foe down the backstretch, tracked the leader in tandem with CLOSE TO ME past the five eighths while racing three wide, bid on
the leader in the three path near the three eighths, took the lead at the five sixteenths, kicked clear into upper stretch, was caught by SEVEN SEVENTEEN
at the furlong mark, proved no match, but chased on under a drive and held place. SHE'S HOT TODAY broke inward, chased the leading pair through the
clubhouse turn, inched closer into the backstretch in tandem with HERO ALEXANDRA, pulled between horses near the five eighths, chased in the two to
three path around the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, chased under a drive, proved no match for the winner but narrowly missed the place.
MAYSTART settled at the rear into the clubhouse turn, raced in second last into the backstretch, continued patiently down the back straight and in the two
path on the far turn, came into the lane in the two path, was driven to advance between horses, and passed tiring foes. HOOSIER GOLD CASE tracked the
leader through the clubhouse turn, raced at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, continued in range in the pocket around the far turn, raced
two wide into the stretch, drifted out under a drive in the lane and lacked the needed rally. CLOSE TO ME settled toward the rear inside into the clubhouse
turn, improved three wide from near eleven sixteenths and four wide past the five eighths, was urged in the four to five path around the far turn while with
the tracking flight, came four wide into the lane and proved empty. VARSITY FLYGIRL led into the clubhouse turn, set the pace down the backstretch and
while saving ground around the far turn, was engaged by HERO ALEXANDRA past the three eighths and headed by that foe near the five sixteenths, was
driven inside into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MAJOR WAGER hopped up and stumbled just out of the gate, recovered to settle in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch and got up in time for the victory. TUFF ATTACK
settled off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the four path around the turn, began a wide bid entering the stretch,
gained ground steadily down the lane and just missed. BIARRITZ pressed the pace between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path,
raced evenly in upper stretch, was caught in the final furlong and finished well. THE GREEN MO'STER trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and gaiend ground between horses late. SMOKIN RICHIE was urged to the early lead, showed the way under a hold up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and tired on the rail in the final furlong. STORMIN EL PRADO brushed with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, chased the frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, raced into traffic while running in the two path around the
turn and faded in the stretch. RED HOT DEVIL brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) soon led, raced keenly while setting the pace in the two path on the turn, was driven to a clear lead in upper stretch, and held
safe throughout. SEVEN SCENTS tracked the pace outside of HIGH CRIME down the backstretch, continued to track the leading pair in the four path on the
far turn, raced three wide in the tracking flight into the lane, was outkicked by both NEVER HAVE I EVER and NUCLEAR OPTION in upper stretch,
continued to chase doggedly under a drive, came back on NUCLEAR OPTION late and nabbed the place. NUCLEAR OPTION chased inside down the
backstretch, continued in the two to three path on the turn behind the leading trio, was urged up the inside for a bid into the lane, proved no match for
NEVER HAVE I EVER from upper stretch, kept on earnestly behind him but was caught for place late. CHINOBE settled toward the rear outside of HUEY
ATTACK, chased in the three path on the turn, swung out five wide into upper stretch for the drive, and rallied mildly late to prove best of the rest. HUEY
ATTACK settled toward the rear inside of CHINOBE, saved ground around the turn, was driven up the inside into the lane, rallied, but was outfinished in the
final furlong. HIGH CRIME tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came into the lane three wide between horses in the
tracking flight, and flattened between horses from just past the three sixteenths. WILD WES settled at the rear, trailed in the two to three path around the far
turn, was urged approaching the quarter pole, swung seven wide into upper stretch, and took mildly closer order late under a drive. AMBASSADOR LUNA
stumbled badly at the start, unseated her rider, trailed the field while completing the course riderless, was apprehended by an outrider after the race and
walked off the course. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY INTO THE START; UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION NO QUARTER MILE TIME IS AVAILABLE.

CAN'T HIDE FROM ME raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, began an
outside bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, quickly took over and drew off to the wire under a drive. BULLION fought his rider while saving ground
around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to run off the pace headed into the far turn, saved ground from there,
gained ground down the stretch and was no match for the winner. CROCE D'ORO angled over to save ground around the first turn, led the field up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, was caught entering the stretch and chased the winner home, getting outkicked late. EDISON
FIRE raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path
around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. HANNITY raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the frontrunner on the outside up the
backstretch, raced between horses headed into the far turn, entered the stretch in the two path and tired from there.

straight, rallied two wide around the far turn, split horses near the quarter, raced into the lane two wide, engaged outside of NO NAY NOW in upper stretch,
was carried out by that foe as he drifted out, kept on just outside him, brushed with NO NAY NOW in the final furlong, fought on but lost the bob. KIT
KOWALESKI raced three wide in the rear flight into the clubhouse turn, settled at the rear, trailed down the backstretch, kept on toward the rear in the three
to four path around the far turn, raced inside into the lane, rallied, and proved best of the rest between horses. SON OF GRACE raced three wide in the
tracking flight into the first turn, advanced in tandem with ARTIE AND JESSIE near the thirteen sixteenths to briefly engage the leading flight, settled back
near the five eighths to track the leading pair outside NO NAY NOW, pulled to attend three wide past the half, continued four wide in close range of the
leading flight around the far turn, floated five wide into the lane, proved no match for NO NAY NOW and QUIET PRAYER, and was outkicked for the show.
OFF TO THE BEACH raced between horses in the rear flight into the clubhouse turn, settled in second last into the backstretch, improved three wide on the
clubhouse turn to get in range with a compact field approaching the quarter, swung four wide into the lane, was outkicked in upper stretch, and chased on
evenly late. QUALITY HOUR came away slightly awkwardly, settled at the inside of the rear flight into the clubhouse turn, continued near the rear around
that bend, improved position inside past the half and around the far turn, proved no match for the leading pair in upper stretch, and flattened out late. COLD
BIRDIE led into the clubhouse turn, was engaged by ARTIE AND JESSIE and SON OF GRACE into the backstretch, dueled inside of ARTIE AND JESSIE
while racing keenly down the backstretch, continued that pace battle while racing in the two path on the far turn, was overhauled approaching the quarter,
came three wide into the lane and proved empty. FIRMAMENT chased inside through the clubhouse turn, raced between horses in the chasing flight down
the backstretch, took up when cut off by QUIET PRAYER into the far turn, was driven in the two path around the far turn, raced up the inside into the lane,
but proved empty and was not persevered with late. ARTIE AND JESSIE raced between horses in the tracking flight on the clubhouse turn, pulled to engage
outside of COLD BIRDIE past the thirteen sixteenths, engaged that foe in a duel into the backstretch, dueled to the five sixteenths, began to flatten out,
floated six wide into the lane, proved empty and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
STACK SHACK saved ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the far turn,
kicked clear entering the stretch, and drew off to the wire under a drive. NOFANSINTHESTANDS raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn,
came up the backstretch between horses, navigated the far turn from the two path, and gained ground on the outside in late stretch. BOW DOWN TEWMEY
raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths
pole, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth of a mile. SPECIAL CONQUEST saved ground around the first turn, raced off
the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made a mild improvement of position from the rail in late
stretch. EMILY BUG saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the far turn and weakened between horses in the final furlong. OXBOW'S RUBY raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. ONE FLASHY GIRL raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path and faded entering the stretch. UNBURNT pressed the pace from the
three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to tire from there.
