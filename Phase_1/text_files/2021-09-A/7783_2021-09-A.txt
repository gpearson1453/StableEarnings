Footnotes
PROJECTED (GB) tracked along the inside, saved ground on the far turn, waited for room, split rivals two wide entering the stretch, rallied outside of
KITTEN STREET and finished well late to draw clear. KITTEN STREET bobbled slightly at the break, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn,
responded, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run, was no match for the winner and held well for second. FATIMA'S BLESSING was fractious in the gate
and backed out, reloaded, settled off the pace, chased inside on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and closed well late. DR. SHANE stalked close up outside
a rival, bid three wide at the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. CANDY CANE LANE stalked two wide early on, then pressed the pace, bid two wide,
dueled on the far turn and tired. KURILOV (CHI) raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. PROMISE ILLGETYOU was outrun.

HALF IS ENOUGH hesitated and had a slow start, rushed up into contention nearing the half mile marker, bid three wide on the turn, quickly took charge,
responded when roused, pulled away and was ridden out. PUT A BOW ON IT showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled inside on the turn, dug in on
the rail in the final sixteenth and held on narrowly for the place spot. LADRO DI FICHI stalked early on, bid between rivals on the turn, rallied late in the two
path and just missed for second. ESCANDALO raced off the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. POOR NO MORE raced off the pace inside,
checked at the five furlong marker and dropped back.

Footnotes
C'EST MARDI set the pace on the inside, dueled with ACT LIKE ARTIE on the far turn, battled back gamely inside of that rival past the eighth pole, inched
away and then was all out to hold on at the wire. MISS JEN trailed early on, moved up between rivals, made a three wide run on the far turn, rallied outside
in the stretch drive, kicked in late, surged and just missed. LUCY'S TOWN raced off the pace, moved up on the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied late
between horses and got up for third. SCATNAP stalked three wide, bid three wide on the turn and finished evenly in the lane. ACT LIKE ARTIE raced three
wide early, then vied outside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn and into the stretch, dug in gamely and weakened in the final sixteenth.
CARIBBEAN KITTEN pulled early racing close up inside, then tracked on the inside and lacked a bid. U KNOW I B LION pulled and was steadied in the
early stages, raced off the pace inside and had no rally. TANAGER raced three wide early, had a three or four wide trip and failed to threaten. PUPAREE
stalked between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
DOUBLE THUNDER raced off the pace inside, advanced between rivals entering the far turn, angled out for a clear path turning for home, responded when
asked, closed strongly outside, rolled to the lead past the sixteenth marker and was geared down nearing the wire. AMERICAN SANCTUARY was forced
wide entering the first turn, settled two wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, made a strong four wide run at the quarter pole, swept by the
leaders to the front, then dug in gamely but no match for the winner. MIDNIGHT WORKER stalked close up two wide, bid between rivals entering the far
turn, dueled past the quarter pole, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and earned the show award. CHANCELLOR BAY checked entering the first turn,
recovered quickly, then stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled into the lane and dug in gamely between rivals to the end. SWIFT TAP was
reluctant loading, then off a bit slow, forced wide entering the clubhouse turn, settled three wide off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and tired. BUFF
HELLO tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and faded. UNDER THE GUN set the pace on the inside, dueled into the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
PECAN PATTIE stalked close up outside a rival, bid three wide entering the far turn, raced wide while battling heads apart with AWESOME ALANA turning
for home, dueled with that rival through the stretch run and prevailed late. AWESOME ALANA pressed the pace racing close up two wide, bid between
rivals entering the far turn, came wide into the stretch, dueled with PECAN PATTIE through the stretch drive and battled gamely to the end. R B C GOLD set
the pace on the inside, dueled inside rivals entering the far turn, faded and held on for the show spot. CROWN OF JOY was outrun early, asked on the far
turn and failed to threaten. FUN PADDY tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and tired.
