Footnotes
VELVET SLIPPERS sprinted to the front from inside, set the pace under pressure early on, cleared nearing the five-sixteenths pole, inched away around the
turn and added to the margin in the stretch. PARK AVENUE got bumped from inside on the first turn, went up to press the pace from outside, could not keep
up with the winner on the far turn and chased that rival to the wire. ANGEL OF FREEDOM settled along the inside, moved out on the far turn and came
three wide into the stretch and held the show. DREAM OF JEANNE angled inside rival nearing the first turn, was under restraint while pulling some early,
went four wide into the far turn then angled down to the rail and could not summon the needed response in the lane. ASSIGNATION went five then four
wide around the first turn, continued off the inside and five wide into the second bend, got carried six wide into the lane and was not a factor.
TMORROWISALONGTIME drifted out and bumped rival on the first turn, stalked the top pair off the rail, lost ground through the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TIME TO PARTY sped to the front, showed the way through the turn on the inside, roused into the lane, urged right-handed midstretch and remained clear
under steady handling. SUMTER chased four deep early, three deep on the turn, took aim at the leader two wide exiting the bend, could not gain any
progress on the winner but stayed on to hold the place. BOMBS AT COCAL forwardly placed between rivals early on, went two wide into the turn, moved
down to the inside, steadied past the five-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch and lost the battle against SUMTER for the place honors.
FACETIOUS was off slow to begin, angled down to the inside, steered out to the four path on the turn, drifted inward to mid-stretch, corrected course and
kept on for a minor award. PENETRATOR steady briefly off the heels of TIME TO PARTY early, chased inside a trio of rivals, lacked room around the turn
and could not rally. RAKU FIRING hopped slightly at the start to come away a bit slow, raced off the pace off the inside, advanced four then three wide on
the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. BIG IMPACT chased off the rail, dropped back around the bend while angled to the rail and never made an
impact. ONE TIME MARK chased three deep early on while between foes, remained between runners on the turn, angled to the rail at the top of the stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
BRANDON'SMYLAWYER up close along the inside then rubbed the rail briefly, stalked the top through the turn, angled three wide leaving the bend, rallied
outside the leader and took over with a furlong remaining, cleared that foe then held well over the runner-up. STERLING CREST (IRE) tracked off the pace,
steered to the inside then exited the bend two wide, angled out in upper stretch and finished well outside the winner. TOM'S BEAUTY showed early speed
between foes, chased the top pair leaving the backstretch, moved out in the lane and got up for the show. SUGAR SUGAR vied three deep early then
pressed into the turn, dueled around the bend and took control leaving the turn, challenged in upper stretch, overtaken at the eighth pole and flattened late
to get edged for the show. FAST JANIE tracked two to three wide into the stretch and could not rally. SO SOFTLY vied for the lead from inside, set the pace
into the turn, dueled around the turn and lost command leaving the turn, then weakened down the lane. FORTUNATA TENSIO was off slow to begin, went
outside a pair of rivals on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was not a factor. MUY CHISTOSA raced off the pace early on, went three wide into
the turn, steered out and came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

SEVEN SISTERS sped clear and angled down to the two path, padded the lead around the turn and held safely under right-handed urging.
WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE tugged early and went between runners early on, coaxed around the turn while angling out to the four path and gained ground
late. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH bumped leaving the gate, unhurried in the beginning, went three then two wide on the turn, and rallied for the show. TAMING
THE TIGRESS tossed her head and hopped at the start, took the turn three wide, angled out in upper stretch and got edged for third. LITTLE MISS ELLIE
chased along the inside then moved out to go around a rival, took the turn two wide and needed to find more in deep stretch. MUCHA WOMAN stalked
outside a rival behind the pacesetter, exited the turn three wide and weakened. LI'L GRAZEN bumped leaving the gate, chased off the pace, went three
wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. KRISTI'S TIGER sat off the pace early on, angled seven wide leaving the turn and could not
find the needed response. ANOTHER EDDIE tracked outside a rival or off the inside, steered out on the turn and entered the stretch six wide, then had little
left for the late stages. MISS GLORIOUS bumped both sides at the start, steadied when then pacesetter came over near the half-mile pole, chased on the
inside through the turn and faded. TAKETHEDIAMONDLANE climbed up the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT FLIRT took the first turn two wide, sat off the pace through the early stages, went three then four wide on the far turn, shifted in while
launching a bid three deep at the eighth pole, dueled with CANDY ON TOP in deep stretch and proved best in the end. CANDY ON TOP stalked the pace
on the inside, moved into the two path leaving the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, bid between rivals at the eighth pole, gained command soon after,
dueled through the late stages and got outkicked. INFINITE LOVE off slow to begin, settled at the back, angled five wide leaving the second bend, rallied
but was no enough to threaten the top pair. PRECIOUS INSIGHT was closest in pursuit through the early going, drew alongside at the seven-sixteenths,
took over past the five-sixteenths pole, cleared briefly in upper stretch then received challenges from a pair of rivals with a furlong remaining and weakened
late. HEAVEN'S GHOST raced in range off the rail, exited the far turn three wide, was crowded in upper stretch and weakened. BIG SHAMROCK tracked
two wide early then entered the lane three wide and lacked a rally. BONITA LEONA cleared early and crossed over, controlled the pace up the backstretch,
overtaken just inside the five-sixteenths, stayed on to the stretch and gave way. ROUBAIX checked between rivals on the first turn, taken back to stalk out
of range, saved ground on the far turn and came up empty. AMANDA ROSE came in at the start, was hard to ride and steadied on the first turn, trailed two
wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DOUBLE THE GOLD stalked the pace outside a rival, bid three deep into the stretch, took over with a furlong to go and drew clear late. FINGLAS LAD away
quickly and sped to the front, vied outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, dueled around the turn, vied between carrying a short lead into the stretch, lost
command at the eighth pole and stayed on for the place. STATE OF THE UNION chased the leader then went up to vie from between rivals, dueled inside
FINGLAS LAD on the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. FLOYD KNOWLES stalked off the rail, two to three wide on the turn and lacked the
necessary bid. COMMISSIONER DAVID brushed from inside at the start, settled outside a rival, entered the stretch five wide and could not rally. PRIMED
FOR DRINKS shifted out and bumped rival at the start, traveled near the back, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to make an impact.
LOOKINFORMISCHIEF broke awkwardly and got bumped from inside, raced greenly early, lacked room and hopped slightly behind a pair of rivals, drifted
seven wide on the turn and weakened. TAP UNION broke out and brushed rival, went five wide into the turn, seven wide into the stretch and failed to
menace. AFTER THE CANDY broke out, went up to vie for the lead from inside, dropped back on the turn and tired.

on the backstretch, five then four wide on the second bend and bested the rest. INFO'S TREASURE tucked inside on the first turn, went two wide into the
second bend, was blocked behind PRUDENT who was dropping back on the far turn, altered out and came six wide into the stretch and was along for the
show. SUGAR KISSES went four wide around the first turn, steered out to race widest on the backstretch, came six wide into the stretch and could not rally.
ZAHRA stumbled leaving the gate, went five wide around the first turn, moved down to the three path, entered the stretch two wide, split foes at the top of
