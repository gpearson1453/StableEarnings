ORSETTO set all pace, well rated, clear into stretch, held on to the wire. PERFECT LIMIT inside trip, saved all the ground, rallied late, no good enough.
STELLAR GRACE chased winner to deep stretch, gave way grudging in the drive. HOMEROOM ANGEL no speed while inside most the way, leveled off
with no late kick. EASY SILENCE chased to pair to the stretch, gave way in the lane. MOMMA RIO steadily faded.
