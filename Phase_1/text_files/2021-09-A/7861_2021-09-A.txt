CLASSY HALO allowed to settle, saved ground on the tow path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady
gain and edged up late. EVERY LITTLE BIT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was no match for the winner and
held the place safe. GRAND MAMOO rated in the early going, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a
steady gain and hung. NURSE JUDY never far back, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. LIMONATA
allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. FUNNY PURSUIT well placed and outside, faded through the turn.

outfinished. FUEL THE BERN vied for the early lead on the outside, gained a short lead down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged through the turn,
then lacked the needed late kick. BOOMIN GOOSE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and lacked the needed
late kick. SNAP HOOK mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and had a mild gain. WAPITI

WHERE YOU WAS well placed, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, dueled in the late going with RIO ABAJO, edged
ahead of that one and held. RIO ABAJO stalked the early pace on the outside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, dueled with the winner late and was outfinished by that one. VALENTINE BUG allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane and closed well for the show. CAPTAIN MAD JACK well placed, moved up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and gained
a share. LIDO LEGACY mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, steadied and could not gain.
LAWN DART sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded the final furlong. MA DE TAW was no factor.
