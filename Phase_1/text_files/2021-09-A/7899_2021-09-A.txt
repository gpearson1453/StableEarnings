KASILOF challenged for the early lead, drove clear, dueled late down the stretch and hung on for the win. ETERNAL FORCE raced within striking distance,
came around the turn on the outside, rallied down the stretch, dueled late and needed one more jump. ZENS SECRET vied for the early lead, forwardly
placed throughout, finished on the rail and proved no match for the top two. ALMA DERBY pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, lacked a kick
and finished evenly. MOSTA FLYIN lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. HOMEVIEW was an early factor and faded, while finishing
wide. BEST LITTLE MAN raced near the back in the beginning and was never close. NAUGHTY MOON always raced near the back and showed little.
