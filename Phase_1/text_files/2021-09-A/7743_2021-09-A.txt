at the start, stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. MY FINAL TRICK was taken back at the start and settled
off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. IN PURSUIT broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled
from the rail and two-wide on the turn then finished gamely along the rail. LATER GATOR settled off the pace and settled well back early, was hustled on
the turn but failed to menace. REAL CHOPPER pressed the pace, stalked on the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LIVERPOOL MAN sat three wide in midpack down the backside, was two to four wide dropping back slightly late on the turn, tipped widest of all in upper
stretch and closed relentlessly down the middle of the course, passing all the tiring pace battlers at the sixteenth pole and pulling away. SUIGU STAR broke
out with his head in the air at the start, settled in the two path off the pace, came inside on the turn and angled out in midstretch, closing well the final
sixteenth, up for place in the final strides in a race dominated by the closers. PERSONAL JOURNEY in the two path and in mid pack early, was inside the
eventual winner on the turn, followed that one in midstretch but couldn't match his energy, then gave up the place spot late as well. L'ETAT (GER) trailed on
the turn and was forced to steady hard when the riderless horse went by, proceeded to tip out in the same wide path as the winner took into the stretch and
closed belatedly to pick off the pace stragglers to get a minor award. I HAVE HOPE chased the leaders in the three path, bid three to four wide late on the
turn and had the lead in the stretch but was passed nearing the sixteenth pole, surviving the pace battle but losing the war, settling for a game fifth. KING
OF GYPSIES stumbled at the start but recovered to get the lead, was dueled and pressed by a rival into the turn for home but tired from that pressure. DR.
JEWEL chased along the rail, angled out behind the leaders turning for home but could not rally and ran evenly to the wire. SAINT'S REST sat along the rail
and off the pace, rallied two to four wide on the turn but levelled off in the final furlong when his rally stalled. JUST START ME UP pressed the front three
wide on the backstretch, dueled with a rival on the turn but tired in upper stretch when shifting about, retreating in the final sixteenth. TRINITY GOLD chased
four to five wide down the backside, still very wide on the turn and tired from midway on the turn. TWIRLING MOON was between rivals battling early,
dropped back to let those two go at it but fell back from midway on the turn. MY BOY CHRISTIAN leapt up at the start and was always far back and wide.
BLUE SNOW stumbled and lost his rider at the start.

Footnotes
GUITAR GEORGE raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn, chased into the stretch, bid 1 16th out and prevailed under a drive.
EMBRACE MY UNCLE stalked the early pace, forced the issue on the backstretch, took the lead in the final furlong but was outkicked. I IDOLIZE YOU
broke alertly then dropped to the rear of the pack, saved ground then rallied gamely along the fence. FLORIDA WON settled off the pace, was roused
three-wide late turn and rallied mildly. NEVAEH'S VALENTINE showed early speed, set a reserved pace, was pressured on the backstretch and turn, shook
clear at the top of the stretch but gave way when headed in the final furlong. AMBERWOOD, always in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the far
turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. AHEADBYACENTURY settled off the pace, raced three-wide throughout, was hustled on the far turn but
never reached contention.

Footnotes
ARI GOLD SPEEDWAGN was taken back early, came two to four-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied willingly and got up late
under a drive. CANOLA WORLD, close early, stalked five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, gained command a 16th out but failed to contain
the winner in the late stages. SILENCE BREAKERS broke outward and settled in mid pack, saved ground on the turn, rallied between foes and was up for
the show position. YOLA was prominent early, dueled from the rail on the turn, was passed a 16th out and gave way. SPEEDY MOONLITE raced forwardly,
dueled two-wide on the turn, was passed mid stretch and also gave way. BARILKO dueled four-wide, lost ground at the top of the stretch and lacked a
closing response. YZERMAN had speed, vied three-wide but began to give way late turn and faded through the stretch.

pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch then held bravely to the final yards. IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) broke alertly but outward and settled at the rear,
closed two and three-wide on the turn, chase into the stretch but was outkicked. LOOKINATAMIRACLE, in range early, was checked hard at the turn then
was hustled along the rail, was blocked upper stretch, found a way to the outside and closed with good energy. STRIKING MOON stalked the pace, was
hustled from the rail on the turn then rallied determinedly along the fence. MAGICAL MAN forced the issue came two-wide through the turn, chased into the
stretch but leveled out in the late stages.

Footnotes
BEYOND MY DREAMS settled off the pace, closed four-wide on the turn, rallied outside and was up just in time, driving. MAAKWA led mid way through the
backstretch, set a pressured pace, was engaged mid turn, dueled, shook clear upper stretch and although all out was caught on the wire. COLTONS
DREAM showed early speed but was headed mid backstretch, stalked three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. CORE, in
mid pack early, rode the rail on the turn then rallied belatedly. OCELOT forced the pace on the backstretch, bid mid turn, dueled, was headed at the top of
the stretch, chased to mid stretch and leveled off. WASAGA broke awkwardly to the inside, settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
and was never contentious. LOVE THAT MADISON shied away from WASAGA whose awkward start came his way, pressed the pace, dropped back a bit
and stalked on the turn, chased into the stretch but flattened out. VIEW FROM EGBERT settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn
then lacked a rally.
