Footnotes
ROAMING UNION broke sharply and went straight to the front, showed the way through solid fractions while inside to the two path, extended the advantage
late on the far turn, responded well when asked coming to the quarter-pole and drew off under a strong hand ride and one tap of a down-turned crop to
prove much the best. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS jostled with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while
inside early on the far turn, angled four wide outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive and safely secured the place while no
match for the winner. LEGIT leaned out and brushed the gate at the start then was hustled, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was
urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, was fanned out six wide near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response while best of the rest. ASHAAR was hustled from the start, went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased
two then three wide on the far turn, dropped back under the crop into the stretch, remained on his inside lead while tiring in the drive and capitulated.
SUPREME AURA jostled with a rival at the start then was asked, saved ground around the opening bend, settled comfortably in third position, was asked
with a half-mile to run, went three wide early on the far turn then was carried five wide near the five-sixteenths, dropped back to the three path outside the
quarter-pole and failed to respond. ACKER was last to depart the gate then urged along early, saved ground on the initial turn, came out entering the
backstretch, settled at the rear, was urged in the two path early on the far turn then lugged out four wide at the three-eighths, bore out eight wide in the
vicinity of the five-sixteenths and also failed to respond. HEAVY ROLLER went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was ridden along passing
the half-mile pole, dropped back while four then three wide on the final turn and faltered.

PIPELINE four then three wide in range of the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch
seizing command straightened away, then edged clear under a drive kept to task. WAXMAN two to three wide in pursuit just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, had the rider lose the handle on his crop nearing the quarter pole to the right side, swung five wide for home reaching for a
pair of goggles for encouragement and lost the majority of them save one pair now entwined in his cap cover when pulling them from their perch on his
helmet, flagged the goggles right-handed to his charge for encouragement losing the cap cover with three-sixteenths to go and fought on head to head with
CODY'S WISH leaving a debris field behind and ultimately prevailed in that battle for the place honors while unable to threaten the top one through the final
furlong. CODY'S WISH four then three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch,
dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe through to the finish getting bested for the place honors while well clear of the rest for the show honors.
STICKY ISSUE showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from UBIQUITOUS to the outside, tucked inside into the turn and came under
increasing pressure coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and floated to the two path straightened away
displaced from command, then tired in the stretch. UBIQUITOUS coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and tired. NORTH CAROLINA chased three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide for home and tired. BALTASAR four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, went six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
RISKY MISCHIEF settled comfortably on the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch under
the crop, closed well to make a bid outside the furlong marker, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady handling. HARPER'S IN
CHARGE was taken in hand early then rated off the pace, saved ground while drafting along the rail on the turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the
stretch, rallied inside to make a bid inside of two foes inside the furlong marker, fought with the winner in the final sixteenth and finished with good courage
but missed while able to secure the place. MISS DOMINA was hustled from the start then switched outside of MEET THE BEAUTY early, tracked that foe
on the outside, ranged up to make a bid in the three path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch then was asked for her best, led under a drive into the
final furlong, battled between foes from that point to inside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished but earned the show. LILLY SIMONE was taken in hand
early then reserved off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the three path into the stretch, angled out inside the three-sixteenths and lacked
the needed kick. FETCHING lugged out at the rear of the field, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MEET THE
BEAUTY was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was guided around the turn in the two path under extra left-rein pressure, came
under urging at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead under a strong left-handed grip into upper stretch and gave way. FORT DRUM was reserved off the pace,
went around the turn in the two path and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CILLA hustled from the start, raced six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the three then two path half a mile from home,
tipped back three wide through the turn nudging SOUPER SENSATIONAL four wide, came under light coaxing three furlongs from home and advanced on
the leader in tandem with the runner up through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch taking command near the three-sixteenths,
dug in under a left handed stick headed for the front a furlong out and came out brushing with SOUPER SENSATIONAL just inside the eighth pole, dueled
through to the finish coming out again a sixteenth from home still under a left handed stick brushing with her main rival when taking back the front, then dug
in gamely to the finish to prevail. SOUPER SENSATIONAL coaxed from the start, raced seven then six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
three wide half a mile from home and was nudged four wide by CILLA near the three-eighths as the leader moved along the two path into front, came under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide into upper stretch advancing, dug in under a drive to take command briefly and narrowly a furlong out,
had CILLA come out under a left handed crop and was brushed just inside that station, dug in dueling through to the finish, had CILLA come out under a left
handed stick again a sixteenth out and was brushed once more getting headed for the front, dug in fighting on to the finish but was ultimately denied at the
end. LI'L TOOTSIE four then three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to
go, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. OXANA stumbled at the start and recovered under
coaxing to take brief command before conceding the front to EDIE MEENY MINY MO, chased that rival two to three wide until tucked inside through the
turn, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was outkicked. EDIE MEENY MINY MO
coaxed from the gate, pressed the early pace of OXANA from the outside five paths off the inside before advancing to take over the front five furlongs from
home, tucked to the two path into the turn and showed the way through the bend under coaxing from the five-sixteenths and under growing threat from a
pair, spun just off the inside for home, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and weakened. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well
as a Claim of foul by the rider of SOUPER SENSATIONAL alleging interference against CILLA through the stretch. After review, the claim of foul was
dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
ANNAPOLIS went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried towards the back, angled from the two path to the four path on the final turn, rallied
outside under the crop into upper stretch, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong marker, kicked clear under the crop outside the sixteenth-pole and
drew away under steady urging. NYQUEST NIX was taken under a snug hold after establishing a forward position early, rounded the opening bend in the
three path, stalked the pace on the outside, was let out in the two to three path on the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the
winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get the place. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, was roused four then five wide on the far turn, lugged in and carried CALLOWAY PEAK in nearing the furlong marker then caused that foe to
steady, continued to lug in while on his inside lead near the sixteenth-pole and just got up for the show. BELOVED WARRIOR went three wide on the
opening bend, settled on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
response then weakened. CALLOWAY PEAK was taken up briefly while off heels into the first turn, settled more kindly while saving ground, raced inside
early on the far turn then moved to the two path, swung four wide into upper stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths, was carried in by
OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE at the furlong marker then steadied, regained momentum outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the trifecta.
FAITH RUNNER was well placed on the inside, came under urging around the five-sixteenths, was driven into the two path into upper stretch and came up
empty. IRISH SEA brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground under urging on
the far turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. CURBSTONE went three wide on the first turn, settled near the middle of the field, was asked
four wide on the far turn and failed to respond. SOUTHERN SENSE was reserved on the inside, dropped to the rear late on the backstretch, fell well behind
while saving ground on the final turn and also failed to respond. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT went to the front, set the pace on the inside through sensible fractions,
was asked near the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and faded.

CLASSIC CAUSEWAY coaxed from the gate, ranged up to establish the front shortly after the start and showed the way very lightly coaxed just off the
inside, came under very light coaxing through the turn, spun just off the inside for home and was roused straightened away, drew off under a drive with
authority to the finish to prevail. TRAFALGAR coaxed from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn coming under coaxing near the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tipped out to the two path straightened away, offered up a
mild bid to improve position and secure the place honors. BRIGADIER GENERAL chased three to four wide in closest aim of the leader under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. MISBEHAVED bumped lightly at the start
by the breaking inwards OLYMPIAN, chased briefly in the two path before tipping out three then four wide down the backstretch carrying GALT out to the
outside of him each time, came under coaxing half a mile from home tucked back three wide into the turn, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. TEN GAUGE bobbled at the break under coaxing and chased just off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside put to coaxing half a mile
from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. GALT got bumped off stride after the start by TIZ ETERNAL who came inwards, chased four to
five wide throughout coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went four wide into upper stretch and never threatened. OLYMPIAN broke in a step at
the start bumping MISBEHAVED, chased five then four wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. TIZ ETERNAL came in bumping GALT off stride after the start, chased six to seven paths
off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path through the turn under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) settled nicely on the inside, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed crop, closed
well to get the lead nearing the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. NEVER
SURPRISED sped to the front then became keen when taken under restraint early, tossed his head and tugged hard at the bit into the first turn, showed the
way through sensible fractions while inside to the two path, came under coaxing late on the backstretch then was asked for more on the final turn, spun into
the stretch in the two path then came under a drive, lost the lead approaching the furlong marker and was outfinished while able to get the place. LIKE THE
KING stalked the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was given his cue on the far turn, made a bid in the three path into upper stretch, fought with
NEVER SURPRISED under a drive into the final furlong, battled between foes from that point into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked but held the show.
HE'SPUREGOLD was caught four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch
and lacked the needed kick. FOUNDER settled on the inside at the rear, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
gained late but failed to impact. MOHS broke out and hit the gate, tucked into the two path while pulling on the bit prior to the first turn, was reserved
towards the back, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was asked with five-sixteenths to run and failed to rally.

CARA'S DREAMER broke out at the start brushing the off side stall before bumping FREEDOM MACHINE into INFRINGEMENT and in turn BEYOND
BROWN and ENGLISH BREEZE, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, tipped out two to three wide nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside for home, rallied tipping out to the three path briefly near the eighth pole before tipping out to the six path nearing the sixteenth marker and surged
late to engulf a a quartet seventy yards from home getting up in the shadow of the wire to score. JUST OK IS NOT OK stumbled badly four to five strides
after the start pecking the ground before recovering to tuck inside settling just off the pace tracking the front, remained patiently handled until placed to
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, angled in to the inside near the eighth pole and rallied up the rail to issue a challenge
inside that station, dug in battling with a trio and seized command a sixteenth from home, then got nailed in the final jumps to the finish in a good effort.
LOOKIN TO FLY broke out at the start and was corrected, raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping three to four wide down the
backstretch, went four to five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths and advancing in tandem with ENGLISH BREEZE to her inside,
swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to threaten through the final furlong among a quartet and then a quintet latched on and battling to the finish and
was just along for the show honors. GOLDEN OLDIE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a flanking trio and stubbornly clung to command through to the sixteenth
marker, then fought on to the wire and was just nosed for the show honors. FREEDOM MACHINE got bumped at the start by CARA'S DREAMER and in
turn bumped INFRINGEMENT into BEYOND BROWN and ENGLISH BREEZE, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes through the stretch to near the finish threatening to the end but as
outfinished in the very late stages. ENGLISH BREEZE bumped at the start in a chain of bumps begun by CARA'S DREAMER, raced four then three wide
into the first turn before tucking to the two path midway, tracked two to three wide from mid pack, commenced a bid three to four wide from the three-eighths
in tandem with LOOKIN TO FLY to her outside, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive and was outkicked when staying on one paced to the finish.
ELECTRIC YOUTH broke in at the start getting away slowly, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for
home and made no late headway. INFRINGEMENT bumped at the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn before giving chase two to three
wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went five wide for home and tired. TAX ME NAUGHT shied out at the start, spun
three wide into the first turn before tucking to the two path midway, went four to five wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from
the three-eighths, spun five wide for home and tired. BEYOND BROWN got bumped between foes at the start, spun five wide into the first turn before
tucking four then three wide, raced three to four wide from just off the pace pulling early on, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went four wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BABY YODA was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two to three path on the turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, kicked
clear when set down into upper stretch, powered away under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under vigorous hand-ride to the wire while
much the best in a very fast time. OLYMPIAD settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
safely secured the place while no match for the winner. DUCALE showed good speed, set the pace under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, was
asked under heavy threat from the winner at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to that foe at the quarter-pole and tired while clear for the show. REJECTED
AGAIN settled well back in the field, raced inside early on the turn then shifted to the three path, dropped to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and
failed to threaten. CROWDED TRADE settled near the back, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide near the three-eighths then came out five
wide over heels, was carried seven wide into the stretch then bumped with AMPERSAND outside the three-sixteenths and never reached contention.
TUGGLE settled off the pace, raced behind foes in the two path past the three-eighths, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, drifted out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally. AMPERSAND was bumped at the start, raced well back in the field, went three then
four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then bumped with CROWDED TRADE outside the three-sixteenths and was no factor. HOMETOWN
broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled, settled off the pace, was roused while three then two wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. STAYIN' OUT LATE veered out and hit the gate, was ridden along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and also failed to
respond. MARCHING chased the early pace from third, dropped back midway down the backstretch, came up empty along the rail on the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack in a spread out field early on, remained patiently handled as the field took closer
order on the leader nearing the three-eighths, began to tip off the inside nearing the quarter pole and went six wide into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away, rallied to take command a furlong out drifting in and received one sole left handed tap to correct, edged away under a hand ride to the
finish to prevail. GREAT ISLAND tracked the pace along the inside in closest aim of the spurted away leader, tipped to the two path seven-sixteenths from
home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and took over brief command three-sixteenths out, got collared a
furlong from home and ran on to chase the winner home just preserving the place honors on the wire. MY SISTER NAT (FR) saved ground at the tail of the
field, tipped to the two path three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive,
kicked on belatedly to just miss for the place honors. LOVELY LUCKY just off the inside in pursuit, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. AMERICAN BRIDGE (GB) got wrangled at the start by the rider and rated unkindly early on along the
inside through the first turn unhappy with the rider in her mouth and holding restraint, settled when given some rein to work with and finding cover behind a
rival past the stands the first time, remained inside until tipped to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. LA SIGNARE (FR) established the front and spurted away just off the inside while in hand through moderate splits,
tucked inside into the backstretch, remained patiently handled and had the field take closer order at the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths coming under threat for the initial time, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded command at the three-sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
MAX PLAYER was sent hard from the start, raced in the three path around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the
far turn, took over in the three path while set down into upper stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and drew away under
strong urging. HAPPY SAVER was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, was
given his cue inside the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick but got up for the place. FORZA DI ORO was antsy
in the gate then lunged inward and brushed the inside of the gate at the start, went to the front, set the pace on the inside with company to his outside, was
asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened then lost the place but held
the show. NIGHT OPS was hustled from the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled just off the pace on the outside, was urged along
passing the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch while behind a foe, pursued the vanguard under the crop in the
drive and lacked the needed response. CHESS CHIEF was taken in hand early, saved ground around the opening bend, settled off the pace, was urged
along passing the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch under the crop and came up empty.
FOREWARNED went around the opening bend in the three path, settled on the outside, was urged four then three wide on the final turn and failed to
respond.
