IT GIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the winner nearing the sixteenth pole but could not get by that
rival in the drive. FEATHER INTHE WIND was never far back while racing along the inside, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths marker and gave
way in the drive. CELINAS BLUE BIRD set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. BARSINTHECAR lagged early,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

COUNT ALEXEI tracked the pace of MY FATHER FOOTSTEP from the inside, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and wore that foe
down in the final yards to be going away late. MY FATHER FOOTSTEP was bumped at the break, opened a clear margin soon after, saved ground and
yielded to the winner late. TIZ MANNY settled off the leaders throughout and finished evenly in the drive. SPARKLING LUTE settled off the leaders early,
moved five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. NORSKI was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. GUIDED BY ANGELS chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
OXBOW PARK checked repeatedly soon after the start, raced unhurried early, angled far out nearing the quarter, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run
and drew off as a handy winner. LUCKY CAUSE dueled for the early fractions with JAZZ STORY while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in
the drive but finished well to hold the place. TIEMPO DE ORO was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive.
JAZZ STORY disputed the pace with LUCKY CAUSE while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. LUKE'S PLACE was bumped at the
break, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. HE'S BANDIDO chased the leaders while racing
four-wide and weakened after going three-eighths. SEA DORA PROUD was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and
was not a factor.
