FAST AXTON sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the furlong marker, then drew off under mild urging. OVERTHOUGHT mid
pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the place. C C'S KITTEN unsettled in the gate, was
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed the place. MASTER tracked
the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong. STUDYLONGSTDYWRONG well
placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no stretch rally. LITTLE LADY POWER was never
involved.

Footnotes
BANDY'S MAP allowed to settle, moved up while drifting out slightly through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drove
clear late. ATLANTIC SUN (GB) rated outside the leader, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid outside into the lane, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. CORT'N ASONG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the final yards, then was no match for
the winner and held the show. RED CAT (CHI) tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and evened out.
LEMON BLITZ well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. WHISTLE ME
HOME mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and ran evenly. JANGADA was no factor.
