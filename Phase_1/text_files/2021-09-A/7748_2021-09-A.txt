Footnotes
KOKO'S KANDY chased on the inside, angled four wide leaving the turn, drifted in midstretch, struck the front outside the sixteenth and drew clear late.
VETOED leaned back and hopped at the start, traveled along the inside then two wide into the stretch, came back to the rail in the drive and rallied up the
inside to prove second best. GRANDCONCOURSE GUY sped to the front and crossed over, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, continued to show the way
with SUMO alongside on the turn, managed to put away that rival but faltered in deep stretch. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS stalked three deep early, four then
three wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished willingly. SUMO brushed from inside at the start, pressed the pace three deep then outside the
leader on the turn, could not keep match strides in upper stretch and lacked the needed late punch. SOLO ANIMO broke out and brushed at the start, sat off
the pace early on, took the turn five wide and went evenly through the final furlong. ENCROACHMENT sent early and showed speed between rivals, could
not keep up into the turn, started to weaken around the bend and faded. CALI BAY (IRE) tracked between foes early, angled to the rail no the turn and also
faded. LORD M off slow and broke inward, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path then came three wide into the stretch and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
APPRECIATED traveled a bit off the rail on the first turn, crept closer from inside on the backstretch, lacked room on the far turn, steered out and came four
wide into the stretch, collared rival near the sixteenth pole and drove past. FLY TO MARS traveled in mid-pack early on, raced two wide into the stretch, was
crowded and behind rivals in upper stretch, tipped three wide then angled to the inside in deep stretch and closed gamely for the place. IRISH HEATWAVE
steered down to the two path while unhurried in the beginning, angled four wide into the lane, brushed rival in upper stretch and took over shortly after,
cleared with a furlong remaining, yielded grudgingly to the winner and saved the place. SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) angled in and stalked the pace from
inside, waited for room leaving the far turn, lacked room from upper to midstretch, tipped out with a sixteenth remaining and kept on for a minor award.
BLAMELESS pressed the pace from between rivals, raced on even terms past the five-sixteenths pole, brushed with IRISH HEATWAVE in upper stretch
and flattened out in the late stages. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) traveled along the inside at the back, moved out and went thee wide into the second bend,
moved down to the two path then swung four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) sped to the front and set the pace
inside a pair of rivals, got headed midway around the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and gave way. IAN GLASS pressed the pace three deep,
chased three wide into the drive, lost path in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TOOK CHARGE bumped from inside at the start, set the pace under pressure, cleared into the stretch, challenged again late from AUGUSTA MELODY and
held gamely. AUGUSTA MELODY pressed the pace from outside into and around the turn, lost contact into the lane, continued to give chase just off the
winner, then came back on late but was not enough. KA'NAH broke out and bumped HAWK HILL, stalked along the fence then moved to the two path,
could not make an impact on the top pair but stayed on for a clear third. HOLDEN THE LUTE chased in the two path to the turn, exited the bend four wide
and lacked a response. SABUDA tracked off the rail, three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HAWK HILL got bumped on both
sides leaving the gate, traveled four, five, then six wide on the turn and never got involved.

Footnotes
ALLABOUTTHEMONEY stalked the top trio, asked at the five-sixteenths, angled to the inside, rallied along the rail and got up late. DA KINE was forwardly
placed three deep early on, challenged into the second bend, put a head in front at the three-eighths, cleared while pushed upon nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, led clear to the final sixteenth and was caught late. HARBOR SKY raced three to four wide through both turns, was closest in pursuit leaving the far
turn, rallied late and proved a game third three deep in the final strides. GONE ROGUE sat off the pace early on, exited the far turn four wide and finished
well to fill out the superfecta. PRIMER DIMER was off a bit slow to begin, raced six wide into the first turn then angled in a few paths, remained well off the
rail to the second bend, went outside rivals then five to six wide into the stretch and never threatened. ROADSIDE settled on the inside then steered out on
the far turn, came three wide into the lane and never made an impact. K P SILVER BULLET turned head and came away slow then got shuffled back at the
start, raced well off the pace, four to five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. LUCKY CHANCE checked when a rival came over early, went three to four
wide around the first turn, three then two wide on the second bend and failed to menace. CANT STOP THIS MAN pressed the pace from between foes, vied
for command into the final turn, started to weaken around the bend and gave way. ABI GEZUNT set the pace under pressure from a pair of rivals, vied for
the lead into the far turn, could not keep up around the bend, tired in the lane and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
QUEEN GODDESS broke through the gate prior to the start and was re-loaded, stalked the speed on the inside, was in tight past the three-eighths pole,
rallied three deep in the final sixteenth and proved best. MISS BELLA CIAO sped clear and moved inside, challenged at the three-eighths, dueled with rivals
around the turn, battled into the final sixteenth and was bested by the winner. MORAZ bobbled leaving the gate, pulled a bit first time through the stretch,
tracked off the rail, launched a bid approaching the three-eighths, dueled for command around the far turn, battled into deep stretch but could not find the
needed late kick. BASILIA rated outside a rival or in the two path to the stretch and also lacked the needed late punch. FOR THE GOOD TIMES settled on
the inside, moved off the rail then went two to three wide on the far turn and could not rally. FI FI PHAROAH traveled near the back of the pack early on off
the inside, came three wide into the drive and lacked a rally. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) off a bit slow to begin, was hard to ride in the chute and rank first
time through the stretch, tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. MAGICAL THOUGHT reserved early on
from inside, moved off the rail and traveled in mid-pack, exited the far turn four wide and had little left. SWEET PEARL was tight between foes entering the
stretch the first time, reserved in the early stages, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

JOKER BOY dueled outside ZUBOSHI early, cleared that rival then vied with a pair of foes on the turn, shook free into the lane and drew away under
right-handed urging and steady handling late. ROCK N RYE stalked well off the inside, bid three deep around the turn, failed to keep up with the winner into
the stretch but stayed on for a clear second. THIRSTY ALWAYS tracked off the rail then outside a pair of rivals, went four wide into the turn, angled to the
three path then came back out and entered the stretch five wide and bested the rest. MOOSE MITCHELL taken back early then went between foes past the
half-mile pole, angled in around the bend and kept on for a minor award. MR. T'S THIRSTY raced up close outside the top pair, bid three deep into the turn,
vied between rivals then lost contact with a quarter mile remaining and weakened in the drive. ELEUTHERA tracked two wide into the turn, angled to the rail
around the bend and also weakened. ZUBOSHI dueled for command from inside, could not keep pace nearing the turn, dropped back around the bend,
eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SOMMER DAISY (FR) stalked on the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, drew alongside and took over at the eighth pole, cleared in mid-stretch, then
fought with the runner-up and was able to hold on. BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) tracked in the two path, swung four wide leaving the far turn, closed well
and just missed. RHYTHM AND GRACE stalked the pacesetters outside a rival, driven three wide into the lane and gained the show. FOCACCINA crowded
between rivals at the start, unhurried in the early going, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend three wide and finished willingly in deep
stretch. BUY AMERICAN dueled for command from outside, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole, led a bit off the rail into the stretch, overtaken at the
furlong marker and flattened out late. FLORAL ESSENCE stumbled sharply leaving the gate, sat off the pace off the inside, entered the lane four wide and
lacked the needed response. JUBILEE LAKE (GB) settled on the inside, tipped out into the stretch and could not rally. LOOKINTOGETEVEN traveled at the
back of the pack, moved out for the far turn, advanced outside rivals and exited that bend five wide and also failed to rally. LA GIOIOSA (FR) off slow to
begin, raced outside a rival at the back and failed to menace. CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) off slow from inside, went two to three wide into the stretch and
made no impact. AVENTAPP cleared and crossed over early, dueled from inside, lost contact past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. RUBY'S
ORCHID tracked the pace off the rail, went four wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
ASCOT STORM set the pace from inside with a pair of rivals alongside, cleared into the turn and drew off under right-handed urging. DIVA'S FINALE
pressed the pace outside a pair of rivals, ASCOT STORM four wide through the turn and held the place. CHARGE CASH bumped leaving the gate, raced
off the pace, navigated the turn three to four wide, summoned a mild response but could not get up for second. GOLDENEYED tracked the pacesetter from
inside, cut the corner into the drive and could not rally. ENOUGH NONSENSE raced in mid-pack early on off the inside, took the turn five wide and could not
respond to urging. GATOR SHINING broke out and bumped rival, showed early speed between rivals, could not match strides with the winner nearing the
turn, chased three wide to the stretch and weakened. TEST DRIVE stumbled and got brushed from inside at the start, steered to the inside, moved out a
path on the turn and was not a factor.

turn and entered the stretch five wide, came in a bit at the top of the lane, rallied but had to settle for second best. BODHICITTA (GB) tracked between foes
in the two path to the stretch and held the show. FAST JET COURT (BRZ) off slow from outside, trailed in through the early stages, steered out leaving the
far turn and top of the stretch, closed willingly and earned a minor award. MAXIM RATE stalked the pace on inside, two wide into the stretch and could not
rally. NASTY cleared leaving the chute, controlled the pace to the far turn, roused past the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch and weakened along
the inside. TAPWATER was in a bit tight between rivals leaving the chute, tracked outside a pair of rivals then came four wide into the lane, lost path in
upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CORNICHE dueled briefly then cleared and crossed over to the two path, showed the way into the stretch, put to an energetic hand ride inside the eighth
pole and drew off. APPREHEND chased the winner from inside to the stretch, could not threaten in the final furlong but was clearly second best. WAR AT
SEA tracked two wide then angled to the rail on the turn, tipped out in the lane and bested the rest. BREAKFAST RIDE veered out and bumped rival at the
start, chased five wide into the turn, three wide into the drive and kept on to round out the superfecta. DANCING RINCA raced in range off the inside,
navigated the turn three then two wide and could not produce a bid. QUALITY WINS off slow to begin, took the turn three then two wide and improved
position. COVER ME UP sat off the pace early on, traveled two wide then angled five wide leaving the turn and lacked further response. HANDY DANDY
stalked off the inside, three deep leaving the backstretch, four wide around the bend and weakened. MR. MASON got bumped and lost his path at the start,
steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. CONCH DADDY got bumped and lost his path at the start, raced six wide into the
turn, four wide leaving the bend and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
NONE ABOVE THE LAW angled to the inside and stalked the pace along the rail, saved ground and was pressed upon into the stretch, rallied inside the top
trio past the eighth pole, gained command in the final sixteenth and inched away. FLASHIEST shifted and bumped rival shortly after the start, reserved in
the early going off the rail, closed in around the far turn, entered the lane four wide, bid three deep with a furlong remaining, battled into deep stretch and
edged HOCKEY DAD for the place honors. HOCKEY DAD sped to the front, gained pressure into the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, held a short
lead into the furlong grounds, relinquished command to NONE ABOVE THE LAW with a sixteenth remaining and lost the battle for second. CATHKIN PEAK
(IRE) was rank early then settled on the inside, saved ground into the lane, lacked room near the sixteenth pole and kept on willingly to the wire. LINCOLN
HAWK (IRE) got bumped and pinched back at the start, angled to the two path, moved out on the backstretch, advanced four then five wide on the far turn
and kept on through the final furlong to improve position. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) settled in the two path, lacked room briefly in upper stretch then angled inward
at the eighth pole, went between rivals with a sixteenth to go and lacked room late. SWORD ZORRO (IRE) got bumped leaving the gate, raced three wide
leaving the chute then moved inside, traveled two wide leaving the backstretch, angled out and came six wide into the stretch and summoned a mild rally in
the late stages. BARRAZA came in and bumped HUDSON RIDGE in the chute, became rank and hard to ride first time through the stretch, ran up on heels
past the half-mile pole, went four wide into the drive and needed to find more inside the furlong grounds. HUDSON RIDGE got bumped by BARRAZA in the
chute, was rank down first time through the stretch, forwardly placed on the inside then moved out a bit, driven two wide into the lane, lacked room in upper
stretch, tipped out and could not regain momentum. NO FOOLERY HERE traveled in mid-pack early on, came five wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
PETRUCHIO trailed the field through the early stages, came three wide into the stretch and never got involved. CREW DRAGON broke in and bumped rival
at the start, was forwardly placed off the rail, went up to press the pace on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, fought to the eighth pole and gave
way. JIMMY BLUE JEANS got bumped at the start, chased up close from outside, drew alongside into the backstretch, dropped back to chase outside
another rival, went three wide into the stretch and faded.
