Footnotes
STAN'S MIRACLE MAN stalked the pace while two wide on the backstretch and turn, rallied and gained the lead in upper stretch, bore out slightly in late
stretch under left handed urging but held sway in the end. POINT TWO stalked the pace while three wide into the turn, made a bid on the outside then
moved out slightly while shying from the winner but hung in late stretch. ROYAL TAP set the early after angling over to the rail, was in a long drive but
weakened in mid stretch. GOLD DECLARATION was inside heading into the turn then was shuffled back on the turn but lacked a rally in the stretch drive. A
claim of foul was lodged by the rider of POINT TWO against the rider of STAN'S MIRACLE MAN for interference in late stretch. After reviewing the film's, no
action was taken.
