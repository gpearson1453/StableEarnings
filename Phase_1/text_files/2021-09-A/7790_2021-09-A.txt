Footnotes
MATTHAUS broke alertly, stalked the pace, took command entering the turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held sway
under a drive. BIG CHEEKS settled in mid pack, closed four then three-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and was gaining. KENTUCKY FAN
raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. GEORGIAN DANCER stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn and finished
gamely. ORBALINE forced the pace into the turn, stalked to the stretch then finished with enthusiasm. JOY'S SOLUTION settled off the pace, closed two to
four-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. SHE'S A TRUE FOX raced from mid pack, was in range early turn but faded along the rail and did not menace.
OUR TICKET stalked the early pace, forced the issue on the turn, chased into the stretch but leveled out. LA BONITA pressed the early pace, stalked on the
turn, was checked mid turn and backed away.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA settled in midpack early, advanced two wide on the turn and tipped out into the six path turning for home, on the flank of the eventual place
finisher when that one got the front nearing the eighth pole and drove on by, inching away in the final stages, a clear winner. CARMENOOTZ on hold along
the inside chasing the three leaders, came off the fence late turn to loom outside that trio turning for home and got the front at the eighth pole but was
immediately collared by the winner, holding the place position stubbornly to the wire. THRESHOLD off the pace along the inside, advanced willingly on the
turn and angled out behind the winner in upper stretch, got clear run in the final sixteenth but the top pair had got the jump on him, inching up late to make it
close for the place. BURNING MAN settled in midpack and three wide early, came two to four wide on the turn and widest in the eight path turning for home,
closing in down the lane but outclosed by the show horse to his inside. FULL EXTREME trailed the field into the stretch and angled out down the lane to
best the rest with a solid wide close. COLEYVILLE off the pace early, angled out in behind the eventual third place finisher in upper stretch but was
outkicked by others in the final stages. NATIVE PRINCE settled in midpack along the rail, was in behind the leaders turning for home but outkicked when he
angled out near the eighth pole. SOLAR chased four wide early, came two to four wide on the turn and was in range at the top of the stretch but ran out of
run in upper stretch and lost ground. GIGANTIC BREEZE along the rail and off the pace throughout, put in a mild rally in the stretch but levelled off at the
sixteenth pole. SALVATOR MUNDI stalked the early leader, dueled between rivals around the turn and was out of gas by midstretch. FARAWAY KITTEN
three wide stalking early, bid outside to make it three in a line around the turn and took the front turning for home but was headed at the eighth pole and
retreated. COURT BATTLE took the lead on the fence, was stalked and pressed by two rivals around the turn and retreated down the lane.

Footnotes
TRICKY MAGICIAN led early, quickened through the turn, was engaged in the final furlong and prevailed under a drive. BREAKING ALONE veered out
early, raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the turn, rallied gamely and just missed. GIANT CRITIC hit the gate leaving, pressed the pace, stalked
on the turn and finished under a determined drive. SHANGASSAH settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, gained
steadily but had to ease up because there was traffic in front of the wire. LION KINGDOM was herded outward early, raced off the pace, chased three and
four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. EASY WEEKEND settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. VELOCE
raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. LION'S GOLDENHEART drifted inward leaving the
gate, stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn but lacked a closing response. ARGENTIUM drifted inward at the start, settled in mid pack, dropped back on
the turn and was never contentious.

Footnotes
OL' BLONDIE cleared quickly, prompted by a rival down the backside, opened up into the turn and held the advantage to the wire, kept to her task late.
TWISTER ALERT trailed early, split rivals when rallying on the turn, angled out into the six path turning for home and closed well but ran out of real estate.
RED FUJI was four wide chasing early, three wide into range on the turn and into a clear second in upper stretch but passed for place at the seventy yard
pole, clearly third. STENCIL broke out at the start, came from midpack circling four wide on the turn to look a threat but levelled off in the final eighth to settle
for a minor award. NEPTUNE'S PEARL stalked the winner in the early going, dropped back to chase inside on the turn but retreated in the stretch. FEW
REGRETS chased three wide early and still in the three path on the turn in midpack, unable to sustain a mild rally in the final sixteenth. FIRE EMOJI off the
pace, asked for run two to four wide on the turn and rallied somewhat but was lugging in upper stretch and levelled off. THATNIGHTINTORONTO hopped at
the start and was off the pace, hustled early on the turn but had no rally. SUGAR SURGE hit the gate at the start and was off the pace, dropped back on the
turn and could not muster a bid.
