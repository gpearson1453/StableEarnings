Footnotes
MERINO WOOL raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch and drew clear then widened under a hand ride. FOR KICKS
stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, encountered traffic late turn and upper stretch then rallied belatedly. ONEZY'S DREAM broke
alertly then settled in range, chased two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but leveled off. INTRICATELY moved up to press the
pace midway through the backstretch, forced the issue on the turn, bid at the 1/4 pole but was no match for the winner and flattened out. MISGUIDED
PASSION was rated off the early pace, closed three-wide to mid pack on the turn then failed to menace in the stretch. OXESOME was steadied at the
outset, gained the lead entering the main track, set a pressured pace, was headed near the 1/4 pole and gave way through the stretch. SAMURAI FIGHTER
raced in mid pack, dropped back two-wide on the turn, chased to the stretch but had no late response. WILBURNRUBBER settled in mid pack, was hustled
from the rail on the turn but flattened out mid stretch.

Footnotes
MARAIS was five to three wide around the first turn, advanced to stalk three wide into the far turn, bid at the quarter pole and had the lead turning for home,
driving clear by the eighth pole and holding that solid margin to the wire. SUSPICIOUS MINDS was four to three wide on the first turn and ran by the leaders
early backstretch to open a clear lead, stayed in front until headed by the winner turning for home and was all out to hold the place late over a couple of
closers. SKY OF DREAMS off the pace and close to the inside on the first turn, began to pick it up two to three wide on the far turn and angled out in upper
stretch to look dangerous but was laying in on her wrong lead, switched to her proper lead at the sixteenth pole and held off a stubborn foe for third while
gaining on the tiring place finisher. JOLENE JOLENE had one beat midway on the second turn before putting in a solid rally in the two path down the lane,
in between rivals at the sixteenth pole to just miss the third spot late. OUT OF ROMANCE chased along the rail, came off the fence near the quarter pole to
be between the top two finishers, but was outkicked down the lane. COCOTARA was three to two wide stalking the leader around the first turn and took
back to chase along the rail on the far turn but had nothing left for the stretch run. FLAXEN led on the rail through the first turn, dropped back early
backstretch and around the far turn, angling off the fence in upper stretch but could only rally mildly. BALLROOMS OF MARS devoid of early foot, rallied
into midpack three wide on the far turn but levelled off quickly. ENGLISH BISCUIT hesitated and was far back at the start, never reaching contention.

SILENT RUNNER stalked the pacesetter, closed three-wide late turn, bid upper stretch, dueled briefly and drove clear then held under a drive. SPRING
MOUNTAIN ducked out at the start, settled in mid pack, closed two to four-wide through the turn, was lugging in through the stretch but was still very game.
BARTICA was rated off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. BIG BROWN BREWSKII was
sent to the early lead, set a very pressured pace, was joined at the top of the stretch, dueled, was headed upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LATE
SURGE, rated off the pace ride the rail but was blocked upper stretch, angled out quickly and rallied. WILD RIVER WOLF broke inward, pressed the pace,
stalked on the turn, was blocked upper stretch but got clear too late to menace. TRAGICALLY FUNNY settled in mid pack, raced along the rail then
two-wide on the turn but finished evenly. YANKEE JOE broke outward, forced the pace, challenged at the top of the stretch, dueled, but gave way mid
stretch.

Footnotes
SOUL FREEDOM broke outward, stalked the duelers from the rail, chased into the stretch, bid quickly and drew clear then held off JACK under a drive.
JACK settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch, gained steadily and just missed. STAR SCHOLAR raced in mid
pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, ran into traffic upper stretch then launched an all out drove once clear. LIARS CLUB steadied leaving
the gate and settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide through the turn, was blocked upper stretch then finished gamely. EXECUTIVE
GIANT raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide on the turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch but leveled out late. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE settled off the
pace, steadied early on the turn then was hustled three to five-wide, rallied outside but flattened out in deep stretch. REGAL INTENT dueled two-wide, was
headed at the top of the stretch and retreated. ZEPHYRTIZER raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, was blocked upper stretch, angled out and while
unable to threaten did show some interest. DAWSON SILVER bumped with MEET THE TENOR leaving the gate, raced off the pace, hustled two to
four-wide through the turn but never reached contention. MAD DOG N JOE forced the pace from the early stages, was three-wide throughout and tired
upper stretch. MEET THE TENOR, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail through the turn but lacked a closing response.
BENLION dueled from the rail, drove to the lead at the top of the stretch but was quickly passed and was through.
