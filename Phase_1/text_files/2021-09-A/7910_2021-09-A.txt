Footnotes
QUIET STRENGTH tracked the pace two wide, brushed with FORBIDDEN DREAM in upper stretch, bid three deep in midstretch, took the lead near the
sixteenth pole, briefly drew clear and just held off FORBIDDEN DREAM'S late rail charge. FORBIDDEN DREAM settled off the pace inside, advanced
between rivals around the far turn, was on heels in upper stretch, was brushed by the winner nearing the eighth pole, was shut off and forced to check in
midstretch by ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED, got through inside of that foe near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely inside of the winner to just miss.
ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED set the pace along the rail, shook clear around the far turn, came off the rail a bit in upper stretch, came back in and shut off
FORBIDDEN DREAM in midstretch, corrected back out soon after and weakened. CRYSTAL LAGOON was up close inside, steadied late on the first turn,
checked near the five-sixteenths pole and dropped back sharply, angled out in upper stretch and improved position while drifting about. SEA SONG stalked
the pace three and four wide and faded around the far turn. BAROLA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. PROMISE ME pressed the pace
two and three wide and tired after a half. SPANISH DELIGHT was never involved. AN OBJECTION FROM BOTH THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF
FORBIDDEN DREAM AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BEYOND HEAVENLY was never far back, joined the leaders three wide between horses past the five-sixteenths, battled with DINNER AT FIVE through the
stretch and narrowly prevailed while being floated out by that rival. DINNER AT FIVE vied inside GRAN RESERVA entering the turn, clung to a short lead
inside BEYOND HEAVENLY in upper stretch, drifted out through the late stages and just missed. LUNAR BLAST bumped with GRAN RESERVA at the
start and was slowest away, advanced out of last threading through four wide a quarter-mile out, had aim at the leaders turning for home but needed more.
BLESSED BEAST vied for the early lead inside, and weakened in the stretch. SILVER PACKAGE shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and came
up empty. GRAN RESERVA bumped with LUNAR BLAST at the start and was off slow, vied outside DINNER AT FIVE into the turn, and was through
approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
KENYA SUN dueled early inside SOLDAT TEMPTATION, got the best of that dispute midway on the turn and was immediately hooked by CALIDAD, lost
the advantage with a quarter-mile remaining, battled back gamely on the rail through a long drive and would not be denied. CALIDAD bumped with CASA
CHA CHA after the start, moved up to challenge outside KENYA SUN after a half-mile, poked a head in front approaching the stretch, then was outgamed
through a stretch-long tussle. STEVIELYNN went along in the second flight early, swung widest for the drive and was along for the show.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY saved ground on the turn, and lacked a solid response. SOLDAT TEMPTATION dueled outside KENYA SUN early, and could not
keep pace after a half. CASA CHA CHA bumped with CALIDAD after the start, lost contact with the field into the turn, jogged in far behind, and walked off.

Footnotes
LADIES' CHOICE was bumped at the start, set the pace two wide down the backstretch, angled in near the three-eighths pole, edged clear around the bend
and widened under a drive in the lane. MORNING COLORS raced in range three wide, loomed outside of the winner in upper stretch, was no match for that
foe and stayed on to be a clear second. BEAUTY BOSS saved ground off the pace, angled four wide in upper stretch and ran on for the show.
DONTPUSHYOURLUCK came in and bumped DOMINEERING into LADIES' CHOICE at the start, stalked the pace two wide and weakened in the lane.
QUEEN CALYPSO had early speed inside of the winner, steadied near the three-eighths pole, chased inside around the turn and faded through the lane.
KEITANY was outrun inside. DOMINEERING was slammed between foes at the start, clipped heels soon after and trailed. THE RIDER OF DOMINEERING
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST DONTPUSHYOURLUCK FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START AND STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY

ONE MORE SCORE brushed with UNIQUE TIME at the start, tracked outside the early leaders, took over from URANIUM with little difficulty after three
furlongs, and widened steadily through the stretch in hand. URANIUM set the early pace inside rivals, was no match for ONE MORE SCORE late on the
turn, drifted out five wide into the stretch, and ran on to remain clear of the rest. SKIPPERINI reared up and spun around unseating the rider behind the
gate, loaded without further incident but broke a step slow, raced three wide on the turn, moved in through the stretch and outfinished PEMBERTON for the
show. PEMBERTON was outsprinted early, came four wide off the turn, and was outfinished for third. UNIQUE TIME brushed with ONE MORE SCORE at
the start, pressed the early pace between horses, and faltered before reaching the stretch. ZIPPER ZAPPER was finished early, and dropped far back.
SHOSHA broke slowly and trailed far behind.

STARRY JAYLEN set the pace along the drew clear down the backstretch and held clear under a drive. THE RAIN IS COMING pressed the pace two wide
between foes around the first turn, settled back off the winner down the backstretch, chased that foe two wide around the far turn, made a slight gain in the
lane and was clearly second best. SHE ROX MY SOCKS bumped with STREAKING GREY at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced three deep
around the far turn and ran on for the show. SECRET PRIZE saved ground well back, angled out near the quarter pole and had a mild rally. LADY
PAYNTER saved ground and failed to menace. SCIENCE had early speed four wide between foes and faded three wide around the far turn. CHECK
TWICE played no factor while racing two and three wide. CHAMPINA vied three wide between foes around the first turn, chased the winner two wide down
the backstretch then retreated inside around the far turn. STREAKING GREY was bumped at the start, went five wide around the first turn and was through
early.

Footnotes
CAFFEINE RUSH was in a bit tight on the rail pressing FOOLISH HEART up the backstretch, took over after three-eighths of a mile and drew off under a
mild drive. BETWEEN DREAMS chased outside early, came five wide into the stretch, and finished willingly to go clear for the place outside. ILKNUR
moved off the inside to the three-path leaving the quarter-pole, and finished one-paced. FOOLISH HEART hustled to a short lead outside CAFFEINE RUSH
early, could not match strides approaching the stretch, and tired. BATTLE CRY stayed in range early, and gave way while shifting out four wide nearing the
stretch. EMUNAH became agitated in the gate prior to the start, and showed little trailing throughout.

ISADORABLE AIDA settled off the pace in range inside, angled three wide turning for home, swept to the front near the sixteenth pole and quickly drove
clear. AFFICIONADO (FR) stalked the pace two wide, seized command in upper stretch, angled in soon after, led to the sixteenth pole and held well for the
place. LITTLE BIT GOOD broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground off the pace and rallied for the show. MONEY FACTOR raced well back two wide, swung
eight wide turning for home and finished well. PEARLESCENT saved ground in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch, moved into a clear third in midstretch
then flattened out in the final sixteenth. GHOSTLY BEAUTY failed to menace while racing two wide. NOBLE INTENTIONS steadied nearing the first turn,
raced three wide and never threatened. JOSEFA set the pace along the rail to upper stretch and tired. WONDER BLONDY hesitated at the start, raced well
back inside, went three wide around the far turn and made little impact. NYMUE'S TREASURE steadied nearing the first turn, raced in range two wide and
came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HERO TIGER tracked four wide off the early leaders, poked a head in front outside FREE FLAY after a half-mile, and bested that foe through a long drive.
FREE FLAY held a short lead inside rivals early, dug in when HERO TIGER came alongside around the turn, and yielded grudgingly. SIR KAHN was
outsprinted to the stretch, and offered a mild response inside to get the show. UNPUBLISHED was a step slow at the start, raced widest through the stretch
and posed no threat. WHYRUAWESOME vied outside FREE FLAY early, got outpaced after a half, moved out several paths into the stretch, and tired.
TENACITY ZIP stumbled at the start, chased three wide early, and tired. UNMATCHABLE dropped back steadily after a quarter-mile.

Footnotes
JULIE BIRD (IRE) stalked the pace three and four wide, took over approaching the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive. DEFENDANT dueled outside
of TRIPLET in the three path, edged clear turning for home, led to the sixteenth pole, was no match for the winner from there and just lasted for the place.
KIZZY chased the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and finished evenly to just miss second. SENORITA SALSA raced off the pace five wide
and lacked the needed rally. SYLLABUS saved ground to no avail. FABIOLA PRINCESS chased the pace four wide and faded in the drive. TRIPLET dueled
inside of DEFENDENT in the two path and faltered nearing the lane. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER played no factor while racing five wide. DUCHESS OF
FURY was eased and vanned off.
