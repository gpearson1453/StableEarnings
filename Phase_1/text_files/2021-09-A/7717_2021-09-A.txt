Footnotes
FLAVA'S DREAM was forced outward at the break then stalked two deep, challenged at even terms from the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep
inside the quarter, raced clear toward the head of the lane and was steadily handled to the wire. DEEMED ESSENTIAL broke in to make contact with Helen
Marie then tapered to the inside and rated the pace, was met and dueled at even terms leaving the three eighths pole, gave up the nod nearest the rail past
the quarter, lost considerable ground leaving the turn and had to settle for second best. MISS BEE HIVING was shut off at the break and settled back about
the three path the first turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased slightly outward into the lane and dug
in to take third late strides. KINKY FROLIC stalked the early pace three wide, gave chase from the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn,
then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. HELEN MARIE was bumped inward and into Miss Be Hiving leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the four
path, bid past the three eighths pole and continued in the four path of the far turn, though, showed little further. JOY FANTASTIC came outward at the break
then saved ground. This race was hand timed.

into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn but showed little in the lane. KATMAN QUICK

Footnotes
WESTBURY ESTATES rated just off the pace about the three path, bid past the three eighths pole and took the lead leaving the five sixteenths, ran clear
into the stretch and was steadily handled to the wire. FREEDOM RIDER alternated for the lead with Just Gets Better then recovered the edge approaching
the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail leaving the five sixteenths, raced near the rail on the far turn and had to settle for second. RIVER WARRIOR
RVF bobbled leaving the gate then settled off the pace inside, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly down the
lane. MINISTRY OF MAGIC settled off the pace about the three path, started a four wide bid toward the three eighths pole then flattened in the lane. LET'S
GET PHYSICAL settled back about the four path the first turn then angled to the inside leaving the half mile pole, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced
near the rail on the far turn and showed little further. STRONG LIL KOKORO saved ground on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole but flattened in the five path of the far turn. JUST GETS BETTER alternated for the lead with Freedom Rider
through the opening half mile, was headed approaching the three eighths pole then faded readily on the far turn.

OFFICER APPEAL rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then kept alert
through the lane. ROCK FILE stalked off the rail, picked up the chase at the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, proved no
match in the lane and had to settle for second best. EISELE rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase into the backstretch, ran in the
three path of the far turn and was along to take third later yards. MINDYOURPSANDQS saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and raced near the rail on the far turn, though, flattened stride the final furlong. TICKLING SPRINGS raced in the five path the first turn and entered the
backstretch outside, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still in the five path and showed little more. DEPUTY JAMES settled off the pace
toward the inside and showed little response through the backstretch. CHAMPAGNE JAM raced well back off the rail the first turn and never factored.

SUBSTANTIAL rounded the opening turn about the five path, challenged three wide approaching the three eighths pole and took over in the three path
midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. BROTHER CORBIN settled just off the pace in the two and three
paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn then dug in through the stretch to take the nod for second.
MARTIN MAN saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, but was outfinished in the stretch long
duel for second. GOLDEN ANSWER saved early ground close to the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, ran
evenly to late stretch then flattened stride approaching the wire. FUGITIVE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole
and was met at the five sixteenths, gave up the advantage midway on the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. NEWS FLASH stalked the earlier
pace two deep, challenged approaching the three eighths pole but dropped back at the quarter and faded through the far turn. CAYENNE CREEK ran in the
six path the first turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. LONG GRAY LINE raced
well off the pace in the two and three paths and never factored. BUFF'S EYE VIEW rounded the opening turn about the three path, eased out into the
backstretch but showed little response.

Footnotes
SUPER MALIBU stalked two deep and took the nod at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled clear past the five sixteenths and was steadily encouraged to hold
off WATERLOO ROSE through the lane, while the latter rated close toward the inside, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the three
path of the far turn and finished well at the outside flank of the winner. WILD CAPPUCINO raced in the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid
toward the five sixteenths pole, ran five wide on the far turn and was along for third later yards. HARDSCRATCH rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole and was headed at the pole, dueled from that point but dropped back past the five sixteenths, raced at the rail
on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. WIN THEN GRIN ran off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn then eased outward into the
backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn four wide then flattened the final eighth. JEAN GREY saved ground and showed little
response through the backstretch. MERCHANT OF HOPE broke awkwardly then closed toward contention to stalk three wide in the front stretch, but
dropped back through the first turn and faded past the seven sixteenths pole.
