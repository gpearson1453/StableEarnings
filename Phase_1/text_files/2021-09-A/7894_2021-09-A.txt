Footnotes
BAMA BREEZE was allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried through middle stages, went widest into the lane, responded gamely under
pressure near the quarter pole, rallied racing in tandem with MALTHAEL down the stretch, battled on determinedly along the outside and got a nose up on
the wire. MALTHAEL rated near midpack, came four wide into the lane, advanced while matching strides with BAMA BREEZE down the stretch, dueled
gamely from the inside and got nipped on the wire. FORTUITY raced in hand and saved ground around the first turn, stalked the pace through early stages,
went two wide into the stretch then given cue at the quarter pole, shifted out four to five wide and dug in to prevail for a share. HENLEY'S JOY was
forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter, launched a bid for command in the upper stretch, was no late match for the clear top pair but stayed on with
response and got nipped for show. FIRST COURSE was well off the pace in early stages, prompted three wide into contention near the eighth pole but
lacked the needed response for impact. THE STIFF tracked the pace along the outside, continued in contention around the far turn then went five wide into
the lane and failed to kick on. CONVICTION TRADE cleared on top leaving the first turn and set the uncontested pace, stayed on top to mid-stretch then
faded in the final furlong. HE'S NO LEMON raced off the pace, saved ground around the final turn and had no rally. CIBOLIAN raced midpack through early
stages then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
CAVEAT EMPTOR contended off of the inside, moved up leaving the turn, bid between rivals nearing the furlong marker, came to level terms a furlong out,
shook off CLEAT and kicked away. CLEAT set the pace in mid track up the hill, opened clear down the hill and into the turn, was collared near the
three-sixteenths pole, was unable to go on with the winner, but dug in to just hold the place. GROUP HUG was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch six
wide, finished with a rush but settled for the minor award. COOL RAGS was unhurried into stride, settled saving ground, got through but found his best
stride too late. MAKAI tracked the leader outside, took closer order leaving the turn, loomed a danger entering the stretch but flattened in the final furlong.
VAN DUSEN (GB) was close up toward the inside, dropped off of the pace on the turn, shifted out but lacked a response when called upon. INVISIBLE
WAR settled toward the inside, tipped out leaving the turn but failed to make headway. UNEMBELLISHED failed to respond. BOLD LICORICE came away a
step slow and was never a factor. TIMEFORAWOODFORD settled between horses but lacked a response. VANCOUVER MOON was hustled along in mid
pack through the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
BOXING DAY was nicely rated along the outside never too far from the frontend, crept closer leaving the turn then launched a four wide bid in the upper
stretch, wrested a slim advantage under firm handling at the eighth pole then kicked clear. JAZZ TIME GIRL settled on the inside through early stages, cut
the corner entering the lane, hustled up two wide near mid-stretch, gained closer contention and just lasted for place. TROBAIRITZ raced near midpack,
went two wide around the turn, headed in pursuit five wide near mid-stretch, steadily edged up closer to the wire and just missed place. VIALETTO set the
early pace, remained on top in the upper stretch then got collared by the winner at the eighth pole and flattened out. HYPE HOUSE was reserved racing in
or near the back, saved ground around the turn, shifted out wide in the upper stretch and had a mild improve. ROYAL COUNTY raced in contention tracking
the early pace, was ridden along two wide in the upper stretch then gave way. KELSEY'S SHOT raced off the pace, was ridden along two wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. MACADAMIA (FR) chased in contention around the turn, saved ground into the lane, remained in range to the furlong marker then
flattened out. DETERMINED HOPE raced off the pace, went wide into the lane and never menaced. TEXAS TIARA raced in range around the turn, hustled
up four wide into the lane then gave way. LADY TERRA was off slow at the start and had no response. JALEBI BABY chased up close in the opening
quarter then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
IN GOOD SPIRITS was away in good order, tracked in hand outside, came five wide to make her bid, tacked to the inside of LAGERTHA (CHI) near the
furlong marker, shook off that one and kicked clear late. CATCH A BID settled toward the inside, worked her way outside between foes through the turn,
quickened once uncovered in the upper stretch and was up to garner the runner up spot. LAGERTHA (CHI) sped to the fore up the hill to set the pace, was
joined at the crest of the mound, relinquished the lead into the turn, came again to assume command leaving the turn, shook clear into the stretch, was
headed once more inside the furlong marker and grudgingly gave in. SUPERSTITION contended between rivals, came four wide and continued on fairly
well. CONSTANTIA was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, rallied between horses and was making up some ground. VIOLENZA was allowed
to settle, came five wide and finished with a belated improvement. JEANIE B (GB) was allowed to settle in mid pack and failed to threaten. GOGO SHOES
settled saving ground, got through but lacked a response when called upon. YES IT'S GINGER was mid pack off of the inside, took closer order leaving the
turn but failed to sustain the drive. VENETIAN HARBOR contested the pace through the turn and faded. JAKARTA attended pace inside for a half and
dropped out. OUR MUSICAL MOMENT showed little.

Footnotes
PRINCESS GRACE was off a step slow at the start and remained settled near the back, saved ground around the turn then cut the corner entering the lane,
tipped two wide at the top of the stretch then headed in pursuit, powered to the front under pressure and cleared at the eighth pole then held late under a
driving finish. DALIKA (GER) rated near midpack through early stages, fanned six paths wide into the lane then picked up the pace along the outside, dug in
racing four deep at the sixteenth pole and got a nose up for place. ABSCOND was never far back through early stages, went two wide around the turn then
launched a three wide bid with a quarter mile remaining, could not kick on with the winner at the eighth pole but stayed on determinedly then got edged out
late for place. SHIFTY SHE tracked the top two early leaders, went five wide into the lane, responded when called upon near the quarter pole, raced in
strong contention mid-stretch then finished evenly. PRINCESS CAUSEWAY was forwardly placed racing just off the pacesetter then vied for the lead late on
the turn, battled on to the eighth pole then gave way. SHE'SONTHEWARPATH was unhurried and raced in the last flight, hustled up along the outside into
the lane, was ridden along five wide a furlong out and lacked the needed response for late impact. SUMMER IN SARATOGA raced three wide in the last
flight going by the half mile marker, hustled along racing wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SARA SEA set the pace through early stages then
vied for lead late on the turn, fought back past the quarter pole then lost the whip and faded. QUERELLE raced in range through the early going, saved
ground around the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
GEAR JOCKEY prompted the pace outside, came to level terms nearing the furlong marker, turned back BOMBARD and edged clear. DIAMOND OOPS
was close up along the inside, shifted out into the lane, split rivals and was just up to earn the runner up spot. BOMBARD bounded away in good order, set
the pace off the hill and through the turn, was collared nearing the furlong marker, was unable to match strides with the winner, weakened slightly further
and settled for the minor award. FAST BOAT settled off of the inside while never far back, advanced between foes leaving the turn, continued on doggedly
while in tight and was making up ground. CASA CREED settled saving ground, angled to the outside leaving the turn and improved position. GOT STORMY
was between horses three deep, finished with a mild late gain but failed to threaten. FRONT RUN THE FED tucked in at once, got through but lacked the
needed response. CHEWING GUM was unhurried, circled into the stretch six wide but failed to threaten. STUBBINS was hung wide throughout and was
never a factor. IMPRIMIS was forwardly placed four wide to the stretch and faltered. SIEM RIEP failed to respond. BORN GREAT tracked three wide for a
half, caved through the lane, and bled.

Footnotes
IMPERADOR (ARG) settled nicely heading into the first turn, remained unhurried off the pace through middle stages, shifted out late on the far turn, came
six paths wide into the lane, responded under pressure at the quarter pole, dueled for the lead with stubborn GLYNN COUNTY in the final sixteenth then
edged away and just lasted over gaining ARKLOW. ARKLOW rated off the pace through early stages, raced behind a wall of pursuers heading into the lane,
went to go between three wide at the quarter pole then got in tight and forced to steady near mid-stretch, accelerated once clear, surged to the wire and just
missed. GLYNN COUNTY raced off the top flight going by the half mile marker, prompted into contention and raced five wide in aim at the quarter pole,
dueled stubbornly with the winner in late stages then lacked a closing kick. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM was unhurried and raced off the pace, picked up the
pace heading into the lane, shifted out wide in the upper stretch and improved position. EPIC BROMANCE set the pace, vied for the lead around the final
turn, battled on to mid-stretch then came up tired. CHANNEL CAT was forwardly placed racing just off the leader, vied for the lead around the far turn,
fought back to the quarter pole then gave way. BREAKPOINT (CHI) settled off the pace, was ridden along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed
rally. BIG DREAMING raced just off the pacesetter, vied for the lead around the final turn then tired in the drive. DYNADRIVE raced wide onto the lane and
failed to threaten. ARTEMUS EAGLE raced in the back, saved ground and failed to move on. TIDE OF THE SEA tracked the early pace, remained in range
around the final turn then faded. CROSSFIREHURRICANE raced near midpack then dropped back in the lane.

Footnotes
THE LIR JET (IRE) was forwardly placed along the inside, got through entering the stretch, struck the front near the furlong marker and edged clear. EASY
TIME was under a snug hold just off of the inside, moved with the winner into the stretch, slipped through and was making up ground. FAUCI contended on
the outside, came six wide, churned on but found his best stride too late. INTO THE SUNRISE was away alertly, set the pressured pace just off of the
inside, was collared between horses into the stretch and grudgingly gave in. MISS AMULET (IRE) settled between rivals, steadied from tight quarters near
the three furlong marker, leveled back into stride and improved position between foes. COUNTY FINAL pulled to contention toward the inside, shifted out
and loomed large between rivals entering the stretch, but wilted in the drive and faded. POINT ME BY was allowed to settle, came six wide to make a mild
bid but failed to sustain the drive. ANNEX was allowed to settle, angled out further to be clear but lacked the need response. BODENHEIMER vied for the
lead outside to the stretch, but faltered between runners in the drive and retreated. OMAHA CITY was unhurried outside and failed to respond. NEXT was
close up three wide to the stretch and dropped out.

under steady encouargement. KING CURLIN settled off the early pace, launched a five wide bid in the upper stretch, rallied then angled in and finished
clearly second best. MIDHURST (IRE) raced in range, went two wide around the turn, hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid and
secured show. BOURBON ON FIRE was never too far back, was ridden along four to five wide in the upper stretch and gained position. GARMENTO got
bumped at the start and remained unhurried near the back, came four wide into the lane and had a mild improve. BAJ tracked the pace on the inside, was
ridden along three wide into the lane, raced in contention then gave way. LONG CROW raced in the back, hustled up along the outside into the lane and
passed tiring foes. FIERCE DEBATE raced off the pace, went two wide around the turn and failed to move on. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA was forwardly placed
through early stages, vied for the lead around the turn then gave way. TUSKEGEE CAT set the early pace, vied around the far turn then tired in the drive.
