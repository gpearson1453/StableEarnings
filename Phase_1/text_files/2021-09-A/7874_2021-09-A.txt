Footnotes
SNOWY JUBA CAT came in at the break and took over on the chute, was pressured leaving the turn and increased her lead under steady stretch handling.
TAPIT CAT chased through the backstretch, raced close in the three path of the turn, dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole then flattened later yards.
JUST ASK ME gave chase inside then steadied leaving the three eighths pole, resumed chase toward the five sixteenths pole but was outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. FIONA BELLA was reluctant to load then shuffled back on the chute, picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn
in the threee path and showed little further. DRIVEN TO SUCCEED chased and rounded the turn in the four path, though, showed little more while widest in
the stretch. WOODSONG'S CASTLE chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened the final furlong.

AGENT STONE hopped from the gate but got right into stride to give chase, eased outward past the eighth pole and ran down the early duelers in the final
stride. CASH FLOWING pressured the pace mostly at even terms and contested the turn two deep, dug in gamely to the finish, but was nipped in the final
stride. SUPER JORDAN dueled mostly at even terms from the start, contested the turn at the rail and raced gamely to deep stretch before relenting to the
runner-up. GREAT BIG NOTION gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and finished well to close the gap. CASA GRANDE
gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and showed little further. LEG UP chased, rounded the turn just off the rail and showed
little in the lane.

Footnotes
HAPPY CHAMP settled just off the early pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed to a hemmed in position
approaching the top of the stretch, angled to the five path leaving the far turn, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear at the wire. RIGHTEOUS MAN
stalked from the three path then bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in for a slim brief lead
inside the sixteenth pole though relented later yards. OWL RUN took over two deep into the first turn and rated a slim lead inside, was met into the
backstretch and dueled leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and continued a factor to mid-stretch before beginning to
flatten stride. WHAT A STORY saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and angled out from the mid point of the far turn, left the turn about the six
path and passed rivals. RAVIN' MAVEN settled just off the early pace inside then chased from the half mile pole, eased to the four path approaching the
head of the lane then flattened stride. DUNLUCE CAISSLE raced off the pace about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the
six path of the far turn and showed little further. GET LIT stalked off the rail and drew to even terms into the backstretch, dueled close from the three eighths
pole, but dropped back midway on the far turn, checked toward the head of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
HILLBILLY ROCK steadied early then saved ground through the opening turn, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, steadily improved at the
rail on the far turn, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was drawing away later yards. CATFISH stalked off the rail then challenged toward the
three eighths pole, took the lead nearing the five sixteenths and drew clear into the far turn, raced near the rail on the turn and dug in under steady handling
from the head of the lane, but was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. CRISTIANO BOY raced well back saving early ground then bid approaching
the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. CAYATANO settled off the pace toward
the inside then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, ran in the three path of the far turn, though, flattened in the lane. MY BOY STRYKER saved
ground. CHAMPSTER settled close to the early pace toward the inside, gave chase leaving the first turn then faded at the rail on the far turn.
THUNDERINREADYRICK accelerated to the lead approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure nearing
the three eighths, was headed toward the five sixteenths and gave chase from that point, but dropped back into the far turn and weakened leaving the turn.

Footnotes
LOOKIN BACK moved to the front while tapering toward the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at
the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. UNEXPECTEDLY broke awkwardly then saved ground on the first turn, started a bid toward
the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the three path of the far turn, raced clear in second inside the eighth pole and finished well to close on the
winner. BOTTLE COURAGE saved ground racing well back, bid past the five sixteenths pole, angled to the four path on the far turn and was along for third
later yards. CHERISH YOUR DREAM rated off the pace about the three path on the first turn, was carried out into the backstretch, picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. CHOSEN MISS saved early ground, picked up the
chase into the backstretch, angled out approaching the top of the stretch, left the turn about the six path and passed rivals. SPEEDING TICKET rated close
to the early pace in the two and three paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail approaching the top of the stretch.
SWEET PIPER rated off the pace the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded into the far
turn. CROOKED WAYS saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.
