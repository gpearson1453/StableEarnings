Footnotes
MIKE OPERATOR was rank on the run along the first turn, stalked the pace into the second turn while three wide, confronted the pacesetter leaving the turn
to take the lead, edged clear in the final sixteenth and held over a late rallying rival. CURRY NATION was unhurried in the early going, saved ground while
two wide on the second turn, mounted a rally leaving the turn and while not able to reel in the winner in the last sixteenth got the nod for the place.
HYPERSONIC set all of the pace through the second turn while saving ground, was confronted by the winner leaving the turn and weakened in the stretch,
just missing on the head nod for second. MEGAMEISTER settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and made a late bid in the
stretch to challenge for the show. IMPERATOR sat just off of the early fractions, saved ground on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch. LINGUA
FRANCA tracked the leaders through the second turn, lost ground while two wide on that turn and did not have a response in the stretch.

Footnotes
HIJO GALANTE was a bit slow into stride leaving the gate, chased the early pace into the turn, mounted a bid while four wide on the turn to confront
STANFORD BAY heading into the stretch and had a final push to get by that rival and was clear in the end. STANFORD BAY was away alertly and set the
pace into the turn while two wide, was headed off of the turn by the winner, kept on to duel with that one but was outfinished in the stretch while besting the
rest. TOM'S BIRTHDAY tracked the leader into the turn, was trying to get out nearing the five-sixteenths marker, steadied and lost ground, was two wide on
the turn and was outkicked by the top two in the stretch. AUTISM BLUE chased the early pace, gained ground while three wide on the turn and weakened in
the stretch run. PRINCE CINDERELLA chased the leaders from the rear, was outrun on the turn while two wide and did not have a response in the stretch
run.

NOWHERE MAN settled off of the early pace by DIAMOND BLITZ, saved ground on the second turn and closed the gap on that tiring foe in the final
sixteenth to prevail. DIAMOND BLITZ set quick fractions through the backstretch and onto the second turn while saving ground, had a comfortable lead into
the stretch but was tiring in the last sixteenth, was passed by the winner and held on to save the place. RESPECT THE HUSTLE settled in the midflight
while saving ground on the second turn and closed willingly in the stretch to just miss for second. HOLY GHOST settled toward the rear of the field, was
three wide on the second turn and made a late gain in the stretch but was not challenging the leaders. ALVAARO tracked the leaders into the second turn
while saving ground and did not have a final bid in the stretch. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) was unhurried in the early going, lost ground on the backstretch
and into the second turn, stopped, was eased and walked off.

TED attended to the early pace of POSO CREEK while saving ground on the turn, pounced on that rival leaving the bend and drew clear in the late going.
OUR EXPECTATION chased the pace from a midflight position, was two then three wide on the turn, mounted a bid inside of the furlong marker by gamely
splitting horses but could not reel in the winner while besting the rest. BOBBY'S ALIBI sat off of the early pace, was two wide on the turn and was outkicked
in the stretch. AMERICA GREAT had no speed in the early going, saved ground on the turn and closed willingly in the stretch. HARBOR KITTY stalked the
early fractions from a forward position, was three wide on the turn, drifted out at the furlong marker into the path of KNOCKOUT BERT and weakened in the
late stages. KNOCKOUT BERT settled in the middle of the pack, was four wide on the turn, was bumped by HARBOR KITTY when that one drifted out at
the eighth pole and gave way in the late going. BY MOONLIGHT chased the leaders from a midflight position, was three wide on the turn and did not rally in
the stretch drive. POSO CREEK was away quickly and set quick early fractions while two wide on the turn, was still in contention at the head of the lane but
faded in the stretch drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE EIGHTH POLE INVOLVING HARBOR KITTY AND
KNOCKOUT BERT AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT HARBOR KITTY DRIFTED OUT INTO KNOCKOUT BERT'S PATH AND HARBOR
KITTY WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH TO SIXTH PLACE.

LA VIKINA prompted the pace by EMPIRE HOUSE through the backstretch and run on the second turn, mounted a bid while three wide off of the turn, was
kept to task in the stretch and just held on in the final sixteenth over an oncoming runner-up to prevail. STYLEDOME (IRE) was allowed to settle at the rear
of the field, mounted a rally while five wide on the second turn, continued that run into the stretch and pressured the winner in the final sixteenth but just
missed while a clear second over the rest. IDA CLAIRE sat just off of the early fractions, saved ground on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the
stretch but was not pressuring the top two. ZAKKIYYAH settled in the middle of the field, was four wide on the second turn and finished willingly in the
stretch run. MISTY CAT settled toward the back half of the field, saved ground on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. EMPIRE HOUSE
broke on top and set the pace through the second turn, was confronted by the winner off of the turn and tired in the late going. TORREY'S GIRL chased the
early pace, was two wide while losing position on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was away a bit slowly and
settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn and was not a factor in the stretch.
