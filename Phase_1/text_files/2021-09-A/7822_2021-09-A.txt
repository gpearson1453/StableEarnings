MIGHTY ABLE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, made a bid, racing three wide and proved the best late. DEGRASSE within contention,
saved ground around the final turn, was outfinished for the win, but got up for second. COOL FIRE went to the front, drove clear, was close throughout and
got outfinished by the top two. SWEET RACHEL lunged at the start, racing in the rear, improved position, but was never a factor. TOUCH OF GOLD raced
evenly near the back, came around the final turn on the outside and showed little. I DON'T FLY COACH raced near the middle of the field in the early part,
faded and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

WAR VETERAN pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the final stretch and proved much the best. CHARMING BULLET raced
within striking distance, made a late wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. U COMPLETE ME pressed the early pace, while being
reserved, eased back, saved ground around the second turn, made a late bid and missed second. IADANZA dueled on the front end in the beginning, saved
ground around the second turn and weakened. DOOLIN reared at the start, racing from the back, moved up on the outside around the second turn,
improved position, but was no factor. MISS YOU JO raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the final turn and was no threat. LISTEN TO ROSE
raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside, faded and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

LUCKY LITTLE LADY vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, pulled away down the lane and proved the best. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH
broke a step slow, brushed start, rushed up, challenged for the lead, saved ground around the turn, made a rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but was
a clear second. MADAM HENNY lacked early speed, made a steady gain and got up for third. SABER QUEEN brushed at the start, racing in the middle of
the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide mild bid, but was no factor. SARAHS HOME flashed early speed and was finished early. BLULU
void of early speed, finished wide and was never a threat. KELLYS THE BOSS lacked early speed and showed little. RACHIE RACH was fractious in the
gates, showed brief speed and dropped back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
