Footnotes
MAGIC CIRCLE broke in at the start, moved up to establish a good position just off the pace, shifted out a path when given room by HOPE OVER FEAR
leaving the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn then began pursuit of the pacesetter, gained to take the lead in upper stretch, shook clear
under the crop into the final furlong, had the rider put away the crop while widening outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a solid hand
ride to the wire. LOVE TO RUN moved up while coaxed along after the start then settled off the pace, came under urging while inside to the two path on the
turn, swung four wide into the stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. SPEEDOMETER came away in good order and went straight to the
front, cruised along on an uncontested pace, controlled the action while inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner while
put to the crop in upper stretch and weakened then lost the place while clear for the show. SWEET LADY IVANKA was taken in hand early then rated off the
pace, went three then four wide while put to urging on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead throughout
the drive and tired. SONNYNEEDSMONEY was hustled from the start, moved out leaving the chute then was urged along on the outside, dropped back four
wide on the turn and had nothing left. HOPE OVER FEAR bobbled slightly at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the turn,
dropped back late on that bend, moved to the two path into the stretch and capitulated. S OH S was urged along on the outside, moved in leaving the
backstretch, dropped back while three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond. SEALITHIC broke in while off slow then was snatched up with the
right-rein, spotted the front several lengths, angled out at the rear early, remained far back through the turn and was eased in the stretch but walked off.
ALSANAH was very recalcitrant behind the gate and extremely reluctant to load, dropped back fast under urging, saved ground on the turn and faltered then
was eased in the final furlong but walked off after pulling up just short of the wire.

Footnotes
SASSY MELISSA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong from home, inched away under a drive kept to task. KHALI MAGIC two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. LUCKY LATKES hustled from the gate, chased briefly in the two path before tucking along
the inside, got roused briefly taking the inside route into upper stretch, had a brief seam along the rail straightened away before it closed as PROSPECTIVE
CANDY drifted in, was paused in behind that rival from the three-sixteenths to the eighth pole, tipped out cautiously as COURTED backed away and was
roused to keep on willingly for the show honors. LITTLE DUTCH GIRL broke out at the start bumping PROSPECTIVE CANDY, then got bumped by
MADAM MACLEAN, who broke outwards before trading two more bumps with that rival, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on head to head with MADAM MACLEAN to the finish and bested that rival for the last major
share. MADAM MACLEAN broke out brushing the off side stall at the start before bumping LITTLE DUTCH GIRL, then traded two bumps with that rival in
the following strides before settling just off the inside tracking from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out five
wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe improving position to the finish but was ultimately bested for the last major share.
APPRECIATE saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
bid but was outkicked. PROSPECTIVE CANDY broke in at the start and bumped with LITTLE DUTCH GIRL, established the front and showed the way in
hand along the inside coming under challenge when placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch leaving a seam along
the rail, drifted in straightened away, dug in under threat and was collared at the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. COURTED hustled from the
gate, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the
late going. CARLY HUSTLE broke outwards awkwardly and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased four wide advancing to mid pack, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
COALITION BUILDING was reserved off the pace in the two path, came under encouragement around the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into the stretch,
rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get up late. BLUE TIMES went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked coming to the
quarter-pole then spun into the two path entering the stretch, responded well when put to the crop inside the three-sixteenths, led determinedly until the final
strides but was denied while clear for the place. VIOLENT VIXEN went around the first turn in the four path, was rated just off the pace, went two then three
wide on the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, chased the runner-up into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked while able to get the show. MY
SUNNY VALENTINE raced in the three path around the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn then made
a bid at the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and was outfinished. BALINESE rounded the first turn in the two path, was
reserved in the front half of the field, saved ground on the final turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into the stretch, chased inside
into the final furlong and weakened. CLOSERTOTHEHEART acted-up at the start and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths, angled in at the rear,
saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, saved ground while let out on the far turn, shifted three wide while asked for more at the
quarter-pole, moved out at the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. CHECKSANDBALANCES (IRE) was caught in the five path on the first turn, settled
on the far outside without cover, went four wide on the final turn, was roused while coming through inside of a foe at the five-sixteenths, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to rally. SYNONYMOUS traveled around the first turn in the four path, was reserved off the pace, steadied near the three-eighths pole,
was asked in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. HIYA HARRY broke out and hit the gate, went two to three wide on the turns, moved out in
upper stretch, drifted in late and was no factor. MOTHERS DAY JEWEL went three to four wide on the turns and also failed to respond. EXOTIC CAT
lagged at the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn and showed little. MISCHIEF REIGNS pulled under restraint early, went around the
first turn in the five path, raced just off the pace on the outside, came up empty while four then five wide on the far turn and retreated.

wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. GLASS CEILING chased two
to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. JADES GELLY hustled from the gate,
chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and faded, angled out

Footnotes
RISK MANAGER just off the inside through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field as a quartet went at it early on up front,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command
inside the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish kept to task. PUBLIC INFORMATION saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing tipped to the two path five-sixteenths from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. FAIR
HAIRED BOY broke out at the start bumping ETERNAL SUMMER into ACTUARY, tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, overhauled the embattled front with three-sixteenths to go edging clear to inside the eighth
pole, dug in under threat, got caught inside the final sixteenth and was outfinished in the late stages for the place honors. BRICCO three then two wide
through the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, offered up a bid a furlong out, then
weakened in the late stages. CLEVER FELLOW saved ground in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. ACTUARY (GB) saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing tipped to the two
path five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAGNIFICENT CHROME chased just off the inside under a ride from
the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ETERNAL SUMMER got bumped between foes at the start, chased three wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. YANKEE EMPIRE coaxed from the gate, raced just off the
inside into the first before tipping three then four wide through that bend, made his way to the five path down the backstretch in aim of a pace dispute up
front, advanced nearing the half mile pole tucking four then three wide into the far turn and issued a challenge for command under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, spun three wide into upper stretch taking brief and narrow command, got overhauled at the three-sixteenths and tired. CARIBBEAN
GOLD coaxed from the start, got floated out five wide into the first turn vying for command outside a pair, tucked four then three wide through that bend
before heading four wide into the backstretch now knocking heads for the front with a pair, took over sole command and tucked three then two wide half a
mile from home, came under threat from the aforementioned foe to the outside through the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch headed for the
front and tired. NUTSIE intent on the front, vied inside a pair spinning three wide into the first turn taking that pair four and five wide to his outside, knocked
heads until nearing the nine-sixteenths when shaken off, tipped out three then four wide at that juncture with little left in the tank but ensuring rivals behind
could safely get by to his inside when spent, went four to five wide through the far turn and into upper stretch and folded. INDOCTRINATE bobbled at the
break, recovered to vie between foes into the first turn getting floated four wide into that turn by the aforementioned rival, tucked three then two wide midway
on that turn and into the backstretch, got shaken off nearing the half mile pole and tucked inside, came under light coaxing nearly spent with three furlongs
to go as rivals circled outside in the two path, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
JESTER CALLS NOJOY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, spun just off the inside for home, went clear under a drive and
was geared down in the final sixteenth. MALIBU KENDALL coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide, continued two to three wide for home, proved
no match for the top one and kept on to safely secure the place honors. HANDBELLE six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing angling in at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and improved position to procure the show honors. AMANI'S IMAGE bumped at the start by SOLASTA,
who broke outwards, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and
weakened. CHASING ARTEMIS chased three wide until tucked inside into the turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and tired. LI LI BEAR stumbled badly at the start bumping into TEXIAN and conceded four to five lengths to the front, chased three wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. BELLE GOSSE chased five to six wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. PACIFIC GROVE five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch and tired. SOLASTA broke out at the start and bumped AMANI'S IMAGE, chased four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and faltered. TEXIAN got bumped at the start by LI LI BEAR, who stumbled badly,
chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn and was placed to a protective hold and steadily eased up
through the turn being guided outside once rivals cleared, then was pulled up into upper stretch and was subsequently vanned off.

BASELINE DRIVE settled comfortably on the inside, tipped to the two path midway through the far turn then was roused between foes at the five-sixteenths,
moved out under a drive inside the three-sixteenths, rallied on the inside of EXOTIC WEST into the final furlong, closed fast into the final sixteenth and got
up in the final stride to prevail. LUCY'S CAKES FLY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the far turn, rallied
outside into upper stretch, drifted in under a right-handed crop while making a bid coming to the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider, took the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, led to the final stride but was denied while just able to get the place. EXOTIC WEST traveled around the opening
bend in the two path, was reserved near the middle of the field, went two then three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, came five
wide into the stretch, rallied alongside the winner into the final furlong, closed well into the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the show.
COMMAND POINT was reserved at the rear on the inside, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed strongly into the final sixteenth,
swapped back to her inside lead at that juncture and flattened out a bit late while willingly securing the last spot in the superfecta. HOHOHOHO had a shoe
repaired in the holding barn, was hustled to the lead, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, showed the way through solid fractions, vied inside on the
far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished.
THEODORA GRACE went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, made a bid near the
quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked. KEMBA was coaxed from the gate then taken in hand early, raced in the two
path under tight restraint on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch,
chased the leader along the hedge into the final sixteenth and weakened in crowded quarters late. EVIDENCE BASED was taken in hand early, traveled
around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was roused three to four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. FAMILY TIME broke in and bumped with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back, navigated the far turn in the two then
three path, was asked at the quarter-pole, drifted in near the furlong marker and was no factor. MOPOLKA bumped with a rival at the start, went three to
four wide on the first turn, settled towards the front on the outside, was asked three wide on the final turn and failed to respond. CLADDAGH'S RUN bumped
with rivals on both sides at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the far outside without cover, went four then five wide on the far turn, came
eight wide into the stretch and also was no factor. SHINING COLORS was hustled from the start then well placed just off the pace on the inside, came up
empty on the far turn and retreated.

and uncontested, marshaled the field down the backstretch and through the far turn patiently handled as the field got busy in behind, cut the corner into
upper stretch and was roused straightened away, edged clear under a drive and a left handed crop drifting out while holding clear and unthreatened to the
wire. MYSTIC NIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, came under a drive with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper

tipped to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at he three-eighths, spun three wide for home and kicked on belatedly to just miss for the
place honors. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON brushed the gate at the start and came under hustling to track the leader from the two path in closest aim, came

chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide for home, offered no response. SUPERFECTO coaxed from the gate, raced

weakened. LIMONITE chased three then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled out seven wide at the top of the stretch and tired.
LOCALLY OWNED went four wide through the first turn forwardly placed, chased four wide under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun five wide for
home and tired. FIRST CONSTITUTION (CHI) broke a beat slow, went three wide through the first turn, chased four to three wide coming under urging at

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU bobbled ever so slightly at the start, displayed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail while still inside a
foe on the turn, came out while shaking clear into the stretch, was given one tap of a down-turned crop while extending the advantage into the final furlong
and drew off under a moderate hand ride to prove much the best. TARABI broke in and smashed the inside of the gate at the start then veered in, jostled
with a foe while angling out leaving the chute, established a good position just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, angled three wide outside the
quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. SAUCY LADY T broke in and bumped
lightly with an opponent, dropped well off the pace, was urged in the two path on the turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and safely secured the show. SEQUIST leaned out and brushed the gate at the start, dropped well behind the rest
of the field, raced inside to the two path on the turn and was no factor. DREAM LITH moved out outside the three-quarter pole, settled under some urging,
was urged along while moving from four to six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond. BENBANG pressed the pace on the
outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and tired. SUE ELLEN MISHKIN broke in and hit the gate, settled outside under some
urging, was ridden along while four then five wide on the turn then carried six wide into the stretch and capitulated. GIRL WITH A DREAM veered in at the
start, jostled with TARABI leaving the chute, settled off the pace, saved ground under encouragement on the turn and also failed to respond. PRETTY
BIRDIE bumped lightly with a foe at the start, tracked the pace on the outside under coaxing, chased three then four wide on the turn, dropped back quickly
coming to the quarter-pole, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
