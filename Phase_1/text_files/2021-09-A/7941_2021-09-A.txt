three across at the top of the lane, battled with the advantage and held the place. PRINCESSINPARADISE slow to settle while five wide, two path on the
turn, responded and rallied inside. BETTY RUBBLE away best, set the pace along the rail into the turn, was collared, battled in the lane and weakened.
SWEET INVASION broke slow, rushed, tracked along the two path, challenged between nearing the quarter pole and tired leaving the furlong marker.

A DAB WILL DO In hand along the rail, let out a notch on the last turn, eased out into the lane and finished well. MOMENTS TO SAVER Tracked along the
three path around the turns, chased and weakened. DANCING SLIPPERS Broke sluggishly, lagged back along the three path, four wide on the last turn and
failed to take part. WHAT MIGHTAVEBEEN Set the pace along the rail to the last turn and gave way.
