Footnotes
HAPPY TAPPY TIM dueled three wide in a contested early pace, dueled with GABRIELA'S MIRACLE on the turn, led into the stretch, drifted in at the
sixteenth marker in front of that rival and won clear. GABRIELA'S MIRACLE dueled inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the turn, could not stay
with that rival in the stretch drive, steadied slightly behind the winner at the sixteenth pole and then dug in gamely to hold second. MEDLEY dueled between
rivals for the early lead, chased on the turn, raced inside into the stretch, angled out and closed late between horses. I LOVE MARIA chased early on,
moved up inside on the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied mildly between horses late. GOLD WATCH chased four wide, raced three wide on the turn
and finished evenly. DECISIVE CAUSE chased five wide early, came wide into the stretch and gained belatedly outside. WATERWORKS ducked in after
the start, raced off the pace and did not factor. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of GABRIELA'S MIRACLE, the race was declared
official.

Footnotes
JAYDINE steadied in tight along the rail in the early stages, then tracked comfortably on the inside, waited for room saving ground on the far turn, angled out
at the eighth pole, responded, closed well and ran down MAP EM UP in the final yards to prevail. MAP EM UP set a pressured pace on the inside, dueled
on the far turn, shook free at the top of the lane, dug in gamely on the rail and yielded grudgingly late. STEFANIE ON FLEEK stalked two wide between
rivals, chased three wide on the far turn and finished evenly. PEGGY O'PRADO raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the stretch, angled in and
closed belatedly on the rail. WHO U GONNA CALL pressed the pace early on, then vied two wide, dueled on the far turn and weakened. MAGO ON MY
MIND raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and failed to threaten. PATRONA was off a bit slow and outrun. VIKING QUEEN steadied at the
start, moved up three wide early, chased three wide on the backside and faded.

AWESOMENEWYEAR was outrun early, moved up quickly on the rail approaching the quarter pole, angled out entering the stretch, closed strongly, ran
past the leader and pulled away. WICKED JANE raced off the rail, off the pace, made a four wide bid midway on the turn, took over, kicked clear and then
was no match for the winner. POLITELY CROWNED raced off the pace, steadied entering the turn, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and rallied mildly
outside. MASHUGANA chased three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled and tired. BAHAMA PEARL steadied at the start and bumped a rival, raced off
the pace inside, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, then tired. THIRD TIME AROUND showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled between rivals on
the turn and faded. DAZZLING SPEED was bumped at the start, rushed up on the rail to contest the pace past the half mile pole, dueled on the turn and
gave way. DIVA DANA chased between rivals and gave way. A Jockey Objection by the rider of POLITELY CROWNED against WICKED JANE was

STRONGERTHANUKNOW raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside, closed willingly in deep stretch
and surged for the win. MUMBAI tracked on the inside, moved up closer on the turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, put a head in front past the furlong
marker, edged away, dug in gamely and was caught in the final strides. VERBIEN O. P. showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled with MUMBAI
turning for home, dug in gamely inside in the stretch and held third. FROSTED BLUE checked at the start, raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane
