had lead until outside rival hustled to clear, entered turn in chasing position along the rail, entered stretch in the two path, and stayed on well to be a game
second. TOMASINO bothered at the start by outside rival, had to stalk pace two wide after troubled start, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch
widest, and rallied up for third. CANNES lacked speed and trailed on the backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, entered stretch along the rail and
had a belated rally along the rail. MYSTIC GREY contested pace early on the backstretch, had to settle for a chasing two wide trip on the turn, entered
stretch in range and gave way in the final sixteenth. SOUL OWNER came away ok at the start, hustled for speed exiting the chute, contested pace three
wide, and cleared heading into the turn, opened up on the turn and into the stretch clear, started to shorten stride in upper stretch and tired badly inside the
final sixteenth.
