Footnotes
GIVEITSOMEWELLIE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards a bit entering the far turn advancing on the
leaders, bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage entering the lane, then kicked away in the closing stages under firm right
handed encouragement. DEPUTY DORA settled last a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, made a steady gain following the winner's path racing into
the far turn, came around a drifting rivals leaving midstretch but proved best of the others. WESTERN BERLIN angled inwards to force the pace outside a
rival racing to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes on the far turn into upper stretch and drifted out leaving midstretch while failing to match
the top pair. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB), urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way.
THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT, forwardly placed three deep stalking just off the leaders under light rating, briefly pressed the issue nearing the second bend,
then drifted out and faded into upper stretch. TEQUILA MARY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn but offered no rally.
EVERYBODY DOES IT was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch but never gained contention. INDAWIN angled to the rail tracking
off the first flight racing to the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
GIVE EM SHADE, prompted to a forward placing racing just outside the pacesetter into the first turn, conceded ground to that rival racing through the
backstretch while continuing under patient handling, was urged challenge for command three deep between foes racing past the quarter mile marker,
lugged inwards a bit disputing the issue outside a rival in the last furlong but edged forward of that foe under left handed pressure. CHARMING FURY was
rated inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, came under prompting to advance along the rail racing into the far turn, momentarily
awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, came through inside foes to challenge for command entering the lane, continued in close quarters through late
stages and was just outkicked. PILOTS STAR tracked the leaders outside foes as part of the second flight in the opening half, was urged to lodge a brief,
four wide nearing upper stretch but couldn't match the top pair while edging a rival for a share. MAJESTIC STRIDE sprinted clear along the inside racing to
the backstretch, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin racing a bit off the rail into the second bend, briefly resisted when challenged racing into upper
stretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker. FIREMAN'S LIL SIS was rated out off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch and failed to
gain striking distance. DESERT ARCH tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out early.

IMA HARLEY TOO was switched out in early stages tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced between foes to
challenge for command three wide in upper stretch, was carried out racing past midstretch but wrested the advantage in time under pressure. COPPER
FIDDLE was rated tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the far turn, advanced on the pacesetter to bid between rivals in upper
stretch, was floated out by LAST PROMISE leaving midstretch carrying out the eventual winner but prevailed for second while failing to contain that foe.
LAST PROMISE, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, went clear on the far turn, briefly resisted when challenged racing into
upper stretch, drifted out under pressure racing past midstretch and yielded to the top pair late. ITS A BOY was rated off the second flight racing outside a
rival to the backstretch, split foes racing into the far turn to advance four wide into upper stretch but finished evenly in late stages. CAMPS BAY was rated
off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. OUTRUN THE POSSE, urged to the lead along the inside
disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, lost the advantage after a half, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter to upper stretch and gave way in late
stages. TEDDY TIME ducked out at the start, then was held up just after the break to setle along the inside and never gained contention. I'M AN EIGHT
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight and faded after a half. SMOK'N POLICY trailed.

OLD INDIAN TRICK broke readily, was urged to dictate the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing to the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and
was kept to firm encouragement. FENDER BENDER settled out of striking distance shifting off the inside, advanced on the leaders four wide through the
turn to upper stretch and found some late stride to prevail for the place honors in time. GOT EVEN SMARTER, forwardly placed three wide prompting the
pacesetter through the backstretch to upper stretch, weakened in late stages. TOP STAR made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but faded early.
KIERKEGAARD was urged inside foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. OMEN OF CHANGE was
outrun early.

GO FOR A RIDE broke readily to join the pace between foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders midway through the first turn, attended the
pace three deep racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path racing through the far turn into upper stretch, then wrested the
advantage and edged clear late under firm handling to prevail. GREATER CAIRO, urged inside foes to contest the lead into the first turn, conceded the lead
on the backstretch while switching outside the pacesetter, moved to press that foe racing into the second bend, gained the advantage midstretch but proved
no match for the winner late. JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE), caught in tight quarters racing to the first turn, then taken in hand while being shuffled back early,
settled between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes racing into the far turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and continued
with interest to prevail for a share. J P'S PRIDE (IRE) was rated outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned six wide into upper stretch and continued with
an effort to improve position. ROBINSON, squeezed between foes at the start, settled three deep racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position
while angling inside nearing upper stretch, then steadied off a tiring foe and altered course in late stages losing momentum. FIVE ROSES LUNA was urged
prompting the pace outside foes racing to the first turn, took over midway through the backstretch, angled to the inside nearing the second bend setting the
pace into the second bend, dueled inside foes to the lane and gave out leaving midstretch. TRADE DEADLINE, brushed at the start, was settled between
foes to the backstretch, made some brief progress between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the closing stages. GLASS EATER tracked off the
first flight outside foes, continued four wide through the far turn to the lane and steadily faded. SIDE STREET DAVE broke inwards bumping ROBINSON,
was urged in brief pursuit between foes cutting off JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) racing into the first turn and emptied out after a half. JERSEY LUTE, prompted to
contention while angling to the inside early, steadily faded after a half.

HADDY UP broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace on a comfortable advantage through the backstretch, responded on the turn to turn back a rival's
challenge nearing the lane, then kicked clear under firm left handed pressure. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE switched outside the pacesetter in early stages
pursuing that rival into the turn, closed the gap nearing upper stretch but proved no match in the drive. PEARLE DE VEENE settled last along the inside in
early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and made some late progress to edge a rival for a share late. AKSARBEN SUMMER shifted out four wide
racing through the backstretch, continued three deep between foes to the lane but had no rally. ARNOLD'S PATSY, caught five wide racing into the first
turn, continued widest to the lane and proved no threat. RUNAWAY A. TRAIN tracked the pacesetter inside foes in early stages, switched out racing through
the turn and faded into the lane. ALOTTA SOUL, urged three wide pursuing the pacesetter to the turn emptied out early.

Footnotes
WILLTOBELUCKY was rated between rivals in second flight to the backstretch, came under pressure advancing on the leaders on the far turn, tipped out
racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to reel in JUNIOR BUG in time under strong handling. The latter angled to the rail attending a
rival's pace under light rating racing to the far turn, was prompted to take over nearing upper stretch, kicked clear racing through the lane and just failed to
contain the winner. HOLD THE SPICE, reserved inside rivals to the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch to split foes three wide and continued with interest to
improve position. DEMIGOD tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing the lane but lacked the needed final
kick. BOX CANDY tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the far turn but offered no closing bid. SHATTERED DREAMS
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. JIMMIE T was urged prompting the pace outside a
rival to the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. STAR MISSION settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat.

Footnotes
KARALINKA hopped at the start while breaking slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, gathered momentum while angling out four
wide in upper stretch, then rallied to the front and went clear in time under firm handling. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA was rated off the first flight shifting off the
inside nearing the turn, advanced three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, gained the advantage midstretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. JUST PLAIN PRETTY settled last along the inside racing to the turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and produced a late
response to edge rivals for a share in the closing stages. GOLDEN EYED QUEEN angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing to the turn and
gave way into upper stretch. HALF SCOUT was rated out of striking distance a bit off the inside in early stages, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch while
being urged to advance inside rivals but lacked the needed final kick. AWESOME GALAXY, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for
command inside a rival on the backstretch, set pace racing into the turn and gave way between foes leaving midstretch. LADY CHURCHILL tracked off the
first flight outside a rival in the opening stages, drifted out racing into the turn and soon gave way.
