Footnotes
EVIE'S PRINCE settled in hand toward the inside, took closer order on the second turn, got through into the lane, took dead aim at the leader a furlong out,
churned on and caught NEW YEAR SURPISE in the final yards. NEW YEAR SURPRISE was slow into stride, launched a early move on the backstretch,
rushed to contention on the outside, opened clear off of the hill, settled into the stretch well clear, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner.
WARBIRD was allowed to settle on the outside, came five wide to make his bid, boxed on willingly but settled for the minor award. FEBRUARY SON settled
off of the inside, tacked toward the inside entering the stretch, got through to make a mild bid but lacked the needed late response. INCITATUS bobbled at
the start, recovered quick and moved up to set the pace into the first turn, relinquished the lead off of the hill, stayed on to the stretch and faltered between
rivals. FREDDY FLINTSHIRE was allowed to settle, went wide, finished with a belated improvement but failed to threaten. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was
forwardly placed inside then between foes, came up empty leaving the final turn and faded. URBAN MYTH tracked three wide, was within reach through the
second turn and faltered. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE failed to respond. MCLOVIN lost action leaving the first turn, quickly dropped back and never
recovered.

Footnotes
MISTHAVEN (IRE) was in hand between rivals on the hill, checked in traffic near the six furlong marker, altered out to be clear down the hill, made a
sweeping move five wide through the turn and into the lane, quickened when set down for the final furlong, reeled in the dueling leaders and kicked away.
ABSTRACT MOMENT was away in good order, disputed the pace between foes, edged clear into the turn, was collared entering the stretch, fought on
doggedly but was no match for the winner. MY FRIEND AMY tracked outside, moved up to engage ABSTRACT MOMENT leaving the turn, battled with that
one through the stretch but flattened in the final yards. LADYBELUCKY was hustled along four wide, offered her bid between horses, but lacked the needed
late response. SCINTILLATING STAR contended three wide, but weakened slightly during the drive. GAMBLE'S ORB was close up along the inside,
dropped off of the pace on the turn and failed to threaten thereafter. STANLEY MARKET vied between early, settled off of the leaders on the turn and failed
to make headway. TOWSER contended between horses, checked near the crest of the hill, then again down the hill and failed to threaten. JUSTASTAR
was unhurried, finished with a belated improvement but was never a factor. PROPERLY STRONG failed to respond. YO YO MON saved ground to no avail.
TUNNEL showed little.

CLEAR FOR ACTION disputed the pace up the hill and into the turn, opened clear midway through the bend, widened into the stretch and dug in to gamely
lead throughout. EPIMYTHIUM attended the pace toward the inside, got through to make his bid, shifted to the outside of CLEAR FOR ACTION but was
kept at bay. HIGH NOON RIDER was unhurried into stride, mounted a long drive circling five wide, churned on well and was making up ground. QUALITY
STEP settled in hand toward the inside, angled out leaving the turn and made a mild improvement. EXULTING stalked the pace, launched his bid five wide
but failed to sustain the drive. POLE SETTER tracked outside, loomed large entering the stretch, but lacked the needed late response. J W RUCKUS failed
to respond. WILSHIRE DIAMOND was never a factor. COUNT YOUR PENNIES saved ground to no avail. JAMMERS JUSTICE showed little. TWINKLING
KNIGHT vied for the lead on the outside, but came up empty between horses leaving the turn and dropped out. CAN'TBETEMALL dropped far back and
was always outrun.

Footnotes
ROCKET ONE was allowed to settle, came under a ride midway through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, angled out further in midstretch,
quickened once uncovered, reeled in the leaders and edged clear. CITY AT NIGHT prompted the early pace, settled off of the leaders, launched his bid
between horses, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner. GINGRICH stalked the pace, drew even four wide leaving the turn, but weakened slightly
during the drive and settled for the minor award. PAMMY'S READY vied for the early lead, dropped off of the pace on the turn, came again to re-engage for
the lead into the stretch, contested the issue to inside the furlong marker and succumbed. NEVER SAY KNOW (IRE) attended pace inside, offered a mild
bid entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. FORMAL ACT was allowed to settle, came five wide and made a mild improvement. HORSE
DADDY was allowed to settle, moved with the winner on the turn, but failed to sustain the drive. STREET N SOUR contested the pace outside, opened clear
on the turn, was headed entering the stretch and gave way readily. TIGER MOON was never a factor. BRAGGADOCIO (FR) was forwardly placed to the
turn and stopped. Pending review all fractional times have been omitted and final time was hand-timed.

Footnotes
AMERICANUS contested the pace between horses, fanned wide leaving the turn, fought on through a prolonged drive and was fully extended to narrowly
prevail. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY contended between foes, came four wide, drew even and battled gamely but grudgingly gave in. SOUPER DORMY settled
off of the inside, launched a bold bid between horses, came to level terms near the three-sixteenths marker, but flattened and settled for the minor award.
NATURAL POWER (IRE) settled off of the inside, was under a snug hold on the turn, rallied between rivals into the stretch and was making up ground.
SEARING CHASE was within reach off of the inside, split horses entering the stretch to make a mild bid but lacked the needed late response. PERUVIAN
BOY was allowed to settle, circled into the stretch seven wide but failed to threaten. AMERICAN UNION was unhurried into stride, came three wide and
finished with a belated improvement. FLAP JACK was forwardly placed toward the inside, bid between foes leaving the turn but failed to sustain the drive.
MR. HUSTLE set the pressured pace, shifted inward on the hill, disputed the issue to the stretch and tired. CENTRIFUGE was allowed to settle, went wide
and was never a factor. SMART REMARK showed little. FATHER GOOSE vied for the lead outside to the stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
VIVAR was unhurried into stride, advanced between horses, checked from tight quarters near the quarter pole, altered to the outside, was quickly back into
stride, reeled in the leaders and kicked clear. HE'S A ANGEL stalked the pace, launched a bold bid six side, forged a narrow lead, kept on well but was
unable to resist the winner. VERSTAPPEN was forwardly placed inside, got through to make his bid, but lacked the needed late response.
SCATTERSHACK was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, got through and improved position. RUSSIAN TANK contended along the inside, moved
up between horses, took an awkward step midway through the bend, leveled back into stride, was put in tight in the drive and the weary GO BALI GO drifted
about and went evenly. GO BALI GO rushed up between horses, opened clear off of the hill, set the pace to the stretch, weakened during the drive and
drifted about some in the final furlong. RITHMICALLEA was away alertly, vied for the early lead, settled off of the pace, was within striking distance to the
final furlong and tired. KNOWHOWIKNOW was unhurried, wheeled to the outside leaving the turn but failed to make headway. SENSEI LAWRENCE
tracked three wide, bid between rivals entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive.

Footnotes
AMALFI PRINCESS tracked four wide, came to level terms entering the stretch, wore down the dogged MUSED (GB) and gamely edged clear. MUSED
(GB) stalked the pace off of the inside, tipped to the outside of the leader on the turn, forged command nearing the quarter pole, fought on well but was
unable to match strides late. LUBNA (GB) contended between horses, waited briefly in traffic entering the stretch, found room and continued on well. TWO
SIXTYONE sped clear down the hill to dictate terms, was headed leaving the turn and gave way. ENVIED was allowed to settle, made a sweeping move
seven wide, offered a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. SOCIAL DILEMMA settled between rivals, came five wide, angled out further to be clear,
improved some. FLYING FORTRESS was unhurried, came six wide and finished with some gain. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) was allowed to settle five wide and
failed to threaten. LEMOS CUNHA contended off of the inside, bid between foes, but came up empty in the drive. STREET OF DREAMS failed to respond.
HINDSIGHT showed little. AMERICAN GODDESS was close up toward the inside through the turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
QUEEN JUDITH settled between rivals off of the inside, took closer order leaving the turn, split horses and angled toward the inside, got through and was
up in the final yards. AZAMANA EMPIRE contended toward the inside, found a wide opening in the upper stretch, came to level terms and fought on well,
but was turned away late. GIMME MO BABY settled between runners, launched her bid once straightened, kicked on well and was making up ground
readily. SHE'S GONE settled in hand, looped into the stretch seven wide and improved position. ROBINHILL tracked out side, ranged up swiftly leaving the
turn, came six wide and loomed large, drew even but flattened. DELIGHTOF THE NILE was away alertly, opened clear to set the pace well off of the inside,
but weakened between foes in the drive and faded. PARIS PARAMOUR settled off of the inside, got through and made a mild gain. THEDEVILYOUSAY
prompted the pace inside on the hill, then outside on the turn to the stretch and tired. JOEZINE passed only the tiring ones. MRS. NUSHI was close up off of
the inside to the stretch and faded. TAYLORS BABE failed to respond. PARIS KENTUCKY showed little.

Footnotes
ADVENTURING set the pace off of the inside, came five wide out of the final turn, turned back all challenges and held strongly. VIBURNUM attended the
pace in hand off of the inside, bid between horses, was unable to go on with the winner. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT contested the pace toward the inside,
weakened slightly during the drive but dug in to preserve the minor award. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE was allowed to settle, moved up to make a mild bid
four wide but failed to make up ground. EARTH STRIKE (IRE) settled off of the inside, got through but failed to make headway. SERENE was forwardly
placed outside, came five wide and toiled fruitlessly. CORE VALUES broke a step slow, was unhurried and never recovered.

Footnotes
ACCREDIT opened clear to dictate terms, was well handled and gamely led throughout. YES THIS TIME was forwardly placed off of the inside, was asked
in earnest leaving the second turn, kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. CELLIST was allowed to settle, moved up five wide through the turn,
came six wide to make a bold bid, but flattened and settled for the minor award. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) shadowed the leader outside to the stretch, but
weakened a bit between rivals in the drive and gave way. RED HORNET settled between runners, came four wide and churned on fairly well through the
drive. GREY STREAK was unhurried, looped into the stretch seven wide and improved position. HILLIARD was close up three wide, but faltered between
rivals entering the stretch and faded. DU JOUR showed little. LAST SAMURAI was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, but lacked a response when
called upon. IN EFFECT was never far back toward the inside to the second turn and tired. PALAZZI broke a step slow and trailed.
