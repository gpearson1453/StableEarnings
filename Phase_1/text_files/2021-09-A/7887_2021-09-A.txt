Footnotes
SILVER PRAIRIE angled out to the three path early in the backstretch to stalk the pacesetters, ranged up four wide, rallied determinedly outside LORD
STANLEY into the stretch and edged away late. LORD STANLEY prompted from the four path, moved up three wide into the lane and was out finished.
GRADY'S SONG set a pressured from the two path and weakened mid stretch inside. JIMMY FLASH tracked outside, went in pursuit of the leaders
approaching the quarter pole then flattened through the stretch. AMIGO QUERIDO went wide through the backstretch and bid mildly late stretch. REMAIN
CALM chased inside and came up empty in drive. CUZ IM A DANCER failed to threaten. JUST CLYDE broke poorly then was rank racing into the
backstretch and was not a factor. ARCTIC REIGN offered little.

ITS ALL ON SLEW stalked inside, angled out to the three path approaching the final turn, bid steadily outside under encouragement, dug in late and inched
up. HARRY'S HAMMER unhurried early, took closer order through the far turn, moved up inside approaching the stretch then gained a slim lead but was
unable to sustain the bid that was needed and was caught late. MINSKY MOMENT vied for the early lead, dueled three wide outside of LONG TIME DON,
disposed of rival nearing the quarter pole, battled gamely between foes through the stretch but was worn down deep stretch. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR
raced four wide leaving the chute, stalked the pacesetters and lacked the kick needed. KING KLOVER settled outside and failed to threaten. LONG TIME
DON contested the early pace, was unable to move on with rival at the in the final turn and tired. MIDNIGHT SHAKE unhurried early and had no response
when asked. TRANG never reached contention.

HARD TO COME HOME took command leaving the chute, set the pace while saving ground, shrugged off challenge from TRIPLE POWER in the final turn
then began to drive clear and held command while ridden out. TRIPLE POWER sat just off the pacesetter from the four path. moved up alongside HARD TO
COME HOME near the three eighths marker to challenge the lead, was unable to get by and rallied determinedly to hold place position. COMMON
KNOWLEDGE tracked from the two path, began a four wide bid at the quarter pole and was unable get by TRIPLE POWER under an all out bid. EL NOBLE
hugged the rail through the backstretch and failed to threaten. EDDYSHAK tracked from the five path, raced three wide into the far turn, drifted in through
the stretch and finished evenly. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE sat near the back of the pack and failed to produce a bid. IRISH TRICK chased outside and was
outrun. COZY BEAR was never involved.

MARIA'S SONG went wide leaving the chute under restraint, contested the early lead from the two path, saved ground while showing the way through the
far turn, kicked clear when asked and widened under light handling. CHASE THE SUN raced at the back of the pack, advanced along the rail entering the
lane, chased under steady urging and improved late for place. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE sat in range from the three path, took closer order inside nearing the
quarter pole, was set down for a drive and was edged out late stretch. RUMOHR REIGNS tracked five wide in the backstretch, launched an all out bid
entering the stretch and was unable to muster the bid required. J C'S FLASHOFCLASS chased inside and had nothing left in reserve. VICTORY AT LAST
raced wide through the backstretch, chased into the lane and gave way. NOT A DOCTOR quickly when to the front, was overtaken then chased through the
far turn and stopped in the stretch. MUCHO GRACIAS showed little. PULL THE PIN sat off the pace from the five path and tired early. FIRST PRINCE
steadied leaving the chute and was quickly outrun.

WYE CROSS took back leaving the chute, saved inside, found running room along the rail approaching the stretch, struck the front and prevailed under a
drive. TRADER LYNN saved ground in second flight from the three path, came under urging entering the stretch then continued on steadily outside and
narrowly missed. SIR MIEZIE broke alertly outside, set a pressured pace while four wide, dueled outside of ASTRONOMICAL throughout the final turn,
battled through the stretch and was run down late. ASTRONOMICAL vied inside for the early lead, pressed inside, battled determinedly through stretch and
was caught. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER sat just off the early dueling pacesetters under a snug hold, chased three wide at the head of the lane and yielded
late stretch. DOC COPE lagged early and rallied belatedly outside. RED CHOCOLATE unhurried early, chased under steady urging and failed to threaten.
HE'S CRIMSON CODE stumbled leaving and showed a mild interest late. BIG AL'S VISION tracked outside through the backstretch and had no response
when called upon. BACK ALLEY CAT outrun throughout. MAKE GOOD CHOICES raced four to five wide from well off the pace and faded steadily. ICE
BOX INDY chased outside and wilted.

Footnotes
INFINITE PATIENCE vied outside for the early lead, pressured the pace mostly on even terms, moved clear willingly approaching the quarter pole,
responded gamely to looming threat from PRINCESS OF CAIRO and stayed clear under a confident hand ride. PRINCESS OF CAIRO sat in striking range
while two to three wide, moved up menacingly at the head of the stretch but was no threat to the eventual winner and finished clearly second best. HERE'S
HANNAH emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, took pressure through the backstretch on the front, was overtaken near the five sixteenth pole,
refused to back down after a late challenge from SARAHS ELEGANCE and held bravely for show. SARAHS ELEGANCE unhurried early, saved ground
inside then shifted out into the final turn, was all out late but could not muster the bid required to get by. RAIDER raced four wide into the opening turn,
chased hard outside nearing the quarter pole and passed tiring. HIDDEN GRACE stalked the pacesetters from the four path and had nothing left in reserve
for the drive. SOLARITY reserved early and failed to produce a serious bid. SHE'S DIVINE stumbled away from the gate and chased throughout. BABS
DELIGHT chased outside and failed to be a factor. TIMER MALFUNCTION- No seven eighths time due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
HEIDI outsprinted to the opening turn, tracked two wide in the backstretch, angled out on the far turn, overtook the lead and held under steady pressure
through the stretch. PLUM BLUE trailed the field early, advanced quickly outside in the final turn, closed steadily in pursuit of the leader through the stretch
and missed after a very determined try. RUN LOLA RUN raced four to five wide into the first turn, tracked outside, fanned three wide leaving the
backstretch, roused outside into the lane, wore down rival late stretch to secure show. SHELTERED BAY moved to the front entering the first turn, stalked
the pace inside, inherited the front briefly and faded along the rail through the stretch. DANCE SHOES sat mid pack, lacked running room inside leaving the
backstretch, chased four wide into the lane and gave way mid stretch. BROAD APPROVAL settled just off the rail, lacked room in traffic then was steadied
and chased to no avail. XTREMA offered little. MI REYNA vied hard outside to the turn then was reserved off the pacesetters and tired early. TABERNACLE
lugged out hard on the first turn, chased on the far turn and yielded. PRETTY ARIA showed good speed outside under strong restraint, set pace by a slim
margin between foes, was overtaken just after the three eighths pole and stopped. DEFINITE PLEASURE raced four wide into the opening turn, pressed
outside through the backstretch and was done early.

UNCHARACTERISTIC broke in then was brushed away, tracked inside under a snug hold, sat in striking position in the two path, waited patiently nearing
the quarter pole, angled out then was set down for the drive and won driving outside. MYOPIC squeezed leaving, angled out to the three path racing in front
of the grandstand, contested the early pace the dueled to the three sixteenth marker outside of SMART PLAY, was kept under steady handling then
overtaken and dug in, in the final stages refusing to give up place honors. SMART PLAY crossed over quickly to secure a rail positioned early, dueled
through the backstretch, rallied determinedly inside through the stretch, gained mid stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final strides. BODEMONSTER
unhurried early the trailed the field early, gained closer order into the final turn and improved late under steady encouragement. TONY'S TAPIT was jostled
away from the gate then was rank approaching the opening turn, sat in striking range from the four path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, drove five
wide and lacked a closing response that was required. MY COLLEGE FUND raced in traffic in the first turn, went four wide through the backstretch, chased
through the far turn, lodged a mild bid but came up empty in the drive. BUCK WEST settled mid pack while racing three wide into the opening turn, saved
ground along the rail and finished evenly. PAY MY WAY raced wide leaving the opening turn and lacked a bid. PAPICHULO sandwiched away from the
gate then raced rank passing the front side, move to the rail leaving the backstretch and gave way into the lane. MAJOR SHEPARD outrun throughout.
DOUGS PAL drifted out leaving the opening turn, tracked outside, was done early and was eased.

Footnotes
GREEK GEEK sat mid pack saving ground, launched a rail bid after the quarter pole, angled out mid stretch and got up just in time. SIR BREGOVIC led the
field through the backstretch, responded to challenge from STONE CARVER, moved clear under steady urging and was caught late. GO AWAY gained
closer ordering nearing the quarter pole, kept on gradually along the rail and finished best than the others. STONE CARVER fanned three wide into the
opening turn, sat just off the pace from the four path, moved up alongside SIR BREGOVIC at the three eighths pole but had nothing left in reserve for the
drive. FIVE STAR GENERAL tracked inside, chased the pacesetters through the final turn and flattened out. PIONEER SPIRIT chased three wide and
passed tiring. REGAL MAX stalked the pace from the two path, was overtaken and faded. SHARP DRESSED BEAU trailed the field and failed to threaten.
ZICATELA sat in range, raced four wide leaving the backstretch and faded steadily through lane. EXPLODE raced five wide into the opening turn and was
outrun. SET TO SHINE saved to no avail.
