DAAHERS BULLY gained the early lead, edged clear leaving the turn and held on well in the stretch. COLD SNACK THIRTY settled well, advanced on the
turn and finished well while racing along the inside rail in the stretch. KID'S MISCHIEF stalked early, was outpaced leaving the turn and came up empty in
the stretch. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE failed to threaten. FLAT ROCK raced forwardly while three wide and faded. LARCH was awkward at the start and
outrun.

HEZA WILD RIDE seized command early, was challenged on the far turn and dug in gamely during the stretch run to hold YOU TALKIN TO ME safe. The
latter stalked, advanced to duel around the far turn and kept on willingly in the stretch. ALLEN'S ROCKET chased while three wide, moved closer on the far
turn and came up empty in the stretch. APOLLO BAY passed tired ones. BET YOU A BEER saved ground and lacked a rally. THAT'S WHAT I SAY was
always outrun. YORK ROAD was outpaced while three wide and faltered.
