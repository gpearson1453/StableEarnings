Footnotes
GABRIEL'S LEGEND, reserved last while angling inwards racing to the first turn, split foes midway through the backstretch advancing to contention, gained
a position just off the leaders along the rail awaiting an opening on the far turn, came through close quarters racing into upper stretch to wrest the advantage
and went well clear under firm encouragement. FEEDING FRENZY angled inwards to track the leaders between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted three
deep racing into the far turn advancing to challenge, pressed the issue to upper stretch but proved no match in the drive. GUEST CHECK ducked inwards at
the start while coming under correction, pulled his way between foes early exchanging light contact with CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE racing into the first turn,
tracked off the first flight outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position four wide on the far turn to lodge a brief bid in that path
nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, bumped lightly in the early stages, gained a forward placing three deep
tracking just off the leaders, advanced between foes to press the issue racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way. TAPIT SAM, urged
between foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, steadily faded in the drive. OPTION, urged inside foes prompting the pace racing to the
backstretch, emptied out after a half. SOTA KING angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch and came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
MINKOTA JOY broke readily, raced in hand tracking just off the leaders along the rail racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and
continued with a steady late bid to prevail under firm encouragement. SUMMER FIREFLYS broke outwards bumping VOODOO FIRE, was righted to track
off the first flight outside foes, moved to challenge three deep racing into upper stretch, gained the advantage late but couldn't fend off the winner. I CINC
EYE LUV U was urged clear in the opening stages racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a narrow advantage to upper stretch, shifted inwards under
pressure in the closing stages and yielded to the top pair late. SHEZONEZESTREET, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter in early
stages, angled to the rail in upper stretch and lost some momentum when held up avoiding tight quarters late. VOODOO FIRE, off awkwardly, then bumped
at the start, was carried out by BIRD FEATHER in early stages, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and made no real impression. SAINT SARENA
tracked the leaders shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch and faded early. BIRD FEATHER swerved out sharply in early stages impeding a
rival, was taken up while her rider corrected her course and trailed thereafter. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED I CINC I LUV YOU FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HER FOURTH.

Footnotes
EDGIE REGGIE broke out bumping LORING PARK, was righted while angling to the inside to stalk the leaders while pulling against firm restraint racing to
the backstretch, continued under light reserve awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, came through inside the leaders to challenge for command when
presented an opening in upper stretch and went clear in the closing stages under firm handling. LORING PARK, bumped at the start, was righted to track
the leaders outside a rival from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the far turn while shifting out four wide
nearing upper stretch, then came around a drifting rival in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors. BUBBA BOB, forwardly placed three wide
tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch, drifted out late and failed to sustain his momentum.
TWILITE LIASON sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, dueled for command inside foes on the far
turn into upper stretch and gave way once headed by the winner. TALENT AND TRICKS, bumped at the start, angled to the inside to track the leaders out
of striking distance, tipped out three wide, then four wide racing through upper stretch while altering course in traffic but continued with a mild bid to gain
position to the end. BAYOU BENNY, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way racing past midstretch. LAST
MARTINI, caught a bit wide early dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, drifted out six wide entering the lane and offered no rally. RUBY'S
RED DEVIL broke inwards bumping TALENT AND TRICKS, angled to the inside racing as part of the last flight to the backstretch and emptied out early.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CURRENT, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders three deep in second flight through the backstretch, made a steady
advance in that path to advance on the pacesetter racing into the far turn, then wrested the advantage and went clear through the lane under firm handling.
DREAMING BIZ, reserved off the second flight along the inside, angled out four wide racing through the far turn and continued with interest to prevail for the
place honors. ROZEY CHEEKS, urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled for command into the stretch briefly
resisting the winner's bid but yielded late. THAT WOULD BE NICE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, shifted inwards nearing the far turn while
losing terms with the leader and faded into the stretch. MINNESOTA NICE tracked off the first flight inside rivals in the opening half, shifted out to race three
wide between foes on the far turn and faded into the lane. WEE MS. BURNZIE settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch and
never gained contention. WITHHERBOOTSON proved no factor. FLASH FLOOD tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and
emptied out nearing the lane.

SHE'S MY WARRIOR broke sharply from the gate, dictated the pace in the early going, held a minimal advantage while saving ground through the bend
then fended off the challenge of HONEY BELLA past the quarter pole, dug in and responded well on the inside to draw away under steady urging to the
wire. HONEY BELLA broke well then pressured the pacesetter down the backstretch, commenced a bid in the two to three path at the quarter pole but failed
to sustained the momentum and was clearly second best. O'BABE was off a step slow at the break, bumped out then lugged in slightly bumping repreatedly
with SENSE OF FLURRY, continued to track just off the leaders down the backstretch then got a bit rank nearing the half mile pole forcing her to steady,
stayed on well in the three path through the bend and gained mildly to get into the show position while full out through the lane. AMARETTO DI AMORE
broke out at the break bumping with rival, tracked on the rail down the backstretch then shifted out at the three eighths pole, failed to menace in the stretch
and had no impact in the stretch. SENSE OF FLURRY was bumped repeatedly at the break from both sides, chased on the inside down the backstretch and
through the bend, but failed to menace in the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. SPEEDY ENOUGH showed brief speed four wide out of the gate
then retreated to the back of the field and proved no threat. START SINGING brushed with foes at the break, lacked early speed down the backstretch and
dropped out into the lane.

RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, a bit restless prior to the start, broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage under rating racing to the backstretch, held
sway into upper stretch and came under energetic handling to the maintain a safe margin to the end. READY TO RUNAWAY angled inwards to track just off
the leaders between rivals to the backstretch, shifted to the inside racing into the far turn and continued with a steady effort to edge rivals for the place
honors late. SHABAM was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched out splitting rivals on the far turn, swung four wide
racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. FIRSTMATE tracked the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to
the backstretch, angled inwards dropping off the second flight racing into the far turn, then tipped out four wide in the closing stages while continuing evenly.
MOLLY'S ANGEL settled off the leaders while angling inside racing to the first turn, switched out three wide on the backstretch while commencing a steady
advance, lodged a brief bid three wide nearing upper stretch but flattened out racing through the stretch. ALL NATIVE broke outwards, was settled last to
the backstretch and never gained contention. SCENT OF SUCCESS, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, emptied out
between foes racing into upper stretch. ICYWILBURNYEH tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight to the backstretch and dropped out after a
half.

Footnotes
CINCO STAR tracked the pace on the rail, shifted out nearing the half mile pole, bid for the lead nearing the quarter pole and drove clear in the lane. EL
TIZAR broke well from the inside, moved forward quickly to dictate the pace through the opening half, continued to lead on a comfortable margin into the far
turn, led the field at the top of the stretch but failed to sustain the momentum and was no match for the eventual winner. ZOE'S DELIGHT was allowed to
settle on the inside in the early going, continued well off the pace into the far turn on the inside, commenced a bid by angling out four wide nearing the five
sixteenths pole and finished willingly to get up for show. DEVIL VISION was reserved in the early going, shifted out three wide at the furlong marker and
rallied belatedly to get up for a minor share. TWOKO BAY broke well then settled back to track on the outside in the two path through the opening bend,
continued just off the leaders down the backstretch, angled out three wide on the far turn but failed to menace and weakened in the stretch. BIG FALCON
ROCKET chased the pace three wide into the first turn, continued to track the leader on the outside down the backstretch, attempted to rebid for the lead on
the far turn but weakened in the stretch. DAME PLATA dropped back midpack to settle on the rail through the opening half, continued to save ground
through the far turn had no late kick. TRI SPOT was far back throughout and proved no factor.

Footnotes
LOVE THE NEST broke readily, vied for command between foes racing through the backstretch into the turn, shook clear while angling to the inside racing
into upper stretch and widened his margin under firm left handed encouragement. NORTH ARM BAY tracked off the first flight four wide between foes in
early stages, shifted inwards a bit nearing the turn, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued with a solid late
response to prevail for the place honors on the wire. DOCTOR OSCAR ducked inwards at the start crossing into the path of XAVEY DAVE, was roused to a
forward placing while shifting out four wide racing through the backstretch, gained striking distance in that path nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain even
terms with the winner and flattened out in the last furlong. XAVEY DAVE, caught in tight quarters at the start, tracked off the first flight between foes racing
to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued even late. BENS MALICE broke outwards exchanging light contact with HAPPY
HOUR BOBBY, was settled into stride dropping well back early, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some position
late. OVERSEAS LETTER came through close quarters in the opening stages to track off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded into
upper stretch. JACKS WILLIE caught five wide tracking well off the first flight racing to the turn, failed to menace. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY sprinted to join the
pace three wide prompting the eventual winner racing into the turn and emptied out nearing the lane. SAINT CHARLES was hustled inside foes prompting
the pace through the backstretch but was spent after three furlongs. MARK OF VALOR was never a factor.

Footnotes
DROP OF GOLDEN SUN was rated three deep dropping well off the first flight in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the turn gaining position,
split foes racing into upper stretch and continued with a solid late response to reel in MR. JAGERMEISTER in time under brisk right handed pressure. The
latter, urged to dictate the pace between foes racing shifting off the rail racing through the backstretch, dispatched rivals to open a comfortable advantage
racing into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. FIREMAN OSCAR was rated between foes in the last flight in the opening stages, came
through close quarters while angling to the inside on the turn, switched outside a tiring rival racing through upper stretch, then angled to the rail in the last
furlong while continuing with interest to gain terms with the top pair nearing the wire. HOT SHOT KID settled inside foes in the last flight, was shuffled a bit
avoiding tight quarters nearing the turn, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. ASTRONAUT
OSCAR broke sharply to dispute the pace inside foes, conceded the lead after the opening furlong to track just off the pacesetter along the rail racing into
the turn and faded racing through upper stretch. THEALLIGATORHUNTER was urged three wide between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch
into the turn and gave way into the lane. RAY'S ANGEL was hustled four wide pursuing the pacesetter to the turn and emptied out nearing upper stretch.

CLICKBAIT tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance inside a rival racing through the backstretch, came under pressure entering the bend
while tipping outside the leader, made a sharp move to wrest the advantage racing past the quarter mile marker and went well clear under some right
handed pressure. STAR OF THE NORTH sped clear from the outset while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin racing into the
turn but proved no match when confronted by the winner. GRAND PRIZE, urged along tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance outside a
rival through the backstretch, lost position entering the turn and gave way nearing the lane.
