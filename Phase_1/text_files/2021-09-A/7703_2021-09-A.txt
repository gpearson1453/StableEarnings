GLACIER EXPRESS lagged far behind, swung six wide advancing into the stretch, surged and was up in the final yards. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD saved
ground off the leaders, bid inside to the front at the eighth pole but was nailed at the wire. THE REIGN MAN stalked the leaders outside and battled gamely
to the finish. RULES stumbled at the start, vied inside and finished willingly. TAPPIN HONOR prompted the pace outside then came up empty in the stretch.
ANZIO BEACH lacked speed, moved near the inside on the turn and faded.

MIDLANER vied inside, rallied clear on the turn and drew away eagerly under moderate coaxing. MAYBE AFTER LATER led narrowly in the opening
quarter then pursued the winner but was no match. DIABLO D ORO raced near the inside to the stretch, angled out with a mild bid. CHARLIES SAFARI
trailed far behind then passed rivals without menacing. INVITATION ONLY was urged close outside, moved inside on the turn with a brief rally then tired.
COBBLE ROAD chased wide and was finished by the far turn.

STREET TAIL took control inside and remained clear throughout under a steady drive. THE WANT OF A NAIL pursued the winner inside then outside and
finished willingly while unable to threaten. FORT FORTITUDE chased just off pace in the two path and raced evenly. BIG BAD BUD hustled within range off
the pace and flattened out in the stretch. HEART OF A DREAMER broke slowly and trailed early then passed fading rivals. VOY A TI raced between rivals
and lacked a rally. GOLD RUSH DANCER dropped back inside and came up empty in the stretch. SEVEN GEMS hustled from the gate wide and gave way
readily.

Footnotes
WILD CARAMELO set a clear pace inside, drifted out in the stretch and lasted while remaining safe. KID D'ORO dropped far behind, moved very wide into
the stretch then offered a late surge. FRAN'S WORRIER pressed the winner throughout, could not get by and was nailed for the place. CHAMPERS saved
ground off the leaders and closed well too late. KADENS COURAGE raced wide within range then proved empty in the stretch. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN
moved wider on the turn then faltered. MACH TRIAL trailed wide and was never a factor. IRISH COLONEL saved ground close up then stopped after half a
mile.

SACRED MOUNTAIN chased inside, faded on the the final turn then came again along the inside in the stretch and got up in time. SON OF A SAINT settled
wide off the pace and continued gamely to the wire. GOOD GOOD bobbled soon after the start, bid wide in the stretch but hung late. NILEATOR moved
easily to the front inside then weakened in the final furlong. DUBROVSKY dropped back inside and faltered steadily. ESPRESSO CALIENTE prompted the
pace between foes and stopped after half a mile. BOB'S MY UNCLE raced wide and gave way readily. ASPHALT PAVING was a late scratch at the gate on
the advice of the track veterinarian.
