BEE BIT established the front shortly after the start and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before taking to the three path down the
backstretch, was under pressure from a pair latched on to the outside, shook off those rivals tucked back to the two path through the far turn and was
confronted by her barn mate SUBIACO to the inside, floated out six wide into upper stretch as that rival spun just off the rail and was on near even terms for
the front briefly straightened away before drawing clear under a light drive getting geared down near the finish to prevail comfortably on the wire. SUBIACO
three to four wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking inside half a mile from home, advanced on an open
rail coming under coaxing at the three-eighths when latching on the leader, spun just off the inside for home getting on near even terms straightened away,
then got shaken off near the eighth pole and chased the winner home well clear of the rest to be along second best. YES I'M EVIL four to five wide through
the first turn, prompted the pace five paths off the inside, tucked three wide into the far turn and came under coaxing midway, went eight wide into upper
stretch and faltered. POSITIVE SKEW coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide through the opening bend before pressing the pace from the four path
between foes down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, faded through the latter portion of
the turn and spun two to three wide for home, then folded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DAKOTA GOLD was a bit awkwardly into stride then hustled, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead into the stretch
then kicked clear, shied out some outside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging. MUNNY BOLT showed good speed while hustled to the
lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead to the winner while under a drive into the stretch and proved no
match while clear for the place. LANZONI was urged along on the outside, dropped back significantly in the three path on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch and got up for the show on the wire. SNOW CANDY chased the pace on the outside, tucked into the two path leaving the backstretch, pursued the
top two into upper stretch, dropped back while tiring into the final furlong, had the rider take a peek behind him to the outside approaching the
sixteenth-pole, was eased up at that juncture, had the rider realize he was in danger of losing the show position late, was put back to urging and had the
reins shaken up at him a few strides from the finish then was caught for the show on the wire. CABANA TIME showed no speed while hard ridden, saved
ground on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

DANNY DEEP CUTS broke out at the start and was corrected, vied from the four path briefly before settling in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two
path through the turn and advanced to poke a head in front spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, began to edge away and shied in under a right
handed crop just inside the three-sixteenths, then drew clear under a drive to the finish. BUSTINMYGROOVE hustled from the gate, vied from the three
path early on with a pair before shaking away to a safe advantage, tucked inside through the turn and came under steadily increasing pressure from the
outside, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, came under a left hand crop and shied
out three-sixteenths from home as the aforementioned foe shied inwards safely in front, steadied briefly behind that rival, then drifted out giving chase
through to the finish despite correction and was along clear for the place honors. MISS ALEX vied from the two path briefly before easing off under a firm
hold nearing the turn, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.
RED PEPPER GRILL hustled from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn placed
to coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, went five wide into upper stretch and tired. GAGLIANO broke out at the start, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and took an awkward step straightened away and trailed throughout.
There was an Objection by the trainer of BUSTINMYGROOVE alleging interference against DANNY DEEP CUTS which was reviewed and dismissed prior
to the result standing and the race being declared official.

good speed, set the pace under pressure to his outside, moved clear passing the five-eighths, went around the turn in the two path, was headed by the
winner while under the crop into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. SONNEMAN brushed with

BOLDISH just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just
inside the eighth pole, inched away in the late stages to the finish. CASTLE CHAOS pressed the pace from the outside four then three wide, tucked to the
two path through the turn and took over command near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside
the eighth pole, fought on inside through to the finish along well clear of the rest for the place honors. MUBTADAA stumbled at the start and came under
hustling to establish the front after the break, showed the way lightly coaxed along three then two wide under pressure from a pair down the backstretch and
then CASTLE CHAOS through the turn, tucked to the inside and was collared near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and weakened in the
stretch. DEFERRED TAXES five then four wide in pursuit, advanced through the latter portion of the turn and went seven wide into upper stretch, then
weakened in the drive. MY BOY COLTON led early on before being displaced by a pair and prompted those rivals from the outside six then five paths off the
inside, tucked three wide into the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, steadily got shaken off and spun three wide into upper stretch
before tiring through to the finish.

AVA K'S BOY broke in and brushed with a foe, was urged along in fourth position, chased three then four wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch
then took the lead before the three-sixteenths, shook clear under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. THE INSTITUTE broke out then was corrected by the rider and hustled, showed speed on the inside of three
foes, was taken up badly and checked inside of a rank foe inside the nine-sixteenths then dropped back significantly, lost around four to five lengths on the
front, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path under a firm left-handed grip, gained passing the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the
stretch then tipped out about seven wide, chased the winner under the crop while outside in the drive and missed while clear for the place. MONEY
MERGER broke a bit slow then drifted in after the start, raced at the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
moved out into the final furlong then drifted out more, took a straight course while gaining into the final sixteenth, drifted out again late then bothered
KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF a bit and finished with good energy to garner the show. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF bumped with an opponent at the start, settled off the
pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch then moved further out, gained in the final furlong, steadied while forced out
by MONEY MERGER late and missed the show. OCEAN'S RESERVE bumped with a foe at the start, showed speed while loosely between horses,
checked while very rank inside the nine-sixteenths then dropped back, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. FATHER WALSH bumped with a rival at the start, showed good speed then disputed the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back while still on his inside lead into the final furlong and
tired. LORD BROWNIE broke in and bumped with a foe then was taken up while in tight between horses, raced off the pace under urging, went three wide
on the turn and failed to rally. DATESFREEDOM broke a bit slow, was hard ridden towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and was no factor. ILLUMINATO showed good speed, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, turned into the
stretch under the crop and stopped.

Footnotes
MOTIVATED SELLER just off the inside early on, tipped out to the four path soon after to be outside the leader, tucked three wide into the turn and and
steadily advanced from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch steadily gaining under her own power and seized command when roused a
furlong from home, then edged clear under a drive to the finish to establish a course record. TIME LIMIT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand
three then two wide coming under steadily increasing pressure from the top one to the outside and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three
wide for home, dug in under a drive clinging to the front until collared a furlong from home, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and
second best. KANSAS KIS bumped at the start by HYDRA due to pressure from ROYAL MEGHAN, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, improved position for the show honors and flattened out in the late going. ROYAL
MEGHAN broke out at the start bumping HYDRA into KANSAS KIS, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cornered two to three
wide into upper stretch and weakened. HYDRA got bumped at the start by ROYAL MEGHAN and in turn bumped KANSAS KIS, chased five to six paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. SUMMER BREW brushed the off side stall at the start, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn under encouragement from midway, angled four wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CANDY TYCOON pulled under restraint along the rail into the first turn, settled while saving ground, was roused on the final turn, cut the corner under a
right-handed crop into the stretch then rallied to the lead, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, led under threat into the final sixteenth, came
out a path and jostled with MO GOTCHA shortly thereafter and held sway. MO GOTCHA charged the front of the gate while fractious prior to the start, went
to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, lost the lead midway through that bend then moved back to the two path, followed the
leader down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the final turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, gained to make a bid inside the furlong marker
under a right-handed crop, was jostled by the winner when that foe came out inside the sixteenth-pole, fought with that foe to the wire and just missed while
clear for the place. TWO THIRTY FIVE went three wide on the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, floated seven wide
into the stretch, chased the top two into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. GLORY ROAD went three wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, moved out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. MUSICAL AMERICA tossed his
head while keen between foes into the first turn, moved to the lead in the two path while let out midway through that bend, opened up a clear advantage,
traveled around the far turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and tired. JOURNEYMAN
saved ground on the first turn, settled near the back, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went around the far turn in the two path and failed to
respond. SHOTSKI went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while falling well behind in the four path on the final turn, spun six
wide into the stretch and faltered. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF MO GOTCHA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CANDY TYCOON ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER THE STEWARDS' REVIEW, CANDY TYCOON WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED
SECOND.

Footnotes
MISS INTERPRET five paths off the inside early on, raced three to four wide in pursuit initially at the tail of the field before coming under light coaxing near
the half mile pole, went four wide through the turn urged along from the seven-sixteenths, tipped out five wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the top
pair a furlong out, took over command just inside the sixteenth marker and inched clear to the finish under light hand urging. LET'S BE CLEAR bobbled at
the break, recovered to be six paths off the inside briefly before tucking four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, advanced to duel through the turn
with SAIL BY to her inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home, dug in under a drive battling on loosely
between rivals to the finish to be along for the place honors. SAIL BY five paths off the inside early on, crossed to show the way under rating just off the
inside until given some rein to work with nearing the half mile pole, got engaged in head to head combat through the turn as LET'S BE CLEAR advanced
outside and was placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in clinging stubbornly to the lead, got
headed just inside the sixteenth pole and fought on to the finish. RUNAWAY BREEZE broke in at the start and came under coaxing, chased two to three
wide under urging from the half mile pole, rode the rail through the turn growing detached at the tail of the field, spun just off the inside for home and was
eased home through to the finish.

Footnotes
ON OUR WAY BOYZ disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, kicked clear under a drive in upper stretch and drew away under
steady urging. HOT DOCTOR broke in then was hustled, settled off the pace, was allowed to drop back and lost position badly late on the backstretch, gave
up around three lengths to the front, went around the turn in the two path, gained passing the five-sixteenths, waited while blocked from the quarter-pole to
the eighth-pole, was asked while finding room between horses at that point and finished with good courage for the place in a tough trip. TAMBURRO'S SOX
broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, chased four then five wide on the turn and weakened while best of the rest. BOOM BOOM KABOOM
bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled in the front half of the field, drafted inside while behind the leaders on the turn, was asked in the two path into the
stretch, pursed the winner under a drive into the final furlong and tired. BEAU BROWN raced just off the pace, chased two then three wide on the turn and
came up empty. I GEN broke in and brushed the gate while off a half-step slow, was hard ridden at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out under the
crop into the stretch, drifted out late and failed to threaten. I'M BLAMING YOU was sent hard from the start, chased the leading duo on the outside, went
three then four wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. TUESDAY'S CHILD broke a bit slow then drifted out early, raced towards
the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and was no factor. SANDOR CLEGANE showed good speed, disputed
the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail while still inside that opponent on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and faded.
