Footnotes
RED CLOUD EXPRESS bumped a rival lightly at the start, dueled inside a rival but off the fence, went in the two to three path on the turn, kicked clear in
the stretch and was kept to the task. AFFAIRS UNLIMITED veered out at the start, shifted in gradually chasing up the backstretch, went in the two path on
the turn, came out in mid-stretch and ran on to get the place. IMPEACHING was lightly bumped at the start, dueled outside the winner going three to four
wide on the turn and lacked the needed late kick. STELLAR WAY shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, kept on. CARMON'S
DANCE broke in the air, was well back early, advanced four to five wide on the turn and ran on mildly. DOUBLE STORM chased four to five wide on the turn
and failed to rally. STELLA SWEEPER broke a bit slowly, lacked early speed racing well off the inside and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SANTIAGO'S TOWER set the pace from outside, edged clear after the opening quarter, went three deep on the turn, widened into upper stretch and held
sway. BOB'SALLWICKED broke out and brushed with a rival, settled well off the leaders off the inside, went in the two to three path on the turn, came out
four to five wide for the drive and gained mildly late. MORE FIREWATER chased from outside, went four wide on the turn, lugged out in mid-stretch and
needed more. TALKABOUTNAVARONE shifted in early, tracked inside heading into the turn, came out five wide nearing the five-sixteenths, moved out
further in upper stretch as a rival drifted out and kept on evenly. KISS ME D ORO vied inside a foe early, went in the two path on the turn having lost ground
on the leader, failed to rally. SIXTH GEAR switched out early, went four wide on the turn and was not a threat. DANCING THUNDER trailed early, went five
wide on the turn, failed to menace. BIG WHISKEY was in tight and brushed at the break, raced last but one off the inside in the three to four path and made
no bids.

Footnotes
EBB AND FLOW was urged at the break, dictated terms in the two path, drifted out a hair on the far turn while well clear, held sway. WIN LIKE COACH P
was caught five wide on the first turn racing toward the rear, advanced past rivals outside up the backstretch, went four to six wide on the far turn, kept on to
gain mildly for place. CAROLS BOUTIQUE stalked the leading pair three wide early, moved in a bit up the backstretch then moved out from two to four wide
on the far turn gaining the second position into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. APPEARTOTRUST shifted in behind rivals entering the first
turn to go three to four wide on that bend off the leaders, moved in further up the backstretch, went two deep through the far turn and failed to rally. HOT LIL
MESS stalked the winner early four wide, continued three to five wide on the far turn and steadily weakened. LITTLE PET KITTY was washy in the parade,
broke a half-step slowly, saved ground on then just off the rail through the first turn racing mid-pack, shifted out heading up the backstretch, went three to
four wide on the far turn and was not a threat. SHEJUSTFLIES was caught six wide early, shifted in near the rail early on the far turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
BISCUIT SNATCHER set the pace with rivals in pursuit, went in the two path on the turn drifting out a bit turning for home, was well clear into upper stretch
and held under steady handling. TRUST THE VAN settled in the back half off the fence, went two to three deep on the turn before swinging seven wide into
upper stretch, ran on evenly to gain the place. REINING PESOS chased from outside, went five to six wide on the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and ran
evenly late. FULL OF DRIVE was forwardly-placed chased outside the winner, went three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and kept on. DRIVE
THRU GARY broke a half-step slowly, trailed early going three to five wide on the turn and swinging out further into upper stretch, shifted in at that juncture
and improved position. WAR WOUNDS advanced four wide on the turn to reach striking distance but could not sustain the effort. DECK HUMOR went five
wide on the turn mid-pack, swung ten deep into upper stretch and had no rally. S W LUCKY CHARM broke a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, went three to
four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CASABLANCA HOT showed brief speed chasing the eventually winner, dropped to the rail while backing up,
faded.

Footnotes
ONE MARK set the pace racing well off the rail in the two to three path, drew away under urging. CHEESE TRAY pressed the early pace, went four wide on
both turns, proved no match for the winner. DAN WHO was floated nine wide into the first turn, eased back and angled to the rail about the seven-eighths,
came out heading up the backstretch and raced six wide on the far turn, gained show honors. IZERIGHT was caught eight wide into the first turn, eased off
and shifted in a bit to the six path, continued to move nearer inside heading up the backstretch while beginning to advance past rivals, went three wide on
the second turn, lacked the needed late kick. SARGE moved in from seven to four wide tucking in behind rivals on the first turn, moved nearer the inside
heading up the backstretch before shifting out from two to four wide on the far turn, failed to rally. DELBERT TOO exchanged a bump at the start, chased
five wide through the first turn, shifted to the rail early up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and came up empty. ILIKEROLLIN exchanged a
bump at the start, was caught six wide early, began to drop back five wide on the far turn, was eased in the lane, walked off.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO pressed from outside three wide on the turn, came into the stretch six deep and edged clear late. STACKIN SILVER tracked the early
pace, moved up inside to commence a bid saving ground on the turn, edged to the lead by upper stretch but was no match late. RAAGHEB settled at the
rear, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch then drifted out a bit, was gaining but too late. BLACK OPS
exchanged a light bump at the start, tracked off the leaders from inside, moved out three wide into upper stretch and kept on. TAKE ME FOR A SPIN set a
pressured pace from off the inside, contended between rivals on the turn, came out five wide turning for home while weakening and could not kick on but
evenly. NIFTY raced outside rivals well back going four to five wide on the turn, came eight wide into upper stretch, shifted inside a foe and failed to rally.
CATS BLAME exchanged a light bump at the start, went two to three wide on the turn toward the rear and ran on evenly. COMPETITIVE IDEA was
mid-pack early, entered the turn two wide coming four wide out of it and came up empty.
