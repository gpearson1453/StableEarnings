ALWAY'S A KNIGHT away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid from along the
inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to get up in time. PITCH COUNT away alertly and raced to the
lead from along rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the stretch the first time and in the run down the backside, maintained his advantage
through the final turn, and just failed to last. BETATHANABOYFRIEND settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first
time, continued to save ground through the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. CHEF settled at
the back of the field while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside,
rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. ACE DEUCE broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first
time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but faded in the late
stages.

IT'S IN COMMAND away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the race from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, and held MASTER EWEN safely at bay late to prevail. MASTER EWEN broke sharply and stalked the early pace
while saving ground along the inside in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from just off the rail through the final turn, and finished willingly three
wide in the drive to prove second best. SIR BARCLAY away alertly and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied two wide into the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. TRUPON ONLINE settled off the early pace while racing
one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid while finishing two wide in the
drive. TEXAS KID settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. MOUSSAKA CHEF unhurried early while trailing the field into the first turn, was always well
back and failed to make an impact.

STEVIE'S SONG broke sharply and dueled for the lead two wide from between rivals through the first turn, continued to battle from between rivals for the
lead in the run down the backstretch, rallied from the outside of CUSHMAN ROAD through the final turn, and wore down that stubborn foe in the final strides
to prevail. CUSHMAN ROAD away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, held the narrowest of leads into the lane, and just failed to last. TAKE CHARGE GWEN tracked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two out from the rail
in the drive to get up for a share. ZETAMARIE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed
willingly four out from the rail in the drive while finding her best stride late. RICHARDS COMMAND tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final tunr, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive, while unable
to improve her position. ANIMA pressed the pace three wide through the first turn and in the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep up with her pace
rivals while racing three wide into the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and rushed to a clear lead entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, controlled the pace through the stretch
the first time and into the backstretch, repelled a bid by HEARTSET in the run to the final turn, opened a clear advantage midway through the turn, and
widened his lead late under confident handling. HEARTSET broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the
rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch, was unable to match strides with AVE'S IN COMMAND entering he final turn, and closed two
wide in the drive to hold the place. SIMPLY GOLDEN away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the
stretch the first time, continued to save ground through the second turn to grab a stalking trip entering the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. CRAZY PROPHET unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced his bid
four wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. WE GOT IT COVERED stalked the
leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a three wide trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied two out
from the rail entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

BOLD AS BRASS tracked the leader into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, slipped through along the inside of DAPHNE in the run to the final turn
to assume command, and finished three wide in the drive to fend off a game DAPHNE in deep stretch. DAPHNE broke sharply and raced to the lead one
out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace two wide in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken by BOLD AND BRASS from along her
inside approaching the final turn, and continued one gamely four wide in the drive to prove second best. WHISKEY TALK was slow into stride and angled in
to save ground through the first turn, raced into a stalking trip in the run down the backside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from
along the inside in the drive to garner a share. YOUNG VIGILANTE settled off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from
the rail entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to just miss the show position. C R SUNRISE away well and stalked the early pacesetters
while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon. SUNGOLD BEAUTY away alertly, but settled well off the early pace while racing four wide entering the backstretch, dropped to the inside entering the
final turn, but failed to have a late impact. ONE FLEET PRINCESS settled well off the early pace while being carried five wide entering he backstretch,
rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid.
