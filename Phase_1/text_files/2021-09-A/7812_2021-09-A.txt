DYRDEK was in tight inside the leader entering the clubhouse turn, checked repeatedly, angled outside that one, too command on the far turn then widened
the balance of the trip to win as much the best under left handed urging. UYEDA away alertly, set the pace into the far turn then was no match for the
winner. ROGALLO close up on the first turn, dropped back, swung wide and came on again in the six path. CAT'S CURIOSITY stalked the pace three wide
and went evenly. DEBDURITE hopped at the start and was no threat. WILL RUNAWAY failed to menace. WEST LEONARD trailed on the first turn,
advanced along the rail after a half then came up.
