INTERESTING LEGACY steadied in tight midway on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn, was bumped lightly in late stretch while vying
outside the leader and prevailed. I GOT A ROCK ducked out leaving the gate, took command at once, raced two wide around the turn, ran clear in early
stretch, bore out under left hand whip, bumped the winner in late stretch and gave way. BEYOND THE BEND was slow early, stayed in the three path
around the turn and finished willingly outside. ZYRAMID bobbled while breaking slowly, was hustled along the rail to press the early leader then tired in the
lane. MCPHERSON hit the outside door leaving the gate and couldn't keep up.

TRIBAL NOTION showed speed between horses, was squeezed back entering the turn, swung wide into the stretch, took over in midstretch and held.
MEET ME AT MUNDIS came over leaving the gate, caused crowding, raced four wide with the pace into the turn, opened a short lead entering the stretch
then couldn't contain the winner. Following objections by Conner and the trainer of MIDNIGHT HAULER, MEET ME AT MUNDIS was disqualified and
placed fourth. SIX CIDER was bumped and steadied after the break, raced wide around the turn and finished willingly. MIDNIGHT HAULER was bumped
then steadied leaving the gate, angled to the inside while trailing then gained late. KICK KICK HUSTLE was hustled inside, ran out into TRIBAL NOTION
entering the turn, remained prominent for over a half then weakened. WEST FORK came out leaving the gate, dueled three wide between horses into the

CHILLY SKY was never far back outside, advanced the four path around the turn, was carried wider into the stretch, took over nearing the final sixteenth
and held. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE was unhurried after a slow break, stayed along the rail, loomed a threat into the final sixteenth but wasn't enough. I'M
THE TALENT raced three wide with the pace, was carried out entering the stretch, was bumped while dueling for command in midstretch then faded.
FLATTERING RUBY was hustled to a short lead along the rail, ran out entering the stretch, bore out under left hand whip while dueling into midstretch then
weakened. LOVELY LYDIA raced two wide and lacked a rally. AMIGOS TUNE raced two wide between rivals with the pace for almost a half then stopped.
