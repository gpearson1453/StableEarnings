TIZONA sat off of the early pace, took control of the pace on the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn, extended the lead off of the turn and pulled
away in the end. MAHI MAHI sat off of the early pace, was three wide between runners on the second turn, closed well in the stretch and won the nod for
second, while no match for the winner. ROBBER BARON had no speed in the early going, was four wide on the second turn, matched strides with MAHI
MAHI in the stretch while closing well and just missed for the place while holding for third. THEYREMINISCEOVERU set the early fractions, then prompted
TIZONA through the second turn, was still in contention entering the stretch but weakened in the final sixteenth. TWILIGHT RIDER stalked the early pace,
saved ground on the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
KAZANSKY sat just off of the early pace, saved ground while two wide on the turn, mounted a sustained bid leaving the turn and had a late kick to get by
the runner-up and drew clear in the end. PHILIPIE FAST broke on top and set the pace from a ground saving position, had a clear lead into the lane but was
outkicked in the final sixteenth while holding second. SMOKE STACK had no speed in the early stages, was four wide on the turn and closed willingly in the
stretch, pressuring the runner-up for second and holding for third. HELLO HANDSOME was away a bit slowly and was hustled to chase the early pace,
mounted a bid while four then five wide on the turn but was outfinished in the stretch. DUBRONSKY tracked the early pace from a ground saving position
and did not mount a late rally. SMILING PATRICK prompted the early pace from a four wide running path, was still in contention off of the turn but gave out
in the late going. DARTMOOR chased the early leaders into the turn, lost ground on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REV REE sat just off of the early leaders, improved position while four then three wide on the second turn while confronting GOLDEN IRIS, overhauled that
foe and drew clear in the final sixteenth to prevail. GOLDEN IRIS (GB) contested the early pace from SAY IT WITH ROSES, gained ground on that rival on
the second turn, was confronted by the winner off of the second turn and could not hold her off but kept on in the stretch to hold second. WIND TARTARE
(FR) had no speed in the early stages, was three to four wide on the second turn while still toward the rear but made a late bid in the stretch to claim third
and pressured the runner-up in the final strides. SAY IT WITH ROSES broke alertly and set the fractions while being prompted into the second turn, saved
ground on the second turn but was losing ground heading into the lane and weakened in the stretch drive. CONVINCE had no speed in the early going,
saved ground while two wide on the second turn and did not mount a late rally. YANGTZE RIVER stalked the early pace from a ground saving position and
gave way in the late going.

BANDERA AZTECA sat just off of the early quick pace, mounted a bid while four wide on the turn and had a determined late push to get by the runner-up in
the final strides to prevail. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF attended to the early quick pace, was three wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn to take the
lead and led into the final sixteenth but was nipped by the oncoming winner while running on the left lead. CARDIFF CRACK tracked the early pace while
saving ground on the turn and closed in the stretch to be an easy third. NUESTRO ENGREIDO broke sharply and set the quick early fractions, saved
ground while two wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run. VINNIEBOB chased the early pace from the midflight, was three wide on the turn and finished
evenly in the stretch drive. TEACH ME settled in the midflight, was three wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. SLOOP JOHN B was slow into
stride and chased from the rear, saved ground while two wide on the turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch but was not challenging the leaders.
SIERRA SNOW STORM tracked the leaders while four wide on the turn and was not a threat. BOB'S REIGN broke sideways and was off slowly, chased the
leaders from the rear of the field, was two wide on the turn and was not a factor.

three-sixteenths marker into SILK ROAD SALLY's path, was urged under left-handed encouragement in the final sixteenths and edged clear late. SILK
ROAD SALLY had no speed in the early going, improved position on the second turn while four to five wide, was carried out by the winner inside of the
three-sixteenths marker and was outkicked in the late going, while holding for second. BLUEGRASS SKY broke on top and set the pace while saving
ground and was outfinished in the stretch. LA GATA ELEGANTE stalked the pace from a forward position, saved ground on the second turn, vied for the
lead leaving the bend but weakened in the stretch run. BLUE BREEZE sat off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn and did not offer a late
kick in the stretch. MADE IN KAROO was away slowly, and was unhurried in the early going, gained ground while two wide on the second turn but finished
evenly in the stretch run. PASSIONATE ROAD stalked the pace from the midflight, gained ground on the rail on the second turn but gave way in the stretch
run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH INVOLVING PARTY SPIRIT AND SILK ROAD SALLY

Footnotes
DESERT DUDE attended to the early pace, gained ground while three wide on the second turn, came to terms with SECOND BOLD inside of the furlong
marker and wore down the runner-up to prevail. SECOND BOLD broke alertly and set the pace through the second turn, had a clear lead into the stretch but
was confronted and outfinished by DESERT DUDE, while holding for second. PURR CAT was rank and hard to place on the run along the first turn,
mounted a bid while three to five wide on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch to claim the show. KNOWN settled near the rear of the field in
the early going, was four to five wide on the second turn, gained ground in the stretch and just missed for third. ANGELO'S PRIDE tracked the early leaders
from the midflight, saved ground on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch. PAPER BOY was away slowly and had no speed early, saved ground
while two wide on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch but was not challenging the leaders. KATZUMOTO tracked the early leaders,
saved ground while two wide on the second turn and did not have a final kick in the stretch. HARVEST A STORM chased the early pace from a forward
position, was four wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run. FOUR O'FIVE settled near the rear of the field, was outrun on the second turn
and did not rally in the stretch.
