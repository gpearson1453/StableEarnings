Footnotes
SON OF ELEANOR was never far off the pace, raced inside, bid off the rail, dueled through the stretch and proved best. JEN LORS LEGACY stalked the
pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. INDY'S OUTLAW rallied on the turn, found his
best stride late and was gaining ground. PERFECT SURPRISE broke through the gate, was hustled along to set the pace to the turn, responded to duel
briefly, weakened and dropped back. BARTOLOMEO failed to threaten in an even effort. RED CHARGER showed little. Hand timed.

handed urging. MISS SHAWHAN was unhurried early, rallied on the turn, bid five wide and closed well to earn place. HAIL ON HOOFS set the pace,
faltered mid stretch and held safely for show. ORATORY GLORY stalked the pace while racing inside and was through after a half. BLUEGRASS BETTY
was through early and stopped. FILTHY pressed the pace, tired entering the second turn and stopped. Hand timed.

DYNA CAT pressed the pace, angled out on the turn, bid five wide to duel for the lead and inched clear late. NEVADAN pressed the pace four across,
challenged leaving the turn, dueled for the lead, came in near the eighth pole and yielded late. CAPITAL REEF dueled between horses, was crowded and
checked near the eighth pole, fell back and held for show. OVER EZ dueled between horses to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. ME dueled
inside past the eighth pole and faltered. CHILL HAZE broke in the air to be off slowly and trailed the field. There was an inquiry concerning the start and an
objection from the rider of CAPITAL REEF against the rider of NEVADA for alleged interference near the eighth pole. No change was made. Hand timed.

FICTIONAL challenged three across on the turn, dueled through the stretch and inched clear late to prove best. PALACE STAR challenged along the rail
into the turn, dueled through the stretch and yielded late, grudgingly. MERRY MARIE was never far back, lacked the needed late response and earned
show. I'M ALL THE JEDI improved position in an even effort. MESANGE was not a factor. OYE COMO VA set the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave
way. RANDOM PLEASURE distanced the field. Hand timed.
