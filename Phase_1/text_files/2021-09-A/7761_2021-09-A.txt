SIP'N DIP stalked the pace, bid on the far turn, dueled with PROMINENT HENNY into the stretch, dug in gamely outside in the final furlong and prevailed
late after a long stretch drive. PROMINENT HENNY set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of SIP'N DIP in the stretch run
and yielded grudgingly in the final strides. DUSTINTHEWIND raced off the pace inside, chased outside a rival on the far turn and rallied mildly for third.
SUPER MELODY raced off the pace, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a rally. TAP SOLO was bumped at the start, raced three wide off the pace,
chased on the far turn and tired. CASTING PEARLS was bumped at the start, outrun early and passed tired ones. INERTIA stalked early on, chased and
gave way. PAGE ELEVEN raced four wide early, settled off the pace, was pulled up on the far turn and walked off.

the pace, closed late inside and got the nod for fourth. FACE CARD CONTESSA hit the gate, trailed the field, moved up three wide on the far turn and
gained mildly. CANDY LUA tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. AUTOSTRADA raced off the pace inside, steadied on the first turn and
failed to threaten. CAPITAL ALLOCATION (GB) stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and faded. BRAMBLE BUSH did not factor. R GIRL FAITH pulled
early on the inside, pressed the pace, then chased and faded.
