Footnotes
PAINT ME LUCKY sped to the front in the two path, showed the way off the rail on the backstretch, came back to the two path for the second bend, led
clear three wide into the stretch, urged right-handed midway through the lane and drew away. FULL DRAW forwardly placed in the early stages outside the
leader well off the inside, chased three to four wide into the drive, could not find the needed late kick but was clearly second best. CAPPER tracked off the
inside, went three wide into the lane, steered out in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. CIBERTRUCK stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the
stretch and never responded to urging. ACHILLEUS off a step slow, chased off the pace near the inside, lost ground around the far turn and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
ENDLESS THIRST sat off the pace outside a rival into and around the turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied alongside in midstretch, dueled with the
runner-up in the late stages and was all out to prevail. SHEMAKESCENTS chased the top trio to the turn, traveled two wide then angled four wide into the
stretch, steered out further in the lane, took over mid-stretch, fought with ENDLESS THIRST in deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. ADDYDIDIT raced off
the pace up the backstretch, took the turn three wide, angled out in upper stretch and produced a mild rally for the show. PRESKITT brushed with outside
rival at the start, went up to vie for command from inside, failed to match strides around the turn, chased through the lane and kept on for a minor award.
BLUE WILDCAT saved ground through the turn, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole, angled out at the eighth pole and never threatened. HER PERFECT
VISION vied outside a pair of rivals for command, dueled with SPOILED ROTTEN on the turn, inched away leaving the bend, raced clear in upper stretch
then gave way when overhauled. SPOILED ROTTEN brushed with PRESKITT at the start, vied for the lead between rivals, dueled with HER PERFECT
VISION on the turn then chased that rival two wide into the lane and tired.

LAST RENEGADE got bumped leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from inside, chased rival into the stretch, came back and collared rival approaching the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. LOOKINFORMISCHIEF came in and bumped rival at the start, dueled for the lead from outside, cleared leaving the turn, led
through the lane then clung to the lead with a sixteenth remaining and yielded to the winner. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT broke in, was forwardly placed outside
the top pair, angled out and exited the ben under a drive four wide, stayed within striking distance and finished willingly through the final furlong but needed
to find more late. FLOYD KNOWLES tracked off the inside, bumped with TOASTED AT DAWN entering the turn, moved in a few paths and left the bend
four wide and could not rally. SMOKEN SHADOW dwelt at the start and came away well behind the field, trailed two wide into the turn, moved to the rail
around the bend and was never a factor. TOASTED AT DAWN broke in, raced five wide and bumped with FLOYD KNOWLES into the turn, angled down to
the rail around the bend and faded.

RED VALOR dueled for the lead outside UNTHROTTLED, cleared nearing the three-eighths pole, drew away in the lane then shortened late but held safely.
SELF TAUGHT dropped back early, went two then three wide around the turn, moved out in the stretch, summoned a late rally but could not reach the
winner. SNAZZY DRESSER tracked the top pair four wide into the turn, stayed in the path to the stretch, lacked the needed late bid and got edged for the
place. OWNING chased three then two wide around the turn, went between rivals with a furlong to go but could not find more in deep stretch.
UNTHROTTLED dueled from inside to the turn, lost contact with three-eighths remaining and weakened in the drive. ALLEVA raced up close outside the top
pair, chased three wide around the turn and weakened. DEFENSE WINS tracked along the inside to the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SAYIN GRACE went three wide on the first turn, stayed off the rail then three deep on the backstretch, closed in on the far turn, went four deep into the
drive, cleared in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. CONQUEST COBRA went five deep into the first turn, angled down to the three path around
that bend, went between foes on the backstretch, bid between in upper stretch, got outkicked by the winner but gained second. KENZOU'S RHYTHM sped
clear in the two path, set the pace to the far turn, challenged into the lane, overtaken in upper stretch and stayed on to hold save the show. KIDMON
showed early speed from inside, chased inside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, launched a rail bid entering the stretch, could not summon the needed late
kick and missed the show. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT angled in on the first turn, angled off the rail on the final bend and came four wide into the stretch, churned
on through the final furlong but never threatened. CANNES went four wide around the first turn, took the second turn three then four wide and tired.

Footnotes
DOUBLE FANTASY raced in range two wide entering the turn, angled four wide around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch, grabbed the lead at
the three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear and drew away. RATTRAPANTE settled off the pace, raced in the two path into the turn, moved out around the bend
and exited six wide, finished well in the final furlong but had to settle for second best. AADHANA got bumped at the start, went up to duel for command
outside KATIE'S PARADISE, cleared nearing the turn, challenged by BRIGHT N SUNNY around the bend, reliquished control at the three-sixteenth and
flattened to third. WINTER STAR raced between foes early, was crowded and shuffled back into the turn, angled down to the inside around the bend,
steered out late and improved position. BRIGHT N SUNNY broke in and bumped rival, was forwardly placed up the backstretch, bid outside at the
three-eighths pole, fought into the furlong grounds and weakened. KATIE'S PARADISE dueled for the lead from inside, chased the lead into and around the
turn and weakened. BRIO IS AWESOME bumped both sides at the start, chased three wide into the turn, came six wide into the stretch and never
responded to urging. MISTAKA hit the inner side of the stall leaving the gate then bumped rival, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path
and proved no menace. ROSES FOR LIFE raced near the back of the pack early, went six wide around the turn and was not a factor. HALF-MILE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
BOLD VOYAGER traveled four wide around the first turn, raced three deep then off the rail, took aim at the leader on the far turn, challenged at the
five-sixteenths pole, took over near the quarter pole, moved clear and was kept to task to the wire. TIZ VICIOUS set the pace off the rail, pressured a bit on
the backstretch then moved clear again, challenged at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command with a quarter mile remaining and stayed on to secure the
place. BRAVESTONE got bumped hard from outside soon after the start, pulled early on, tracked off the rail, angled in entering the stretch and faltered in
the late stages. MONGOL ALTAI traveled two wide around the first turn, trailed in the early going, moved out on the far turn and came five wide into the
stretch and never threatened. SIROCCO bumped inside rival hard shortly after the start and steadied, came four wide into the stretch, altered course to
avoid rival near the three-sixteenths pole and made no impact. MARINO HEAT was rank early and checked off heels on the first turn, raced between foes
behind the leader then went up between a rival and the pacesetter briefly on the backstretch, dropped back around the far turn and tired. SIR WILLIAMS
DREAM got pinballed between runners and checked early, raced three wide into the far turn, angled to the rail around the bend and came up empty.
CHARMING DANZA traveled along the inside and was done early. INVESTMENT ACCOUNT chased on the inside, put in mild bid past the five-eighths
pole, could not stay with the leader past the seven-sixteenths, continued inside to the stretch, injured in upper stretch and was vanned off.
