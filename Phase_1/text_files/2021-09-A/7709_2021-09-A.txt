response in the drive. THREE FOR THREE trailed the field early then made a late bid to be up for show. FROG WALKER was hustled from the three path
to vie for the lead then gave way. MR PRINCE CHARMING raced wide throughout and was never a factor.

FLO TIME was rushed to the lead and drew clear then drew off in the stretch drive. SUPREME DREAM vied for the lead from the two path then was
steadied going into the turn and was clearly second best. LUNA ROSE chased the leaders while racing evenly and gave a good effort. UNBRIDLED DIXIE
saved ground on the rail and improved position. PRETTY EASY was in the middle of the pack while racing three wide but was never a factor. PERFECT
LILCHARLIE trailed the field and was never a threat.

Footnotes
GOLD NOTE was unhurried early from the two path then slipped through on the turn and angled out at the head of the stretch and closed willingly to be up
for the win. YODELERS WAY set the pace from the inside and was empty in the drive to be caught late. MATRICULATE vied for the lead from the three
path and lacked the late response. NATTYTYME raced in the middle of the pace then made a bid in the stretch and hung. HYPER DRIVE pressed the pace
from the two path and weakened. LOOKING FOR BULL was off slow then steadily advanced to improve his position. RENVYLE was well placed behind the
leaders while racing three wide but failed to menace. MAYHAWK was close up to the leaders early from the two path and retreated. NOW MIND YOU was
allowed to settle made a mild bid on the backstretch but was never a factor.
