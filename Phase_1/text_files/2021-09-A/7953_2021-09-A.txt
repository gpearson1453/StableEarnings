BLACKBERRY LISA broke in the air and bumped at the start, steadily advanced, assumed command three wide on the turn, drew off in the drive and won
handily. WINDI'S MOMENT vied inside to the turn, dropped back and was no match for the winner. MY FUNNY GAL dwelt at the start, raced far back early,
went widest in the drive and finished well to earn show. UH OH SEVEN veered in and bumped at the start, raced outside in an even effort and did not
threaten. HAIL ON HOOFS vied two wide to the turn and gave way. Hand timed.

WAR MAIDEN was sent to the front to set the pace and steadily increased the margin while under urging. OLD WEST was never far back, put in a steady
effort and earned place while no match for the winner. TROPHY CHEST raced mid pack, saved ground and got up for show while no threat to the top two.
COPPER PEG raced outside, lacked a bid and was outrun. STEINWAY was outrun in an even effort. TEA ANA stalked the pace, dropped back on the turn
and gave way. INDIAN HARBOR trailed the field and showed little. Hand timed.

BULLET TIMES lagged early, rallied on the turn, bid willingly to get a head in front near the eighth pole, inched away, was under pressure to the wire and
held on gamely. THE KOHEN pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, continued willingly to the wire and couldn't get by the winner. ROLL OUT was never
far back, bid off the rail leaving the turn, didn't have enough late and settled for show. DENS D ORO was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and
improved position. AGUA DORADO showed good early speed racing along the inside, fell back into the turn and faded. CLEVER EMMA was hustled along
to set the pace, drew clear on the turn and faltered near the eighth pole. JAZZ TOWN stalked the pace, went six wide on the turn, swung wide and gave
way. MARQUE IT UP raced between horses, showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timjed.

Footnotes
ARIZONA MOON stumbled at the start, set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn and extended the lead while kept to task. LOOSE DIAMOND moved up
along the backstretch, pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and was no match for the winner. CAPTAIN RED pressed the pace two wide to the
second turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. RACE HOME raced mid pack in an even effort. OLYMPIC EXPRESS raced close to the pace and
was through after a half. JU JU GUY stalked the pace while racing inside, was through early and gave way. TOP OF THE GAME was not a factor. Hand
timed.

Footnotes
DEVON'S CHOICE pressed the pace, bid willingly, assumed command near the sixteenth pole and drew off. J T'S LA NENA was hustled along to set the
pace to the sixteenth pole, was unable to sustain her bid and finished second best. WITHIN THE LAW bumped at the start, was never far back while racing
inside, shifted out for the drive and closed to earn show. SASHAYING SIS saved ground, bid and came up empty. WITH THATBEINGSAID raced mid pack,
saved ground and lacked a bid. DELIGHTFUL HIPS was not a factor. SUPAH SISTA was outrun. COME ON KAT bumped at the start and failed to contend.
WRIGHT WINGED had brief speed only. OLD TOY was outrun. Hand timed.
