THIRTYSIX G'S unhurried in the early part, moved up around the final turn, rallied down the home stretch and drove clear before the wire. ROCKDALE
sprinted to the front, pulled away, led until deep in the home stretch, lacked a late kick and couldn't hold off the winner. LES PAUL void of early speed, made
a late gain, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. ONE HITTER raced within striking distance, made a bid and hung. LIGHTNING LEE
lacked early speed and passed tired ones. FLAMIN FIRE pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. ARLINGTON'S SHINE raced in the middle
of the pack, weakened and was no factor. ZYZACK pressed the early pace and retreated to the rear. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
MY ALIBI broke in the air, raced from the rear in the beginning, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out, split rivals down the stretch and
proved the best. ZIONICA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the stretch and was caught late. DREAMIT unhurried in the
beginning, racing in the middle of the field, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. EUROROSE raced within striking distance,
made a bid and hung. PRINCESA ANN raced within contention, had an outside trip and lacked a late kick. MERLIN'S SISTER lacked early speed, finished
wide and was never a factor. WIND ZEE sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back. SOCO UNBRIDLED raced
near the back, was rank early and never proved a threat. VERITY JANE raced within contention, made a steady retreat and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND
