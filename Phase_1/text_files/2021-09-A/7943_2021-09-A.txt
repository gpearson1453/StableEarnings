JUSTA DOLL dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then drew out leaving the turn and was kept to right handed
pressure to prove best. DREAMERS DREAM was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, eased out leaving the quarter pole and swung out five wide
for the drive and rallied well to get the place award. SHES MY TREASURE chased the early pace three wide, came into the stretch four wide and had no
kick while besting the rest. PIEDI AMOY was reserved early, came three wide into the drive and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. WICKED
JUSTICE was allowed to settle three wide early, came six wide into the drive and had no rally. OXBOW'S IMAGE dueled for the early lead two wide and
inside of the winner and weakened.

Footnotes
MUSIC TO MY EARS was allowed to settle early while five wide, then made a six wide bid in hand by the quarter pole, drew off smartly under a hand urging
and was wrapped up the final sixteenth to prove much the best. BETTER WATCH OUT was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the inside on
the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and finished willingly but was no match to the winner but clearly second best. MURDO was allowed to settle
and advanced three wide on the turn, angled in around the three sixteenths pole but flattened out while besting the rest. GAMERA was void of early speed,
angled out in the stretch to pass the tiring rivals. PASS THE BISCUITS set the pace while clear on the inside and gave way. ARTEGON stalked the early
pace three to four wide and came six wide into the drive and was empty. UNCLE MOMO stalked the pace three to four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
ALTMEISTER was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace three to four wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and
edged clear in the stretch to prove best under a drive. PERSEVERING pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and kept on willingly to
the wire but was outfinished by the winner, second best. LIGHTNING ROD CARL was well rated while saving ground, tipped out three wide for the drive but
needed more in the drive. DECEIVER was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive and had no rally. INDIAN SPRINGS set the pace on the
inside and weakened the final quarter of a mile. SOUTHERN RAGS was reserved early and was four wide on the backstretch, then was six wide by the
quarter pole and lacked a rally. MR. SLATE was reserved early, then was five wide by the quarter pole and lacked a late response. CARNARVON was
taken back early and saved ground but failed to respond.

TUANIS was allowed to settle early towards the inside, eased out leaving the half mile marker, made a five wide move on the turn, continued that move in
the drive to close well to get up in time under a drive. UNPREDICTABLE BAY was four wide into the first turn, then was rated three to four wide on the
backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn and was clear by the furlong marker but was caught late to just miss. ACTUATOR was off slowly, then was
sent up five to six wide on the first turn, then made a five wide middle move to take over leaving the half mile marker and set the pace on the inside on the
far turn, then faded in the drive while staying on for the show award. MATTHEWSTHIRTYFOUR was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the
far turn to be in contention leaving the turn, but raced greenly in the stretch while flattening out. JUG ROCK was reserved early, came five wide into the
drive and offered a belated rally. STOP THE SPREAD stalked the pace three wide and weakened. MOTION TO ADJOURN chased the pace on the inside
and weakened. BARSTOW was void of early speed and was not a threat. BENEVOLENT AUSTIN was not a factor. ON SPOT was through after a half mile.

under a drive. VILLAREGGIA chased the early pace four wide, came five wide into the drive and finished gamely for the place award while no match to the
winner. TEN AT TWELVE pressed the early pace three wide, then was bumped by the three eighths pole, then faded while being outfinished for the place
award, bested rest. HALAGA chased the early pace two to three wide and was in between horses on the turn, finished evenly in the stretch for the minor
rewards. WICKED ECSTASY was bumped at the start, chased the pace three to four wide and offered no rally. MISS DIAL chased the early pace on the
inside, tried to ease out on the turn and came three wide into the drive but lacked a rally. CARDIGAN set a pressured pace two wide and then on the inside
on the turn and weakened. HONEST INTENTIONS was five to six wide and offered no response.

Footnotes
AMAZING GAL was sent to the lead to set the pace on the inside, was well handled on the front end, then was headed by the furlong marker and dug in
gamely to hold on under a drive. GIVEUSTHISDAY was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the turn, continued that move in the stretch to go
on even terms for the lead but was outfinished late, hung. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was bumped at the start, then was rated two to three wide down the
backstretch, then lacked room on the turn and swung out six wide for the drive to offer a late rally. TOO CROWDED was reserved early, then made a six
wide move on the turn, but needed more in the drive. VALSHEBA was settled back early on the inside, swung out widest for the drive and had a belated
rally. TWILIGHT MAGIC was reserved early, made s even wide move on the turn but flattened out. BACKHAND was settled back early, then was six wide
on the turn and had to take up on heels and check by the quarter pole and had no late rally. DANCE MONEY was four wide into the first turn, chased the
pace three to four wide and weakened. MISS DEPUTY STAR was rated on the inside and weakened. SLEEPY DREAM was rank on the first turn and
stalked the pace three wide then folded. THERE WAS NO CHANGE AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN ON THE FAR TURN.

Footnotes
ROCKIN JUSTICE was five wide into the first turn, then had a five to six wide pursuit down the backstretch, then bumped ALTERED keeping that rival in at
the three eighths pole, then advanced five wide on the turn, closed well in the stretch, drifted out under left handed crop urging leaving the furlong marker,
then was corrected with a couple right handed pops with the riding crop, then surged late to get up in time to prove best. PRESTO BENCH was bumped at
the start, then was five wide on the first turn, then advanced six wide on the turn to move into contention, then was floated out leaving the furlong marker,
then closed with a rush late gaining the place award and just missing the win, good effort. ALTERED was looking for a spot to settle early, checked at the
five eighths pole, then eased out for racing room but was bumped soundly and kept in by ROCKIN JUSTICE at the three eighths pole, made a four wide
move on the turn to move into contention, then continued that bid leaving the turn, gained a short lead leaving the sixteenth pole but was caught late.
INDIGO RICH set the early pace while racing in the three path, then was pressured from the inside by the half mile marker, then shook clear again on the
turn and moved to the inside, then still maintained the advantage by the furlong marker and gave way grudgingly late. GOT LOST was settled while four
wide five wide down the backstretch, made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened in the drive. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE was settled early on the
inside and made a mild bid on the inside on the turn but was empty in the drive. AMAZING JUSTICE passed the tiring rivals. CATCH THE SPARROW was
bumped at the start, failed to menace. JUST DIG IT tracked the early pace and then went up to press the pace on the inside at the half mile marker and then
tired. WHITE SILVER SANDS chased the pace three wide down the backstretch and tired. ONE FOR THE MONEY was four wide into the first turn and was
not a factor. CANDELIVER chased the early pace five wide and stopped.
