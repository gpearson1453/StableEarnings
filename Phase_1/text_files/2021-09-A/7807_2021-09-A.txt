steadily. ORACABESSA lacked speed and was never in contention. WISEMAN'S SECRET was urged close up between rivals early then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BEAST OR FAMINE advanced outside on the turn collaring the leaders then drew away in the stretch driving. DON GIUSEPPE earned a narrow advantage
between rivals and held well for the place. VINE JET dueled along the rail, was in tight through the final furlong, altered course and bobbled near the
sixteenth pole. BRINDISI lacked speed then offered some late energy. KENNER forced the pace down the backstretch then began tiring on the turn.
SOUTHERN RUNNER was in tight between rivals into the far turn and faltered. DOWNTOWNCHALYBROWN broke awkwardly, rallied very wide on the
turn and was no factor. DANGNABBIT was urged close up through the opening quarter then gave way readily. AYE broke sluggishly and was always
outrun. INSTANT CHAOS broke sluggishly and trailed throughout.

BOLD CONFECTION stalked the pace outside, bid strongly on the turn, eagerly drew off and was geared down the final sixteenth. GIA'S FUEGO stumbled
badly at the start, steadied soon after, rallied outside then inside in the stretch and closed well. AMERICAN BASTET chased three wide and continued well
while no threat. EIGHT DANZAS trailed early, advanced wide with late energy. FINEST WORK forced the pace, led briefly on the turn, was collared by the
winner and faded. SHAHAADA hesitated at the start, dropped back on the turn and was no factor. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS saved ground off the leaders and
weakened. NYSSA dueled along the inside and began stopping on the turn. DISCO DAISY rushed to contention down the backstretch and gave way.

FLASHING DIAMOND moved eagerly three wide on the turn then drew away under moderate urging. BUCKS SOME settled off the pace inside then split
foes rallying late. LOVE ON FIRE chased wide off the leaders, moved very wide into the stretch rallying. ALWAYS TALKING hustled to the front inside, was
collared and weakened slightly. CHARITY STRIPE dropped back in the opening quarter then showed late energy. LE PETITE PAPILLON prompted the
pace outside for half a mile and faltered. GYPSY JANIE raced wide and lacked a rally. HEROIC OFFICER lacked speed and was never in contention. LADY
MUNNINGS rated inside the dueling leaders and gave way. MORISSETTE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

coaxing. PACIFIC GALE taken under hold early, advanced three wide on the turn, continued willingly but proved no match to the winner. REGAL RETORT
settled between rivals down the backstretch and lacked a rally. GLORY DIA reserved off the pace inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out into the
stretch but lacked a bid. B B'S ROCKET moved easily to the front inside, was collared into the far turn and gave way..

SWEET WILLEMINA angled out into the first turn, stalked the leader in hand, took over when ready on the final turn and quickly pulled away while ridden
out. B B'S BUSTED reserved off the pace inside, rallied to be easily second best while no threat to the winner. TIC TIC TIC BOOM dropped well behind,
advanced wide and was just up for third in a head bob. QUIET COMPANY settled three wide off the pace, rallied on the final turn then flattened out. BLUE
SHINE easily moved to a clear advantage then was finished on the final turn. MISQUILLO saved ground and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
STORMBEAM lacked speed, angled inside on the turn, remained on rail and drew away in the final furlong. CREATE A STORY settled outside, rallied into
the stretch to get up for the place. MAD MARY chased between rivals and continued willingly. REIGNING FIRE drifted in soon after the start, raced outside
with a mild bid. HARBOUR WAY lacked speed, raced outside and was no factor. CREEDIBILITY lunged at the start then passed rivals without menacing.
CHECOTAH vied outside, led into the stretch then faltered. KARABESSA dueled along the inside and faded after half a mile. BIG RED SEVEN broke in a
complete tangle losing any chance. BALTIMORE BEAUTY saved ground and gave way readily. TRUE UPGRADE clipped heels soon after the start and fell.
Following a stewards inquiry, REIGNING FIRE was disqualified and placed last for interference soon after the start.
