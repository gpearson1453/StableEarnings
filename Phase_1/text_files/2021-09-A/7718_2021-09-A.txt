SMOOTH JUSTICE set the early pace while racing off the rail, then shook clear by the quarter pole and moved to the inside, then remained clear by the
furlong marker, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. ALLIE MAES REVENGE was allowed to settle towards the inside, came into the stretch two
wide and angled out by the furlong marker and closed well late. JUSTA DOLL prompted the early pace three wide and came into the drive four wide and
continued on willingly but needed more late. SUMMER HOME was well placed early on the inside, tipped out two to three wide by the three sixteenths pole
but had no kick. WICKED JUSTICE was reserved early, came five wide into the drive and offered no rally. DREAMERS DREAM tracked the pace four wide
and weakened. UNFORGETABLENATALY was bumped at the start, then failed to menace.

Footnotes
MISS SUGARBAKER stalked the early pace five wide, made a four wide move on the turn and took over leaving the turn and drew clear by the furlong
marker, then drew out to prove much the best under a drive. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL dueled for the early lead in between horses, then made a bid to set a
pressured pace and move over towards the rail by the quarter pole, stayed on to save the place award while no match for the winner. TAPPIN INTO
SUMMER was bumped soundly at the start, then raced on the inside and was boxed behind horses on the turn, moved out leaving the quarter pole and
came four wide into the drive and finished well to just miss the place award. SWEET SKY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid but weakened
in the drive. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE was reserved early, then was three wide by the quarter pole while starting his bid, then offered a belated rally.
THUNDERSTRUCK was fractious in the gate, then broke outwardly and bumped a foe, then was settled on the inside, eased out on the turn and came six
wide into the drive, offered no serious rally. MISS INHOFE was settled back early, then was two wide by the quarter pole and lacked a rally. TEENER was
fractious in the gate, then failed to menace. BLAZING FIREFLIES dueled for the lead on the inside and faltered.
