Footnotes
OUR LUCKY MAN raced close up on the inside, then between rivals, was in tight and forced to check sharply midway on the far turn, then rallied on the rail,
dueled with SUPER SHOES in the final furlong, dug in gamely along the rail, exchanged bumps with that rival, battled to the wire and prevailed
determinedly. SUPER SHOES bobbled at the break and was steadied, tracked close up on the inside, made a rail bid in tight quarters on the far turn, dueled
with OUR LUCKY MAN in the final furlong, bumped with that rival and dug in gamely to the finish. POSTINO'S STORY raced three wide early, then stalked
two wide, bid four wide on the far turn, dueled, then dug in gamely outside rivals in the stretch run. D TACHYON stalked three wide, chased outside rivals on
the far turn and tired. UNCLE SKEETS set the pace on the inside, dueled three wide on the far turn, then steadied between rivals at the quarter pole and
tired. NITTANY LION did not factor. After a Stewards' Inquiry, along with Jockey Objections by SUPER SHOES against the winner and UNCLE SKEETS
against SUPER SHOES, the race was declared official.
