Footnotes
AUBRIETA stalked early, closed two-wide late turn, bid just into the final furlong, drove clear near mid stretch and finished under a hand ride. MARIE
MACKAY led quickly, set a reserved pace, was headed in the final furlong and held place. SPOOKY SPICE was sent to the fore in the early stages, forced
the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn then chased gamely in vain. KANTA stalked the early pace, was steadied on the turn, chased two
and three-wide to the stretch and finished under a determined drive. DISTORTED SUCCESS ducked out leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled
angling from two to four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. VERI UNIFIED settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide late turn then flattened
out at the top of the stretch. SPICE IN YUH LIFE settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
ADMIRING had early speed and moved to the rail, set a pressured pace, drew away in the stretch and for the most party was under a hand ride. MIDNIGHT
CHOIR stalked the pace, chased hard two and three-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. LADY MOONSHINE was rated at the rear
early, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the final turn, rallied, but was outfinished for place. KARAKONTIEPARADISE settled off the pace, closed
two and three-wide on the far turn, finished gamely but failed to menace. RECIPROCAL forced the pace on the backstretch, chased two-wide late turn but
evened out in the stretch. GWEN settled off the pace, chased from the rail on the far turn but never reached contention. SUNDAR pressed the pace into the
backstretch, dropped back near the far turn and lacked a rally. ITSKATHIESLUCKYDAY stalked the pace from the rail, was hustled on the far turn, suffered
an injury near the sixteenth pole, did not finish and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CLEOMENES stalked the pace, came three then two-wide through the turn, challenged in the final furlong, battled, and prevailed late under a drive. GREEN
GABLES set a pressured pace, shook clear on the turn, held her rivals safe to the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. SHES THE NORTH forced the
pace, stalked on the turn, launched her bid upper stretch, was determined but could not draw even with the leader, angled off the rail a 16th out, closed
gamely but ran out of real estate. UMNEYAAT raced in mid pack, closed three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. SPIN THAT
TUNE raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied. TAQUANYAH raced in mid pack, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn, encountered traffic upper stretch and did not menace. ASHBURY broke outward and settled off the pace, trailed to
the stretch, ran into traffic mid stretch, got clear and finished gamely in vain. CON THIEN pressed the early pace, settled in striking range, chased into the
stretch but evened out late. MOMMA CARRIE away slowly, saved ground, chased three to five-wide on the turn, was lugging in upper stretch and was not a
threat. PRINCESS LANNISTER steadied at the start, settled off the pace, was hustled into the stretch then leveled out in the final furlong. SHEZ A SEALY
raced in mid pack, came two and three-wide on the turn, was in range at the top of the stretch but tired a 16th out. GOLD FORESTER broke inward, settled
in mid pack, ran into traffic upper stretch and flattened out.

Footnotes
UNION COLONEL set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook off the challengers and stalkers in upper stretch and opened up a clear advantage, kept to
his task in the final furlong under vigorous handling. REGAL INTENT chased the two leaders between rivals until turning for home, followed the winner's
path to look dangerous in midstretch but couldn't match the energy of the victor, ridden hard to maintain the place spot. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) off the pace
and along the rail, came inside to three wide late on the turn and tipped into the five path coming home, closing resolutely outside but unable to get to the
top pair. BEST AND FINAL chased along the inside, was still in behind the winner turning for home but was outkicked down the lane and could only garner a
minor award. SILENT FIRE was three wide stalking the pacesetters, loomed outside that pair turning for home but his bid stalled in the final furlong. STEEL
WOOL brushed the gate and bumped a rival a few jumps after the start, stayed inside in midpack on the turn and tipped out in upper stretch but his bid
levelled off in the final sixteenth. MILWAUKEE FIBOLT off the pace early, came into midpack two to four wide on the bend and came out in the five path into
the lane but his mild run was mitigated by his laying in tendencies. VERRAZANO NARROWS stalked and pressed the winner throughout, dropping back
and fading in the final three sixteenths. CARROBIO off the pace and had two stragglers beaten on the turn, never reaching contention. MR. MAGICAL broke
slow, near the rear and drifting out on the turn, never entering the fray. DOC FISHMAN broke out at the start and trailed throughout.

NOT SO QUIET raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn turn, cut to the rail upper stretch, rallied, and swept by the leader in the late
stages. ROCKCREST set the pace, rode the rail on the turn, was under steady handling in the stretch but failed to contain the winner. CITY BOY settled in
mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn and was all out in the stretch. SOUPER HOT, in range, chased four-wide late turn then rallied gamely,
but late. CELEBRATORY stalked the pace, chased three then two-wide into the stretch then leveled off in the late stages. FORESTER'S FORTUNE settled
off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn then rallied outside. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS raced early in mid pack then settled off the pace, came along
the rail and two-wide through the turn and chased through the stretch. ALACRITOUS stalked the pace along the rail, dropped back late turn and lacked a
rally.

FROSTED OVER was away alertly, stalked the pace from the rail, bid a 16th out and prevailed under a drive. FINALIST broke outward but quickly gained a
short lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the far turn then gave way grudgingly in the stretch. HOLYFIELD settled off the pace, closed two and
three-wide on the far turn, pressed the pace to the stretch and was under a determined drive through the stretch. BODE'S TIPSY forced the pace, closed
late turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SOUPER WATSON stalked early, chased two and three-wide from mid pack on the far turn, angled
out in the stretch and finished gamely. UNILATERAL settled off the pace, chased hard three-wide on the far turn then rallied from the outside. BROADWAY
raced off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, chased, but evened out late.

Footnotes
CARELESS HEIRESS set a pressured pace, shook clear into the turn then held sway under a drive. TENPENNY NAIL raced in mid pack, closed two-wide
to the rail on the turn, rallied along the fence and gained steadily. FIONNUALA broke inward and settled in mid pack, closed two-wide late turn, angled out in
the stretch and closed gamely. I'M NOT PERFECT, in touch with the leaders, came three-wide through the turn, launched a determined stretch drive but
evened out late. BOSSKAYE raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied gamely but leveled out in the late
stages. BILLYJANE hopped out of the gate, raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from three to five-wide on the turn then tendered a mild rally. SILVER
HEIGHTS broke outward, settled in striking range, was hustled five-wide through the turn but evened out in deep stretch. JOLIE DAVINA bumped with
GOSPEL HILL and was pinched back leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide to the rail on the turn but failed to menace. GOSPEL
HILL, bumped leaving the gate, briefly forced the pace then was taken back and stalked, closed into the stretch but her rally stalled. MELROSE STAR got
away slowly and raced from off the pace, dropped back under a drive nearing the turn and lacked a rally. SILENZIO bobbled leaving, showed speed and
forced the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong. GOLDEN WORLD, in range, dropped back along the rail
entering the turn, was hustled along but lacked a rally.
