Footnotes
GOOD VERSES EVIL was away in good order to duel for the lead with COASTAL WONDER while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, veered out into the lane, was quickly straightened away and drew off with complete authority. MILORDS OATHKEEPER was bumped
at the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was up for the place. AWEZEE lagged early, saved
ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a late bid. COASTAL CAT was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. COASTAL WONDER was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened through the
final furlong. HAVARTI GOLD was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MR BINGLEY lacked early foot, angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. REIGN ON (GB)
lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. COOL EDGE showed brief speed and weakened. DOCTOR BRUCE S. lacked early
foot, steadied nearing the three-eighths marker, angled out in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid.

DEEPINGREEN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the
closing yards. FATS DOMINUS was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner from over the top. ROCKET POWER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and finished with a steady bid. BENNY THE JET chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further into the stretch and gave way.
GUARDINGTHEMONEY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. ONE TUFF MINISTER lagged early, saved
ground through the second turn and was not a factor. SALTY MINNOW raced five-wide through the first turn while being unhurried early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and was eased through the lane.

SMASHING SUCCESS raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and wore down the two foes in the final
yards to be clear late. KISSABLE U was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the stretch but
could not resist the winner late. SAPPHIRE SILK sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. IF YOU
WANT IT showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. RAELEE raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the second turn and weakened. SASSY EDIE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
COBRA JET broke sharply to to press the pace of A VIEW FROM ABOVE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened
a clear margin into the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task. DIAMOND WILLOW was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was clearly second best. A VIEW FROM ABOVE was bumped at the break, set a pressured pace from the
inside and gave away to the winner after gong a half. BIG PAPER DADDY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished
evenly in the drive. HICKORY WIND lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NEUMEISTER was bumped at the start,
showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid.

DAFFODIL SWEET was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore into the lane, drew clear and held

late energy. GALILETA sprinted clear at once, saved ground through the turn and gave way through the final furlong. JACANA settled off the leaders from
the inside and failed to rally. KILLARNEY LASS chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. SHEZA DELIGHT lagged
early, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
