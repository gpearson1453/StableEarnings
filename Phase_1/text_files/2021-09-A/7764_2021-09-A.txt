Footnotes
MISSISSIPPI MUSIC broke just a bit awkwardly, was coaxed forward to vie for the lead inside a foe, edged clear in the two path on the turn, was well clear
turning for home and lasted while being kept to the task. F S POSITRACK settled off the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, was gaining but too late.
SMOOTH BLUES angled in to the rail past the three-eighths, saved ground on the turn, could make no headway in the lane. KEY TO THE CITY saved
ground on or just off the rail on the turn racing at the back, ran on mildly. MICKEYS GOLD broke just a half-step slowly, was encouraged along but lacking
early speed, moved out from two to five wide on the turn and was not a threat. KABULL vied outside early, dropped back three wide on the turn and
continued to weaken.

Footnotes
CAUGHT STEALING pressed from outside, took the lead past the five-sixteenths going three wide on the turn, was shaken up at the head of the lane and
drew off under moderate hand urging. VALLEY VERDE broke out just a bit, moved through to set the pace on a narrow lead with foes inside and out, dueled
inside a foe but in the two path into the turn, was no match but held second. TEXANA broke out just a bit, was in the two path heading into the turn but
brushed lightly with a rival inside about the three-eighths, ran on or just off the rail through that bend before coming out three wide turning for home, got
show honors. SEVENTH HENNESSY broke quite awkwardly then soon angled sharply to the inside, tried to sneak up the rail inside a rival leaving the
backstretch but brushed lightly and had to steady slightly at that juncture, continued to save ground on the rail through the turn and ran on well late. TEE
SHOT DOLLY was bumped lightly at the start but recovered to show brief speed inside, eased back and tracked the leading pair two to three wide through
the turn, had no extra for the drive. SPECIAL PRIDE bumped the outer rival at the start, went three to four wide on the turn racing well back and failed to
menace. OUR ISLAND GIRL was bumped at the start, went four to five wide on the turn and was not a threat. SMOOTH FIREWATER bumped a foe and
steadied at the start, shifted out and was mildly coaxed forward outside to gain position up the backstretch, dropped back five to six wide on the turn and
came up empty.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF HOLLYWOOD was forced in at the start then coaxed forward to take a narrow lead after the opening furlong, edged clear in the two path into
the turn, held sway under steady handling. INDIAN SECRET settled in behind the leaders, moved in from three to two wide on the turn, was within range but
could make no headway late. FEISTY HALO settled mid-pack along the inside, came off the fence late on the turn, angled out in mid-stretch then drifted
from a left-handed use of the crop which was thereupon halted, straightened out and ran on well. THE PACESETTER broke inwardly, settled off the leaders
two wide into the turn, moved out five wide by the latter part of that bend and had no rally. CLUBHOUSE PARTY set the early pace for a furlong, continued
to chase going four wide, came up empty. SWINGIN DOORS was toward the rear racing outside, went five to seven wide on the turn and was not a threat.
SPEED SEAL was placed in tight quarters at the start then taken to the inside, came back out heading up the backstretch, moved out further from two to
four wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

COURAGE N ORDER settled at the rear, went two wide on the turn, asked for run at the quarter pole, struck the lead making an inside bid past the
three-sixteenths, drew clear in the stretch. HUSTLE UP moved forward soon after the start to set the terms racing off the inside, went in the three path on
the turn, was no match but second best. FRANCHISE TAGGED pressed the pace going three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. NO PASA NADA
stalked from outside going five to six wide on the turn and weakened. DIABOLICAL RULER attended from between runners early, went four to five wide on
the turn, faded in the lane. HESA PROSPECTOR was ridden along inside, tired. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED BUT
FRACTIONAL SPLITS PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY.

CLOSING TIME CUTIE was prominent early, allowed the leader to go on with it and stalked while switching out, advanced three to four wide leaving the
turn, dueled briefly in upper stretch and edged clear late under steady handling. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE settled last but one, went about three wide on
the turn, moved in a bit to gain mildly up the inside and get up for place. BISCUIT'S DREAM set the early tempo from outside, edged clear leaving the
backstretch racing just off the inside, weakened grudgingly in the lane. HIGH ON LIFE broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground but did not threaten. FLAMING
BESITOS was mid-pack early, went two to three wide on the turn and faded.
