ALMOST A STORM pressed from outside, moved clear three wide on the turn, extended the advantage into upper stretch, just held. LOVER BOY BOB
settled toward the back having angled in, saved ground on then just off the rail on the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch, was gaining fast but missed.
DIXIELAND DELIGHT shifted well off the inside early, moved back in heading to the turn to be two wide then on the rail, came out in the stretch and ran on.
TUCKER D angled to the rail entering the turn to vie inside a foe, weakened. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT moved out from four to seven wide on the turn, ran on
evenly. LEADING PROSPECT shifted in up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, ran evenly. SONG OF LAURA exchanged a bump at the start, was
forced out leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the turn, weakened. BACK SEAT HERO was bumped at the break, veered out and brushed a foe
about the seven-sixteenths as a rival moved to the rail in front, went three wide on the turn, came up empty. TRUST THE VAN exchanged a bump at the
break, went five wide on the turn, was not a threat. SCOTTY WHO was fractious in the gate, bumped a rival at the start, was forced out and steadied about
the seven-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, faded.

TIGHT FITTIN JEANS set the pace from off the rail in the three then two path on the turn, was clear into the stretch and held safe. LET IT ROLL exchanged
a bump at the start, moved out from two to five wide on the turn, came into upper stretch eight deep, gained the place. PEGGY B FAST attempted to move
nearer the rail but had a rival inside late up the backstretch and tapped on the brakes at that juncture, moved out from two to four wide on the turn while
losing ground on the leader but kept on in the lane to regain position. SHORT POCKETS settled last but one, went five to seven wide on the turn, shifted in
and drifted a bit in the stretch but ran on mildly. SEXY BIKINI MODEL angled out heading up the backstretch after previously having been moved in, went
three then four wide on the turn, was within striking distance turning for home but flattened out. SHUGS CHARLIE tracked from inside, saved ground on the
turn, weakened. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY trailed early, went three to four wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch. FLIGHT SONG exchanged a bump at
the break, switched out to enter the turn three wide moving out six deep on that bend, tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
THIRSTY JUNIOR tracked from inside on or just off the rail, came out in upper stretch, took aim and got up late under steady urging. SALTIE FIRE set the
pace racing just off the rail, was clear on the turn into upper stretch but caught late. LITIGATOR pressed early then chased from outside going three to four
wide on the turn and coming out a bit turning for home, ran evenly in the lane. SUNLAND STAR chased from outside mid-pack going four to five wide on the
turn, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and ran on. WINDBREAK raced in the back half of the field going two to three wide on the turn, altered out a bit in
mid-stretch. MR. FEARLESS was outside foes well back, went four to five wide on the turn, failed to threaten. BULLY RIDE broke a half step slowly, angled
in, saved ground early on the turn, shifted four wide coming to the five-sixteenths, altered course outside a rival in mid- to late-stretch.
