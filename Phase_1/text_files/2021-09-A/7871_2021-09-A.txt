SUPER LEGS outrun for five furlongs toward the inside, began to move far turn, asked midway on the second turn, closer then waited briefly late in the final
turn, split foes into the stretch, took command and drew well clear under steady handling. COSTA SUGAR last away, raced four wide into the first turn,
continued outside, came five wide into the lane when advancing, lodged a bid while remaining widest past the furlong marker, proved no match for the
winner to the wire, held sway for the place. IZEONPOINT within striking distance off the inside, ranged up to challenge four wide into the stretch, vied briefly
upper stretch then flattened out. CAUGHT HIS EYE chased the leader for five eighths, moved to challenge in the two path second turn, weakened in the
drive. SAY YES AGAIN broke in good order, cleared before a quarter, set the pace onto and up the backstretch, briefly responded when confronted in the
final turn then gave way when headed. SWEET MILAGROS broke on top, raced within striking distance early, began a steady fade before a half. OPENING
QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
DOBBY SUE broke with the leaders, fell back to stalk the pace off the inside, came four wide into the stretch when advancing, outside bid past the furlong
marker, well clear under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. IAM DAKOTA bothered, steadied just after the start, remained back for three furlongs, came
four wide out of the turn, staged a willingly rally while also well out in the strip to be clearly second best, no threat to the winner. ELLIE'S A WILDCAT
forwardly placed along the inside in the run up the backstretch, vied along the rail through the turn, raced on equal terms with the winner nearing midstretch,
began to weaken and proved no match for that rival or the runner up the final sixteenth. TAP THE CAT broke back,, moved to the inside, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals. REMI'S ROSE came out just after the break, was straightened to narrowly set the pace in the two path, vied between rivals through the turn,
gave way in the drive. MISS LINDA LOU pressed the issue from the three path for three furlongs and stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
HAVINFUNYET unhurried early while saving some ground, moved closer late backstretch, traffic far turn, patiently handled, eased out three wide for the
drive, rallied from between rivals past the furlong marker and finished with good resolve to prove best. POOPSIE DOOPSIE settled off the pace and the
inside, also encountered some traffic in the second bend, moved out to be widest for the drive, late rally to be up in time for the place while slowing getting
to the winner. RUBY SIOUX in the second flight off the inside, closer four wide exiting the final turn, bid, put a head in front past the furlong marker,
outkicked late between the top two, comfortably clear of the others. CRIMSON FELINE chased the leader while saving ground, continued inside, lodged a
brief rail bid past the furlong marker, flattened out late. SAND DRIFT broke alertly, cleared early, set all the pace, faltered when confronted the final furlong.
QUEEN OF CARNIVAL last away, trailed, came five wide into the straight, lacked a closing response. KICK N KISS in the second flight while outside early,
closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TALE OF A STORM broke on top, dueled early inside, shook clear exiting the turn, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept to task with a right
handed crop. REPLETE bobbled at the break, raced back, three wide into the lane, rallied for the place while between horses at the wire, not a serious
threat to the winner. HE'S A BOMB within striking distance off the inside, three wide into the lane when moving slightly closer, lacked a closing punch to be
outkicked for the second spot. DREWZANO one paced behind the first flight, in some traffic late in the turn, continued evenly through the stretch when clear.
JACKMAN lacked early foot, four wide into the stretch, failed to muster a meaningful rally while remaining well out in the strip. PARLAY PETE dueled early
outside the winner, chased that one through the turn, staged a steady retreat down the lane.

Footnotes
JAKE THE BAND MAN raced in mid pack off the inside for three furlongs, raced in some traffic late in the turn, came four wide into the lane, steered out
slightly when beginning to mount a run the final furlong, late surge, floated out by the leader in the waning strides, just up while bumping with that same rival
at the wire. TOUGH CHARLIE off the leaders outside, four to five wide turn, angled in while rallying to wrest control past the furlong marker, drifted out late
bothering the winner then bumped with that foe at the wire to be caught. HOORAY AUSTIN last away, moved up toward the inside, shifted out a bit and
lodged a brief bid between horses past the furlong marker, could not match the top two late, clear of the rest. O'L RED pressed the issue early off the inside,
challenged in t he turn, fell back upper stretch, went evenly in the late going to maintain position. CLEVER RACER lacked early foot, improved slightly down
the lane with some belated interest. GALAXY BUILDER broke back, void of speed, failed to menace while picking off a couple of tiring rivals. REECE'S
PRIORITY moved up to set the pace along the inside for three furlongs and began to back up. CHASIN GRACIE bumped at the start, raced back, got out
turning for home and remained back. ROYAL BERTRANDO bumped with CHASIN GRACIE at the break, quickly recovered to contest the issue early then
began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
ARKANSAS BLING broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, dueled through the turn while remaining closest to the rail, shook off that rival
to be clear upper stretch, drifted out a bit past the furlong marker, enough left late to withstand the runner up. PERFECT PEACH forwardly placed in the run
up the backstretch, lost a bit of position in the turn while saving ground, challenged the winner along the rail late, not enough, clear of the others. MISS
INVADER in mid pack early toward the inside, race in the two path through the turn, came three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to be well clear of the
rest. BEAR TOOTH PASS in the main group while racing outside, came five wide into the stretch, brushed with MAVE RUNNER entering the stretch, went
evenly to the wire. MY LITTLE DIVA broke with the field, outside, five wide into the lane, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. MAVE RUNNER
within striking distance early, four wide, brushed exiting the turn, weakened. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL pressed the issue early, dueled through the turn
outside the winner, faltered in the drive. SANDY'S WAGER broke back and was never a factor. CRYPTO BRAVE was also always outrun.

Footnotes
PARROT HEAD tracked the leaders while toward the inside, moved out a bit and came four wide when under the whip turning for home, bothered by a
drifting MAJESTIC SIGN approaching the furlong marker, bid soon after, dug in late to prove best in determined fashion. JACI'S ROYALTY lacked early foot
off the rail, continued outside second turn, five wide and outside the winner turning for home, came in with less than a furlong remaining, challenged,
outkicked at the wire. METROPOL settled off the pace, three wide into the far turn, staged a mild rally to gain the show, not a serious threat to the top two
late. MAJESTIC SIGN chased the early leader, joined that one onto the backstretch, dueled past the half mile mark and into the far turn, showed the way
into the stretch, drifted out nearing midstretch and began to weaken. PERFECT STAR settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. DREWCITABLE
in tight at the start, saved some ground when trailing, lacked a closing response stretch. SPEEDY FELLAR broke on top, showed the way first turn, dueled
middle half, gave way in the drive. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF JACI'S ROYALTY AGAINST THE WINNER WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
OPPS MY BAD stalked the leaders up the backstretch off the inside, steered out and came four wide into the lane when moving to challenge, bumped twice
by SWEET PRAYERS when dueling with that one past the furlong marker, kicked clear under steady handling. SWEET PRAYERS broke well, showed the
way out of the chute, continued to set the pace into the turn, dueled nearing the furlong marker inside the winner, came out to bump that one twice with a
furlong remaining, could not keep pace with that same foe late, clearly second best. ONETWOMANYROCKETS off a step slow, void of speed, swung five
wide when advancing turning for home to lose ground, mild late interest to be up for the show late, no threat to the top pair. OLD FASHION AMOUR
pressed the runner up in the two path, could not keep up with that one or the runner up when straightened for home, weakened, caught late for the show.
MAW MAW'S SOPHIA pressed the issue three wide for five furlongs and also faltered through the lane. FOURSWEETNIECES popped stall doors prior to
the break, stumbled badly at the start and trailed throughout toward the inside.

Footnotes
OH MY OH tracked the pace while racing toward the inside, moved a bit closer behind traffic turning for home, clear past the furlong marker, engaged the
leader a sixteenth out and wore that rival down. VELVET ISLE missed a slight beat at the start, recovered to be clear before exiting the chute, continued top
maintain daylight into and through the turn, stayed clear past midstretch, responded when confronted by the winner from the outside late, gave ground
grudgingly to that rival, clear for the place. SISTEROFTHEMOON forwardly placed while racing three wide, continued to force the issue into the lane while
between rivals, lacked a closing punch to finish best of the rest. RUNNING ROSADO void of early foot, loomed a threat with a four wide move late in the
turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. BE A BANDIT closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch, moved out a bit and move closer in
the two path late in the turn, also lacked a further advance in the run to the wire. CLOCKED IN TYME was finished early. MALARTACH last away, was also
never involved.
