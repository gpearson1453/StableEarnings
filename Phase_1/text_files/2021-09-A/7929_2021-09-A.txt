JENNSTONE was well rated and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then had a long drive with the pace setter and wore down that rival late to
get up under a drive. BABY VINCENT set a pressured pace early while racing off the rail, then shook clear on the turn, then had a long drive and dug in but
was denied late. GOOD SUGAR tracked the early pace and made a inside bid in the drive to be gaining late but needed more. OVERJOY was bumped at
the start, then was five wide by the quarter pole and offered no rally. GOLD BUCKLE was allowed to settle early, then was four wide by the quarter pole,
angled in leaving the turn and had no rally. HICKORY HIGH pressed the early pace four wide and weakened.

FIRESIDE KITTEN was reserved early, made as inside move on the turn, then had to check hard leaving the quarter pole, then tipped out to make a two
wide bid leaving the turn to draw clear, then was kept to a mild drive to draw out to prove much the best. BERNADETTE THE JET vied for the early lead
then rated off to stalked the pace three to four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner in the drive while second
best. DANCE RECITAL was allowed to settle early, then made a four to five wide move on the turn, then was along for the show award in the drive. BE
PATIENT vied for the early lead then dueled for the lead on the inside to the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE pressed
the early pace and made a three wide bid to duel for the lead to the quarter pole and weakened. GOOD PENNY was allowed to settle early, advanced on
the backstretch then was on the inside on the turn and checked to avoid spill and tired. BREONNA chased the early pace four wide and weakened, jumped
over spill leaving the quarter pole causing the rider to almost fall off, then was eased to the wire. MACHINE GUN MERRY was allowed to settle early, made
a three to four wide bid on the turn in between rivals, then checked around spill leaving the quarter pole, losing all chance and was just eased to the wire.
LEMON ROSES was void of early speed, then went very wide to avoid spill around the quarter pole, not a factor. ZOIKES (FR) was well rated early, then
made a bid between horses on the turn and clipped heels leaving the quarter pole and fell. vanned off. THERE WAS A STEWRDS INQUIRY
CONCERNING THE RUN AROUND TYHE QUARTER POLE BUT THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.

ACUTELY stalked the pace outside of the leader, bid on the far turn, dueled briefly in the stretch and drew off under mild urging. MYGALJUSTICE stalked
the pace in the four path, bid on the turn, dueled briefly in the stretch but then couldn't match strides with the winner. TAPPINTOTHEBEAT was clear early
inside but couldn't last. BEYOND JUSTICE raced evenly in the four path. EMPIRE DANCER saved ground to no avail. MYGIRLJUSTICE was not a factor.
SKIPPINJUSTICE was off awkwardly and brushed the rail early. UNBRIDLED FOX was through early.

RUPP N READY was well rated early on the inside, advanced on the turn while saving ground, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim on the pace
setter, drew clear in the furlong grounds under left handed urging to prove best. LEADING THE CHARGE was allowed to settle early, advanced and came
four wide into the drive, finished willingly but no match for the winner while clearly second best. LONTANI set a unchallenged pace on the inside and
weakened in the final furlong while saving the show. OLYMPIC ROMP was reserved early while saving ground but lacked the needed rally on the inside
while just missing the show award. AMENDED chased the early pace three wide and came into the drive four wide and faded. TROUBLED JUSTICE was
reserved early, came six wide into the stretch but had no rally. IGNITED tracked the early pace on the inside, eased out leaving the half mile marker and
made a mild three wide bid on the turn but weakened.

Footnotes
LEXI SUN was away alertly and quickly to the front to set the pace while clear and racing off the rail, then was kept to her task to prove best. LIL EVIE
chased the early pace on the inside, then advanced and moved off the rail on the turn, swung out four wide for the drive, raced erratic and greenly through
the furlong grounds while finishing willingly and holding on to the place award. UNBRIDLED VICTORY was bumped at the start, then chased the early pace
four wide, then was five wide by the three sixteenths pole and rallied late. HERKINDOFJUSTICE tracked the pace three wide on the turn and needed a
stretch bid. LANTANA JUSTICE was allowed to settle and was three wide by the quarter pole and raced evenly. SISTER JUSTICE was allowed to settle
early on the inside and lacked a rally. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE bobbled at the start, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. SONG OF
THE SIREN lacked a rally. CAROLYN'S ANGEL was reserved early and came five wide into the drive and offered no response. LUCRETIA was off a step
slow and not a threat. MAYBE PRIZE showed little.

Footnotes
MR. GARY D was rated along three to four wide, then was five wide by the quarter pole and closed well on the outside to get up in time winning the bob
under a drive. EVIL EYE was settled early, then made a four wide middle move to stalk the pace four wide, then made a bid to gain a lead past the
sixteenths pole and was caught late losing the head bob. BIZERK set the pace and was still clear by the furlong marker but then gave way grudgingly late.
CAN'TBETEMALL prompted the pace three wide then faded in the final furlong. FADE AWAY was allowed to settle early and made a mild inside bid leaving
the turn but flattened out late.
