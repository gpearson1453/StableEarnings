Footnotes
BALLYBRACK LASS tracked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up to press the pace between horses for what remained
of the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, and kicked clear in the final furlong. DARLIN ROSIE led the field on the
inside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the turn, gave way approaching the eighth pole and chased the winner home from
there, the best of the rest. WATCHIN THE WHEELS raced in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn and
finished evenly, while proving to be no match for the top two. LITTLE CHICK dropped back early and trailed the field up the backstretch, began to move up
while racing two wide around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. GOLDEN LILY raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and made no bid. G CITY WARRIOR pressed the pace on the outside in the early going, moved up to duel headed into the turn, began to
drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and tired further from there.

Footnotes
GALAHAD KID settled at the rear down the chute, edged closer past the three quarters, split horses past the five eighths and advanced close to the leading
trio, saved ground in the pocket around the turn, was driven between horses into the lane, led with a furlong remaining and took over. DARK WOOD (IRE)
tracked the leading pair down the chute, improved to track the pacesetter inside of DANCIN NICKY past the three quarters, took closer order on that
pacesetter past the five eighths, was pushed along in the two to three path on the turn, engaged outside of YALIKEANYTHING approaching the quarter, did
not catch him in upper stretch while three wide, was outkicked by GALAHAD KID into the final furlong, but continued willingly late and got up for place.
YALIKEANYTHING soon led inside, set the pace down the back straight and in the two path on the turn, was confronted by DARK WOOD approaching the
quarter, carried a narrow lead inside into upper stretch, was headed by GALAHAD KID near the furlong mark, chased on while no match for that foe and lost
the place late. GIANT'S FORREST chased toward the rear inside of BUBBA CABALLO down the chute and backstretch, took closer order approaching the
half, chased in the two to three path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, proved no match for the top three from upper stretch, drifted in late
and flattened. BUBBA CABALLO chased toward the rear outside GIANT'S FORREST, took closer order with the leaders in tandem with that foe nearing the
half, chased in the rear flight in the four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted inward in the final furlong, and
ultimately lacked the needed rally. DANCIN NICKY tracked the leader down the chute, continued to track the pacesetter outside of DARK WOOD down the
backstretch, drew closer in tandem with that foe past the five eighths, was driven three wide in close range on the turn, but emptied out past the three
eighths and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
JOLINA broke sharply, dictated terms down the backstretch, edged further clear in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked into the stretch and
held command throughout while ridden out. RANK AND FILE was keen to track the leader early, continued in closest range in the three path on the turn,
proved no match for JOLINA into the lane, but chased on well enough to hold the place. LION LOVE settled at the rear, continued two wide in the rear flight
around the bend, swung five wide for the drive into the stretch, and ran on willingly for the show. LILY'S WOOFY chased midpack down the backstretch,
chased the leading pair four wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the lane, proved no match for JOLINA and RANK AND FILE, chased on but was
caught late for the show. RARE ACTION ATTACK settled in second last, lost ground along the inside around the turn, swung out three wide and was driven
into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. MANHATTAN LEGACY tracked the leading pair inside, was pushed along in the two path on the turn but
gradually lost ground, was urged inside into the lane, and continued to flatten.

Footnotes
COCKALORUM saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn,
began a bid passing the three sixteenths pole, and gained ground quickly from there, surging up to get his head in front in the final stride.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid
from the three path approaching the three eighths pole, dueled gamely down the lane and just missed. HALF COCKED bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, led the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around
the far turn, dueled gamely down the lane and was caught late. GAGOOTS raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch between
horses in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the two path and improved position while being outkicked late. RETAIN hit the gate, bumped
with the horses to either side of him and checked leaving the gate, settled in at the back of the pack in the two path for the run around the clubhouse turn,
trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there. ON THE MUSCLE
chased the leaders from the three path around the first turn, moved up to press the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the
two path and faded entering the stretch.

Footnotes
CHARGING NELLIE was reluctant to load, tracked the pace inside of LIVINHERBESTLIFE, saved ground in the pocket around the far turn, popped out
between horses nearing the quarter pole, engaged outside of FREEDOM ROSE into the lane, led past the three sixteenths, began to drive clear, shifted in
past the sixteenth mark, and drew off despite racing greenly late. FREEDOM ROSE was soon clear, set the pace through the clubhouse turn and down the
backstretch, took some slight pressure from LIVINHERBESTLIFE into the far turn, edged clear again in the two path around the far turn, was engaged by
CHARGING NELLIE outside of her into the lane, was headed by that foe past the three sixteenths, steadied slightly past the furlong mark as CHARGING
NELLIE drifted in, and chased on while proving no match for that foe in the final furlong. SUMMER BELLE chased midfield while saving ground, rallied when
urged up the inside into the lane, proved no match for CHARGING NELLIE or FREEDOM ROSE into upper stretch, shifted three wide in upper stretch, and
kept on best of the rest. AULENTI was herded in early, chased outside of SUMMER BELLE through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch,
continued midfield four wide around the far turn and into the lane, and kept on mildly past tiring horses. LIVINHERBESTLIFE tracked the pacesetter, inched
forward to apply mild pressure two wide into the far turn, continued in range three wide approaching the quarter, but proved no match into the lane and
flattened out. NIFF cut inward in the opening strides, chased behind the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn and the back straight, chased in the three
path between horses around the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, drifted inward in upper stretch, and flattened out. PINKABOO settled near the rear
inside of ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE through the clubhouse turn, continued toward the rear down the backstretch and while racing in the two to three path
around the far turn, was driven inside into the lane, but offered no rally. ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE settled near the rear outside of PINKABOO early, raced
second last down the back straight, continued patiently at the rear in the four path on the far turn, raced two wide between horses into the lane, drifted out in
upper stretch and offered no bid. LIFENHOWULIVIT settled at the rear, moved two wide to join outside of ZAZZY ZAZZY DAZZLE past the half mile mark,
chased with the rear group in the five path around the far turn, was driven five wide into the lane and made no bid. THE JOCKEY OF FREEDOM ROSE
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF CHARGING NELLIE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS
MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CLOUD TO GROUND stalked the leaders from the three path around the first turn, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack between horses up the
backstretch, began a bid four wide entering the stretch and dueled tenaciously between horses, managing to get his head in front at the wire. ROAR OF
THE LION saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while still saving ground around the far turn,
swung wide entering the stretch, and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch, just missing the victory. UPHAM saved ground around the first
turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid passing the three sixteenths pole,
bumped mildly with SMILING SILAS, and gained ground quickly between horses from there, just missing the win. OVERPRAISE raced in the middle of the
pack in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path, launched a bid between horses
entering the stretch and gained ground inside down the lane, just missing the win. WHITE MIST saved ground around the first turn, chased the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, gained ground from the rail while drifting in in the final furlong and was
outfinished late. DEWY'S HIT raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, began a bid from
the three path passing the three eighths pole, showed the way into the stretch, dueled down the lane and weakened in the final strides. FAST ONE pressed
the pace from the two path through the opening half mile, dueled for the lead on the outside around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. FRONTIER
CHARLIE led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the rail while racing around the far turn and tired
entering the stretch. VENETIAN DREAM raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to drop
back while racing two wide around the far turn and continued to tire from there. JOEY B raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. SMILING SILAS raced off the pace in the
three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn, bumped mildly with UPHAM near
the three sixteenths, was pulled up from there, walked onto the van following the race and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BENELUX tracked the leading pair inside early, was keen into the backstretch to track outside of MARKITOFF, engaged outside of him past the nine
sixteenths, cleared the rest of the field into the far turn while vying outside him, ceded a narrow lead to MARKITOFF into the lane, but continued to bear
down, wrested a slim lead near the sixteenth, and held gamely. MARKITOFF set the pace inside, was engaged by BENELUX past the nine sixteenths,
cleared in tandem with that foe while vying inside him into the far turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, was headed by BENELUX near the sixteenth
mark, continued to battle on gamely but just missed. FLY NIGHTLY chased inside of MERLIN'S SONG into the clubhouse turn, chased at the middle of a
strung-out field into the backstretch, took closer order approaching the far turn, saved ground while chasing the leading pair around the far turn, continued to
give chase while well behind the leading pair in upper stretch, drifted inward and outward in the lane but nonetheless mustered some late gain on the
leading pair. CAMMACK settled toward the rear, continued patiently down the backstretch and in the two path inside of BLUE SKY KOWBOY on the far
turn, began to rally inside into the lane, gained steadily inside down the lane and missed the show. WILE E PEYOTE tracked the pacesetter through the
clubhouse turn, raced three wide between horses into the backstretch, continued in range of MARKITOFF and BENELUX to the nine sixteenths, gradually
lost ground approaching the far turn, chased midpack in the two path around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, and took mildly closer order late.
BLUE SKY KOWBOY settled near the rear around the clubhouse turn, raced inside of GOING WITH STYLE in the rear flight down the backstretch, kept on
toward the rear in the four to five path outside of CAMMACK around the far turn, swung out toward the center of the track at the head of the stretch, ran on
five wide, took closer order late but was ultimately outfinished. MERLIN'S SONG chased outside of FLY NIGHTLY early, advanced to chased behind the
tracking flight, angled out four wide into the backstretch, raced in close range of the leader to the half, was relegating to chase the leading pair in the three
path into the far turn as BENELUX and MARKITOFF cleared the rest of the field, was and gradually outpaced between horses from near the quarter.
GOING WITH STYLE was taken back to the rear, continued in the rear flight outside of BLUE SKY KOWBOY down the backstretch, was outpaced in the
five path on the far turn and not persevered with in the lane.
