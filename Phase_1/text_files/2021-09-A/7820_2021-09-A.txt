SOARINGFORTHESUN away well, and was allowed to settle off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to get up in deep stretch to prevail.
BELCARRA PARK rushed to the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and
through the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, and just failed to last in a solid debut. DRILL BABY DRILL dropped back to trail the field into
the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to be along
for a share. ALL LIQUORD UP settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to advance four wide midway
down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact while finishing two wide in the drive. MONTE away
alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position into the final turn while racing along the inside,
but faded in the late stages. A TREE OF LIFE settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

BAKTURA away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down
the backside and through the final turn, took a narrow advantage entering the lane, and inched clear late over a very stubborn rival. MCMURPHY broke
sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and into the backstretch, battled from the
inside of BAKTURA in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, struggled to match strides with that rival entering the lane, but battled
determinedly from along the rail in the drive to prove second best. FREE FOR SURE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
lane the first time, held his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more late while
finishing two out from the rail in the drive. JUST MAKE BELIEVE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied smartly along the rail entering the final
turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. FRANKIE MACHINE stalked the leader through the stretch the first
time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
MAKEITORBREAKIT away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
closed with a rush three wide between rivals in deep stretch to get up in time. COUNTRY COWBOY settled well off the early pace while racing one out from
the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. CATTITUDE raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace into the final turn, held a clear advantage into the lane, and just failed to last.
AKROYD broke outwards, before chasing the leaders three wide through the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of CATTITUDE in the run down the
backstretch and through the final turn, but faded in the late stages. VALUE MAX away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. SHOWMAN broke sharply and stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. EH TEE EM
unhurried early while dropping well back of the field entering the backstretch, trailed throughout, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
SNOWSHOES broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to advance from
just off the rail soon after entering the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove best. STONERIDGE
AMBER away well and dueled for the lead two wide entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn,
was unable to fend off SNOWSHOES late, while all out to hold the place. CERTIFIABLE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from
the rail, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to just miss the place. SOUTHERN LASS away
alertly and eased into a tracking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly in the drive.
GOTTCHA BRAN DEE settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. BLUEBERRY HONEY dwelt at the start, to get away poorly, trailed the field in the run down the backstretch,
saved ground through the final turn, but was only able to pass a tiring rival. MANDY MAGIC settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering
he backstretch, dropped back in the run to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry
into the start, in particular to BLUEBERRY HONEY. Following review the horse was deemed to have had a fair start, and no change was made to the
original order of finish.

out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to get up for a share. COUNTESS CAT away alertly and raced to the lead from
