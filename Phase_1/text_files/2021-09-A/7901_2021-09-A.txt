Footnotes
BIG BIG DREAM set a contested pace, edged clear leaving the turn and held sway in the stretch. BRAVO KOLT settled nicely, advanced on the turn and
finished well while racing along the inside in the stretch. HOOKED ON DREAMS stalked the pace, dueled on the turn and came up empty in the stretch.
DOT COM DREAMIN was always outrun. POE MANS RIDE was forwardly placed and lacked a rally. NOT THIS AGAIN took no part.

Footnotes
BIG PINES SANDY forwardly placed, responded when asked approaching the quarter pole and rallied while three wide in the stretch. VANDRING grabbed
the early lead, held well into the stretch and was worn down late. NASTY EXAGGERATOR stalked the pace, got outpaced leaving the far turn and came up
empty in the stretch. TEQUILA was void of speed and showed some mild late interest. COOL CAT CHARLIE was always outrun. ALITTLEBITOFLIME
swerved out at the start and did not factor.
