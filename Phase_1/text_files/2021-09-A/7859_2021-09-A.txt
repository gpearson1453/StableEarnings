Footnotes
SUPREME BLESSING disputed the pace outside FEARLESS LASSIE, drifted out near the eighth pole, sprinted clear then drifted in near the sixteenth pole.
FEARLESS LASSIE bumped with MY WAY OR ELSE leaving the starting gate, showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace with the winner and
faded in the drive. CORAL SUMMER lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through out and had a slight rally. MEET MICHELLE , three deep on the turn,
raced four wide approaching the stretch and was not a factor. MY WAY OR ELSE , steadied when jostled and caught in tight quarters leaving the starting
gate, stalked the pace three wide around the turn then weakened. MOONLIGHT MISS bumped with MY WAY OR ELSE leaving the starting gate, raced in
the two path on the turn and weakened. LUCKY EMBER trailed and was eased the final furlong.

VOLTAMOUR prompted the pace two wide, moved to a slim lead between rivals near the half mile marker, eased back to the inside of foes near the far
turn, shifted out and stalked three wide, came back under solid handling, took command a furlong out, dueled outside RIP IT then edged clear late. RIP IT ,
four wide in attendance of the pace early on, bid three deep nearing the half mile marker, pressed the pace outside MR. J MCKAY around the final turn and
into the lane, fought on between foes leaving the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. LEFT BLANK broke in and bumped with a rival then steadied when
in tight, lagged off the early pace, circled four wide advancing into the lane, dropped in to progress between runners leaving the sixteenth pole and churned
on. TRANSFER THE FUNDS settled in the clear and in mid pack, was under asking four wide past the five sixteenths, moved up in mid stretch, switched
over to his left lead and flattened out. NTH POWER raced well back through the opening six furlongs, saved ground into the lane, swung out past the three
sixteenths and had belated action. MR. J. MCKAY , bumped at the break, moved up and was three wide tracking early on, bid between foes to take a slim
lead into the far turn, dropped in and handled outside pressure, sparred to mid stretch then gave way. LEAVE 'EM LOADED saved ground early, was put to
pressure off the rail leaving the far turn and gave way. EMPHASIZE broke a step slow, dropped in early and settled, was under asking around the final turn,
raced three wide into the lane but came up empty. HONOR MY WORLD , well placed saving ground and in range of a contested pace, failed to kick on
leaving the far turn and tired. LE PEACE TREATY cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was collared past the five eighths and faltered around the
final turn. IMAGINE NEVERLAND dropped far back.

Footnotes
ARRIO stalked three wide, moved up past the five eighths, drifted out four wide while under pressure heading to the quarter pole, was corrected with right
handed asking, made a grinding run under solid handling, moved to command near the sixteenth pole and held firm. CALL IT LOVE prompted the pace two
wide, moved alongside heading to the half mile marker, shook clear mid way on the final turn, widened under asking past the three sixteenths, was headed
a sixteenth out and kept on gamely to the line. LIDSTROM broke a step slow, recovered and edged up, settled outside a rival through the backstretch run,
circled four wide making some headway into the lane, lugged in through the final furlong and rallied mildly. MOHAAFETH saved ground advancing to the
five eighths, angled out under pressure and chased past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on seriously in mid stretch and faded. AWARD NOMINATED
drifted in at the break and bumped with a rival, rated off the pace while between foes, raced two wide under urging into the lane but failed to rally.
AWESOME DYNAMO , bumped at the break, was sent clear from the inside, took pressure heading to the half mike marker, battled leaving the far turn then
tired through the final quarter mile.

WITTY BANTER lacked speed, raced in the two path around the first turn, angled out on the backstretch, circled the far turn four deep, closed outside
horses, led inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. MOSLER'S IMAGE prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, dropped back a bit on the far
turn, angled out in mid stretch and rallied. MAUREENLOVESFRANK , three wide the first turn, advanced four wide leaving the backstretch, gained a short
lead approaching the eighth pole and weakened late. MAHKATO , three wide the first turn, advanced in the three path outside horses to gain the lead mid
way down the backstretch, battled inside MAUREENLOVESFRANK around the far turn and through upper stretch then weakened late. RAPIDASHQUEEN
lacked speed, floated five deep leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. ARBUTUS , two wide the first turn, was well positioned between horses leaving the
backstretch then weakened on the far turn. BIRD TYCOON saved ground around the first turn, raced in the three path between horses entering the far turn
and weakened. MAVILUS showed speed along the inner rail and faltered.

Footnotes
FROSTY BREW , four wide early, dropped in a bit and edged up to track a contested pace three wide, was floated out four wide when threatening outside
rivals entering the lane, responded when put to firmer asking past the three sixteenths, took over a furlong out then drew out nicely while steadily hand
ridden. DETERMINED TRUTH vied inside early then rated back off the leaders into the turn, awaited room leaving the five sixteenths, got through along the
rail in the drive and came back on with good energy to gain the place. SHE IS WISKY drafted back along the rail nearing the turn, eased out and worked her
way between foes in mid stretch, swung out with a sixteenth to go and finished well. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY prompted the pace three wide early on,
moved up to engage the leader leaving the far turn, dueled outside then was floated out a path into the lane, held a short advantage leaving the three
sixteenths, battled inside the winner leaving the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. COST A FORTUNE vied two wide before briefly clearing past the half
mile pole, met an outside bid from KYMMIES CHARDONNARY soon after, dueled inside that past the five sixteenths, drifted out a bit entering the lane,
failed to match strides heading to mid stretch, shifted out and was giving effort at the wire. ISABELLA'S GLORY lacked speed, angled four wide into the lane
and rallied mildly. PRIMA BALLERINA edged up into the turn while under coaxing, gave hard chase two to three wide past the five sixteenths, failed to make
an impact and gave way through the final furlong. SULLIVAN STREET , off slow after drifting in, saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally.
MEJORAMIGA settled off the rail, angled five wide under asking into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
U S CONSTITUTION , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced four deep leaving the far turn, bumped with TAKE PROFIT
when taking the lead in mid stretch and held sway under urging. AMERICAN D'ORO stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced behind horses the far
turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch and rallied nicely. TAKE PROFIT stalked the pace racing inside horses, moved up in the two path leaving
the far turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch, bumped with the winner in mid stretch and flattened out. NO ONE TO BLAME , three wide the first turn, was in
hand between horses waiting for room leaving the far turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch and had a mild rally outside foes. BELTWAY BOB , four
deep on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and offered a mild rally outside rivals. CALL ME PLUCKY , no factor, passed tired rivals late.
SUPER E bobbled at the break, was four deep on both turns and weakened. SASSY KING , five wide the far turn, weakened. MACY'S BOY set the pace
along the inner rail and gave way in mid stetch. BRYCE CANYON hugged the inner rail around the far turn and weakened. ARTISTIC REASON was no
factor. MANICOMIO prompted the pace two wide, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
UNION GEN. GEORGE rated back off TITAN'S WILL early and angled out, moved up to join that one past the three quarter pole, vied two wide into the
turn, shook clear past the three eighths, kept on under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, wandered outward in the final yards and was fully extended to
get the bob. ROMP stumbled to his nose at the break, regrouped and settled outside foes, edged up into the turn to track, was attempting to lay in when
threatening the winner near the three sixteenths, dropped back a bit, shifted in and found more to advance between runners, kept on valiantly towards the
rail and just missed. UP AGAINST IT was sent up towards the inside leaving the chute and prompted the pace, eased back off foes leaving the half mile
marker while patiently handled, angled out and was put to asking mid turn, moved up five wide to loom past the furlong grounds then churned on between
foes. TIZ MANDATE drafted back off the pace near the three quarter pole then rated between, came under pressure mid turn while off the rail, angled six
wide nearing mid stretch and came back on with good energy. TITAN'S WILL took over early and dropped in towards the rail, set a pressured pace, ceded
to the winner exiting the far turn, gave hard chase into the lane, stayed willingly along the rail past the furlong grounds then faded late. ERAWAN settled off
the pace, angled very wide for the drive but lacked a solid kick.

Footnotes
KIT KELLER hugged the inner rail, secured command on the turn, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch then was kept to her business in the drive.
WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER lacked speed, raced in the two path leaving the turn, worked between horses through the stretch and closed nicely. LUNA
ANTONIA saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, remained along the rail in the stretch, moved up in mid stretch and flattened out. DETERMINED
STAR stalked the pace, was four deep leaving the turn and rallied mildly. DATS A SUPERSTAR lacked speed, raced wide on the turn, was outside rivals in
the stretch and passed tired ones. BALLYHOOLY showed speed outside the winner and weakened in the drive. PRINCESS PALMER , three deep chasing
the pace around the turn, gave way. CAROLINA SUN , reluctant to load into the starting gate, steadied in close quarters near the five eighths pole, turned
for home in the three path and failed to rally. COFFEE BEAN , along the inner rail most of the race, was not a factor.
