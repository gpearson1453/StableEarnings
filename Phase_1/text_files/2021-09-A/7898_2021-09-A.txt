Footnotes
MONGOLIAN WINDOW went four wide into the first turn, moved in a bit then back to the four path around the bend, went between rivals on the backstretch,
exited the far turn three deep, angled out upper stretch, drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear to prove best. LADY ROBIN vied for the
lead between rivals and got floated out into the first turn, continued to battle up front outside VIDALIA, cleared into the second bend, led three to four wide
into the drive, challenged in the lane and resisted to the sixteenth pole, yielded to the winner but held the place. FLATTERWITHJEWELS got floated out
while three deep into the first turn, chased outside the top pair from outside, exited the far turn four to five wide, challenged through the lane and lacked the
needed late punch. REDS SACRED APPEAL went three wide into the clubhouse turn then angled in around the bend, saved ground to the stretch, shifted
out mid-stretch and weakened. VIDALIA had early speed from inside, tossed her head and drifted out into the first turn, dueled for command from inside up
the backstretch, lost contact on the second bend, chased two wide into the drive and faded.

MISS GLORIOUS was closest in pursuit outside the pacesetter, kept the pressure on through the lane, vied between foes in the final sixteenth and won the
bob. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN raced in range off the inside, came four wide into the stretch, rallied three deep late and lost the bob at the wire. TRIBAL
BID sped to the front, challenged around the turn, maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth, fought gamely to the wire but was overtaken by the top
pair. OUR LITTLE TIGER chased widest up the backstretch, went four to five wide around the turn, kept on through the lane but needed to find more in
deep stretch. TRAFFIC STOPPER chased on the inside to the turn, moved out and came three wide into the stretch and could not respond when called
upon.

BACK BEAUTY vied for the lead between rivals, cleared around the turn, put to right-handed urging past the eighth pole and held late. WICKED SUNSET
stalked the top quartet up the backstretch, chased three wide into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, was gaining on the winner into deep stretch when
the rider stopped riding past the sixteenth pole, then once he realized the race was not over it was too late. FOR MY BROTHER vied for command from
inside, could not keep pace with the leaders around the turn but stayed on through the stretch to secure the show honors. SPEEDY GIGI brushed inner rival
and stumbled a bit at the start, showed early speed four deep up the backstretch, chased four to five wide into the lane and flattened out. GODDESS
APHRODITE off slow to begin, went four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and weakened. LA CROIX brushed with SPEEDY GIGI at the start,
vied for the lead three deep, pressed into the turn, chased the leader leaving the bend and faded.

Footnotes
SOUL SWEET sped to the front, vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, cleared approaching the five-sixteenths pole and held well over the runner-up. KIND
BUT SHE LIES raced off the rail in range, angled four wide on the far turn, finished willingly while drifting inward in the stretch and could not summon the
needed late kick. MEDUSA'S GAZE went five wide around the first turn, chased three wide into the second bend, spun five wide into the lane and whittle the
gap late. BIG NEWS COMING vied for the lead between rivals to the far turn, could not keep up the with the winner nearing the five-sixteenths, then
weakened in the late stages. GRIGORO traveled four wide into the first turn then went up to vie three deep for command, fought outside the inside pair to
the second bend, lost contact around the turn and faded in the drive. STRIKING TIGRESS was rank on the inside around the first turn, dropped back to trail
the field, started to weaken nearing the final turn, was eased in the lane and walked off.

SWIFT NONNI chased outside the top quartet, took aim four wide into the stretch, rallied three deep at the eighth pole and proved best late. SUPER GAME
trailed early on, went four wide into the turn, moved out and came seven wide into the stretch, rallied late and got up for the place. RIGHTEOUSLY vied for
the lead three deep, dueled inside a rival in the two path on the turn, held command through the lane but got outfinished in the closing moments. WRONG
TURN CUPID vied four the lead four deep, dueled in the three path outside a rival on the turn, stayed alongside into the final sixteenth and could not
summon the needed late kick. TRULY FABULOUS got crowded early, lacked room nearing the sixteenth pole, went two wide into the turn, angled out and
entered the lane four to five wide and never rallied. LI'L GRAZEN tracked off the inside, exited the bend five wide and lacked a late bid. DOZO vied for the
lead between rivals then steadied at the half-mile pole, chased two to three wide into the lane and could not re-rally. NO COVER CHARGE vied for
command from inside, chased the top duo around the turn and faded.
