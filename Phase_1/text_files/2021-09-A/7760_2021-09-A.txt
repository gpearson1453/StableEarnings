MOCITO ROYALE stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up, three wide around the second turn, made a late rally and proved the best. PRINCE
PERFECTA unhurried in the beginning, racing evenly in the middle of the pack, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
PLUTONIUM raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, racing four wide and got up for show. OGRE'S LION KING lacked early speed, showed late
interet, racing five wide, but was no factor. SERBIAN SAILOR dueled on the front end, racing between rivals around the final turn and faded down the
stretch. OUR BLUE JAY challenged for the early advantage, saved ground and was finished early. HAPPY DAY trailed throughout and was never close.

LITTLE CHIEF vied for the early lead, took the advantage around the turn, dueled down the stretch and prevailed for the win. LULLABY BLING brushed at
the start, racing near the middle of the pack, made a late bid, four wide and was outfinished. DA GOLD ROOM showed early speed, saved ground and was
outfinished by the top two. KYLE'S BRO JIMMY pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and weakened late. DREAMONMEBABY lacked early
speed and was never a factor. TROPHY DADDY brushed at the start, raced near the back and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #3 DE GOLD ROOM
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 LITTLE CHIEF FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS
TOOK NO ACTION. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

contention, saved ground around the final turn, dueled down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. LIL ASHLEY B. raced in the back in the early going,
