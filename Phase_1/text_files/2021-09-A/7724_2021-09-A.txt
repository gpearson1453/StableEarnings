outside going five wide on the turn, made late bid but was outkicked. DAUX pressed the early pace, continued to chase three wide on the turn, took a
narrow lead in upper- to mid-stretch but was outkicked. CERVEZA stumbled badly at the start, raced in range four wide on the turn but had no late kick.
ATTILIANNO tucked in behind the leaders leaving the backstretch to go two wide on the turn, was within striking distance but failed to rally. GUNNERS ONE
set the pace inside, faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
INDIAN DRAGON broke sharply and led for the opening furlong while shifting in, eased back allowing rivals to go on with it while tracking inside on or just
off the rail into the turn, encouraged along while angling out six wide out of that bend, struck the lead in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and drove past.
WINNIES OWN stalked the early pace, pressured three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch taking the lead about the quarter pole, was
overtaken near the sixteenth and second best. LINCOLN COUNTY KID was bumped at the break, trailed early racing in the two path into the turn, moved
out four wide into upper stretch and gained mildly late. CHUCKIES CHANCE was bumped into a rival at the start, raced in the back half of the field going
about three wide on the turn and moving in coming out of that bend, lacked room in mid-stretch and altered out, ran on evenly. FRANKS DEHERE was in a
bit tight after the break, moved out and chased going four wide on the turn, swung seven deep into the lane and had no real rally. BESITOS CRIMINALES
moved clear after the opening furlong to dictate terms on a clear margin, led into the turn racing in the two path but facing pressure, faltered and faded. IMA
SAINT TOO bumped the inner rival at the start, switched outside foes heading up the backstretch, went five deep on the turn fanning eight wide into the
stretch and could not rally. RED RASCAL was briefly mid-pack early, dropped back three wide into the turn and moved out six wide later on that bend, was
never a threat.

Footnotes
HARKING set the pace after coming out just a tad at the break racing off the inside, went in the two to three path on the turn, was challenged by an inside
rival near the quarter pole but regained command in upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. ZAMARA exchanged a light bump early up the
backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn, made a mild bid inside near the quarter pole but was no match. BRAVE CINDERELLA exchanged a light
bump early heading up the backstretch, was within range three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch five wide and lacked the needed late kick.
REVENOOR WOMAN broke a step slowly spotting the field a length or two and lost her path, switched out and moved up outside, chased four to five wide
on the turn coming six deep into the stretch, drifted a bit while failing to rally. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY raced last but one early in the two path through the turn,
angled out about seven wide in upper stretch then kept going another further three paths and was not a threat. SHANGHAI KEELY reared and hit the gate
at the start almost losing the rider and spotting the field numerous lengths, switched off the inside to go three to four wide on the turn at the rear, swung
seven wide into upper stretch then was carried out and put in tight quarters in mid-stretch.

Footnotes
TRUST N PRAYER moved in from five to three wide on the first turn trailing the field, moved back out three to five wide on the far turn commencing a bid,
came into upper stretch nine deep, exchanged two solid bumps with DOM WAYNE, edged past late to prevail. DOM WAYNE went four to five wide on the
first turn, shifted in about midway up the backstretch to enter the far turn two deep in behind and off the leaders, moved out leaving that bend to enter upper
stretch eight deep, exchanged two solid bumps and lost action temporarily, regained momentum and drifted in through late stretch but was outkicked by the
aforementioned. TIME TO RUMBLE angled out four wide about the six and one-half pole, moved clear early up the backstretch to dictate terms, came in a
bit for the far turn going two wide on that bend still in the clear, weakened in the lane. MASTERCLASS was mid-pack just off the leaders mostly four to five
wide, fanned seven deep into upper stretch then moved in a bit, had to alter outside a drifting rival late. ELLIOT tracked the leaders going in the two path on
both turns, was within striking distance in upper stretch but flattened out. COMET CAUSEY set the early pace three wide, was overtaken by a rival early up
the backstretch and tracked that one, came out six wide turning for home and failed to rally. WISHFUL SLIM settled off the leaders three wide early, moved
in to on or just off the rail on the far turn before coming out four wide for the drive, made no bids. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE TRAINER OF
DOM WAYNE AGAINST TRUST N PRAYER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
