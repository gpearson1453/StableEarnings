Footnotes
FERDAN set a pressured pace while racing off the rail, then shook clear leaving the turn and was kept to a mild drive to remain clear to prove best. MACHO
ALEGRE was well placed early while two wide, then moved to the rail by the quarter pole, then tipped out four wide for aim on the front runner, but failed to
gain on that rival while clearly second best. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE was checked early, then came five wide into the drive and found best stride late to be
along for the show award. GUARD chased the early pace on the inside, angled out by the furlong marker and had no rally. PRINCE SHIM was off a step
slow, then was sent up four to five wide to press the pace four wide, then fell back leaving the turn, lugged in through the stretch under right handed urging,
then was corrected with left handed urging and weakened. INDIGO RICH chased the pace five wide and weakened. CALL ME DROSSEL was reserved
early and angled out in mid stretch and offered no rally. STUDENT PRINCE raced on the inside and was roused on the turn and had no response.

swung out six wide for the drive with momentum, closed well on the outside to get up late under right handed urging drawing clear.
MAGNIFICENTREVENGE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, then had a long drive and was caught late while staying on
grudgingly. ROYAL CHEYANNE was four wide into the first turn, then pressed the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, but
flattened out in the drive. WILADENE was five wide into the first turn, prompted the pace five wide down the backstretch, then fell off the pace on the turn
and moved in to be four wide by the quarter pole and tired. HITCHED was allowed to settle on the inside and dropped back. FOUND MY MAN set a
pressured pace on the inside and gave way.

WHAT NOW DARRELL was settled back early, then made a five six wide run on the turn, came seven wide into the drive, closed full of run to win going
away late under a drive. ME AND CHILI was well placed throughout, then slipped through on the inside leaving the turn, bumped with the pace setter by the
three sixteenths pole, then grabbed a short lead leaving the furlong marker but was caught in deep stretch. JUSTICETHEBEAST bobbled at the start, then
set the pace while racing off the rail, exchanged bumps with ME AND CHILI by the three sixteenths and gave way grudgingly late. COPPER HARBOR
stalked thee early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but was empty in the drive. NO PROOF broke in at the start, then chased the pace four wide
and weakened. PURSUANT broke outwardly at the start, then failed to menace. JEOPARDY THEORY chased the pace on the inside and tired. SHAD was
bumped soundly at the start then was not a threat.

Footnotes
MOMMY BERTA pressed the early slow pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take command, drew clear leaving the turn then was kept to mild
pressure to prove best. BIA BOLT RUNNER was four wide into the first turn, then was reserved early, came four wide into the stretch and finished well to be
clearly second best. LOVELY TROPHY GIRL tracked the early pace on the inside but lacked the needed winning bid while getting the show award.
TRADITIONAL ARCHER was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a rally. CROSSED THE LINE set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened.
UNION PARK GAL (IRE) was settled back while two wide on the backstretch and failed to respond. HOT N SWEET was allowed to settle early, swung out
three wide for the drive and was empty,bled, vanned off.

LOADEMUPJUSTICE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid leaving the turn, moved to the inside by the three sixteenths pole while drawing
clear, then was kept to pressure to prove best. FAITHFUL NOTION was allowed to settle early towards the inside, advanced and eased out on the turn and
swung out six wide for the drive and closed well on the outside. SHINEONBRAD was bumped at the start, then dueled for the lead in between rivals, then
steadied by the three sixteenths pole, then finished willingly to best the rest. CASPER JUSTICE pressed the early pace three wide, came four wide into the
drive and was empty. TAKECHARGEJUSTICE chased the pace and advanced on the inside, then was boxed by the quarter pole, then was blocked by the
three sixteenths and angled out in mid stretch but had no bid. BIG HAT NO COWS rushed up the rail to duel for the lead on the inside and weakened in the

Footnotes
CLEARING WAIVERS led inside of a foe and drew off from that one in the stretch under steady urging. MILLION DOLLAR RED pressed the pace outside of
the winner and was no match in the stretch. FEVER TEMPLE raced inside, moved out five wide in the stretch and had a late bid for the show spot.
PRADO'S PLAYBOY raced inside, bid three wide at the three-eighths pole and improved position late. FLYING SAMURAI stalked the pace inside before
fading in the stretch. CONCRETE CHARLIE raced inside and passed tired foes. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL stalked between foes, bid at the three-eighths
pole but faltered in the drive. BAKER'S MAN stalked in the four path to the far turn and faded.
