Footnotes
CROSS THE MERSEY wide into first turn, stalked outside, took over when ready midway on the final turn and drew away under moderate coaxing..
GRAND ENTRADA lagged far behind at back of pack then rallied mildly to earn the place. MY LUCKY HEART prompted the pace in the two path, led into
the far turn and had no response to the winner. PAOLLA KISSES raced close up early then began fading on the final turn. ENOUGH KISSES saved ground
close up early, stopped abruptly losing contact with her field.

ELLAS MY LOVE settled near the back of the field, angled out advancing at the quarter pole, surged into the stretch and edged off. JOHN'S PROMISE vied
along the inside, moved two wide on the turn and lasted for the place. CALIFORNIA SWING trailed inside, altered course in the stretch and closed well just
missing the place. KING'S HOUSE dueled between rivals, moved clear on the turn, led to the stretch then came up empty. BAZOO raced within range three
wide but lacked a rally. ROCKET BLAST dropped back outside and was never a factor. YEI YEI prompted the pace outside then began faltering on the turn.

OHIO CLASS prompted the pace outside, moved clear into the stretch and edged away under a mild drive. WHERE PARADISE LAY dropped back inside,
moved wide in the stretch and closed well without threatening. CLOSE SHAVE settled off the leaders, moved inside on the turn then flattened out in the
stretch. NASHVEGAS hustled to the front inside, dueled on the turn and faded in the stretch. YABBA DABBA DUDE lacked speed, drifted very wide on the
turn and trailed. ARRIVEDERLA was a late scratch.

SECOND LINE DAVID moved clear early, lost the lead briefly after the half, led and vied, moved clear and drifted out in the final sixteenth. MARACAIBO bid
to the front after half a mile, vied to the stretch, angled inside the winner but could not get by. DON'T THROW STONES urged close up between rivals,
dropped back on the turn and was no match for the top pair. GOLDEN GALLANT fanned six wide into the first turn then passed fading rivals. TAPIFLY
saved ground off the leaders and lacked a response. BAMA DRIFTER lagged far behind inside and was always outrun. DOUBLE MAGNUM raced four wide
on the first turn then stopped abruptly.
