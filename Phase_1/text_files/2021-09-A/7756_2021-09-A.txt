Footnotes
AL HILAL rated off the early leaders, picked up the pace entering the far turn then launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, gathered momentum under
steady pressure, roused forward into striking distance in deep stretch then surged to the wire. DOUBLE BLESSING was unhurried and raced in the back,
swung six wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and captured place. ROYAL WAR vied in the opening quarter then cleared on top, saved ground into
the lane, widened advantage under pressure in the upper stretch then got reeled in late. PIYPA DE LYNDA was stubborn to load the raced near midpack
through the backstretch, weakened around the far turn, launched an inside bid turning for home and improved. HONESTO stalked the pace through the
backstretch, commenced a two wide bid around the final turn, stayed on past the furlong marker then faded. SMART SOLDIER raced between foes in early
stages, coaxed two wide around the far turn and failed to gain. GONNA BE EPIC raced off the pace, was ridden along three wide with three furlongs to run
and failed to move on. JOE PHILLIPS stumbled then got bumped at the start, advanced to race near mid-range at the half mile marker, moved into
contention with three furlong left to run then came up empty leaving the quarter pole. MUTARAAFEQ vied with rival in early stages then retreated leaving
the backstretch.

Footnotes
PRETZEL raced in contention while ridden along three wide around the turn, responded under pressure with a furlong left to run and kicked clear. QUEEN
DOMINA got bumped at the start, sat five wide off the early speed, hustled along five wide into the lane, steadily gained closer contention and finished
second best. NENITA vied inside of FREEZER BURN out of the gate, battled on around the turn, edged away to a slim lead at the eighth pole then lacked
closing response. FREEZER BURN vied outside of NENITA for the early lead, continued in aim at the furlong marker then flattened out. LIGHTS ON GIRL
chased inside around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and stayed on evenly. LYRICAL hustled along three wide in pursuit off the top pair then failed
to keep pace near the quarter pole. HAPPY INTEREST saved ground into the lane and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
KAHIKO rated off the pace while never too far back, picked up the pace along the outside near the quarter pole, set down driving four deep with a furlong
left to run, dug in under firm pressure and edged away late. ALL QUALITY was forwardly placed behind the early leader, moved up to engage ZODIAC
PRINCESS for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled gamely two wide into deep stretch then lacked a final kick. SNOW SHOWER (GB) stalked inside through
the backstretch, roused for more late on the far turn, raced three wide in aim for the lead at the furlong marker, raced in tight quarters in the final sixteenth
and finished evenly. ZODIAC PRINCESS set the pace through early stages, came under attack from ALL QUAILTY nearing the quarter pole, fought back
gamely into the lane then weakened in deep stretch. WONDER BLONDY was unhurried out of the gate, remained off the early pace then coaxed four wide
around the far turn, had a mild improve but needed more for impact. ELUSIVE MOLLY settled through early stages, cut the corner entering the lane and
lacked a needed rally. RAKI steadied around the first turn, rated near midpack, was ridden along the rail late on the far turn and failed to move on. SMART
SPENDING raced in range through the backstretch then came up empty around the final turn. THE RIDER OF SNOW SHOWER LODGED A CLAIM OF
FOUL AGAINST KAHIKO AND AIR QUALITY, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
SUNSHINE CITY quickly established the early lead and saved ground around the first turn, set the pace and held clear around the final turn, roused for
more in the upper stretch, responded willingly and remained well clear. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) stalked SUNSHINE CITY through the backstretch,
launched a two wide bid for rival near the quarter pole, ran on two wide through the lane and just lasted for place. CHAMPAGNE IVY rated inside through
early stages, picked up the pace turning for home, tipped out three wide, finished with response and just missed place. STARSHIP NTERPRISE was
allowed to settle through early stages, hustled up around the far turn, kept under a drive three to four wide in the upper stretch and lacked the needed
response for impact. FRANKIE'S GIRL was reserved through early stages, saved ground around the far turn, tipped two wide at the head of the lane and
lacked a needed rally. KATE'S KINGDOM stalked the pace through the backstretch, remained up close three wide around the final turn then faded in the
lane. CULTURED raced wide around the first turn and continued reserved in the back, saved ground into the lane and failed to respond.
RESTOFTHESTORY was forwardly placed through the backstretch, had no advance under pressure around the far turn then dropped back in the lane.

Footnotes
LADY JAE was forwardly placed through early stages, angled out and launched a bid turning for home, took over the lead in upper stretch, shifted out wider
under left handed pressure and held firm. LA RUSIA tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched an outside bid at the head of the lane, stayed on
with steady response and held second best. CACTUS KITTEN was reserved in the back, raced wide into the lane and rallied to grab a share. SLEWYS
CHOSEN ONE settled off the early pace, hustled up five wide entering the lane, raced in range with a furlong left to run then finished evenly. HAPPY
THOUGHT was unhurried, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide in the upper stretch and improved position without threatening. BONHEUR raced
near midpack, gained closer order along the inside entering the lane then gave way. GINGERONMYMIND raced off the pace, went four wide into the lane
and never menaced. GLITTER BAY set the pace, got collared by the winner at the head of the lane and faded. HARDLY SOCIAL was ridden along in
pursuit through the backstretch, stayed on around the far turn then retreated. FIRST GOLD was unhurried, went four wide into the lane and had no
response.

SHANGHAI RONNIE tracked the pace through the backstretch, hustled up three wide at the quarter pole, swung five wide into the lane, sustained a steady
bid through the lane and got up in final strides. EMOJI GUY raced inside off the top pair, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole and moved up to
engage BRETT'S WORLD entering the lane, dueled two wide into the final sixteenth, held a slight edge late then got denied in final strides. BRETT'S
WORLD held a slim lead in opening stages, dueled with EMOJI GUY at the head of the lane, battled on into the final sixteenth then lacked a closing kick.
KICKS ON SIXTY SIX tracked the top two flights around the turn, launched a five wide bid at the head of the lane, raced in range with a furlong left to run
then finished evenly. FITZ'S MO applied pace pressure to BRETT'S WORLD through early stages then weakened late on the turn. KLEON raced off the
pace, came four to five wide into the lane and failed to respond. IN HONOR OF ARTIE showed interest in the opening quarter then dropped back. NOT SO
EASY raced outside and never menaced.

Footnotes
LITTLE VIC sped to the lead at the start, held clear two wide around the turn, roused three to four wide in the lane, had more left in reserve and remained
clear. SUPERSTITIEUX was hustled along out of the gate, urged along the rail at the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid near the inside through the lane
and gained second best. MITICO raced two wide up close around the turn, churned on four wide through the lane and cleared the rest.
CLASSICSTATEOFMIND matched strides out of the gate then chased after LITTLE VIC around the turn and failed to keep pace turning for home. MO Z
chased three wide in range around the turn then faded in the lane. TOMMY POINT showed response out of the gate then dropped back. HEAVY WEIGHT
was slow into stride at the start, lacked speed, saved ground and never menaced.

TUNE IN matched strides with SUPRISE FACTOR out of the chute then remained forwardly placed behind the leader, was let out a notch entering the far
turn, cleared command at the three eighths pole and widened to a clear advantage on top, was ridden along four wide into the lane, stayed sharp in
response and finished ridden out in the final sixteenth. MEADE settled in good position just off the top pair through early stages, given cue three wide
mid-way around the turn, was no match for the pulling away winner but sustained a steady bid to secure place. NIXON JOY (ARG) got bumped then
bobbled sharply at the start and dropped back, trailed through the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the turn, shifted to the outside turning for home
and churned on for a share. SURPRISE FACTOR vied for the lead with the winner out of the chute, held a slim lead then got collared by TUNE IN near the
three eighths pole and retreated. The seven furlong split was omitted and the race was hand timed
