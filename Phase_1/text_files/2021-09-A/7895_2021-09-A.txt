Footnotes
NEOTROPIC lacked speed near the inner rail, eased out to the two path leaving the far turn, remained on her left lead until deep stretch, swung outside
near the sixteenth pole and was up approaching the finish. LACCO AMENO stalked the pace, was three deep turning for home, gained the lead near the
sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. SILK WAR , along the inner rail most of the race, had a mild rally inside HANFORD to finish third. HANFORD ,
quickly clear, set the pace near the inner rail, drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. WHAT DOES IT TAKE stalked the pace, was well positioned in the
two path entering the stretch and faltered. FAX , three deep the far turn, was outrun. FIRE D'ROCKET faltered leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
BILLINGSGATE cleared early, was nicely rated two wide, spurted away a bit leaving the far turn, turned away an initial threat from FOMO nearing the lane,
opened back up after being set down near the three sixteenths, was flashed the whip through the final seventy yards and held firm. FOMO , under firm
rating between rivals early, moved up to have aim on the winner heading towards the stretch, saw that one get away in mid stretch, kept on gamely to bridge
the gap and switched to his left lead in the final yards. EVER CLEAR broke a bit slowly, settled off the pace and saved ground mid turn, angled out in upper
stretch, worked his way between foes leaving mid stretch and finished with good energy. DASHING CIRCLES edged up three deep nearing the half mile
marker and reached a stalking spot, pursued four wide into the lane but came up empty. IRISH SNOW pulled his way forward while inside rivals nearing the
half mile pole, stalked along the rail mid turn, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. STREET MOJO settled off the rail, circled four wide into the
lane and lacked a bid. DREAM HAPPY , taken to rate while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch and faded.

COLOR CRUSH angled off the rail early and settled, moved up into the far turn, quickly gained four wide under asking past the five sixteenths, forged to
command with a furlong to go and drew clear under left handed encouragement. ROONEY , bumped early, edged up off the rail into the far turn, eased back
a bit past the three eighths, was under pressure four wide into the lane, found more past the three sixteenths and came back willingly outside rivals to gain
the place. SALLY'S MUSTANG , away to a forward position, drafted back off the pace while saving ground around the first turn, moved up under rating
leaving the three eighths, waited briefly approaching the quarter pole, shifted out and progressed between runners in deep stretch but was out kicked for the
place. AWESOME JAZZ broke a bit slow then quickly pulled her way four wide outside rivals to reach a stalking spot around the first turn, took closer order
past the half mile marker, struck the top leaving the three eighths while in hand, went clear nearing the lane, drifted in after being roused and gave way.
INDIAN NICHOLS stalked the pace, was under pressure while saving ground near the three eighths, eased out to pursue then faded in the drive.
PERFUME RIVER drifted in and bumped with a rival soon after the break, was a bit keen and pulled her way clear into the first turn, dropped in to set the
pace, was joined into the far turn by AWESOME JAZZ, sparred briefly under asking then gave way in the drive. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , inside, dropped
back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DEVILISH AFFAIR , taken to rate off the rail, moved up three wide past the five sixteenths, briefly waited near the quarter pole, eased out for room,
responded to left handed asking when advancing past mid stretch, sustained under pressure and forged ahead of rivals in the final jumps. BOURBON
WILDCAT rated close behind foes, steadied off heels into the turn, shifted out and finished gamely between runners. HUFFLEPUFF dueled outside a rival,
was roused clear in upper stretch, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, battled on gamely inside foes but wasn't quite good enough. LAUGHIN' PLACE
was steadied early, saved ground around the turn and had a mild response. BUTTER PECAN drafted back early, angled out under a ride into the lane and
lacked a bid. MICK'SBESTBETYET stalked the duel while outside a rival and gave way. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL , off slow when stumbling, failed to
recover. MISSING MY POINT got involved in a duel inside HUFFLEPUFF soon after the start, stayed on to upper stretch then surrendered.

Footnotes
I LOVE YOU , shuffled back approaching the first turn, circled the far turn four wide, swept to command in upper stretch and eagerly pulled away while kept
to her business. BECKON stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced in the three path on the far turn, had a mild move into the stretch, weakened and
held the place. NO ORDINARY TIME lacked speed, raced four wide into the far turn, five wide leaving the bend and lacked a sufficient late move. DANCE
WARRIOR lacked speed, swung outside in mid stretch and passed tired rivals. BETHABARA , well placed inside horses to upper stretch, eased out in mid
stretch and lacked a serious rally. SERENADE A KITTEN raced in the three path between horses on the far turn and failed to rally. BETCHA BY GOLLY
chased the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead on the far turn and tired in the drive. UNSHAKABLE U stalked the pace to the stretch then
weakened. MINDING MILLIE was not a factor. IDES OF MARCH set the pace along the inner rail and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
MATTA , under a light hold while in range three wide, circled a bit wider into the lane, leveled off when put to a drive past quarter pole, moved up to
challenge in mid stretch, took a short lead soon after then was fully extended to keep NOBLE COMMANDER at bay from the inside. NOBLE COMMANDER
, ridden from the start, stalked ZIGGY MON into and around the turn, moved up to engage that one past the three sixteenths, gained a short lead between
runners with a furlong to go, was headed a bit later by the winner then fought valiantly inside that one to the wire. ZIGGY MON sped clear early, set the
pace towards the inside, widened some in upper stretch, dug in when confronted, stayed on past the eighth pole then faded late. PAPAL LAW settled off the
rail, came under pressure mid turn, angled five to six wide for the drive and had belated action. VALUED NOTION , taken to rate inside, eased out in upper
stretch, angled back in and advanced in mid stretch then flattened out. FORTUNE'S FOOL , between rivals around the turn, came up empty. ROBEY'S BOY
lagged back, saved ground mid turn, angled out but failed to generate a strong run. BLESSED ARION saved ground stalking the pace, steadied when losing
his action near the quarter pole then faded. KARAN'S NOTION lost ground four wide pursuing the pace and gave way through the drive.
