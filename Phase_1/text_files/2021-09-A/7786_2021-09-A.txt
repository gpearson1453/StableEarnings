Footnotes
RIG RIDER stalked the pace from outside, moved to challenge on the turn going four then three wide, edged clear in upper- to mid-stretch and held from
CHARLIES HURRICANE, who had the early lead then veered in entering the gap, tracked along the inside, steadied slightly when in tight entering the turn,
saved ground on that bend before angling out in upper stretch, was closing but too late. RIGLET was coaxed forward to the lead after the gap, set the pace
under pressure going two to three wide, weakened once headed. MAJORWAYHOME chased briefly from between runners, dropped back and went three to
four wide on the turn, was not a late threat. EL JOKER broke awkwardly, lacked early speed, went in the two path on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
QUIEN ES broke out just a tad, moved forward inside foes but off the fence, edged to the lead late on the turn racing two wide, drifted four deep into the
stretch, met the challenge of an inside rival and held gamely. CHAMPITO settled off the early leaders, advanced inside on the turn, drifted three wide into
upper stretch, dueled in late stretch but could not get past. STRYDER broke out just a bit, tracked in behind the leaders racing two wide into the turn, kept
on in the lane. NATIVE EVENT was in tight after the break, angled in past the half-mile marker, saved ground on the turn, came out a bit in the stretch and
was gaining but left with too much to do. DOM STRAIT was in just a bit tight at the break then urged along but lacking speed, went in the four path on the
turn last but one, swung six deep into the stretch and was not a threat. SILENT ZENON was rated between horses up the backstretch, contended three
wide on the turn, weakened. SOUTHERN FIRE prompted the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn and came up empty.
