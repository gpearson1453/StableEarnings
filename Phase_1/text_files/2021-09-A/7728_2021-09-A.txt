Footnotes
BAINE THE BULL sat just off the pace under a snug hold leaving the opening turn, tracked three wide through the backstretch, closed steadily outside and
was up in time. CALEDON SUMMER away well to set the pace, took pressure leaving the backstretch inside of CHILLIN WITH CHIP and was caught late.
LIL OL FLATTER away last, tracked outside, drove four to five wide at the quarter pole and flattened out in stretch. BREACH OF CONTRACT took back
entering the first turn, saved ground on rail and lacked a serious bid. I'MANIMPERIALGIRL raced three to four wide and failed to threaten. CHILLIN WITH
CHIP went four to five wide on the turn, moved up alongside CALEDON SUMMER to contest the early pace and had nothing left in reserve.

WHERE'S THE GOLD raced at the back of the pack, began bid approaching the quarter pole, drove five wide into the stretch and won the nod in a multi
horse scramble to the finish. EZEKIEL saved ground showing the way through the backstretch, battled between foes into the lane, inched clear of inside
rival but lost the nod after a long hard drive. BACKSTREET BOBBY took back leaving the chute, waited for running room inside on the far turn, found a clear
path approaching the three sixteenth marker then moved up menacingly inside of EZEKIEL but was unable to get by and was narrowly denied in the final
strides. STORMCHASER stalked outside, bid three wide at the quarter pole and faded through stretch. WEEKEND WIZARD never far back outside, moved
up at the five sixteenth to challenge the lead but had nothing left in reserve in the drive. RAINY BAY sat in striking position from the four path and was done
early.

IRISH LUNA attended the pace racing three to four wide, fanned three wide, pushed to the front then drifted in at the head of the lane, responded gamely to
challenge from AWESOME GIGI mid stretch and prevailed. AWESOME GIGI sat in range of the pacesetters, circled into the lane, moved up alongside
IRISH LUNA menacingly but was unable to get by after a hard fought drive. CHATTY GAL contested the pace from the rail, was unable to move on with
rivals, angled out and held position late. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI lagged early, raced wide into the lane and improved late. GO MAMA rider lost stirrup
momentarily after the break, trailed the field, went wide off the final turn and passed tiring. NO BAKK TALK contended the pace from between foes to the
quarter pole and was unable to keep pace with the field. BOUND TO BE SMART stalked outside, fanned four wide into the far turn and stopped in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
KEKE KIMONO sat in striking distance, took closer order leaving the backstretch, angled out to three path mid turn, dueled into the stretch inside of
DIPLOMATICA and edged away under encouragement. DIPLOMATICA broke sharply outside, rated off the pace while four wide, drove four wide then was
headed into the lane, rallied outside of KEKE KIMONO into the stretch and gave way grudgingly deep stretch. CHABI raced near the back of the field,
advanced quickly through the final turn and gained ground late. SHE LOVES WINNIN led the field through the backstretch in the three path, was joined by
GROOVY GIRL in the far turn and faded gradually. GROOVY GIRL pressed outside, moved up alongside SHE LOVES WINNIN to challenge the lead and
emptied out. SASSY BUT CLASSY tracked inside leaving the chute and was done early. LILBITSPICY offered little. GAYELETTE never reached contention.

Footnotes
SAVEITFORARAINYDAY steadied near the five eighths pole, took closer order near the quarter pole, drove between rivals then won driving along rail. LIA'S
ON TUNE pressed the pace three to four wide, inherited the lead at the quarter pole and was rundown. DAZZLING CHIC sat mid pack, raced in traffic
turning into the lane, drove five wide and gained outside late. I TRICKED MY RIDE hustled early in the two path, bid four wide and was outkicked.
ASTARTOBE allowed to settle off the early pacesetters, bid outside but failed to menace in the drive. PHINALYWYN trailed and passed tiring. CAN'T
TOUCH THIS set a pressure pace from the rail and faded steadily with two furlongs remaining. FAIRY BARB showed early outside speed and tired.
