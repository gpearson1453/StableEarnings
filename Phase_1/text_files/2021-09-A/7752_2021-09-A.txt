Footnotes
IRISH KNIGHT broke sharply to press the pace of FOREST ECHO while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew clear.
EXECUTIVE ACTION hopped at the start, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, veered out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly when straightened away. GHOSTFINDER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid.
FOREST ECHO was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going three furlongs. PRAYFORTATERS was
forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. AWEZEE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

bumped at the break, settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. FLYIN BY was bumped at the break,

not threaten. NOW SAY SO was off a step slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. COASTING IN raced off the
pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. MYRICKLESDOHAPPEN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not

and finished evenly late. REMEMBERTOBREATHE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. PULPITS POWER
broke inward, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
GREY POINT broke sharply to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, quickly drew off and held sway to
the wire. PERFECT D chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and was up for the place. CONTINUE ON VICTOR was off slow,
raced unhurried early, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. NEW EVERY MORNING sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while
setting the pace and gave way after going a half. STARZAN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. I'M NOT GABBY
was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MEAN SHARON tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, was carried out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and held off the closing KISSABLE U to prevail. KISSABLE U was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn
and rallied late to just miss. PERFECT BLOSSOM was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run
and finished willingly. BEAU ROCKS lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the lane and finished evenly. I WANT ONE was
bumped at the start, opened a clear margin soon after, drifted out nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. PIN UP LADY lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TEASPOON OF PEPPER lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
RAIDERETTE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

ZIPPIN SEVENZ was reserved just off the leader early, moved four-wide through the turn, was bumped into the lane, vied with JUDICIAL and held off the
closing BRILLIANT BIRD to prevail. BRILLIANT BIRD was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, rallied late and just missed. PLEASE ME lacked
early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. JUDICIAL was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing
three-wide, came to impede rival nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, stayed on well and gave way late. STAY IN GRACE pressed the pace of JUDICIAL
from the inside, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and finished willingly in the drive. CHOTEAU was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HOLD THAT SMILE chased the leaders from between foes, weakened after going three furlongs and was
eased through the lane. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF STAY IN GRACE AT THE
SEVEN-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT JUDICIAL HAD CAME IN TO IMPEDE STAY IN GRACE AND
CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED LAST.

Footnotes
DADDYS LITTLE GIRL was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew off. BODE'S
BEST pressed the pace while racing three-wide throughout , could not match strides with the winner in the drive but held well to save the place. FOUR
SCORE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. FRENCH TUDOR was forwardly placed
from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and gave way in the drive. THAT'S MY STORY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and
failed to threaten. GUARDING ELK CAMP lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EXCESS COIL was void of early
speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.
