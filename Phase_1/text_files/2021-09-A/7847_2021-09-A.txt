the start, drew closer between rivals two wide after a half, was in tight entering the far turn causing her rider to check, dropped back, angled outside then
came on again late to finish clear for second. MY PINK BABY BIRD drifted out at the start, was hung wide through the clubhouse turn then went evenly.
AIKEN APPLE pressured the winner three then two wide, drifted in a bit entering the far turn then faded in the stretch. GOODFRIDAY MORNING got out
early and was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
