Footnotes
HOSTILE AFLEET pressed the leader early from off the inside, fell back late in the turn, was coming again inside the furlong marker when bothered slightly
by the drifting leader, continued with good resolve to the end to be edging clear at the wire. QUEST FOR AVETTE broke alertly, showed the way up the
backstretch inside, garnered a larger lead to be clear by late in the turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, drifted out soon
after and began to falter bothering the winner slightly, proved no match for that one late, fully extended to preserve the second spot. BUNKIE'S SONG
lacked early foot, continued to lag through the turn in the two path, roused for the drive, staged a belated rally to up for the show while getting to the runner
up in the waning strides. MIDNIGHT NIGHTMARE well back early, also displayed some late interest while out in the course, gaining for the second spot as
well. GOT KRAMER within striking distance, had little left for the drive. THUNK broke out, steadied to be last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
JOLIE GRIS shuffled back at the start, unhurried while trailing well back early, three wide turn, shifted out to be widest when commencing her rally nearing
the furlong grounds, closed with good energy to win going away. TWO PUNCH FIST in the second flight early toward the inside, advanced and challenged
in the three path between horses late in the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the
place. PEPPER POINT in the second group while racing off the inside, ranged up with the runner up while four wide to challenge turning for home, could not
match that rival in the drive while also proving no match for the winner inside that one, finished best of the rest. YAZHI OKEUS set or forced the pace for
three furlongs, faltered in the final furlong. SARAH'S GOLDEN broke through the gate twice prior to the start, away sharply, pressed the pace in the two
path, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
AMAVI last away, was outrun early while racing outside, began to steadily advance after a half, outside bid late in the final turn, took over when straightened
for home, edged clear under steady handling. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY in the second flight while racing toward the inside, behind some traffic turning for
home, shifted out a bit for the late going, slowly getting to the winner. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN dueled up front while closest to the inside, edged away to
be clear in the second turn, vied with the winner inside that one entering the straight then began to gradually weaken, could not contain the runner up while
saving the show. MOMENT OF STARDOM within striking distance off the inside, continued in even fashion after losing some position in the second turn,
lacked a closing p unch. WINDSOR ACADEMY dueled early off the inside, chased the leader the middle half then began a steady retreat. F J'S GEM trailed
early, never menaced. MORO PHAROAH finished early, trailed far back.

Footnotes
ROSE CROWN in the second group while saving some ground, continued toward the inside behind the leaders turn, steered out to be three wide for the
drive, roused, late surge to be up in time. MISS UNDERRATED dueled up front while off the inside, put a head in front midway on the turn, continued to hold
that slight advantage past the furlong marker, led late, could not contain the winner while between horses at the end. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE alternated
up front while closest to the inside, held stubbornly past the furlong pole, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair late. LUCKY LINZ went one paced
throughout in lacking a closing response. SWANEE BEACH dwelt at the start to spot the field a few lengths, continued back into the turn, improved slightly
while not a serious threat. SASSY MALLORY in mid pack early, had nothing for the drive. TIZZY'S SONG also dwelt at the start, thrashed when away,
veered out and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULTS WERE ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
PEPPER JACK unhurried early while racing off the inside, tipped out widest while still trailing in upper straight, closed with a rush down the middle of the
course to win going. UNFATHOMED settled in the second flight inside, moved out to the two path for the drive, challenged between rivals inside the furlong
ground, proved no match for the winner late, held sway for the place. ZION away in good order, pressed and dueled in the two path, long drive for the place,
outkicked for that position while outside the runner up. WISH UPON A STAR within striking distance in the second group, lacked a closing kick. COACH
KENNY pinched back at the start, trailed early, displayed a modest amount of interest to improve slightly into the lane, flattened out a bit to finish up evenly.
GIMMEASOUND set the early pace, continued to narrowly show the way into the stretch and past the furlong marker, faltered when headed.

Footnotes
ARGYBARGY BUCK broke back while being bothered, moved inside to press the pace, fell back turn, moved out, rebid, clear late. THE FLUSH KING with
the pace from the start, edged away to a slightly larger advantage late in the turn, continued to hold that advantage while drifting out slightly nearing
midstretch, could not contain the winner late, clearly second best. LIGHTNING HARBOUR void of speed, raced four wide through most of the turn, staged
an outside rally to be along for the show, not a threat to the top two. HOLDEN PASS within striking distance early, fell back in the turn than came up empty
for the stretch run. D'FESTIVE CAT broke out to bother ARGYBAARGY BUCK, fell back and failed to threaten. GENES FEATHER within striking distance
early, moved closer in the turn, began to gave way when the real running began entering the stretch. PER RULING DATED 10/07/2021 RECEIVED FROM
THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #24547), ARGYBARGY BUCK WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BAYOU broke back, was outrun for three furlongs, came widest for the drive, closed with good resolve down the middle of the course to be up in
time. GOLD PUNCH closest to the leader, three path into the lane, challenged between rivals to put a head in front past the furlong marker, proved stubborn
to the end and while unable to contain the winner, gamely held the runner up spot. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU back off the leaders inside, continued to save
ground through the turn while creeping closer, challenged along the rail with a furlong to run, outkicked in the late going, narrowly gained the show.
TACTICAL PRIORITY in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through much of the turn when moving a bit closer, challenged outside the first
flight past the furlong pole, hung in the late going. PURE VALOR in mid pack, improved a bit into the lane, encountered traffic with a furlong to run, managed
some late gain after moving out a bit. I'LL RAISE YOU broke back, continued to lack speed through the turn, displayed some late interest while also
encountering some traffic issues late. VICTORY TRIP sprinted clear to set the pace inside, continued to show the way through the turn and into the straight,
faltered when headed nearing the furlong marker. INCA WARRIOR last away, raced back, closed the gap a bit with some belated interest outside.

Footnotes
NOT ENOUGH BLING took command out of the chute, dueled in the run up the backstretch, put the other speed away by midway on the turn, drew out
through the lane while being kept to task with a steady right handed crop. MISS LAUGHALOT in the second flight inside, improved while saving ground into
the lane, closest to the winner past the furlong marker, no match for that one to the wire, fully extended to hold the place4. US SECOND CUTE PIE also in
the second group, came three wide and evenly paced into the lane, slowly getting to the runner up late, well clear of the others. VELLEITY dueled outside
the winner for just less than a half and began to weaken, continued to fade stretch. PUMP IT last away, raced far back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
long after the issue had been decided. MSCHITCHATTOUR broke back, was never close. ASUKA also was always back.

Footnotes
HOLY WAR broke with the field, fell back, remained well off the pace while in the two path turn, picked way through traffic upper stretch, moved out a bit and
finished with a flourish to be clear at the end. MY LOVELY CHARLIE never far back, dropped to the inside early in the turn, saved ground and lodged a bid
inside entrymate to take command a furlong out, failed to withstand winner, held the place. FLOWERS APRIORITY took control just after the start, showed
the way into and through the turn, allowed entrymate the inside nearing midstretch, also proved no match for the winner late, lasted for the show. SWEET
JACKIELEIGH off a bit slow, moved outside, widest for the drive, finished willingly to be closing for the second spot. WHISKEY TO WINE void of speed for
three furlongs, improved position with some mild, belated interest. CHEYANN GLITTERS broke on top, pressed the pace from the outside, began to weaken
late in the turn, continued to back up through the stretch. LUNA Y SOL prompted the pace while racing outside, gave way. SMART SHELLEY fell back,
trailed far back, jogged in.
