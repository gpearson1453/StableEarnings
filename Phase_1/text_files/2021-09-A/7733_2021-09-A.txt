Footnotes
FAST ONE was sent to a clear lead going to the first turn, allowed to relax on the front end soon after, roused again in the stretch and steadily widened
command while kept to a drive until nearing the wire. UGO raced closest to FAST ONE from the start, stayed in path three throughout, was no match for the
latter when set down for the drive and could only just hold his position late. JOHNNY LONGBOAT hesitated at the start, was settled at the back, advanced
two wide under a drive on the second turn, took the rail in the lane and was closing in for second through the waning yards. TRAVEL ACCOUNT chased
from just off the inside, began to fade along the rail on the second bend, was steadied briefly when his path narrowed at the quarter pole, fanned out some
for the stretch run and continued to yield.

Footnotes
STRATUS STORM was rated from inside on the backstretch, swung out three wide to commence his bid on the bend, battled between rivals upper stretch
then fought inside HOUR NAP midstretch, moved ahead nearing the sixteenth marker and held sway under steady handling. HOUR NAP was away slowly,
picked up his pace after the first quarter mile, swung out four wide on the turn, fought gamely in the stretch, did not have enough left the final sixteenth but
was easily second best. HAYGRINDER broke alertly, gradually made his way to the inside, was challenged on the bend and began to wear down upper
stretch. APPLE VALLEY broke inward, pressed HAYGRINDER from just outside, vied for the lead on the turn but also began to fade upper stretch. HIDE
AND RUN AWAY was a step slow at the break, hustled up from outside, began to bear out on the bend, was pulled up and walked off.

BORA BORA a bit slow at the break, was hustled up from outside, three wide on the bend, gradually angled out as RAHFEE TOWN came out in the lane,
engaged the latter inside the last furlong and edged ahead nearing the wire. RAHFEE TOWN was sent to vie for the early lead from inside, moved clear on
the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, gradually drifted out as he fought to hold on, did not have enough left but was clearly second best. IT'S
BELLAMY TIME displayed early speed outside RAHFEE TOWN, did not keep up from between rivals on the bend and slowly wore down from inside the last
furlong. FANCY EMPRESS in contention early, saved ground taking the turn, angled out for a clear path inside the final eighth and finished evenly. LINE OF
DENHAMS only passed outside tired ones in the stretch. STOSH void of speed, was three then four wide taking the bend and had no late bid. ROLL CALL
chased from outside on the backstretch, was two wide on the turn, fanned out some for the drive and had little to offer. COPPER CROSSING failed to
menace in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
ITALIAN CHARM settled at the back, commenced his bid widest on the bend, rallied under mostly hand urging, gradually lugged in the last eighth and
edged ahead inside the final sixteenth under a well-judged ride. MARCO'S DREAM prominent from inside, waited for room on the turn, got through two wide
entering the lane, edged ahead inside the final furlong, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was clearly second best. GONEGHOST reluctant to
load, was forwardly placed just off the inside once the race began, steadied behind traffic into the bend, altered out on the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, lacked a serious bid but caught R H SMOAKEM for third. R H SMOAKEM disputed the early pace from just off the inside on the backstretch, gained
the rail on the turn, moved clear, was challenged again in the stretch and wore down the last eighth. COME ON DOVER contested the pace just outside R H
SMOAKEM, did not keep up on the bend, floated out some into the stretch and continued to yield. GREAT GRET raced in contention from outside on the
backstretch but faded four wide on the turn.

Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT bumped with ROAD GAME at the break, advanced from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned to path five for the stretch run, vied
for the lead inside the last furlong, edged ahead of GIRLOLAMO'GLORY inside the last sixteenth and kept that one at bay. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY broke on
top but was soon chasing MIND YOUR OWN BIZ from outside, went for the lead on the turn, floated out to path four into the lane, fought gamely between
rivals but had to settle for second best. SIRCORRI without early speed, took the bend two wide, rallied in the stretch, could only make up minor ground late
but caught MIND YOUR OWN BIZ for third. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ reluctant to load, was hustled to a clear early lead once the race began, was challenged
into the lane, floated out some upper stretch and slow wore down the final eighth. SPINSTER ROAD chased from just off or along the rail, swung out for the
drive and failed to have a significant response. ROAD GAME in contention early, saved ground taking the bend then gave way for the stretch run.
BUMPTYBUMPBUMP soon trailed from inside, angled out through the turn, came widest into the lane and had little to offer.

Footnotes
SUSPECT set a pressured pace from inside, was challenged on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, lost the advantage upper stretch, drifted out
some under left-handed urging inside the final furlong, jostled with WISE KHOZAN, edged ahead nearing the sixteenth marker and kept the latter at bay.
WISE KHOZAN pressed SUSPECT from outside, went for the lead on the turn, edged ahead of the latter upper stretch, jostled briefly and forced out some
inside the last eighth, lacked the extra needed in the waning yards but was easily second best. THE LAST OPTION was a step slow at the break, chased
staying off the inside, was widest taking the bend, lacked a rally but gained third deep stretch. HATCHET CREEK in contention early from outside, advanced
two wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, was no match for the top pair and weakened the final eighth. MACHO CLASSIC well placed from
inside, did not respond to urging along the rail on the bend and steadily faded the last quarter mile. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
VENETIAN DREAM took the advantage from outside midway on the backstretch, drew clear after a quarter mile, was roused with two furlongs to go, floated
out entering the lane then gradually opened up under a drive. COOL AMBITION commenced his bid from inside on the turn, moved clear for second upper
stretch, proved no match for VENETIAN DREAM the last furlong but lasted for the place. VENKMAN void of speed, though hustled along from the early
going, saved ground taking the bend, rallied belatedly the last furlong, angled outside COOL AMBITION deep stretch and caught ABSTRACT PAYNTER for
third in the waning yards. ABSTRACT PAYNTER chased from outside, was three wide taking the urn, angled out for a clear path upper stretch, took over
third inside the final eighth but leveled off in the late going. MY CURBY moved to the outside early on, was widest through the bend and had no late bid.
YABA DABA DOO chased from between horses, had a striking position two wide on the turn but gave way for the drive. CREAL WONDER displayed early
speed from inside, moved outside VENETIAN DREAM after a quarter mile, stayed outside that one entering the lane and steadily faded from between rivals.
