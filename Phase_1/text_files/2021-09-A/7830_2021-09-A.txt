TAP A MIRACLE was behind a wall of three horses in the turn came through along the inside came out a bit through the lane but held on gamely for the win.
PREFERRED PROSPECT raced three wide the entire race took a brief lead outside the eventual winner but could not hold off that rival. LET IT RIP was
well off the pace early came to the two path on the second turn and made a late run to get third. LAST CALL LEROY set the pace on the rail came off the
rail entering the stretch to allow the winner to come through and then tired. NO PROBLEMO was four wide on the first turn and two wide through the lane
and could not make up ground. DESPOTIC attended the pace in the two path but gave way on the second turn. The mile fraction was unavailable.

BAUDETTE BLIZZARD challenged for the lead along the inside and edged clear late while while not asking for best. CREAKY CRICKET battled for the lead
from the outset from the two path and held gamely while no match for the winner in the final yards. XAVIER DAVEY came three wide entering the stretch
and was up for third while never a threat to the top two. DANCE FOR RANSOM raced in the two path for much of the race and could not make up ground.
PENCE was well off the pace and made a three wide bid but could not make up ground. MASTERPIECE DAY was away slow spotting the field three
lengths and was not a factor after that. SILENT SANCHO was up close for the first quarter along the inside and then steadily faded.
