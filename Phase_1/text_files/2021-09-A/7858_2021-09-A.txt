Footnotes
POINT WILD settled two wide through early stages, angled out turning for home, came four paths wide into the lane then launched a bid at the quarter pole,
roused forward three deep and took the lead at the eighth pole then widened advantage while ridden out. COUNTRY TIME applied pace pressure to CODE
NAME LISA around the turn then vied for the lead at the head of the lane, could not move on with the winner a furlong out but stayed on with response and
held place. TRICK HAT was allowed to settle, tipped out and picked up the pace leaving the turn, was set down four wide in stretch run, angled in a couple
paths near the eighth pole and just missed place. CODE NAME LISE set a pressured pace, vied for the lead with COUNTRY TIME in the upper stretch then
got collared by the winner and gave way. FORGOT PASSWORD raced in range saving ground, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, raced in
contention then finished evenly. FLORIS rated outside through early stages, moved up a bit closer late on the turn, went six paths wide into the lane, made
a bid down the stretch but lacked the needed response for serious impact. YABA DABA DIVA was allowed to settle through early stages, hustled along five
wide at the quarter pole and had no response. CHLOE RENE prompted the pace through early stages, remained forwardly placed around the turn then
retreated. ISABIS saved ground around the turn and never menaced.

the lane, responded willingly when roused near the quarter pole, quickly cleared on top and finished going away. CHARLES CHROME settled through early
stages, launched a five wide bid down the stretch, angled in three wide under pressure and stayed on for second best. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS matched
strides for the early lead while racing in hand, saved ground entering the lane then roused for more at the quarter pole, was no match when the winner took
over but sustained response and held show. ISLAND COMMISH was forwardly placed through early stages, vied three wide at the quarter pole, battled on
to the furlong marker then gave way. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL settled and saved ground around the turn, hustled up the inside then two wide in the lane
and lacked a needed rally. MIDNIGHT PATRIOT raced near midpack, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SPECTACULAR GEM was not
too far back around the turn, tipped out wider in the upper stretch and failed to move on. GET WESTERN steadied along while headstrong in early stages,
saved ground then shifted five wide and never threatened. TOHUI vied for the lead in opening stages, dueled around the turn then came up empty in the
lane.

Footnotes
CAMELLIA GAL was forwardly placed three wide through early stages, edged up closer leaving the turn, went four paths wide into the lane, raced in aim for
the lead in the upper stretch then cleared on top at the eighth pole, stayed on with response and held firm. TEXAS SHUFFLE rated off the early pace,
launched a wide bid at the quarter pole, rallied into close contention, angled in closer and continued to dig in up close but could not reach the winner.
OLLIE'S GOLD vied for the lead with UYUNI, battled on into the upper stretch, got collared by the winner near the furlong marker but continued to put in
effort and secured a share. I HEAR YOU was unhurried, saved ground into the lane, launched an inside bid at the quarter pole and had a mild improve.
ALYDIVA settled through early stages, was ridden along five wide in the upper stretch, raced four deep in the final sixteenth and needed more for impact.
COMMANDERS PALACE raced near midpack then crept up closer late on the turn, hustled up and raced in contention in the upper stretch then weakened
in the final furlong. REINECKE saved ground into the lane, was ridden along the rail in the stretch run and lacked a needed rally. UYUNI vied outside of rival
through early stages, battled on around the turn then faded in the lane. DREAMFUL was allowed to settle, saved ground into the lane and never threatened.
JAZZY LADY trailed through early stages and never factored in late stages. POLKA POLENTA raced in range through middle stages then faded in the lane.
MISS ADELINE raced off the pace, ridden along six wide in the upper stretch and had no response.

Footnotes
LADY OF LUXURY set the pace by a comfortable margin through early stages, remained on top in hand heading into the lane, came off the inside and
roused for more near mid-stretch, responded gamely, turned back the inside bid from STRONG ODOR and held firm under a strong hand ride. STRONG
ODOR was allowed to settle inside while never far from the frontend, tipped out two wide at the head of the lane, moved back inside approaching the eighth
pole and launched a bid for LADY OF LUXURY, sustained a solid in late stages but could not get to the game winner. BEANTOWN BABY was unhurried
and settle off the early pace, went five paths wide into the lane, gained closer contention then switched in a couple paths at the eighth pole, sustained a
steady bid in late stages and secured show. SHORT SUMMER DRESS stalked the pacesetter, was ridden along three wide into the stretch then launched a
bid at the quarter pole, raced in contention then evened out. MUCHA MEZQUINA was allowed to settle in the back, was ridden along five wide down the
stretch and failed to move on. JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) tracked the early pace, remained up close three wide late on the turn then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
RED DANGER was well rated while never too far off the pace in early stages, was ridden along three wide around the turn then came out wider for the
drive, roused forward and dueled with KAUFYMAKER at the eighth pole, dug in under a left handed drive and edged away. ROMANCER raced off the early
pace, began to pick up the tempo late on the turn, roused five wide into the lane, steadily edged up closer and gained second best. KAUFYMAKER raced
three wide up close around the turn, roused forward and vied for the lead in the upper stretch, fought back gamely when confronted by the winner with a
furlong left to run then had no closing kick left in reserve. BONUS APPRECIATION raced off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted to the
outside in the upper stretch and had a mild improve. MASSETO (GB) chased the pace around the turn, was ridden along two to three wide at the quarter
pole and failed to move on. VODKA N WATER vied for the lead in opening stages and battled on around the turn then came up tired in the drive. ZIP IT
SCOTTY chased the pace inside around the turn then retreated in the lane. BAYTOWN WARRIOR drifted out after the start, moved up to duel for the early
lead then came up empty in the lane.

HENDY WOODS stalked the top two leaders along the outside, edged up closer and given cue in the upper stretch, poked a head on front at the eighth pole
then finished going away. SWEET MELANIA vied for the early lead, shook clear heading into the lane, fought back when challenged by the winner at the
furlong marker, was no match in late stages but sustained a steady bid for second best. ALTA'S AWARD settled off the early pace, launched a five wide bid
near the quarter pole, angled in closer under left handed pressure and got up for show. PASS THE PLATE raced off the pace, hustled up five wide at the
head of the lane, gained closer contention then finished evenly and got edged for show. DOMINGA rated not far off the early pace, dropped inside late on
the turn, headed in pursuit along the rail in the upper stretch, raced in range but lacked the needed response for late impact. ENGLISH AFFAIR raced off the
pace, saved ground around the turn, hustled up two wide in the upper stretch and passed tiring foes. ELEGANT DE DOMINO was ridden along near midpak
around the turn then gave way in the lane. I'LLHANDALTHECASH vied outside through early stages, battled on around the turn then came up empty
entering the lane. WITEZ failed to move into close contention. TAMMANY raced in early contention then faded leaving the turn. TONALIST'S SHAPE trailed
throughout and jogged in.

pursuit of the leader, dug in under steady pressure then edged away leaving the sixteenth pole. CIRCLE BACK JACK prompted the early pace, vied for the
lead late on the turn, battled on down the stretch, held a slim lead at the furlong marker then got collared by the winner in late stretch and settled for second
best. ADMIRAL HALSEY broke sharp then edged back into tracking position, launched a bid at the quarter pole, gained closer contention with furlong left to
run and stayed on for show. RUM 'N TONIC raced near midpack, hustled up five wide at the head of the lane, dug in along the outside, drifted in under right
handed pressure past the furlong marker then evened out. MIRIFICUS settled through early stages, hustled along three to four wide in the drive, split foes at
the sixteenth pole and had a mild improve. PRAYFORPEACE vied for the early lead, dueled into upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. ATRAS
