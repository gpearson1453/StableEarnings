WATFORD was allowed to settle early, angled out six wide through the turn, was gaining late and was up in time. BONFIRE PARTY set a pressured early
pace, raced off the rail into the turn, lost the lead angled out, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. LATENITE GOLD was outrun early,
raced five wide into the turn, angled in and finished evenly late. RIGHT JAB was reserved early, raced along the inside into the turn, angled out and finished
belatedly. GUY IN THE SKY chased the early pace, went four wide into the turn and weakened. QUANTUM BULL was up close early, went six wide into the
turn and faded. BRIGHT WAY raced in mid pack early from between rivals and offered no late rally. ORGULLO MIO was unhurried early, raced nine wide
into the turn and never fired. K B'S KROME was void of speed and retreated.

LEMON DROP GOLD was allowed to settle early, raced six wide into the turn, drifted out mid stretch, was gaining late and was up in time. QUESTA
pressed the early pace, went four wide into the turn, angled to the inside, took a brief lead, couldn't hold off the winner and just missed. INDIAN
FIREBLOSSOM raced in mid pack early, advanced seven wide and finished belatedly. ROYAL QUEEN was outrun early, went eight wide through the turn
and offered no late rally. RAGTIME RYTHM set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail and faded. ATHENA'S STORM stalked the early pace from the
inside and was empty late. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was always outrun.
