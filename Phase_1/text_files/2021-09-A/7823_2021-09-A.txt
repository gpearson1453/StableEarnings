Footnotes
TOWARDS THE LIGHT stalked close up through the turn engaging three deep in upper stretch extending to edge clear late. MASKED pressured the pace
dueling along the inside through the turn then down the lane ceding to wide pressure while holding well in the two path. SHACKLEFORDS STORM pressed
a narrow lead abreast rival through the turn extending between horses the final eighth coming up a touch short. NO WAY NEVER (IRE) chased the pace
angling to mid track in upper stretch needing but not finding a final push. TROUBLE X TWO slow early saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly along
the rail. SLEEPING GIANT a step slow early played no factor. APPROVETHISMESSAGE was never involved. ALASAAL played no factor.
