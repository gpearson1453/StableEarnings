stretch. GALILEO'S AFFAIR dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. ROSE OF DUBLIN raced wide after the pace, moved very wide on
the final turn and stretch. SPECTACULAR NOW moved clear inside briefly, vied down the backstretch and stopped. COTTON CANDY CUTIE prompted the

Footnotes
NEON CITY settled early, split foes advancing, swung wide in the stretch and drew away while kept to her task. LET'S CELEBRATE moved clear before
half a mile, was collared into the stretch but continued willingly. BOHEMIA BABE raced inside just off the leaders, bid on the final turn then came up empty
late. PEGASUS IN FLIGHT trailed for half a mile, moved wide in the stretch and closed well. TREASURE SEEKER prompted the pace outside for half a
mile and weakened. BOHEMIAN DANCER broke slowest, raced far back then gained inside stretch. CREATIVE JOY lacked speed and was never in
contention. CRIMSON LILLE was taken up fading into the far turn and continued to falter. SONG SAVER reserved within range in the two path then gave
way readily. MISBEHAVING LADY chased wide for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

AMERICAN FLEET forced the pace outside, took over at the five sixteenths pole and edged away under moderate urging. OPEN LENGTHS saved ground
behind the pacesetters, angled out in the stretch and finished gamely for the place. DIGGERS DIAMOND settled outside, moved wider into the stretch then
flattened out. MITHRA lagged far behind and advanced inside with some late energy. DENNARD reserved well back inside, bid wide on the final turn then
faded. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE set a pressured pace inside to midway on the final turn and tired. COMMISSIONER DAVE lagged far behind and was
always outrun.

TIZ GRACIE quickly moved clear then widened throughout while kept under a drive. EXCITABLE LADY chased the winner between rivals and continued
willingly while no threat. BILLIEANNE dropped well behind then advanced near the inside through the stretch. GLOWING STAR raced off the pace, moved
wider on the turn and lacked a solid bid. TOMARIE trailed for half a mile then passed tiring rivals. THREE POTATOE FOUR prompted the pace three wide
for half a mile and faded. DISCREET SISTER was urged just off the leaders inside and stopped.

Footnotes
INSTINCTIVE rated off the pace, angled wide into the stretch and surged late to get up in time. KIND HUMOR well placed under a hold, bid inside then
closed outside through the stretch but was outfinished. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE prompted the pace three wide, went after the leader on the turn, led in the
stretch but was nailed nearing the wire. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE well back wide, advanced late while no threat. MADAME ROUGE hustled to the front inside
for five furlongs and faltered. FED POLICY dropped far back inside and failed to threaten. TIPSY CHATTER raced off the pace and lacked a rally.
CONFIRMED GENIUS fanned extremely wide into the first turn and was always far back. SWEET TURN forced the pace between rivals to the far turn and
stopped. Due to a timing issue the six furlongs fraction was omitted.
