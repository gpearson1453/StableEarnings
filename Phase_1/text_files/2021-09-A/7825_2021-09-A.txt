Footnotes
COMMISSIONER BIGGS was never far back outside, improved position three wide around the turn, took over from the outside nearing the final sixteenth
and held under urging. TRADERS LUCK stumbled badly leaving the gate, advanced inside into tight quarters, was steadied nearing the turn, checked
sharply entering the turn, came out two wide between rivals then continued gamely. FLASHINTHENIGHT showed speed outside from the start, moved to
the front early on the turn, ran out entering the stretch then faded from between the top two. ANY SUGAR HONEY ducked out into ROLL ON DUDE leaving
the gate, stayed just out from the inside while making the pace to the turn then stopped in the lane. ROLL ON DUDE was bumped soundly leaving the gate
then trailed.

BAZINGA C was rated outside with the pace, moved clear into the stretch and drew away in hand. JEANETTEO was hustled inside to press the winner then
couldn't keep up through the lane. NATURE TRAIL wasn't far back early, raced two wide between rivals around the turn then drifted badly through late
stretch. AUTOMATED TELLER broke slowly, was unhurried inside, angled to the outside in early stretch, continued to angle out through the lane and
gained too late. An objection by Diaz against the third finisher was not allowed. PEACEMON was close up along the rail to the turn then tired. FAIRY
DREAMS bobbled a stride out of the gate then was outrun. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN lagged badly early and never caught up. ASGATA briefly showed

LIGHTNIN leaving the gate, moved clear soon after, stayed out from the rail around the turn, drifted late and faltered. DOLLARIZATION wasn't far back in
the three path but lacked the needed rally. JOHNY LIGHTNIN was bumped leaving the gate, chased in the two path then weakened. MACHO SMOKE
made a mild run along the rail on the turn but failed to matter. ECONOMIC POWER was hard handled while trying to bear out on the backstretch, bore out
into the winner on the turn then stopped. LONG TOM was outrun.
