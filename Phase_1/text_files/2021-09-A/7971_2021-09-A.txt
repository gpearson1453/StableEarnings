Footnotes
CAVE CREEK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing three wide around the turn, chased the
frontrunner in upper stretch and wore down that rival on the outside in the final strides to get up for the win. BOSSY SNOW PEA broke sharply and opened
up a clear lead on the field in the opening quarter of a mile, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch
and raced evenly down the lane, getting caught by a closer late. LEXI SUMMER trailed the field on the outside in the early going, raced in the two path
around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved position in upper stretch, cut in with a furlong to go and continued to gain ground
between horses from there. COOKIN ROSES hit the gate leaving it, recovered to chase the leader on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. TOUCH BY FELICTY chased the frontrunner on the outside in the opening stages, saved ground
while running in the middle of the pack around the turn and faded in the stretch. LA GUERRERITA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SHE'S WANDAFUL was sent for speed, prompted the pace outside of TIZALADYBUG, stalked two wide on the turn, bid outside the pacesetter approaching
the quarter, vied two wide in upper stretch, put her away nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a mild drive. MY BOSS LADY settled toward the rear
inside, took closer order approaching the half, chased in the two path on the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, and chased on while drifting in
late to prove best of the rest. U CAN DO IT came out in the opening strides, chased the leading trio down the backstretch, kept on four wide in the chasing
group around the turn, proved no match for the leading pair into the lane, was carried out slightly by MY BOSS LADY approaching midstretch, chased on
willingly but was outfinished for place. TIZALADYBUG broke inward, set the pace inside while prompted by SHE'S WANDAFUL, saved ground through the
turn while still setting a pressured pace, was engaged by SHE'S WANDAFUL approaching the quarter, vied with her inside in upper stretch, proved no
match approaching the eighth pole and flattened out. NURSE SADIE came in on ROYAL MISSION in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the
three to four path on the turn, took closer order past the three eighths, and lacked the needed kick while drifting out under a drive in the lane. ROYAL
MISSION was squeezed between horses in the opening strides, advanced to track the leading pair down the backstretch, went to a drive while chasing
between horses on the turn, stopped at the five sixteenths and faded.

ENGLISH dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle while racing in the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and held her margin to the wire under a drive. JOAN'S WAY raced off the pace in the early going, began a bid from the two path nearing the three
eighths pole, found room on the rail to continue gaining entering the stretch, and chased the eventual winner home, no match for that rival.
COLOROFACLOUD trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the turn, and
continued to gain ground on the outside down the lane. SHARP HERO dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening half mile, pulled ahead to
lead by a half length while racing in the three path around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. FOX ABLE

AKA LIONESS settled at the rear early, improved inside near the five eighths, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn, rallied three wide into
upper stretch, caught RULER DAENERYS just past the furlong mark, and held sway under a mild drive. RULER DAENERYS attended the pace inside the
leading flight early, engaged inside of VALERIE VALESKI near the nine sixteenths, set the pace inside around the turn while heavily pressured by VALERIE
VALESKI, shook that foe off into the lane, was soon engaged by AKA LIONESS, proved no match for that foe past the furlong pole but kept on willingly
inside to prove clearly second best. VALERIE VALESKI was lightly bumped by NEVE DE LUA in the opening strides, disputed the early pace inside of TIKA
TOY, continued to vie outside of RULER DAENERYS past the nine sixteenths, pressed two wide outside of that foe around the turn, proved no match past
the quarter pole, but chased on well enough to hold the show. STARLET WARRIOR bobbled in the opening strides, settled near the rear early, was
relegated to the rear past the five eighths as AKA LIONESS began to improve, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven in the three to four path in
upper stretch, lacked the needed kick but passed a tiring horse. LADY X FACTOR chased between horses early, chased well off the leading trio in the two
path on the turn, was driven in the two path in upper stretch but flattened out in the lane. NEVE DE LUA came inward in the opening strides and bumped
VALERIE VALESKI lightly, chased three deep early, was driven in the five path on the turn while racing toward the rear, continued in the five path into the
lane, offered no response and was not persisted with late. TIKA TOY disputed the early pace outside of VALERIE VALESKI, began to lose ground past the
nine sixteenths, continued to fade in the three to four path on the turn and was not persevered with late.

IOYA AGAIN saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, swung out in upper
stretch and gained ground quickly on the outside down the lane, to get up for the win in the final strides. PADDY'S HOUSE raced in the three path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, gained
ground in upper stretch, was squeezed in tight quarters with a furlong to go when COMING UP ACES drifted over, and finished well, just missing.
IWILLPERSEVERE raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up while racing in the four path around the far
turn, gained ground steadily down the lane and just missed. COMING UP ACES was content to chase the leader from the two path around the first turn and
up the backstretch, raced between horses headed into the far turn, began a bid passing the three eighths pole, kicked clear entering the stretch, dueled
down the lane while drifting out and was caught late. ADMIRAL RETURNS saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the far turn between horses in the three path, gained ground from the rail in upper stretch and finished evenly. ANDREAS saved
ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, gained ground
mildly in upper stretch and was outkicked. EMPTY HOLSTER sprinted to a clear early lead while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the

Footnotes
LOCASH settled at the rear of the main pack, took closer order near the half, raced at the rear of a more compact main group in the three to four path
around the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive, led near the furlong mark and cleared. TWELVE RED ROSES chased the leading
pair two wide through the first turn, chased the leading pair down the backstretch, took closer order on the leading pair near the half mile mark, bid in
earnest in the five path past the three eighths, came five wide into upper stretch, took the lead near the three sixteenths, carried a narrow lead to midstretch,
proved no match for LOCASH just inside the eighth pole, chased on and held the place. IMAGINE GOLD chased toward the rear of the main group, took
closer order approaching the far turn, chased in the two path around the far turn, rallied inside in upper stretch, was taken two wide midstretch, improved
well late and just missed the place. GIRLS COUNT chased the leading pair inside of TWELVE RED ROSES around the clubhouse turn, chased inside down
the backstretch and in the pocket around the far turn, bid inside into upper stretch, led momentarily before being headed by TWELVE RED ROSES near the
three sixteenths, and flattened inside under a drive. ALOTMOREACTION chased two wide through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, chased
in the three path around the far turn, was taken five wide into upper stretch, and lacked the needed kick. COUGER pressed the pace two wide through the
clubhouse turn, dueled outside of SUPREME IRENE down the backstretch and while racing in the four path on the second turn, raced into the lane three
wide with the leading line, was swarmed from upper stretch and weakened under a drive. SUPREME IRENE led inside into the clubhouse turn while
pressured by COUGER, dueled inside that foe down the backstretch and around the far turn, raced into the lane two wide with the leading line and emptied
out from upper stretch. BIRD KEY soon trailed, took both turns in the four to five path while gradually losing ground on the field throughout, and was never
involved. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THERE IS NO HALF-MILE TIME.

BOURRE' TRICK tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn, raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued around the
far turn in the two path, launched a bid entering the stretch, gained ground between horses down the lane and dueled gamely to get his head in front at the
wire. DYNABLUE dueled for the lead on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and
dueled gamely the length of the stretch, just missing the win. RAVE ON stalked the leaders from the three path around the first turn, raced outside in the
middle of the pack through the next quarter of a mile, navigated the far turn from the three and four path, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch,
could not go with the top two late and was the best of the rest. BIGGIE dueled for lead from the three path through the opening quarter of a mile, took over
the lead while racing up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
MULSANNE (IRE) raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began a mild bid from the three path
nearing the three eighths pole, and flattened out in the stretch. ROCKET HOTSHOT swerved in leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground around
the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the far turn and continued to pass tiring horses while drifting out in the
stretch. DASTARDLY DEEDS bobbled leaving the gate, raced into traffic and steadied slightly headed into the first turn, saved ground from there, chased
the pace setters between horses up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the three path and faded from there. MUCHOMATIC broke slowly and
angled in sharply to race in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two
path and made no bid. STORM'S REFLECTION raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back
while racing in the two path around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAJOR WAGER attended the pace three wide early, bid to take the lead just past the three eighths while positioned four wide, kept a narrow lead through
the rest of the turn as KENNESAW continued inside and just behind him, vied outside of KENNESAW from upper stretch, and edged away in the final
sixteenth. STAR OF KODIAK chased the leading line three wide early, was positioned four wide on the turn while chasing the leading line, chased the
leading pair four wide in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong, and got up for place three wide in the final jump. KENNESAW set a pressured pace inside
early, was headed by MAJOR WAGER past the three eighths, attended inside him through the rest of the turn, vied for the lead inside that foe from upper
stretch, flattened from the sixteenth pole, and was nailed for the place. HERE COMES KYLE chased the leading line between horses down the backstretch
and through the turn, raced three wide into the lane and chased the leading pair, rallied between horses in the final furlong but was outkicked for the place.
ROYAL COMMISH settled toward the rear outside of NAVY SEAL, continued in the three path around the bend, swung six wide into upper stretch, and
rallied mildly. NAVY SEAL settled toward the rear inside of ROYAL COMMISH, raced in the two path inside that foe around the turn, swung four wide into
upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE chased the leading line inside of horses down the backstretch and in the two path on the
turn, was driven in upper stretch but outpaced by the leaders, and took mildly closer order late. OMAR ATTACK settled at the rear, saved ground through
the turn, took mildly closer order two wide in the lane but ultimately proved no threat. OL GREY GHOST was sent for pace between horses, hounded the
leader while racing between horses down the backstretch, continued to attend the pace between horses in the leading flight around the turn, began to flatten
near the five sixteenths and was empty in the lane.
