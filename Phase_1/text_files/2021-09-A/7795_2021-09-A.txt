Footnotes
COLOSI stalked the pace from inside, bid along the fence inside the trop trio past on the second bend, kicked clear leaving the turn and drew off under
urging. LUCK OF THE DRAW broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked off the inside, bid four deep around the far turn, chased the winner four wide
into the lane and outkicked PALACE COUP for second. PALACE COUP broke in and was quickly corrected, was closest in pursuit to the outside of the
pacesetter, bid three deep between rivals on the far turn, could not match strides with the winner leaving the bend, fought with LUCK OF THE DRAW for
place honors and got bested for that award. FEAST got bumped from outside the start then sprinted clear, set the pace to the far turn, challenged from both
sides past the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished command to COLOSI and was outfinished for the place and show. MISSISSIPPI went five wide into the first
turn then eased down to the rail around the bend, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. ROYAL INSIDER got knocked into rival at the start,
traveled three wide throughout and tired. GRAY MAGICIAN went four wide through both turns and lacked a rally in the lane.

Footnotes
IL CAPITANO sped clear and controlled the pace through the early going, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, turned away foe into the stretch and
remained clear to the wire. PERCOLATE (IRE) stalked outside a rival early, bid alongside the leader with a quarter mile remaining, could not keep up at the
top of the lane and stayed on to hold the place. LOOKOUT POINT off slow from inside, stalked along the rail, two wide on the far turn and finished evenly.
BIRTH OF COOL broke slow, settled near the back, went three deep into the far turn, five wide exiting the bend, altered out in upper stretch and improved
position. NOBLE UNION off slow and brushed with inside rival at the start, raced well off the pace early on, came three wide into the drive and lacked rally.
CORSICA FLAVOR off slow, brushed and lost path at the start, angled to the inside, tipped two wide on the second bend, split foes at the three-sixteenths
pole and lacked a rally. HAPPY RUNNER closest in pursuit early, lost ground on the far turn and weakened along the inside. CLASSICALLY angled in on
the first turn, moved out on the second bend, came four wide into the stretch, clipped heels behind HONOR AWARD, then altered out and coasted to the
wire. HONOR AWARD traveled in mid-pack off the inside, driven three wide into the lane, injured upper stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BARBWIRE bothered a bit by STREET RUCKUS shortly after the start, went four then three wide around the turn, went four deep on the backstretch,
moved up to chase outside the top pair, bid three deep on the second bend, dueled with STREET RUCKUS in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. STREET
RUCKUS up close early outside the lead, bid between on the second bend, held a short lead with a furlong to go, dueled with BARBWIRE late and was
edged in the closing moments. WHO'S THE STAR got squeezed between foes early, went three to four wide around the far turn, came four wide into the
drive and finished willingly for the show. MONGOLIAN FORD sped clear and steered to the inside, showed the way through the early going, vied for the lead
around the far turn and into the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and weakened late. STAR SAILOR stalked the pace on the inside, drive two wide
into the lane and lacked a late bid. A. P. PHAROAH tracked in the two path then moved out for the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to
menace. MAGNIFICENT pulled into a tight spot on the first turn, steadied briefly nearing the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the second bend and
weakened. JEDI MASTER fractious in the gate, tracked off the rail, steadied briefly three deep at the nine-sixteenths, trailed into the far turn, eased in the
lane and walked off.

BEYOND BRILLIANT off alertly and moved to the rail, responded when tested by COTOPAXI on the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew away
under urging. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) stalked the pace from between rivals, exited the far turn two wide while outside a runner, tipped out in the lane and
ran on to be second best. COTOPAXI (IRE) forwardly placed outside the leader, drew alongside on the far turn, kept the pressure on through the bend, lost
contact in upper stretch and flattened to third. WYFIRE stalked along the inside, asked with a quarter mile to run, put to right-handed urging in upper stretch
and failed to respond. NUMERO DIX (GB) settled in the two path, spun four wide into the stretch and never threatened. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) got
bumped leaving the gate, unhurried at the back on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and made no impact. BEROLIJEAN (FR) stalked the pace three
deep early, driven two wide into the lane, raced between rivals in the drive and weakened. OPTIMISTIC VALOR broke in and bumped rival at the start,
raced three wide around the first turn, moved out and traveled four deep at the seven-sixteenths, went four then three wide around the second bend and
weakened.

Footnotes
HAY JUAN away quickly from the gate, showed the way up the backstretch with company to the outside, cleared rival around the turn, asked upper stretch
and put to left-handed urging to remain clear to the wire. HEAVEN'S MUSIC stalked the top pair in the early stages, took aim at the leader on the turn,
chased the winner through the final furlong and while unable to threaten late was clearly second best. CHRIS FIX was off slow to begin, chased outside a
trio of rivals, navigated the turn five wide and bested the rest. MEDINA MAN tracked three deep up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and never
rallied. SUMMANUS chased along the inside to the lane and made no impact. NATIONWIDE PRIDE off slow to begin, tracked off the rail to the stretch and
failed to rally. EYE CANDY RANDY stumbled leaving the gate, went up to prompt the pace from outside, could not keep up with the winner around the turn,
raced four to five wide leaving the bend and faded. MONDALE stumbled a bit at the start, chased off the pace, two wide into the turn, three wide into the
drive and prove no menace. BIG SPEECH tossed his head and came away slow to begin, dropped back on the backstretch, angled in around the turn and
was never a factor.

deep up the backstretch, three to two wide around the turn and could not find more to threaten the winner. ANONYMOUSLY fractious in the gate, raced up
close on the inside, saved ground into the stretch, could not find more in deep stretch and saved the show. VEGAS PALM tracked off the pace, exited the
bend three wide and missed the show. FANTAIL (GB) chased along the inside to the stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. SEPTEMBER SECRET
chased three deep early, put in tight quarters and checked at the seven-sixteenths, moved to the inside to save ground and improved position. ALTHEA
GIBSON chased four deep early, was crowded near the seven-sixteenths pole, lacked room on the turn and upper stretch, tipped out to a clear path and
could not regain momentum. DEISE DELIGHT (IRE) forwardly placed up the backsretch, driven two wide into the lane and weakened. SHE'S SO NICE
(IRE) brushed inner rival at the start, tracked outside foes up the backstretch, went three wide into the lane and flattened out. VALPOLICELLA (GB) chased
between rivals, dropped back around the bend, moved out in the lane and had little left. ROSES AND CANDY dropped back off the pace, came four wide
into the lane and was never a factor. DONUT GIRL off slow to begin, trailed two wide into the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LAUREL RIVER sped to the front, cleared and angled to the inside, set the pace to the far turn, drew away late on the second bend, urged a bit with a
furlong to go and widened while ridden out to the wire. DIVINE ARMOR settled off the pace, went three to four wide into the lane and rallied for the place.
INDIMAAJ chased LAUREL RIVER outside a rival, exited the far turn two wide, lacked the needed bid and got outfinished for the show. BUTKUS forwardly
placed outside the leader, chased near the inside into the lane and faded. PROVERB stumbled badly at the start, trailed through the early going, came three
wide into the stretch and was never a factor. DIRECT LINE stalked the pace from inside, dropped back around the far turn and had little left for the stretch
run.

MACKINNON brushed from outside at the start, stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, roused three wide around the far turn, rallied outside the top pair and
drove clear. THIRTY FOUR COUPE hopped the start but recovered quickly, went up to duel for the lead then inched clear around the bend, met the
challenge from OPTIMISING with a quarter mile remaining, maintained a short lead into the furlong grounds, yielded to the winner in the final sixteenth and
held on for the place. SILVER SURFER (GB) settled in mid-pack early on, went between foes with three-eighths remaining, chased two wide into the
stretch, lacked room near the sixteenth pole, angled to the inside and missed the place. OPTIMISING (IRE) dueled for the lead into the first turn,
relinquished the lead around the bend, chased the pacesetter to the far turn, bid outside near the quarter pole, fought outside THIRTY FOUR COUPE to
deep stretch but could not find the needed late kick. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL brushed MACKINNON at the start, reserved in the early going, went three wide
into the far turn, four wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more. MOGOLLON RIM broke in and bumped rival at the
start, stalked the pace on the inside to the stretch and faded out of contention. SOCAL RED sat off the pace, went three wide through the turns and was
always outrun. SHORTMAN turned his head and came away slow, trailed through the early stages, went three wide into the drive and was not a factor. MY
MANE CHAMP got bumped from outside at the start, raced two wide then angled to the inside, remained near the fence and failed to menace.

PINEHURST brushed with FINNEUS at the start, went up to take control set the pace up the backstretch, cleared rivals again at the five-sixteenths pole,
inched away in upper stretch and padded the margin under left-handed urging. FINNEUS bumped between runners at the start, became rank leaving the
chute, went four deep into the lane and finished willingly for the place. AMERICAN XPERIMENT away quickly to begin then settled in a stalking position
three deep behind the leader, continued three deep into the drive, bumped with MURRAY in upper stretch and kept on to gain the show. PAPPACAP
ducked to the inside in the chute, rated along the inside up the backstretch, lost a bit of ground on the turn, given his cue with a quarter mile remaining,
moved out in the lane and faltered in deep stretch. MURRAY forwardly placed between rivals to the stretch, bumped with AMERICAN XPERIMENT in upper
stretch, lost his path with a furlong to go and weakened. OLYMPIC LEGEND bobbled and got brushed lightly at the start, trailed four wide through the turn
and came up empty.

Footnotes
CANE CREEK ROAD showed keen early foot and opened up on the backstretch, held a diminished lead but remained comfortable through the second
bend, led into deep stretch, then got run down from both sides but won the bob at the wire. GENERAL MATHIS angled to the inside early, traveled along the
rail then tipped out in upper stretch, angled back to the inside and rallied late, put a nose in front just before the wire but lost the bob on the line. ZIPPY
BABY tracked the pace in the two path, took aim two wide around the far turn, chased through the lane under urging, summoned a late bid three deep but
was not enough. OX BRIDGE tracked along the inside, shifted out and came two wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and flattened while earning a
minor award. TEMBO tossed his head head leaving the gate, steered out in upper stretch and failed to make an impact. ALGERIA (IRE) off a bit slow to
begin, angled down to the two path, went outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, angled out in the stretch
and lacked a rally. MUAY THAI (IRE) moved to the inside early, angled three wide leaving the second bend, asked in the drive but offered no response.
STONE'S RIVER was closest in pursuit to the three-eighths, chased from the rail through the second bend and weakened. BROTHER REID went two wide
around the first turn, trailed into the stretch, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.
