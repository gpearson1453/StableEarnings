Footnotes
THORN OF ROSE HILL rated close to the early pace about the three path, rallied to even terms toward the quarter pole and dueled for the lead two deep
approaching the top of the lane, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on well. MIKI raced in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, bid
past the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage three wide on the far turn but dug in through the stretch to take second the final strides.
TWENTYTWENTY stalked the early pace off the rail then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod at the three eighths pole but was met
approaching the quarter, raced at the rail on the turn and continued close through the upper stretch, though, gave up second in the final strides. MINI BOLT
settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then weakened into the stretch.
ROCKET COLONY saved ground off the pace, faded past the five sixteenths pole then lost ground on the far turn and entered the stretch about the six
path. WINTER IS HERE tapered in and took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole then rated the pace, was met past the seven sixteenths, gave up the
nod at the three eighths and weakened at the rail on the far turn.

backstretch and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and had to settle for second best. DEJOHN stalked off the rail
the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and ran at the rail on the far turn, though, showed little further. ADIOS SEE YA steadied
early and raced in the four path the first turn, was well off the pace into the backstretch and showed little response. ROLLIN angled to the four path into the

CRYPTOBLUE angled in and pressured the pace, contested the turn at a close disadvantage two deep then dug in through the stretch to take the nod later
yards. ROCKET BLUE drew clear and angled to the inside to set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was headed inside the
sixteenth pole and grudgingly ceded later yards. SPRING DELIGHT was shuffled back leaving the chute then again past the seven sixteenths pole, picked
up the chase from that point and rounded the turn about the four path, dug in through the stretch to finish well and was gaining on the top two. GHOST
MINE gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened. WE GOT THE MONEY gave only distant early chase, saved ground on the turn and
finished evenly to pass rivals. SALTY J J chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. NOBLE EL SID gave
chase, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted into the stretch and had little left. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Cryptoblue,
lodged by the rider of Spring Delight, though, found no evidence of foul.

NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far
turn, was met entering the stretch and dug in determinedly to turn back the game challenge of RIVER CROSROAD RVF, who stalked the winner off the rail
and challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested the far turn at a close disadvantage two deep and dug in gamely to the finish. SPUNMAN saved
ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled outward toward the top of the lane and came along
for third later yards. CANDY INVASION rated just off the early pace about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole but dropped back into the
far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. RIDING CLOUD NINE hesitated at the break and saved ground well off the pace.

Footnotes
THE KING AQUILES drew briefly clear and angled to the inside to stalk from the three quarter pole, steadied at the rail in the vicinity of the five sixteenths
pole, recovered stride past the pole and dueled for the nod midway on the far turn, raced clear leaving the turn and was kept alert to later yards, then taken
in hand nearing the wire. FASHIONABLE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in
through the final furlong and dueled for second later yards. BEING ME raced with the pace off the rail, was caught approaching the seven sixteenths pole
and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, contested at a close disadvantage between horses on the far turn, but dropped back losing ground at the
head of the lane and was outfinished for second later yards. DUSKY settled just off the early pace about the three path then closed to contention into the
backstretch, dueled at even terms leaving the half mile pole and contested the far turn three wide, but dropped back midway on the turn, was carried out into
the stretch and weakened. ARTISTA stumbled from the gate and dropped well off the pace in the three and four paths and showed little response through
the backstretch. ALWAYS BIZ loped along.
