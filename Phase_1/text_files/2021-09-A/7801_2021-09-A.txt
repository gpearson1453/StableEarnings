Footnotes
ALOIS sat just off of the early pace, improved position while three wide on the turn to challenge HANDS OFF, repelled the pacesetter in upper stretch and
kicked clear in the final sixteenth. NORWESTER settled near the rear of the field in the early going, made a steady run on the second turn while three wide,
continued that run into the stretch and got up to win the head nod for second but was not challenging the winner. HANDS OFF broke on top and set all of
the pace through the second turn, was confronted by the winner leaving the second turn, was tiring in deep stretch and missed for second. BRANNIGAN
stalked the pace, was three wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch. PRETTY LOUD was rank on the run into the first turn, settled in the
midflight, gained ground while five wide on the second turn but weakened in the stretch run. WELL CRAFTED was away slowly and had no speed in the
early stages, was four wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. HANDSOME HUSSAR stalked the pace from a forward position, was four wide
on the second turn and faded in the stretch run. LOVER BOY TOM tracked the early pace from a ground saving position and gave out in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAMINO DEL PARAISO settled just off of the early pace, mounted a bid while four wide on the second turn, vied for the lead leaving the bend, dug in in the
final sixteenth and held off an oncoming runner-up in the final strides. JUNGLE CRY tracked the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, closed well
on the rail in the stretch and pressured the winner in the final strides but could not reel him in while besting the rest. HARMON settled in the midflight, was
two wide on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch to earn the show. MECKLENBURG (IRE) attended the early pace, was three wide on the
second turn while challenging the pacesetter, vied for the lead off of the turn but was outfinished in the stretch. CUPID'S CLAWS settled toward the rear of
the field, was three to four wide on the second turn, swung widest into the stretch and was outkicked in the drive. SHADRACK was away a bit slowly, was
unhurried through the early going, was four wide on the second turn and made a late gain in the stretch but was not challenging the leaders. PROUD
PEDRO (FR) settled at the rear of the field, was four to five wide on the second turn and did not offer a late rally in the stretch. HONG KONG COWBOY
broke alertly and set all of the pace through the second turn, was confronted by MECKLENBURG nearing the top of the lane and weakened in the late
going.

Footnotes
BRITE TAN sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn, tipped out for the stretch drive and had a late push to get by COCOA CENTS to
prevail. COCOA CENTS broke alertly and traded pace duties with PERFECT EDITION, gained on that foe while three wide on the second turn, continued
that run into the stretch to have a clear lead but was outfinished in the final sixteenth while holding for second. MIA SOLINA was unhurried in the early
going, made a steady bid while four wide on the second turn and closed well in the stretch to get third, while just missing for second. COLD BREW KELLY
tracked the pace from the midflight, gained while two wide on the second turn but was outkicked in the stretch. SASSY EINSTEIN settled in a midfield
position, had outrun ALMA SPIRIT on the second turn when that rival clipped heels and finished evenly in the stretch run. PERFECT EDITION sat off of
COCOA CENTS in the early going then made a middle move to set the pace into the second turn, saved ground on that turn and weakened in the stretch.
ROUGE BOUQUET settled toward the rear of the field, mounted a bid while two wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. ALMA SPIRIT sat just
off of the early pace in a forward position, was three wide heading into the second turn and losing ground when clipped heels with SASSY EINSTEIN and
was not persevered with in the stretch.
