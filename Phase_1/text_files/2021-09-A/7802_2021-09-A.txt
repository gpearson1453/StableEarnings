Footnotes
HEAVEN STREET was away alertly from the gate, stalked the leaders early on, was in the five path into the lane, took command down the lane with ease,
cleared the field while geared down in the final stages. STOLEN BASE chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane
but was no match for the winner in the final stages. BRITAIN'S KITTEN was unhurried early on, raced in the three path into the lane, rallied in the upper
stretch, made a bid near the eighth pole but flattened out late in the drive. STRIDE chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid down
the lane but leveled off late in the drive. ATTA BOY ANTHONY set the pace early on two wide, was in the three path into the lane and faltered in the stretch
run. ROYAL CONNECTION raced along the inside through the turn, was in the three path into the lane and through after a half. COME ALONE was never a
factor. DEAL GO DOWN had early speed then folded up.

Footnotes
SUNNY ONE chased the pace early, raced along the inside through the turn, was in the three path into the lane, split horses near the quarter pole, was
under a long drive and prevailed in the final stages. MALIBU MOIRA chased the pace early, raced four wide along the turn, was in the five path into the
lane, made a bid five wide in the stretch, edged ahead near the eighth pole under a long drive but did not have enough in the final stages. NOSTALGIA
tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, led the field three wide near the quarter pole but faltered late in the drive. VORTICES raced back
early on, was on the inside along the turn, raced in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. SOLAR KITTEN
was unhurried early on, raced in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. BLOODY MARY MORNIN raced five wide along the turn, was in
the six path into the lane and lacked a rally down the lane. TOLERATION was never a threat. MY WYNTER ROSE was a bit slow at the start and no factor.

along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the upper stretch four wide but was empty late in the drive. BEAUTIFUL BELLA was a bit
slow at the start and outrun.
