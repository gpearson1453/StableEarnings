I'M GITTIN THERE chased the pace two wide around the turn, remained on her left lead, bid for the lead in mid stretch and drove clear. MISS MIDNIGHT
sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, raced on her left lead in the drive and weakened. SPICY MARGARITA saved ground around the turn and
failed to rally in an even effort. MISS CASEY bumped with SAFE REEZAN soon after the break and drifted out leaving the turn. DERBY JULEP dwelt at the
break, saved ground on the turn, angled out and offered a late move. SAFE REEZAN bumped with MISS CASEY when bearing in soon after the break then
was not a factor. FELONS ONLY was outrun.

Footnotes
SIMMARD SHENANIGAN stalked three wide, was under urging from the half mile marker, went after the leader nearing the quarter pole, was initially turned
away and dropped back a bit past the three sixteenths, found more under strong handling leaving the eighth pole, came back with a grinding run and got up
in the final jumps. PETES PRIDE cleared early, dropped in and set a rated pace, repelled the first challenge from the winner leaving the quarter pole,
spurted back away under pressure, continued gamely to the wire but wasn't quite good enough. PARCHED GHOST was squeezed back at the break,
regrouped and was taken well in hand while saving ground, was under pressure past the three eighths, eased out leaving the far turn and rallied mildly.
CHINA CAT was rated two wide early, came under a ride mid way through the backstretch run, made a mild inside run past the three sixteenths, failed to
sustain leaving the furlong marker and faded. BRING ME ANSWERS drifted out a bit at the break, straightened and saved ground stalking the early pace,
failed to keep pace under pressure past the three eighths and gave way. OLIVE'S BUMPA broke a step slow, was used three to four wide early to reach
contention, failed to kick on nearing the far turn and retreated.

SLINGIN SAMMY B , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the far turn three deep, rallied steadily and was up late.
MAGICAL LUNA hugged the inner rail setting the pace and gave way grudgingly. JOYFUL NOISE lacked speed, raced slightly off the rail around the far
turn, angled out in mid stretch and had a slight rally. STAY OUT prompted the pace outside MAGICAL LUNA and weakened through the final furlong.
MORTAL STORM raced along the inner rail and was done about three furlongs from the finish.

MS. HAITI broke outward, straightened and attended the pace four wide outside rivals and under rating, responded and bid five wide to command in upper
stretch, kicked clear under right handed rousing past the sixteenth pole then held sway under a steady drive. ADABEL stumbled at the break but with the
field, prompted the pace three wide, waited a bit nearing the furlong marker, shifted out six wide, straightened away and closed willingly. YEYETZI vied
outside a rival, was floated out a bit entering the lane and gave way through the final fifty yards. YIRA saved ground off the early pace, cut the corner into
the lane and rallied. JENNA THE BOSS broke outward and bumped with a foe, raced well back saving ground, eased out late and had some late interest
between foes. SMOOTH DANCER rushed to a short lead, dropped in and dueled, drifted out entering the lane and weakened in the final sixteenth. MYSTIC
COMIN HOME , bumped at the break, was outrun. An objection by the rider of ADABEL against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not
allowed

Footnotes
ROO LA LA eased out early and edged up to stalk the pace, responded leaving the three eighths and bid two wide, took over near the far turn, opened up
nearing the lane and proved best while kept to a drive. GUAPA CHICA , off the pace two wide, angled out into the far turn, lugged in nearing the three
sixteenths, shifted out and circled four wide, closed steadily and was second best. MOSE DEFINITELY , three wide most of the trip, edged up some leaving
the far turn the lacked a solid finish. LOOKING FOR LOVE sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined near the five sixteenths, failed to
contain the winner soon after, pursued to the lane then gave way in the final sixteenth. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , sluggish from the gate, saved ground off
the early pace but failed to respond. CELESTIAL DIVA gave pursuit off the rail and weakened after five furlongs. ARBELA drifted out four wide entering the
first turn, chased to the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
CROUCHELLI settled well back while saving some ground, edged up two wide past the three eighths, angled in and gained more steam leaving the quarter
pole, continued progress along the rail to mid stretch, eased out soon after and surged between rivals under a drive to get up. THE POSER chased the
leader, was all in past the three sixteenths, made a grinding run to threaten outside foes in deep stretch and just missed. SINGLINO quickly went clear, set
the pace towards the rail, maintained a clear advantage under pressure past the furlong marker, but just failed to contain the top pair. WALK AWAY JOE
settled in the clear, angled out past the half mile marker, was under pressure pursuing three wide nearing the lane and continued with effort. SILENT
MALICE failed to menace. O K GAME ON , three wide off the pace, dropped back. GLORY SONG stalked off the rail, failed to kick on under a ride leaving
three eighths and surrendered.

Footnotes
MINER'S GEM stalked the pace for a half mile, advanced two wide on the far turn to take command approaching the stretch then drew off while kept to her
business. SHERIFF'S KID , well placed down the backstretch, raced two wide on the far turn, chased the winner and faded. MY WAY OR ELSE , bumped
by SEVILLA SANGRIA entering the first turn, circled the far turn three deep and rallied. FEARLESS IDEAS , three deep the first turn, raced in the two path
on the far turn and weakened. SEVILLA SANGRIA dwelt at the break, bore out bumping MY WAY OR ELSE entering the first turn and failed to be a factor.
COMPETENT rushed to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and tired leaving the far turn. SLIP SLIDIN hugged the inner rail on both turns and
weakened. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the break but no action was taken.
