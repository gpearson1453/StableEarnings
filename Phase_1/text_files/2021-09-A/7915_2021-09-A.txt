MALIBU MISTRESS bumped leaving the gate, vied for the lead between rivals, dueled with FRISCO FRILLS into the turn, lost contact with three-eighths
remaining, continued to give chase through the stretch, re-bid from inside with a furlong to go and proved best late. GAYLES EVENING broke out and
bumped rival at the start, vied for command from inside then dropped back to chase, angled four wide leaving the turn, closed outside the top pair late but
was not enough. FRISCO FRILLS vied three deep for command, dueled into the turn, shook free at the three-eighths, held a short lead with a furlong to go
and yielded late. LATER DAYS raced up close between early then dropped back to chase outside a rival, exited the turn five wide and lacked a late bid.
SIMMER DOWN bumped both sides at the start, traveled two then three wide on the turn and weakened.

I KNOW CASH FLOW got bumped at the start, showed early speed four deep then dropped back to chase outside a rival, bid three deep around the bend,
came five wide into the lane, grabbed the lead in upper stretch, fought with THIRSTY CHAPO in deep stretch and held gamely. THIRSTY CHAPO broke in
and bumped rival at the start, raced widest up the backstretch, navigated the turn five then six wide, rallied from outside and dueled with the winner late but
lacked the needed late punch to go by. CURLING SECRET bumped hard with BIG SWEDE at the start, vied for the lead between rivals, dueled leaving the
backstretch, cleared early on the turn then got tested by multiple rivals around the bend, led three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and
kept on to best the rest. GEMINI BAY angled in to save ground from off the pace, moved out in upper stretch, split foes at the eighth pole and improved
position. BIG SWEDE bumped hard leaving the gate, went up to vie for the lead from inside, dueled with rival leaving the backstretch, checked entering the
turn, continued to give chase along the rail to the lane and weakened. TEE SHOT had early speed three deep, chased the top pair leaving the backstretch,
bid between around the turn, vied four wide into the lane and weakened. REAL POUCH got knocked into rival at the start, bumped with PAULAS CAUSE
near the half-mile pole, went four wide into the turn, came out seven wide and failed to menace. PAULAS CAUSE bumped from outside at the start, chased
well off the rail, bumped with rival near the half-mile pole, angled down to the two path for the turn and tired in the lane.

QUESTION AUTHORITY was closest in pursuit off the rail, drew alongside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared past the three-sixteenths pole
and drew off. PALACE PRINCE angled in early, settled near the inside, entered the lane two wide, moved out in upper stretch and bested the rest. STREET
BEHAVIOR was off alertly then settled into a stalking position on the inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn,
responded mildly to urging and gained the show. WHATSITTOYA cleared early and angled to the inside, rated on the front-end setting the pace, got headed
with five-sixteenths remaining, lost command in upper stretch and wakened in the final furlong. UPPER ROOM was off a bit slow from the inside, traveled
two wide around the first turn, angled in on the second turn and was not a factor. TYPHOON HARRY tracked off the rail, dropped back around the far turn,
exited the far turn four wide and weakened.

PEACEFUL TRANSFER sped clear into the first turn, lost command into the backstretch, chased the leader off the rail, drew alongside on the far turn, took
over past the three-eighths pole, fought with LOUD MOUTH in the drive, lugged out and bumped that rival at the sixteenth pole and prevailed under
left-handed urging. LOUD MOUTH stalked off the inside, bid three deep on the second bend, vied four wide into the stretch, dueled outside PEACEFUL
TRANSFER through the lane, got bumped by that rival at the sixteenth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. DESMOND DOSS was rank around the first
turn, traveled off the pace outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, moved to the inside in the lane and gained the show. GALILEAN off slow to
begin, went four wide around the first turn, continued wide up the backstretch, navigated the second bend four then five wide and lacked the needed late
punch in deep stretch. TOM'S SURPRISE steadied briefly around the first turn, went up to take control into the backstretch, cleared past the three-quarter
pole, showed the way to the far turn, lost command past the three-eighths pole, chased the top pair into the lane and faded. BIG FISH settled on the inside,
angled out with three-sixteenths remaining and never made an impact. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED PEACEFUL
TRANSFER FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR FLOATING OUT AND BUMPING LOUD MOUTH NEAR THE SIXTEENTH POLE, COSTING HIM A
CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
WHISKY MY GOD (ARG) stalked the pacesetter on the inside to the turn, moved out on the turn and came three wide into the stretch, closed through the
lane and reeled in the leader at the sixteenth pole and drew clear in the end. EQUIPO A broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, set the pace off the rail
then moved to the two path, padded the lead around the bend, led clear to the eighth pole but was run down with a sixteenth remaining. PEDRO PEREZ got
knocked into rival at the start, raced three then four wide on the turn, could not find the needed rally but held the show. CALDER VALE tracked four then five
wide on the turn and lacked a late bid. MR. CLUTCH bumped at the start, went four wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide and came up empty.
DAPPER bumped with DEPUTY GARY at the start, came three wide into the lane and made no impact. W. WHITEHOUSE dropped back into the turn,
angled in around the bend and had little left for the drive. DEPUTY GARY bumped leaving the gate, traveled along the inside then two wide on the turn and
weakened.
