BELLE OF ST. JOHN sat off leaders patiently to far turn, hooked in battle in the final furlong to prevail. GREEDY ALGORITHM never far back throughout,
rallied in the lane too late. LA ROSA speed to the front, well measured pace to stretch, weakened. MY HEAD HURTS raced evenly with no late response
when called upon in the drive. THREE POINT KUZ chased pace to quarter pole, gave way in the stretch run.
