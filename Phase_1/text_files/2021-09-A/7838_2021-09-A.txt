KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN broke sharply, but was taken in hand and dropped back to trail while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, launched
his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed steadily four out from the rail in the drive to get up in time. EYE BE SEEING YOU settled off the early
pace while racing three out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, angled in to commence his bid two wide entering the final turn, shifted four wide
entering the lane, and closed willingly to just miss. LAUGH WITH ME tracked the dueling leaders one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch,
engaged the leaders three wide entering the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was outfinished late. REPRIMAND away alertly and
dueled for the lead from the outside of VOLO VELOCHE entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside
and through the final turn from between rivals, but faded in deep stretch. VOLO VELOCE away well and rushed up from along the rail to vie for the early
lead, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
ATOMIC HAZE broke sharply and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final
turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to get up in the closing strides to prevail. KEEPINGTHEDREAM away alertly and tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in
the drive to just miss. HARVEST DAY away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, dictated the pace in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late. JACK DON'T DRINK settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the inside in the drive. COMMANDER B settled off the early
pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid while finishing four
wide in the drive. NORTHERN KID settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount
a serious late bid when called upon. ZULU POWER unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, raced three wide in the run down
the backstretch, but failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
THE ALL BUTTON away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
engaged the pacesetter leaving the turn, and inched clear late under confident handling. MARTELLO rushed to the lead entering the first turn and controlled
the pace in the run down the backstretch while racing out from the rail, maintained his advantage through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late while
unable to fend off THE ALL BUTTON in the late stages. TIZ MEOW hopped at the start to get away slowly, trailed the field into the backstretch, advanced
three wide midway down the backside to gain a striking position entering the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and finished two out from the rail
in the drive to get up for a share. DAKATI away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering
the final turn, and finished evenly from along the inside in the stretch drive. HIGHWAY BOSS settled off the early pacesetters while racing one out from the
rail entering eh backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. EUROPEAN broke sharply and stalked
the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded in the late going.
