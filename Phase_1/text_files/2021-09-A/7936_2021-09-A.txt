SWEET RIVER BAINES tracked in behind the leaders, went three wide on the turn moving in a path briefly then back out commencing a bid at the quarter
pole, swung six to seven deep into the stretch, struck a narrow lead then forged clear late. BLUE AZUL tracked inside, made a mild bid in upper stretch but
was no match. CLASSY CLASS bobbled slightly at the start, moved through inside foes but coming out well off the rail to force the pace, went in the three
path on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. ARIMONY pressed from between foes, went four to five wide on the turn, eight deep into upper stretch and
weakened. MIDNIGHT IN MAUI chased from outside, went five to seven wide on the turn, nine wide in upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
DOM WAYNE was fractious behind the gate and hard to load, broke out and brushed a rival, moved clear dictating terms in the four path, was briefly
challenged up the backstretch then regained a clear lead going in the three path on the far turn, held safe under mild urging. ELLIOT shifted in entering the
first turn to the three path then back six wide by the latter part of that bend, advanced outside foes into the far turn going five then four wide on that bend
and reaching striking distance but could not sustain the effort and was no match for the winner. TIME TO RUMBLE was brushed and forced outwardly
several paths at the break, raced close up into the first turn but appeared to be getting out and was taken hold and steadied slightly while three wide on that
bend, kept on two wide on the far turn but needed more late. MASTERCLASS settled last but one racing on or just off the rail, came out eight wide in the
stretch. DAN WHO raced four to five wide on the turns, made a mild early bid heading up the backstretch, came out nine wide into the stretch and turned up
empty. WISHFUL SLIM was unhurried early trailing the field two to three wide, swung eight deep into the stretch and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DANIEL THE DREAMER stalked the pace racing three to four wide, moved to challenge on the far turn, floated six wide into upper stretch taking a narrow
lead, just held under steady handling. HOT TO SURF stalked the pace then moved to the fore at the five-eighths travelling two to three wide, was clear up
the backstretch into, faced challengers on the far turn still travelling in the two to three path, was headed in upper stretch, fought on gamely. STELLA
SWEEPER settled at the rear moving out from the inside to three wide and outside a rival, began to advance heading to the far turn, moved out from three
to five wide on that bend and wider into upper stretch, continued to drift out then drifted back in and was gaining fast but too late. SUZY Q settled mid-pack
five wide, made a mild bid five then four wide on the far turn before coming out seven wide into upper stretch, flattened out. ISLE BE GABBY settled well
back two to three wide on the first turn, moved to the rail early up the backstretch, came out two wide late on the far turn then four wide at the head of the
lane, failed to rally. EBB AND FLOW was a bit fractious in the gate, urged from the break, had speed for three-eighths inside, steadily weakened. MCCIRCA
raced outside six wide early, angled in late up the backstretch to go three wide on the far turn, tired. PER RULING FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING
COMMISSION, DANIEL THE DREAMER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
