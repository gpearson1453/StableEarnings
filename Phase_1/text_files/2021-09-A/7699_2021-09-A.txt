Footnotes
MAGIC APRIORITY broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, shook clear in the turn, extended that advantage when straightened for
home, kept to task with a steady right handed crop to the wire. MY LITTLE GUERA chased the dueling leaders off the inside, could do little with the winner
in the drive, up late for the place spot. PRAYERS SAVED broke in mid pack, moved up quickly to duel outside the winner up the backstretch, could not keep
up from mid turn on, gradually weakened, caught late 2nd. HUSHED COURT ROOM broke slowly and outward, bobbled, raced back early, improved slightly
turn, drifted in under a right handed crop upper stretch, went evenly to the wire. HER GREAT GRANDPA broke back, made little impact while racing off the
inside. EMPRESS ELOISE ducked in badly at the break to lose all chance, trailed most of the way, picked off a single tiring rival late. SHANGHAI HETTY in
mid pack for three furlongs, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
JAMAICAN ME broke on top, pressed the early leader off the inside, dueled with that one through the turn, disposed of that same foe to be clear with less
than a furlong remaining, enough left to hold off the runner up late. ADIEU LE CHAT back off the early pace off the inside, four wide exiting the turn, finished
willingly to be rapidly getting to the winner late, well clear for the place. CAVATINA moved up the inside to show the way early, dueled along the rail with the
winner turn, could not keep up in the drive, no match for the runner up late, well clear of the others. CYRANO DE forwardly placed early, fell back off the
leaders turn, went evenly through the stretch. A STAR IS BORN NOW within striking distance for four furlongs, came up empty for the drive. YANKEE HAIL
CAT checked up after an awkward beginning, trailed throughout. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CALCULATE outrun in the early going while racing in some traffic, moved closer in the three path far turn, four wide turning into the straight, set down,
closed with a late surge to prove best. MUSCADINE last away, void of speed for a half, came five wide and outside the winner exiting the final turn, finished
willingly while unable to keep pace with that one late. CITY PARK away with the leaders, prompted the pace three wide for a half, advanced and challenged
on the outside in the second turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two. FRANK THE MAYOR settled off the pace,
displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position slightly, not a serious threat. HERO OF THE HOUR pressed the issue early off the inside,
dueled the middle half, continued to be a factor with a furlong remaining then faltered. MR. UNUSUAL void of speed for five furlongs, improved position a bit
without posing a serious threat. HALF A BITE set or forced the pace four five furlongs and gave way. THEORIST was finished after a half. SUPER FACTOR
was also through early.

Footnotes
DOCTOR LEO took command out of the chute, set all the pace toward the inside, drew out steadily down the lane while kept to pressure with a right handed
crop. STEALING APRIORITY forwardly placed toward the inside, could do nothing with the winner in the drive, edged clear for the place. TOE BANDIT
closest to the winner for six furlongs, weakened a bit late to lose the second spot, comfortably saved the show. IDE LIKE HAWAII void of speed in trailing
early, raced four wide through much of the turn, improved into the lane, flattened out a bit the final furlong. OUR BUCKET LIST remained back in failing to
menace. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT settled in mid pack early, faded. CAMEO TRICK last away, moved up steadily to improve to the second flight in the turn,
stopped from between horses in the drive. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
QUINN MURPHY broke on top, fell back to be unhurried early, moved closer late in the final turn along the inside, roused when straightened for home, late
push under a brisk hand ride to be up in time. GLANCE took over soon after the start, set a soft pace toward the inside, remained clear into the lane, could
not contain the winner, remained clear of the rest. AMELIA MADELYN last away, trailed much of the way, closed the gap a bit on the top two in the final
furlong with some modest late interest. STORIED TRIP chased the runner up for six furlongs and gave way when the real running began at the head of the
lane. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MOORAC allowed the pace to go early, ranged up to challenged three wide into the stretch, took over and drew clear under a steady right handed crop. LIL'
SISTER LOU back off the early place, four wide out of the turn, rallied for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. ZUGERSEE void of speed for a
half, came three then four wide out of the turn, found best stride too late to be clear for the show. GABY'S PROMISE forced the issue for three furlongs, took
over late in the turn, offered little resistance to the winner past the furlong marker and faltered when headed by that one. WILL B LATE last to leave, raced
back, picked off a couple of faltering rivals while never a threat. BACK INTHAT ACTION narrowly set the early pace toward the in side, gave way after four
furlongs. FILM STUDY broke back, raced in mid pack for a half, backed up through the stretch. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER broke on top, raced with the early
pace, stopped late in the turn, pulled up in distress upper stretch, vanned off. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
GRAVY HOUND with the pace from the start toward the inside, dueled into and through the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear when straightened for
home, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire while being kept to task with left handed pressure. BERNIE SPECIAL broke on top, settled in the second
flight in the three path, finished with some determination on the outside to be up for the place, not a serious menace to the winner. STEAL IT BACK settled
behind the pace, saved some ground through the turn, came out a bit for the drive, moderate interest through some traffic to be up for the third spot.
CHROMPTON went one paced outside in lacking a closing punch. FIFTY PROTECTION off the pace, improved position along the inside turning for home,
flattened out in the drive. LOUISIANA THUNDER fell back to near the back after the start, swung out sharply turning for home, improved position with some
mild interest. TOTALLY ADDICTED broke back, lacked speed, floated out four wide into the lane, passed tiring rivals. BIG BAND'S LUCK broke out, was
straightened to duel outside the winner for three furlongs then gave way. TRIPPER JOHN pinched back at the start then steadied, trailed early as a result,
was carried six wide into the lane, failed to rally. WICKED FITZ broke in to help pinch back TRIPPER JOHN, raced in mid pack for three furlongs off the
inside, tired in the drive. MR. PAYCHECK was finished early, five wide into the lane, trailed home.

Footnotes
FORESTDUNGONE broke on top, set the pace just off the inside while rating, shook off a rival to be clear again into the lane, held sway under steady
handling. KING OF THE TESTO settled off the pace and the inside, three wide into the far turn, four wide into the lane when roused, ground out a steady
rally while remaining well out in the strip to annex the runner up position. LIGHTHAWK forwardly placed, moved a bit closer to the winner nearing the furlong
marker, lacked a further advance to be caught for second. GREELEY'S DEALER well back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the final turn,
improved position without posing a significant threat. BUXTERHOOTER off a step slow, trailed for a half, passed some tiring rivals while never dangerous.
GENTRIFIED settled behind the pace, had little for the drive. MOMENT pressed the winner early, chased that one the middle half, moved slightly closer
briefly turning for home, then faltered. SI ES GOYA staged a steady retreat. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
LIZZ A BEE unhurried early while saving ground through the first turn, continued inside while moving closer through the second bend, encountered some
traffic nearing midstretch, got through between foes and proved best while fully extended. STAR FASHION lacked speed, saved ground through the final
turn, came into the stretch behind the winner, also encountered some traffic in midstretch, split foes late, finished well when clear. AUDACIOUS GIRL
settled behind the leaders off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, finished willingly while unable to match the winner in the waning strides.
GOTTABEGOLDEN prompted the pace off the inside, continued to chase into the far turn, challenged into the lane, held a narrow advantage with a furlong
remaining, could not last. BEAR TOOTH PASS settled in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked the needed closing response
to conten.d. BABY MAYBE broke out and slowly, raced back, four wide into the lane, also found wanting down the straight. MIDNIGHT TRIP forwardly
placed for a half, gradually weakened. SALT LIFE ANGEL broke alertly, sprinted well clear, held a daylight advantage up the backstretch and into the far
turn, confronted in upper stretch, gave way when headed the final furlong along the inside. MISSGREELEY'SSONG remained always back, trailed home.
