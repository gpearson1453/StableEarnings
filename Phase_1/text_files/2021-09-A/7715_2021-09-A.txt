inside, could not get to that rival in the drive but finished with good courage. ROCKET POWER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. IRISH SWING showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.
JIMJIMMYJAMES settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MR BINGLEY was void of early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EMERALD SEA was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by MAJESTIC CAFE into the lane vied with
that rival, was headed and gamely held. MAJESTIC CAFE broke sharply to stalk the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid
nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with that rival, gained a brief lead but could not sustain her rally. SHERM was bumped at the break, raced just off the
leaders from the inside, checked in mid-stretch, angled out and failed to gain. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. PREACHINATDINNER lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and did not menace. RENO
ROY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. COLAVITO broke in the air, was
unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
PISTOL POWER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. LOLLY EXPRESS settled off the leaders from the inside, reached a striking position into the stretch, could not gain on the winner late
but held for the place. RATE FOR ME was allowed to settle early, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished
with a steady bid. WILSON TO LOCKETT was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.
ARDENLEE STAR chased the leaders while racing four-wide, was bumped in mid-stretch and weakened. DAVID NOSE BEST was away in good order to
chase the leaders while racing four-wide, was bumped with a furlong to run and weakened.
