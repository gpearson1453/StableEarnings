Footnotes
SO CAL MEMORY got bumped from inside leaving the gate, went up to prompt the pace from outside, stayed alongside HEAD FOR BUSINESS through
the turn, came under right-handed urging with an eighth of a mile remaining, switch to the left-hand at the sixteenth pole and dug in late to edge the
runner-up. HEAD FOR BUSINESS broke out, sped to the front while shifting in early, set the pace inside SO CAL MEMORY, maintained a short lead
through the turn, continued to hold the advantage over that rival through the lane under hand urging and got edged in the final moments. PICK YOUR BID
stumbled leaving the gate, chased outside a rival, four wide around the turn, finished willingly and closed the gap on the top pair. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE
veered out and bumped rival, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, took aim three wide into the stretch but finished evenly in the final furlong.
WARRENS CANDY MAN tossed head head at the start and came away slow, went five wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and kept on through the
final furlong while unable to threaten. IRRESISTIBLY SEXY off slow to begin, navigated the turn five wide, drifted out in the lane and failed to menace.
GERLACH'S tracked in the two path through the turn and could not rally. LARRY'S LEGEND bothered by the leader shifting in early, chased along the
inside to the stretch and never responded to urging. RIFEY tossed his head at the start and came away very slow while breaking inward, went three to four
wide around the turn, drifted out in the lane and was never a factor.

inside and rallied for the show. WICKED angled to the two path early, checked between rivals late on the first turn, came four wide into the lane, drifted in
upper stretch and got edged for the show. GRANOLA GIRL sped to the front from the rail position, dueled for the lead up the backstretch and around the far
turn, held a short lead into the lane, shifted in upper stretch and weakened inside. EMPIRE D'ORO trailed through the early stages, saved ground into the
lane, lacked room in upper stretch, then gained a clear path and passed tired rivals. ROXBURY went three to four wide around the first turn, stalked off the
rail, went two wide into the far turn, three wide into the stretch and faded. VULIN raced off the rail on the first turn while a bit green, sat off the pace up the
backstretch, floated out by rival into the drive and could not offer a response when called upon. BLOSSOMING off slow to begin, moved to the inside,
angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. PEARLS AND HEELS steadied off heels on the first turn, went outside the top pair to challenge for the lead,
dueled into the far turn, lost command nearing the quarter pole and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
WHAT GOES ON TOUR stumbled badly at the start, trailed the field to the turn, advanced in the two path around the bend, steered out in the stretch, closed
gamely and overhauled the runner-up. LIV AND LET LIV stalked the pace from outside, bid three deep around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, gained the
lead with a furlong remaining, cleared mid-stretch but could not fend off the winner. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN tracked off the inside, went five then four wide on
the turn, got floated out a bit in upper stretch by the winner, then rallied for the show. ISLAND LIFE set the pace under pressure, vied for command from
inside around the turn, dueled to the eighth pole and weakened late. SEASON TO REMEMBER forwardly placed up the backstretch on the inside, saved
ground to the lane, tipped off the rail and lacked a late bid. SECRET MISTRESS pressed the pace from outside, between foes around the turn, could not go
on with the top pair in upper stretch and flattened out. KERRALIA broke out, took the turn four then five wide and was not a factor. BOLD MISTRESS broke
out, chased along the inside and started to climb up the backstretch, drifted out around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
ELLIE ARROWAY pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader with a quarter mile to go, gained command into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and
held gamely. FREEDOM LASS stalked between foes into the first turn or the two path, went between rivals past the half-mile pole, exited the far turn three
wide, rallied outside the winner but could not get by. BRISTOL BAYOU angled down to the two path early, settled off the pace, angled five wide leaving the
far turn, closed well and prove a game third. DRAMATIZER unhurried in the beginning, went between foes on the backstretch, angled four wide leaving the
far turn, steered out further in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to fill out the superfecta. TROUVILLE traveled in mid-pack on the inside, entered the
stretch two wide, kept on through the final furlong but needed to find more. REIWA tucked inside on the first turn, reserved along the fence in the early
stages, tipped out into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and could not rally. VELLA went four wide around the first turn, three to four wide on the far
turn and flattened out. OVER ATTRACTED trailed early on the inside, angled out on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BUY
WAVE BUY stalked the pace on the inside, exited the far turn two wide, got blocked behind weakening rival mid-stretch and could not regain momentum
after steering to a clear path. JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT stalked off the inside or outside a rival, took aim three wide into the stretch and weakened. SAVVY
GAL set the pace from inside under pressure, headed by rival with a quarter mile remaining, lost command into the stretch and gave way. VAROMA went
three wide around both turns and came up empty.

Footnotes
BENEDICT CANYON chased the pacesetter three deep, bid alongside nearing the quarter pole, struck the front into the lane, put away inside rival in upper
stretch, drifted out through the drive and held on. LADY T tracked off the inside then between foes, exited the turn three to four wide, drifted out in the lane
while putting in a late bid and just missed. KEYCHAIN GIRL chased up close between runners, raced two to three wide around the turn, stayed within
striking distance in the final furlong but could not find the needed late kick. SHE'S SO SHINY sped clear and crossed over to the two path, moved to the rail
around the bend, challenged nearing the quarter pole, lost the lead into the stretch and flattened to a minor award. I GOT A GAL chased along the inside, a
bit off the rail into the drive and flattened out. VERY SCARY broke out, sat off the pace then went outside a pair of rivals, entered the stretch four to five wide
and lacked the needed response. AYELLOWROSEOFTEXAS tracked inside a pair of rivals, came out into the stretch and never rallied. BLONDE
BOMBSHELL tossed hear head at the start and came away very slow, trailed along the inside to the stretch and was always outrun.

Footnotes
NORMA JEAN B. tracked from the two path, eased out four wide leaving the second bend, rallied to the front four deep at the eighth pole, cleared nearing
the sixteenth marker and drew away. FEARLESS GIRL (IRE) stalked the pace on the inside, went two wide into the drive, lacked room in upper stretch,
steered out to a clear path and rallied for the place. ULTIMATE HY stalked outside a rival in the early going, bid three deep on the far turn, vied for
command into the stretch, battled to the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. NEW HEAT settled off the pace, went three deep into the far turn, four wide
into the lane then angled out and summoned a mild rally. MISS COSTA RICA sat off the pace, angled four wide into the lane, brushed rival in upper stretch
and lacked a bid. DEL MAR DRAMA angled to the inside early, tracked along the fence then moved into the two path on the far turn, came three wide into
the drive, angled in some in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ZYDECO MAMA raced up close outside the pacesetter, challenged between rivals on the
second bend, fought to the furlong marker and flattened out. TRICKLE IN broke through the gate prior to the start, took control early, set the pace on the
inside, met bids and vied with a pair of rivals on the second bend, fought back to the eighth pole and weakened. FROSE settled on the inside, tipped out on
the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, got brushed and steadied off heels in upper stretch and flattened out. RESARCIO broke through the gate prior
to the start, was off slow to begin, saved ground and was always outrun. LUCKY PERIDOT pulled up on the first turn and walked off.

Footnotes
FLIGHTLINE went up to press the pace from outside, took over midway around the turn, cleared approaching the quarter pole, opened up under mild
urging, then powered away in the stretch and coasted to the wire in the final sixteenth. ESCAPE ROUTE chased between foes early, a bit off the rail around
the bend, moved out in the lane and bested the rest. PARNELLI got bumped from outside at the start, chased outside a pair of rivals, three wide on the turn
and never threatened. POSITIVITY chased along the inside into the turn, dropped back around the turn, angled out and came three wide into the stretch
and made no impact. BIG SCOTT DADDY steadied off heels briefly early then dropped back, went two wide into the turn, angled to the rail to save ground
and was not a factor. NOTRE DAME broke in and bumped rival, sped clear then set the pace with FLIGHTLINE to the outside, lost command midway
around the turn, chased the winner along the inside into the lane and faded.
