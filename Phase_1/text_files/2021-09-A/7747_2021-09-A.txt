MARACOCA'S DREAM sat in striking position outside of the leader, angled out to the three path approaching the quarter pole, struck the front into the
stretch and held safely. TOP DEMON raced at the back of the pack leaving the backstretch, rallied outside and inched up to secure place. SMILE MARY
chased three wide, continued on evenly through the stretch and was bested late. ZHAVIA moved up alongside NOT YOUR BIZINESS to challenge the lead
leaving the backstretch and left little in reserve for the drive. NOT YOUR BIZINESS vied inside, took pressure inside of ZHAVIA through the turn and yielded
inside.

SKY DESTINY allowed to settle early, saved ground through the backstretch while four wide, began bid nearing the quarter pole, gained quickly outside
then swept the lead and drew clear. KENSINGTON MARKET emerged the leader entering the backstretch, saved ground while showing the way,
responded to challenge from GEM OF INCEPTION, edged away from the fore mentioned but was out kicked in stretch and just held. MARYAM trailed the
field from the three path, chased hard into the lane, was all out inside and just missed after a determined drive. CROSS LADY raced in second flight, lodged
a rail bid but was unable to improve position. GEM OF INCEPTION stalked the pace, moved up to alongside KENSINGTON MARKET to challenge the lead,
dueled through the final turn and wilted abruptly into stretch.

IGNITE THE MOON raced wide through the turn, tracked outside through the backstretch, fanned three wide on the final turn, began bid nearing the quarter
pole, overtook the lead and was kept to light handling. PREDESTINED vied three wide to the turn then saved ground while leading the field through the
backstretch, came under urging into the lane and was out kicked. NODIGGITYNODOUBT allowed to settle early, chased the pacesetters through the far
turn and wore down rival late for show honors. DARE TO GO sat just off the pace while two to three wide, pressed the issue near the three eighths pole and
weakened in stretch. TANGERINE TAXI raced four to five wide into the first turn and finished evenly. SMALL TOWN DUDE outsprinted through the turn and
was outrun. SOCRATES angled in to the four path into the turn, trailed the field and passed tiring. SALTY LITTLE DOG offered little. POOR RUBEN chased
and tired.

Footnotes
RAIDEN saved ground early, shifted out to the three path in the backstretch, responded to handling into the lane and nipped the leader before the wire.
LONE PIONEER quickly went to the front then opened up good margins through the backstretch, see those margins decrease in the far turn, was under
pressure through the stretch and was caught late. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed the field, swung out into the lane and rallied belatedly. FROBISHER BAY
rated off the pace racing four wide through the first turn, raced in closest pursuit of the leader, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole and yielded into
stretch. STEELFORCE sat mid pack while four wide, drove five wide into the lane and evened out. INDICATIVE vied four wide to the opening turn, tracked
inside and faded gradually inside. DOMENICO was not a factor. HUERFANO G. never reached contention.

Footnotes
FINALLY GOTTCHA vied four wide to the opening turn, gained the lead into the lane and stayed clear. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT tracked outside, drove five
wide at the quarter pole, rallied determinedly outside and held for place. DENSE FOG raced in traffic into the turn, was roused at the quarter pole, battled
two wide and was outfinished for place. ADRIEN'S AURORA raced at the back of the pack and lodged a mild bid into the stretch. BOOKIE sat just off the
pace in the two path, dropped back through the turn and passed tiring rival late. CHASKA stalked inside and faded. GEM ALTA sat in range outside in the
five path and tired into the stretch. JOVIAL DESTINY broke alertly, settled outside and faltered. ROMAN STEEL quickly went to the front, was overtaken in
the far turn and stopped along the rail.
