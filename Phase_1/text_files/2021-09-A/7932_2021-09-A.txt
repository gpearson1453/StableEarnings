throughout and closed well to get up for the place. SWEET SAVAGE broke alertly and took control, widened on the turn then weakened. MARYEVIL
pursued the leader inside then faded after half a mile. WANNA BE REGAL lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. EVERYBODY'S PAL raced off the

THE ROBERT settled in the two path, advanced on the final turn then edged away through the stretch while kept to a drive. FLIGHT RISK stalked the
pacesetter, took over near the three eighths pole, drew clear but was caught in the final furlong. LEGACY'S PRINCE chased off the pace and rallied mildly
for the show. FINGLAS lacked speed, moved wide into the stretch and was no threat. BANKER'S ISLAND hustled to the front inside to the far turn and
stopped. DIAMOND SQUARE reserved just off the leaders but gave way after half a mile. BOAT OVER THE HILL broke very slowly and raced far behind
throughout.

ICY DUDE trailed early, advanced strongly inside and quickly pulled away while kept to his business. ONE TWO KID settled inside off the pace, continued
well while no match for the winner. DIESEL moved clear under stout restraint, was passed on the final turn and tired. SOCIAL EQUALITY chased outside,
faded before half a mile then came again to outfinish pair of rivals. LONGTAIL moved three wide on the first turn then stopped after half a mile.
RITTENHOUSE flashed speed then gave way readily.

inside rivals through the stretch led in midstretch but was nailed. DECKOLOGY reserved outside, moved wide in the stretch and closed gamely.
PASSPORT broke very slowly, raced very wide into the stretch rallying but was too late. KID CHOCOLATE dropped far behind, bid into the stretch then
flattened out. AUCHINCRUIVE lacked speed, moved closer through the final turn then came up empty. OUR PHILLY SPECIAL led narrowly outside, moved
clear into the far turn then weakened in the lane. OVERBOLD prompted the pace along the inside for three quarters and faded. VENTRILOQUISM vied for
the advantage into the first turn then weakened steadily. SOPHOS lagged far behind throughout. CATCH MY VIBE was urged within range inside briefly
then stopped abruptly.

INSPIRED OPTIONS settled close up three wide, faded on the final turn then came again through the last furlong and edged away. STAY HYDRATED led
inside, widened before the half to the stretch, was collared by the winner but continued gamely. NINE TOE JOHNNY advanced inside on the final turn,
angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but yielded. WISE JUDE dropped far behind, moved wide on the final turn and was no threat. IMAGINE THIS
saved ground close up then began fading after three furlongs. BAVARIA dropped back early and was never in contention. NORTHERN EXPRESS
prompted the pace in the two path to the three eighths pole and stopped.
