speed and came in the two path to challenge but could never go by the winner. OUR HALF FIRST came four wide on the turn after trailing and was closing
well for third. DOWNTOWN BROWN stalked the pace and came to challenge three wide on the turn was almost on even terms with the winner but tired in
the stretch. FLY DONNA FLY stalked the pace along the inside but never mounted a rally. OTHER THAN THAT raced four wide the entire race and had
nothing left in the stretch.

settled along the inside behind the leaders and made a late run on the inside for third. INTOXICATING KISS was well off the early pace then came between
rivals in the stretch to make a strong rally for third. SUZ showed good early speed in the two path but gave way at the top of the stretch. EPSOM IMP raced
along the inside off the pace and never mounted a rally. LIVELY SPELL showed good speed on the inside but had nothing left in the stretch. The race was

ALWAYS A TIZ showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail before the turn took command and held gamely. MOONFIELD chased in the two
path on the turn but could never go by the winner. DIVA'S DIVA was well back until the top of the stretch came out for the drive and was moving best of all
while not a threat to the top two. CELEE'S TE was off the pace and then came mid track through the stretch to get a minor share. FIVE B C race in mid
division the entire race and never mounted a rally. GARNETS GAL was away in good order to engage for the lead early but gave way in the stretch.
SHIVERHERTIMBERS raced three wide in mid pack and had no rally. ATOKA GIRL was always in the back and never offered a rally. IZE DISCREET
ROSE raced mid pack and then faded while never a serious threat.
