Footnotes
MCORO set the pace facing moderate early pressure, edged clear into the turn going in the two path on that bend, was kept to the task. S L R GUS
MCCRAE was coaxed forward, chased the winner, went four then three then four wide on the turn, made no headway in the lane. IMPUTED pressed the
pace briefly, continued to chase three to four wide, held show honors. TOX lacked early speed, went in the two path on the turn, angled widest of all to be
about ten deep in upper stretch and improved. KICK IT was mid-packed and well-positioned outside early, went five wide on the turn, failed to rally.
ATTILA'S LEGEND failed to threaten while saving ground. QUITE PEACE failed to rally after moving out from two to four wide on the turn. OFF THE
WAGON trailed while going four to five wide on the turn, was not a factor.

DANI'S CAT was bumped at the break, encouraged forward to force the issue, entered the turn three wide then shifted to the rail once clear, extended the
margin in upper stretch and kept to the task late. SPICEY SECRET bumped a rival at the start, chased the eventual winner from outside moving in from four
to three wide on the turn, exchanged a light brush in mid-stretch, held the place. FI FI D'ORO shifted out to go three to four wide on the turn, exchanged a
light bump with an inside rival in mid-stretch and ran on. REBEL RYETTE switched out in the early going, went four to five wide on the turn, improved
position in the stretch. BRANDISTYLED bumped a rival at the start then brushed with that same on into the turn going two wide, weakened. K J'S MARK
was bumped at the break then entering the turn and placed in tight quarters at that juncture racing inside, dropped back and faded. CLOCKIN' LIKE DALI

Footnotes
ALEXANDER WHO veered out at the break, quickly sped to the fore and shifted in early on the first turn once clear, extended the advantage early on that
bend racing in the two path, met the challenge of a rival in mid-stretch and dug in to hold that rival at bay. MORE FIREWATER raced well off the leader
three wide early, edged closer heading into the far turn continuing three to four wide, asked for run by the five-sixteenths, couldn't get past.
TALKABOUTNAVARONE saved ground on or off the rail despite being in just a bit tight entering the first turn, advanced between foes up the backstretch
then moved out from two to four wide on the far turn, kept on in the lane. SNOW IN THE NORTH angled in heading into the first turn, saved ground through
both turns and ran on evenly. SPURS N LATIGO saved ground in the early going, shifted out heading up the backstretch, went five to six wide on the far
turn, was vanned off. SEVEN ROONEY was bumped at the break, settled mid-pack, went three to five wide throughout and ran evenly. METEORIC bumped
a rival at the start, was two to three wide early and three to four wide on the second turn, weakened. KELL'S KISS was bumped into a rival at the start,
raced last but one two to three wide and was not a threat. BANISTER stumbled badly at the start, was distanced, eased through the stretch, walked off.

SLAMMED stalked from outside, went three to four wide on the turn taking a narrow lead just past the three-eighths, was clear turning for home, widened
under very light urging despite drifting out a bit late. PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN broke outwardly just a bit, settled off the leaders, went two to three wide on the
turn coming five wide into upper stretch, was second best. LINE CALL dueled outside a rival early, contended three wide and between runners early on the
turn, was no match for the top pair but fought on for show honors. MARKING TIME dueled inside foes just off the rail, had no rally. QUATRO shifted out
from two to four wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
KONA COAST moved forward four wide between rivals, edged clear heading up the backstretch and shifted in a bit, went in the two to three path on the far
turn, held sway in the lane. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT saved ground on or just off the rail through most of the early running, swung out five wide leaving the
far turn, was gaining but too late. DIVINE FAVOR attended the early pace inside the winner but in the three path early, switched outside that one at the
nine-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the far turn urged along while in contention but could only run on evenly. BROZILIAN (BRZ) settled at the rear on
or off the rail, shifted four wide on the far turn, failed to rally. TROOPER chased four to five wide, came seven wide into the stretch but was not persevered
with in the stretch and walked off.
