STYLE raced three wide early, moved up to contest the pace, dueled two wide for command, continued a prolonged duel with NOVEL IDEA on the far turn,
shook free at the furlong marker, then dug in determinedly for the win. MOON BOSS was reluctant to load, bumped at the start, tracked on the inside,
moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and needed more late. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS was bumped at the start, tracked
the leaders, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. NOVEL IDEA set the early pace, then dueled inside for command, dueled with the winner
on the far turn, weakened and held on for fourth. SIGN AND SEAL raced three wide early, settled off the pace, moved up inside on the far turn and then
closed mildly between horses. I'M BUZZY raced off the pace inside and lacked a rally. WHEREDIDYOUGO raced four wide on the first turn, settled off the
pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, then had no rally. SO FULLY SUE was bumped at the start and did not factor. LIKING IT TWISTED was bumped
at the start, checked in the early stages, then outrun. PERGOLA checked in tight quarters entering the first tur, was pulled up on the backside, eased and

ASPECT was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, came wide into the stretch, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final furlong and prevailed late. SHOO
SHINE set the pace racing with a clear lead, opened up on the backside, responded when roused, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly
late. RED AGAIN raced five wide into the first turn, settled two wide off the pace, made a four wide run at the quarter pole, rallied and was outkicked.
CONFESSOR raced four wide early, tracked the pacesetter, chased two wide on the far turn and gained mildly between foes. SUPER DUDE stalked the
pace, chased on the far turn and gained mildly on the rail. COAL TRUTH raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten.
APRICOT was off a bit slow and outrun.

Footnotes
MONIQUES DAREDEVIL stalked the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run, gained slowly in the final sixteenth and was up
late for the win after a long drive. COCKTAILS AT EIGHT set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when asked, dug in gamely in the stretch drive
and yielded grudgingly in the final yards. TRULY A DREAM chased two wide, moved up entering the stretch, rallied mildly and was gaining on the top pair in
deep stretch. SWEET TINA stumbled at the start, stalked outside, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and tired. COOL STANCE raced off the
pace, three wide on the turn and did not factor. BAD TEMPER ducked in at the gap soon after the start, then raced inside and was outrun.
