the final stages. HAUNT trailed to the stretch, was in the two path into the lane, altered out down the lane and rallied for place in the final stages.
IMPRESSED chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. MUCH BETTER chased the pace early, was in
the three path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch drive. HOLLIS stalked the pace early, was in the two path into the lane while making a bid but

Footnotes
AMICHE set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and drew clear in the stretch under a steady drive. FAIR GAME chased the pace early, was in
the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. ENGLISH TREASURE trailed the field early on, made a middle move
and bid three wide along the far turn, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the drive. CLOSET SHOPPER broke in the air at the start
and raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX was in the three path into the lane
and improved position in the stretch. MAKE ME LAUGH broke out at the start, chased the pace early, was in the two path into the lane and leveled off late in
the stretch. TERRANOVA hopped at the start, tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. INCESSANT
stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and empty late in the stretch drive. ALITA was checked along the first turn and the backstretch. ON
MY OWN was bumped at the start and no factor. DUE TO THE START BEAM BEING TRIGGERED EARLY THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
