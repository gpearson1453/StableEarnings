TIZ LA LUNA shot to the front, saved ground around the turn, drove clear down the stretch and finished well. SUMMER TSUNAMI raced within contention,
made a late rail bid, proved no match for the winner, but got by LITESTER for second. LITESTER showed early speed, dueled throughout and got caught
late for second. STORMY SPOTS void of early speed, raced outside around the turn, finished wide and was no factor. MAGNOLIA BEE raced evenly near
the back and was never a threat. DREAM PEACEFUL pressed the early pace, faded, while racing inside around the turn and was no threat late. RACE

TAILORBESWIFT bobbled at the start, vied for the lead, drove clear down the stretch and won under steady urging. HURRICANE TIZWAY challenged for
the lead, came around the turn on the inside, angled out entering the stretch, made a wide bid, proved no match for the winner, but held on for place.
BELMAR BEAUTY unhurried in the early part, made a late bid and missed place. GET DIRECTIONS lacked early speed, finished wide and was no threat.
ADINA always raced near the back and was outrun. SHESTHECATSMEOW dueled for the early lead and dropped to the rear. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
