Footnotes
MOST SANDISFACTORY had speed from the start pressing the pace around the first turn, made the lead before a half, set the balance of the pace under
pressure, drifted out through deep stretch to the seven path under steady left handed urging, brushed the runner up nearing the wire and just lasted.
FALCONS FURY close up from the start, swung out to the eight path for the drive, loomed boldly, was brushed nearing the wire and just missed in a game
effort. VASARIANO vied for the lead for six furlongs, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch, drew on near even terms for the lead between rivals, was
shut off by the winner near the sixteenth marker and lost momentum. BOSS BEAR went evenly, inside. CASTLE KING offered a mild bid in the six path near
the quarter pole then came up empty. MINE'S DIALED IN set the early pace along the inside, had speed into the stretch then stopped. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRYSIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISUQALIFIED MOST SANDISFACTORY FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH AND PLACED
HIM THIRD.

FRONT CIRCLE made the lead soon after the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch while full of run to win as much the best. ATTITUDE
chased the winner from between horses and gamely gained second. KIST never far back, found her best stride late in the four path. BUCKEYE BLING
raced wide and went evenly. GONNABEGOOD had speed from the start, moved up three wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. RAINBOW
SHIP chased the winner along the inside into the stretch then lacked the needed response. GRAZIA WHO had brief speed. PENNY SHOTS was no threat.

BARITONE close up from the start, rallied three wide on the far turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted out to mid track under left handed
urging and drew clear under strong encouragement. LATIN SPICE stalked the pace and finished determinedly in the five path to gain second. TIME TO
SHOOT went evenly. FREDDY SOTO was bumped at the start, rushed up along the rail to make the lead entering the clubhouse turn, set the pace to the
top of the stretch then faded inside. HEZA HANDFUL failed to menace. HOOKED A GOODWIN bore in at the start bumping FREDDU SOTO, had a brief
early lead, prompted the pace into the far turn, regained command, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened late. SCARED WARIOR was
outrun.

Footnotes
ZALINSKY stalked the pace for four furlongs, surged to the front with a quick move nearing the far turn, made the lead, drew clear under left handed urging
and won under brisk handling. DAWN WEST trailed for nearly a half, closed rapidly into the stretch then finished second best in the six path. VALEROSO
led briefly from the start, was taken under a strong hold, chased the balance of the pace and went evenly late. SPEIGHT'S SOUL allowed to settle, inched
closer into the far turn then leveled off. COMPLY stalked the pace from between horses and faded in the stretch. EXONERATED PREZ was no factor.
PERFECT SENSE unhurried, moved closer five wide before a half then came up empty. WINWITHJIMMY was hustled from the start to set the pace for four
and one half furlongs then flattened out.

STRIKE APPEAL away alertly, set all the pace, widen through the stretch at will and won as much the best. FRANCO trailed into the stretch, closed
determinedly along the rail and got up for second. FLATTER ME PLEASE stalked the pace and finished with good courage in the eight path. STATESBORO
chased the winner into the stretch, drifted out from the three path to the seven path while under constant left handed urging, bumped with OBIWAN late and
improved position. OBIWAN allowed to settle, began to gain some ground in upper stretch, was forced out to the seven path, in tight between rivals,
bumped by STATESBORO late causing his rider to check then finished evenly. SOMETHING NATURAL lacked the needed response. THE RIDER OF
OBIWAN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF FLATTER ME PLEASE AND STATESBORO FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED STATESBORO FROM FOURTH AND PLACED HIM FIFTH.

Footnotes
THIS MAN CAN chased the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, shook clear while dropping inside in upper stretch and lasted under left handed
urging. BOOT LEGGER unhurried, checked over heels past the quarter pole, swung wide then closed fast in the middle of the racetrack. KOLE MAN CAN
outrun early, closed a big gap late in the five path. PLATE IT UP close up, was herded out to mid track by the runner up entering the stretch, lost ground
then came on again late. CANT BUY COOL well placed, went evenly. BLINGITONAGAIN away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the turn then was.
