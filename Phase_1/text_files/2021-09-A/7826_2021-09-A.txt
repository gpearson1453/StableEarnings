Footnotes
HONEY BEEST stalked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, shook clear into the stretch, then lasted under steady pressure. SIDE
ACTION well placed and between rivals, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and missed.
STARSHIP PRANKSTER tracked the pace well back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. ALLIE
AND JAZZY well placed and between rivals, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. SUGAR ON TOP allowed
to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, drifted in and passed tiring rivals. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE improved
position. ENLISTED set the early pace off the rail and faded in the lane. SNOWBIRD SALLY well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn,
bid on that path and had no stretch rally.
