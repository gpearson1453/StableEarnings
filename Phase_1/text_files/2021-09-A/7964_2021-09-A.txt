Footnotes
SECRET ZAR settled far behind, advanced wide on the final turn and rallied clear while kept to her task. OUR WEST INDY urged to the front inside, led to
midstretch and yielded. OUI MADAME lacked speed, advanced near the inside and flattened out in the stretch. BARN QUEEN urged outside off the leaders
and lacked a solid rally. JUST A DREAM prompted the pace outside to the stretch and gave way. SHES EUPHORIC dropped far behind and was never a
factor. RAGAZZA CARINA was urged just behind the pacesetters inside and faded on the final turn. ALMOST EVIL was always outrun and weakened
steadily.

shortened stride in the stretch. FLY FLY BIRD lagged far behind then closed the gap along the inside. SNAPPY RIDE was urged off the leaders inside and
flattened out in the stretch. PRINCESS EMMA JO was hustled within range outside then stopped abruptly. IRIE EMPRESS was injured at the starting gate

AMERICAN NINJA reserved well behind, swung wide into the stretch then surged to get up in time. MT SURIBACHI settled early, bid wide on the final turn,
led late but was nailed. HAY BOY pursued the pacesetter outside, bid to the front into the stretch but weakened slightly. CHARGIN STORM saved ground
within range then flattened out in the stretch. NILEATOR was well placed outside the pacesetters then proved empty in the stretch. RATED SPECIAL broke
slowest, trailed then passed fading rivals. THE WANT OF A NAIL sprinted away inside, led to the quarter pole and faded. DRAMATIZED raced off the
pacesetters outside and gave way. Due to a timing issue the six furlongs fraction was omitted. PER RULING 2127PP FROM THE PENSYLVANNIA HORSE

LONG MAY YOU RUN controlled the pace inside then determinedly held rival safe through the final furlong. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN saved ground close up,
steadied in tight near the three eighths pole and continued gamely to the finish. JUMP SHOT prompted the winner outside then weakened slightly in the
stretch. KADENS COURAGE was urged close up between rivals and continued willingly. KOWBOY KARMA dropped far behind then passed tiring
opponents. FIVE MORE MINUTES saved ground well back and lacked a rally. HARD WEST forced the pace three wide to midway on the turn and gave
way. CHAMPERS raced off the leaders three wide and stopped.
