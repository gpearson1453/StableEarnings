FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN raced in the middle of the field in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and was
outfinished for the win. PRE HEAT pressed the pace, came around the second turn three wide, made a bid, took the lead, but couldn't keep up with the top
two. TROPHY DADDY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the home stretch. MOM SAID YES void of early speed and
was never a factor. RED BUFFALO dueled on the front end, saved ground and was finished early. BRANDI BO DANDY always raced near the back and
showed little. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

FRIDAY'S BEST was hard to load, challenged for the lead throughout, had an inside trip and drove clear before the wire. CHARLI MICHAEL broke in,
pressed the pace, came around the turn three wide, made a bid, racing four wide and was a clear second. SENT'S GALAXY dueled for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished by the top two. SUDDENLY reluctant to load, brushed at the start, racing in the rear, saved ground around
the turn and was never a factor. AMANDAS LIGHTENING broke sharp, dropped back, had a wide trip and was no threat. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
