Footnotes
S W LUCKY CHARM tracked inside, came out at the top of the stretch, edged past late under steady urging. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE was urged forward
from the break, moved clear to dictate terms in the two path, weakened in the stretch. COLORFUL COLORADO pursued the leaders from outside going five
wide into the turn and coming seven deep into upper stretch, ran evenly in the lane. MOVE IT MISTER settled at the rear, shifted out five wide by the latter
part of the turn, continued to move out nine deep into upper stretch then drifted out a bit before drifting in, rallied strongly but too late. INQUISITEUR tracked
in behind the leaders three to four wide on the turn, came out eight wide turning for home and ran on. FLICKERING LIGHT chased the leading pair, went
four wide on the turn, came up empty. MOSTLY CLOUDY dueled briefly from outside, dropped back three wide, tired.

WINNIES OWN set a pressured pace inside a foe but off the rail, edged clear leaving the turn, drifted out a touch in upper stretch, extended the margin and
held sway. FLYING PHANTOM settled outside toward the rear early, shifted in entering the turn, went three then two wide on that bend, gained position into
upper stretch but could make no headway late. DIGGER'S GOLD trailed early, went in the two path on the turn, shifted in then out in the stretch and gained
some. IMA SAINT TOO switched out, went three then five wide on the turn dropping back, came into upper stretch widest of all in the seven path and
regained position. REGGIE J chased from outside, went four wide on the turn, was not a late threat. GAMBLING COWBOY dropped back four wide, failed
to rally. FRANKS DEHERE pressed the winner early, went three wide on the turn, gave way.

the stretch and gained late. REVENOOR WOMAN switched off the inside up the backstretch, went four to five wide on the turn, needed more late.
SELECTION PARK shifted out early, trailed the field, went three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six to seven deep and was not a threat.
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY raced outside a foe in the back half of the field going three wide on the turn, shifted eight deep once in upper stretch, failed to rally.
SAYWARD pressed from outside going three to four wide on the turn, came up empty. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong time was omitted.

Footnotes
MR. SILVER EXPRESS forced the pace from outside, shifted in to be three wide entering the turn, edged clear and moved in a further path, was clear into
mid-stretch and held sway under steady handling. FULL OF DRIVE raced toward the back early, advanced past rivals inside going two to three deep on the
turn, swung out seven wide turning for home and continued to drift out a couple paths, gained late. R H EXPRESS exchanged brushes and steadied ever so
slightly entering the turn, saved ground, lacked the needed late kick. WISKEY CROWN went four wide on the turn and kept on in the drive. REINING
PESOS shifted in from five to three wide on the turn racing toward the rear, ran on mildly. HERMANO was fractious in the gate, raced outside foes in the
back half going five wide on the turn, swung eight wide into upper stretch and was carried out further by a drifting foe. WAR WOUNDS contended between
rivals, exchanged brushes and steadied ever so slightly past the seven-sixteenths, came up empty. MAGIC JOURNEY moved to within striking distance
while moving out three to four wide late on the turn, came out a bit further for the stretch run and faded. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
R H EXPRESS AGAINST MR. SILVER EXPRESS ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
