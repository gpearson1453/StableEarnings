Footnotes
DOM THE BOMB was off sharply and sent to the lead, went further clear while saving ground on the turn, and retained his advantage while continuing to go
easily down the lane. SOUTHSIDER broke sharply but was outsprinted to the lead by DOM THE BOMB, chased inside, down the backstretch and through
the turn, kept on while driven inside down the lane, and proved second best. DUMBMARK settled at the rear, raced in the three path on the best, was taken
four wide into the lane, and rallied mildly under a drive for the show. GREELEYS ICE chased outside of SOUTHSIDER early, improved position mildly while
three wide on the turn, was hard driven near the five sixteenths, but flattened three wide in the lane. STRATE REMARK was sent for pace but outsprinted,
tracked well off the leader early, chased between horses around the turn, was driven between horses into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
LITTLE TOOT dueled for the lead on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, kicked clear while still saving ground around the far turn and
dueled gamely down the lane to hold off a late closer for the victory. LORD BOLSTON raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch at the back of the pack on the inside, launched a bid four wide headed into the stretch, and dueled gamely down the lane, just missing, the best
of the rest. MI ENLACE saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, began a late bid with a furlong to go, and gained ground between horses to the wire. TOE THE LINE was away from the gate slowly and
blocked, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the two path around the far turn
and continued to improve position down the lane. FIRMAMENT dueled for the lead from the two path through the opening half mile, continued to battle from
the two path around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch, raced evenly from there and weakened late. CHOCOLATE BUNNY pressed the pace from
the three path around the first turn, dropped back slightly to chase the leaders up the backstretch, continued to lose ground while running in the three path
around the turn and faded further in the stretch. QUALITY HOUR raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, began a bid approaching the half mile pole, dueled from the three path around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. FIFTY ONE NINETY
raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and weakened
from there. KING ZION raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, began to drop back while saving
ground around the far turn and tired further from there. DROOP'S M D B raced in the three path around the first turn, continued at the back of the pack on
the outside, began to drop back entering the far turn, and was eased down the lane.

Footnotes
NYOMAN raced at the inside of the tracking flight early, continued to track in range of the leader while positioned two wide on the turn, was outkicked by
TALE OF THE NILE into upper stretch, kept on with interest under a drive while drifting out, found his best stride past the furlong mark, caught the
pacesetter inside the sixteenth pole and cleared. TALE OF THE NILE was placed on the lead, set the pace while headstrong, saved ground while clear in
the turn, kicked away when asked in upper stretch, kept on under a drive but was caught inside the sixteenth pole. RENEGADE BOB raced two wide in the
rear flight down the backstretch, raced in the three path toward the rear of a well-strung field around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and went to a
drive, angled slightly inward as he kept on, never threatened the leading pair but got up late for the show. TRE LEE DIVINE raced two wide in the tracking
flight early, lost ground on the leading pair into the turn and chased in the two path around the bend well behind them, was driven inside into the lane, could
not gain ground on the leading pair, and lost the show late. CITALI settled in the rear pair, was outpaced into the turn, went to a drive in the two to three path
around the bend, was driven in the three path into the lane, and offered no response.

Footnotes
AMERICAN CHAOS broke quickly, showed the way the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and
drew off from there, ridden out to the wire. ACHILLES bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, and chased the winner home, the best of the rest.
OVERANALYTICAL stalked the frontrunners on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a mild bid while racing in the two path approaching
the five sixteenths pole, and finished evenly. CUPID'S GHOST bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly while drifting mildly in the final
furlong. HERO DRAGON broke slowly and was blocked leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the
stretch in the two path and gained ground quickly down the lane to finish well. TEQUILA REVOLUTION tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and weakened from the rail in the final furlong. ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH veered in and bumped hard with an inside horse
leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. GWENDOLA chased
the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to track the frontrunners from the two path around the turn and faded entering the stretch. LUCKY
SHOT was bumped hard by ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, moved up headed into the turn, came in slightly on the
heels of OVERANALYTICAL nearing the seven sixteenths pole, stumbled, lost his rider, ran with the field the rest of the race, was caught after the wire and
walked off. AN INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE SEVEN SIXTEENTHS POLE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CHRISTIAN C broke inward and lightly bumped DOLLAR BLUE in the opening strides, tracked the leader, took closer order approaching the far turn,
engaged outside of JUST THE FACTS past the three eighths, vied outside that foe into the lane, led for good past the furlong mark and drove clear. AND
WON chased behind the tracking flight, was pushed along into the far turn, tracked the leading pair two wide, was driven two wide into the lane, kept on well
behind CHRISTIAN C and JUST THE FACTS through midstretch, found his best stride in the final sixteenth and got the nod for place. MEMORY BANK
settled toward the rear inside of ANTRIM'S GIANT through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, raced in the three path with the rear of the main
group through the far turn, was taken three wide into the lane, rallied under a drive, and missed the bob for place. JUST THE FACTS was sent clear, set the
pace through the first turn and down the back straight, was engaged by CHRISTIAN C past the three eighths mark while saving ground around the far turn,
vied inside of CHRISTIAN C into the lane, kept pace to midstretch but flattened out in the final furlong. DOLLAR BLUE was lightly bumped by CHRISTIAN C
in the opening strides, tracked the leader inside of that foe through the clubhouse turn and while racing keenly down the backstretch, tracked the leading
pair while saving ground around the far turn, was driven into the lane inside of AND WON in upper stretch, continued in range of that chasing flight past the
furlong mark, but was no match for AND WON and MEMORY BANK in the final sixteenth. ANTRIM'S GIANT settled toward the rear outside of MEMORY
BANK, continued outside that foe at the rear of the main group while racing around the far turn, shifted four wide into the lane, and lacked the needed
finishing kick. KEARNY COUNTY settled at the rear, was pushed along into the far turn but began to lose ground on his foes, was driven in the four to five
path around the bend, found no response and was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
LUSCIOUS was sent for pace, saved ground around the turn, kicked further clear in upper stretch, and maintained a commanding advantage while ridden
out. MORRIE'S JOY settled outside of KYLEIGH'S CANDY in the rear flight, was pushed along in the four to five path on the turn and began to rally, raced
six wide into the stretch, sustained her rally and got up for the place past the sixteenth mark. STACY ATTACK chased the leading trio, began to improve
three wide past the three eighths, continued three wide into the lane, was outkicked into upper stretch by MISS HIGH N MIGHTY, but re-rallied in the final
furlong and got the bob for show. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY broke sharply, tracked the pacesetter inside of SAINT J J down the backstretch and through the
bend, proved no match for LUSCIOUS into upper stretch, chased on willingly, but lost second inside the sixteenth mark and then lost the show bob.
VIETNAM settled near the rear early, came in on KYLEIGH'S CANDY near the seven sixteenths, continued near the rear in the three to four path on the
turn, was driven two wide into the lane, carried out KYLEIGH'S CANDY as she drifted out in upper stretch, found her best in the final sixteenth and finished
well. SHE'S SO CALI chased midpack down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, chased two wide in the lane and was outkicked.
KYLEIGH'S CANDY was slow into stride, raced at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, took up near the seven sixteenths when VIETNAM
came in on her, floated out into the six path when racing around the turn, raced four wide into the lane, was carried further out by VIETNAM as that foe
drifted out, and took mildly closer order. SAINT J J tracked the leader outside of MISS HIGH N MIGHTY, continued between horses in the tracking flight
around the end and into the lane, and flattened out two wide.

Footnotes
MY SWEET KAT dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, challenged entering the stretch, dueled
outside down the lane and pulled clear late. ESTARDO stumbled leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, led the
way while saving ground around the turn, dueled gamely down the stretch and gave way in the final strides. TIZ SUSAN ANN stalked the leaders between
horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, chased the eventual winner in upper stretch and finished evenly
between horses. STACK SHACK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, and gained ground
mildly between horses in late stretch. FUDGE BROWNIE raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the
three sixteenths pole and gained ground late on the inside from there. PALETTE hit the gate and bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, trailed
the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung to the outside entering the stretch, and passed tiring horses with a quick turn of foot on
the outside in the final furlong. HEY HEY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and flattened out late. ANOTATION was reluctant to load, chased the frontrunners on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and faded in the stretch. APOLLO U ANYWHERE dueled for the lead between horses in the early
going, dropped back to chase the frontrunners while saving ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong.
