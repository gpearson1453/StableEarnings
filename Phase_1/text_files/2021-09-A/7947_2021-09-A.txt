BOAT'S A ROCKIN angled to the rail once clear nearing the first turn, began to draw off nearing the end of the backstretch and widened under a brisk hand
ride. STORM FACTOR steadied along the rail nearing the wire the first time, stayed along the rail while making a run around the final turn, angled out
entering the stretch, moved closer into the final furlong then flattened out. I SAY I PLAY raced in good position along the rail into the far turn, came out
midway on the bend then weakened. MY FRIEND FRANK wasn't far back outside early then tired. SOLAR WARMING ran outside the winner for over a half
then stopped. LOVEDISC couldn't catch up after a slow break.
