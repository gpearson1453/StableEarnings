Footnotes
HAPPY BACK dueled inside of WHISKEYONHISLIPS to midstretch, put that foe away leaving the eighth pole and held onto a diminishing margin under a
steady drive. PORK CHOP saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and closed outside. WHISKEYONHISLIPS dueled outside of the winner
and weakened in the final furlong. WILDCAT ECHO bumped with LAYNES KNIGHT at the start, raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the
lane. CAPTURE MI slammed into the starting gate and was away well last, angled in entering the turn and never threatened. LAYNES KNIGHT was
bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. WILD IRISHMAN played no factor while racing four wide. CREATIVE
MAGIC had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
DIVINE CONNECTION veered in at the break but was quickly corrected, vied inside MAKIN IT LOOK EASY and DIGNIFIED early, shook clear around the
turn, and maintained a daylight advantage through the stretch mildly urged. VEILED PROPHET bumped with WILDCAT STAR at the start, was outsprinted
early inside, began finding stride on the turn while moving out three wide, could not reach the winner but finished well to clearly best the others. LANIAKEA
STORM trailed early, took closer order approaching the stretch out in the five-path, and rallied mildly to go clear of the rest. SOUL FLIGHT raced three wide,
and lacked the needed rally. WILDCAT STAR was bumped between horses at the start, stayed in shouting distance to the turn, then faded steadily.
DIGNIFIED contested the early pace outside rivals, moved inward past the quarter-pole and tired along the rail. MAKIN IT LOOK EASY vied up front
between rivals for a quarter-mile, and retreated on the turn. JO JO A GO GO dropped far back before reaching the stretch, and jogged in. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED, FIVE-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ELISA'S SONG settled early in midpack, rallied through inside to take over from LADY YOUNES in upper stretch, and drew clear under pressure.
SWEETCANDYFACTORY was outsprinted early, advanced around the turn four then five wide, and finished well to best the others. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN
pursued the pacesetter between horses to the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a closing response. OODLES ON FIRE lagged well back
through the opening half-mile, improved through the stretch in the two-path but posed no real threat. LADY YOUNES sprinted clear early, showed the way
to the stretch two to three wide, could not cope with ELISA'S SONG and folded up. MILA came in just after the start, and was outrun. TSAYONARA SLEW
was no factor inside. KUMANDRA chased four wide early, and faded steadily leaving the turn. CAGUA was finished after a half. UNCAPTURED FAITH
showed speed for a half, and stopped. IVY WAY was crowded by MILA shortly after the start, and showed little. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED,
FIVE-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
GOODBYE GABY stalked the pace two wide down the backstretch, moved to even terms near the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of ACTING LUCKY
from to deep stretch and edged ahead late under a steady drive. ACTING LUCKY set the pace along the rail, was headed by the winner near the
three-eighths marker, fought on inside of that foe, had the rider drop the whip approaching the eighth pole, continued to duel to deep stretch and yielded
late. COZY CAFE settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn and rallied outside to just miss second. MISS ITALY lagged well
back in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. DON'T LOSE HOPE was in range three wide and faded through the lane. KITTY
KITTY chased the pace two wide and tired in the drive. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL was outrun inside.

Footnotes
THENORTHREMEMBERS got floated out into the first turn outside COLONEL JACKSON, shadowed that rival up the backstretch and around the far turn,
wrested command with a furlong remaining and edged away, then held sway under a drive. BUENISIMO was difficult to load, tracked three wide in the clear
for six furlongs, had aim outside the winner through the lane, did not have enough and just saved the place. THORN raced two wide in the second flight to
the stretch, split horses rallying a sixteenth out and just missed the runner-up spot. COLONEL JACKSON went into the first turn three wide with a short lead,
moved inside nursed along for six furlongs, could not stave off THENORTHREMEMBERS through the furlong grounds and gave way. EXPONENTIAL broke
a step slow, trailed for six furlongs inside, moved out in the stretch and gained only mildly. SOUTH POINTE DRIVE raced three wide on the turns, and made
no headway late on the far outside. NO GETTING OVER ME saved ground, came under a ride on the far turn, and was empty.

Footnotes
GATSBY stalked the pace inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, closed steadily on the pacesetter and was up in deep stretch. AMERICAN PRINCE
set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. SPEARGUN trailed inside for a half, swung widest in upper
stretch and was along for the show. THE DISTRACTOR stalked the pace three wide and tired in the drive. DEMOCRACY failed to menace while racing two
wide. BAILEY hopped at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn and was through early. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED WITH THE FIVE FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON set the pace slightly off the inside, and widened through the stretch under a steady drive. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT raced two to three
wide around the turn, finished willingly and was up for second between horses. HAPPY LOUDON stumbled at the start, chased outside three then two wide
to the stretch, and weakened. BEAUTY QUEEN raced three to four wide around the turn, and had no closing bid. HENNI PENNY showed early speed
inside, got outpaced approaching the turn, and posed no threat. LA CARA BONITA never reached contention. MY DESTINY hit the left side of the gate and
was off slowly, came five wide off the turn and made no progress. DADDY'S JOY tired three then four wide past the quarter-pole.
