Footnotes
CORSIDAT chased the early pace three to four wide on the turn, made a four wide bid leaving the turn, then went on even terms in the furlong grounds,
switched back to left lead at the sixteenth pole but still prevailed late under a drive. TIZWAY FOREVER set the early pace while clear on the turn and off the
rail, then was headed in the furlong grounds and dug in gamely but was outfinished late, clearly second best. DOWN AND DIRTY was bumped at the start,
then raced three wide by the quarter pole, then offered a belated rally for the show award. ZIGGY'S STORM tracked the early pace three wide and then was
on the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. KHUSHBU was off slowly, then was three wide by the three eighths pole, then moved to the inside by the
quarter pole and had no rally.

MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR was well rated early, made a five wide move by the quarter pole, then kicked clear in the final furlong under left handed crop urging
to prove best. SASSY SAGEY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid to take over leaving the turn, then was headed in mid stretch by the
winner, proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. CACTUS FLOWER was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn between horses
and came three wide into the drive, finished willingly but proved to be no match for the top two while besting the rest. HAPPY OUT dueled for the early lead
two wide, then was between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. PURITY dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. DAY SPA was bumped at
the start, stalked the pace and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but came up empty in the drive. BOURBON BUNS failed to menace.

Footnotes
BERN N ASH was four to five wide on the first turn while a bit rank, was hard to handle throughout while four wide, then was sent down around the three
eighths pole to keep pace, drifted to the inside around the quarter pole, then swung back out four wide for the drive, then wore down rivals late to prove best
under strong handling. KID SHELLEEN was settled early while four to five wide, came five wide into the drive, closed well on the outside but was outfinished
by the winner, got place. TROPICAL TORNADO vied for the lead three wide, made a bid to gain a short lead by the sixteenths pole but was caught just
before the wire, lost place spot too. PRIORITIZATION vied for the lead on the inside and gave way grudgingly. SIMON PETER was between horses on the
first turn, then settled early, came four wide into the drive and offered a belated rally, needed more. RUFFLED WATERS was well placed early in between
rivals and faded. WEATHER PRAYER was on the inside on the first turn chasing the place and weakened. ECHO MOUNTAIN was not a factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE MAEMI steadied on the inside around the three eighths pole, then made a decisive bid between horses by the quarter pole, shook clear leaving the
turn and by the furlong marker, and had enough to hold on late under mild drive. Z'S LUCKY GIRL chased the early pace while five to six wide, came five
wide into the drive and closed well. MORE APPROVAL chased the pace from between horses and checked around the five sixteenths pole, then moved to
the inside, then moved back out to come three wide into the drive and finished well. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE dueled for the lead on the inside and made a
bid to shake clear on the turn and faded in the drive. PRIME N PROPER raced on the inside early, moved out on the turn and came four wide into the drive
but was empty. QUITE WHIMSICAL was allowed to settle early, made a inside run on the turn but lacked the needed stretch bid. ANNA'S TRIBUTE passed
the tiring rivals. SHOTGUN KATIE lacked a rally. K TO THE CAMP was bumped at the start and not a factor. DOMESTIC REVIEW dueled for the lead three
wide and folded.

Footnotes
HOLY JUSTICE stalked between foes in the three path, angled five wide at the quarter pole, dueled late and prevailed under steady driving. LOUDER
THAN WORDS was off awkwardly, checked repeatedly while lacking room, was steadied at the quarter pole, bid in the stretch, dueled late but couldn't get
past the winner. NO MORE FAKE NEWS raced five wide, angled seven wide in the stretch and bid late for the show. RE ANTE stalked in the four path, bid
on the turn, angled inside at the eighth pole, then yielded late. COMPRESSED ENERGY dueled inside of a foe, but couldn't last. KISSES SO SWEET was
impeded at the start, then was unrushed, bid in the stretch but faltered. EVERYTHING'S ROSY raced five wide, came seven wide into the stretch and
improved position late. SKYS IMAGE pressed the early pace inside and then gave way in the stretch. FLIRTY DANCER dueled outside of a foe but couldn't
last. MI ESTRELLA stalked early in the two path before giving way in the stretch. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF
LOUDER THAN WORDS AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH.

BURNING AMBITION was well rated throughout and made a three wide bid approaching the quarter pole and quickly assumed command, then drew off in
the stretch while being ridden out, wrapped up final sixteenth to prove much the best. PRINCESS THEOREM was allowed to settle early on the inside,
continued to save ground entering the stretch, angled off the rail and the stretch and rallied to be clearly second best. MRS CLAUS was allowed to settle
while three wide and in between rivals, advanced and came four wide into the drive and offered no rally while getting up for the show award. COVENANT
LADY was well placed early and made a inside bid leaving the turn, but came up empty in the drive, lost show late. BIG BAND LUZZIANN set the early pace
while clear and racing off the rail and gave way in the drive. CELESTIAL SPIN was allowed to settle while four wide on the backstretch, came five wide into
the drive and tired.

DYN O MITE was sent to the lead to set the pace while clear, then was challenged by ROYAL PRINCE going by the quarter pole, then dueled with that rival
through the stretch, turned back his bid to prove best in a game score. ROYAL PRINCE was well rated early and made a three wide bid on the turn to go on
even terms for the lead, then crowded that rival through the stretch and hung.. PERFECT SILENT CAT chased the early pace and had a mild late rally on
the inside to best the rest while no match to the top two. SHOFAR was allowed to settle early and made a four wide middle move but finished evenly. OH
SAY (IRE) lacked a rally. THE JOCKEY ON #7 ROYAL PRINCE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE #6 DYN O MITE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE #6 DYN O MITE FOR HITTING ROYAL PRINCE WITH THE
RIDING CROP IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
MOWINS was well placed early towards the inside, then eased out on the turn and swung five wide entering the stretch, closed full of run to win going away
late under a drive. ORO AZTECA dueled for the early lead three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then moved out to the four wide
path entering the stretch and drew clear by the furlong marker, but could not hold off the winner late while clearly second best. BLUE KALON was reserved
early, then was on the inside by the quarter pole and finished well on the inside to gain the show award. WHAT NOW DARRELL was allowed to settle early,
came six wide into the drive and offered a belated rally. CORNER TAP was taken back early, advanced two wide on the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and showed late interest. TOUR THE MOON was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide into the stretch and finished evenly late.
HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE chased the pace six wide and was wide on the turn and weakened. CLASSIC MAX was bumped at the five eighths pole, dueled
for the lead on the inside and weakened. METALLIC MAN was bumped around stalking the pace four wide around the five eighths pole, then weakened on
the turn. VENICE BEACH was bumped at the five eighths pole and stalked the pace five wide and weakened on the turn. THREE TWO RUN was off slowly,
then showed little. BUCKSHOT RUN was off slowly and was not a factor.
