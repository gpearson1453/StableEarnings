Footnotes
TELLURIDE QUEEN was urged at the break to obtain a more forward position, tracked in behind in the two path on the turn, moved in to the rail leaving that
bend, bid inside in mid-stretch, dueled from the sixteenth to the wire and got the nod. LAURA BELLE set the pace early racing off the fence, went in the two
path on the turn, was engaged by the aforementioned near the sixteenth pole and lost the nod. STONE TOP stalked early while inside a foe but off the
fence, went three wide on the turn, was no match for the top pair. SELL BABY SELL angled in from outside at the seven-sixteenths to race in behind the
leaders going three to four wide on the turn, kept on evenly. SAY HELLO TO HEAT chased from outside going five wide and weakened. WHAT A
SURPRISE hesitated slightly at the break, raced last but one in the two to three path on the turn, swung six deep into upper stretch and ran on. INDIAN
DIVA reared then stumbled slightly at the start spotting the field several lengths, raced off the inside in about the four to five path on the turn and wider for
the drive.

ZOMBIE ALAN moved to the fore after the opening three-sixteenths to dictate terms while kept well off the inside, went from four to three wide on the turn,
lost the lead and ground leaving that bend into upper stretch, was resurgent under stout urging to get the nod. WILLY TELL HIM tracked the leaders, bid
inside leaving the turn after saving ground, had a clear lead from upper- till late but lost the nod. YES ITSA STAR shifted in heading to the turn, tracked the
leaders in behind three wide, moved out five deep past the furlong marker for room and gained belatedly. COWBOY TOBY bumped and bothered inside
rivals shortly after the start while moving in, had the early lead briefly then chased from outside, went five then four wide on the turn, was in range at the
head of the lane but weakened. BORTSTEIN exchanged some contact early, angled to the rail, saved ground on the turn improving position but lacked the
needed late kick. SAMURAI JACK was encouraged along early on the turn while lacking early speed, went two to three wide on that bend, passed tired
rivals in the stretch. STORMY WORLD was bumped between foes then steadied in the early going, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally.
DAJUDGE raced mid-pack outside foes early, went four to five wide on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
TRACTOR MAN was just a tiny bit fractious in the gate, quickly moved clear to dictate terms riding the rail, widened heading up the backstretch, asked for
more late on the far turn, was shortening stride in late stretch but held safe. PUB raced inside a foe but off the fence through the first turn while mid-pack,
moved nearer the rail heading toward the far turn, saved ground on that bend before angling three deep turning for home, was gaining steadily but slowly.
SOULONG exchanged bumps with inside and outside foes at the start, was well-positioned outside a foe mid-pack going three to four wide throughout,
failed to rally. C D POLDARC exchanged a bump at the start, was taken back and angled in, settled at the rear saving ground, swung six wide into upper
stretch and ran on mildly. NEXTPORTOFCALL switched off the inside to stalk the winner two to three wide, weakened on the far turn and angled in coming
out of that bend, was empty for the drive. LEMON ICE exchanged a bump at the start, raced off the inside in the three to five path while well back, made no
bids.

AWESOME STORM moved up inside to take a narrow lead about the half-mile marker, vied inside foes through the turn, was headed at the top of the
stretch, regained command and edged away late. HENRY ON THE RUN settled off the pace inside runners but in the two path into the turn, moved nearer
the rail and found room inside past the three-sixteenths, ran on mildly. BAND OF GLORY attended from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, put a
head in front in upper stretch then weakened late. RISKY REVENGE advanced between rivals on the turn going three to four wide on that bend, lacked the
needed late kick. NEAR GENIUS chased from outside, dropped back four to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. AISLE RUNNER vied between runners

Footnotes
SHAME ON BEA set the pace in the clear racing just off the rail, drew away. UNBRIDLED DIVA tracked the leader from inside rivals but off the fence, went
in the two to three path on the turn, was second best. ARRANGED VOWS was positioned between runners tracking the leader, went three to four wide on
the turn, had no extra. MY CRAZY SISTER chased the pacesetter, was outside foes four to five wide on the turn, weakened. RUN LIKE KATE failed to rally
racing off the inside in the four to five path. TERAS SILENCE shifted in late up the backstretch, saved ground in the two path on the turn but was not a
threat. PASSION RIDE was not a factor racing off the inside.
