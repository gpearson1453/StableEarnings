THEYKEEPONCOMIN set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off slightly and held. SECRET TEMPLE allowed
to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and closed well late to gain the place. PATIENT DIGNA stalked
the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no match for
that one and held the show. SUPER DONNA G tracked the pace, saved ground through the second turn on the two path, bid on that path into the stretch
and had a mild gain. SAYSO passed a tiring rival, inside. ANNIE UP BUCK lunged at the start, rushed up outside, lost some ground three wide through the
second turn, then had no stretch rally.

SUMMERFEST mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and drew off late.
SHOOT YOUR CUFFS rated close up, saved ground through the turn, got through inside into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was no match and held
the place safe. PURE SPRING allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and improved his position.
FOLTYNEWICZ sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furong and held a share.
I'M JUST LAUGHING mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. TOUCH OF LA GREY passed tiring
rivals. OAKMONT MAGIC well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and faded the final
furlong. GILGIMESH stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then had no rally. DIALED IN ON ALICE was no

Footnotes
ORAZIO never far back, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and edged up in the
final strides. CROW MOON sprinted to a clear lead quickly, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then was outfinished. DAHOG mid pack, looped
up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, then closed willingly and lacked the needed late kick. BUZZ OFF well placed and outside,
held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. PIONEER DANCER tracked the early pace, angled out to
stalk that one through the second turn, bid outside, then weakened in the stretch. PENDRELL MOON was no factor.

Footnotes
RED HOT LOOKS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off under mild urging. CHARLIE
CHARLIE well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, then evened out while gaining the place.
DIMATE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. INDIAN
TANGO mid pack, moved up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. FLY FRIENDLY SKY tracked the pace, held position
two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. POLLOCK well placed, gained a striking position on the
two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. TALE OF KANTHAROS well placed, moved up on the two
path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and ran evenly in the stretch. AWESOME HALO ran evenly. BREZNO never far back, lost some ground
four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and had no rally. THESIS was never involved.
