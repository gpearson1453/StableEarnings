MINE THAT STAR stalked just off the leaders from outside, engaged to duel three to four wide on the turn, edged away late. DESTINY ONE attended the
pace from between runners into the turn, went two to three deep on that bend dueling inside a foe, was outkicked by that one. SECRET'S DOUBLE broke
out just a bit, shifted in entering the turn to go two wide, moved out five wide by the end of that bend, ran on. GREENBRIER raced outside a foe off the
leaders going four to six wide on the turn and was not a threat. FLIGHT SPEED bobbled at the break, trailed early, went in the three to six path on the turn,
failed to threaten. ABETEMARCO vied inside runners early, was done at the three-eighths, dropped back and faded. Due to a timer malfunction the six
furlong fraction was unavailable.

REGGIE J set the early tempo near the inside, hooked up and dueled inside on or just off the rail late on the turn into the lane, was headed through much of
mid-stretch but gamely regained late to prevail. DIABOLICAL MIGHT stalked early then dueled outside two to three wide, had a narrow lead in mid-stretch
but was outfinished. CANYON DEL ORO settled off the leaders, went four wide on the turn, was along for show. LATIGO'S FIRSTDANZ saved ground
inside toward the back, came out in upper stretch and went evenly. A B LOOKER was outside early, went five wide on the turn, shifted in having reached
upper stretch and failed to threaten. RED RHUMBA chased briefly, went two to three wide on the turn and came up empty.

VROYSKY dueled briefly outside then edged clear on the turn two wide, was kept to the task. UNION BROTHER stalked mid-pack, went three to four wide
on the turn, lugged out and lightly brushed a foe past the three-sixteenths, ran on to secure the place. PHOENIX FIRE was slow to gather, began to
advance outside rivals on the turn having switched out, went four to five wide on that bend, was lightly brushed past the three-sixteenths and lacked the
needed late kick. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT was off the inside going in the three to four path through the turn, failed to rally. VIVID FEVER vied briefly inside
the winner, steadily weakened.
