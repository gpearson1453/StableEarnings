Footnotes
JENN'S THE BOSS tracked the early leader while racing well off the inside down the backstretch, moved up to challenge through the upper stretch, drifted
through the stretch run to race well wide and got up under strong handling. GRAN MICHELLE was sent along from the inside to set all the pace, angled well
off the inside through the lane and was wore down late to finish second best. MOON ME AGAIN was allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide
through the drive and had not enough for the top pair. SECUENCIA stalked the top pair down the backstretch and tired while racing near the rail.
WORKINONBEINSINGLE dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
KICKSTARTER was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up through the far turn, made a good four wide bid through the drive, lost his whip near the
sixteenth pole and got up late to prove best. BIG TALL DAWG was coaxed along to press the early pace, raced two deep and held the place position late.
NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY showed good early speed to set a contested pace, was clear at the eighth pole but couldn't couldn't last as he weakened a bit
in the final stages. TOP BOSS was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally.
ANOTHER LULU dropped back early, raced towards the inside and had no response. HAIL SOUTHERN was forwardly placed to lay up close in the early
stages and failed to sustain a bid.

just off the inside and weakened through the drive. POWERFUL FORCE was unhurried early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no response
while racing from the inside. SPOTTED CAT bumped at the break, was slow in the early stages and never threatened. STORM ATTACK raced five wide
around the first turn, stalked the early leaders down the backstretch, raced towards the inside through the stretch run and never threatened. ORIGO

on, raced near the rail at the quarter pole, moved up three wide through the stretch run and made a mild late bid. JAG settled to the middle of the pack,

Footnotes
STYNER pressed the early pace from the inside and drew clear under a strong hand ride. SANTO was allowed to settle early on, moved up near the inside
and made a good late bid. ENGLISH LAD dueled for the early lead while racing between rivals and weakened a bit in the drive. REDEEM PETER stalked
the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. RESTLESS ROCKER
was forwardly placed to lay up close early and weakened from the inside. HOOKEAI threw his head at the break, dropped back early and never threatened.
