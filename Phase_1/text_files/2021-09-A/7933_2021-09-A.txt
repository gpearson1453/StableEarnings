EMOLGA stalked the pace, took over on the far turn and was all out in the stretch to fend off JAVISTHA. The latter chased while three wide, advanced on
the far turn and stayed on while three wide in the stretch. GAME TO PLAY led early, was headed on the far turn and yielded. NOCTURNAL MISSION never
menaced. MAYAN SKY was always outrun. SING ALONG SUZY was outpaced inside and lacked a rally. FLYTA showed little interest.

JUST JOHNNY forced the pace, forged clear leaving the turn and held well thereafter under steady pressure. AMERICAN SUE outrun early, commenced a
bid on the turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. FORGIVEN leaned out at the start, set a contested pace and was brushed aside on the turn. BLUE
PARADISE never menaced. WELLER ROGUE was always outrun. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW retreated. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.
