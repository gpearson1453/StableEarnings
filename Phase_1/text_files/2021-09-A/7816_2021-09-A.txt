CALL THE COPS had inside speed under mild pressure, opened a short clear lead on early backstretch, maintained lead to final turn, opened up, increased
margin into stretch, drew out. GUARANTEEDDELIVERY pressed outside early, well placed off rail final turn, prevailed outside in the battle for the place.
HENRISINCONTROL veered out at the break, tracked winner inside, made a place bid in the stretch, third best. IMPRESSIVE SENSE, well placed outside,
went after the winner on the final turn, couldn't get to that one, tired in the drive. RUSSIAN RED showed little. HAPPY HARLEY showed little.
