Footnotes
NOT A WILD BRAT stalked the early pace, closed three wide on the turn and into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker and drew clear under
mild urging. GOOSEISONTHELOOSE pressed the pace two wide, made the lead entering the turn, set the pace into the stretch then was no match for the
winner. MARQUERO set the early pace along the inside, had speed into the stretch then weakened. BEACH AND WINE failed to menace. TIDAL ROCKET
advanced along the inside into the stretch then leveled off. CHILLVILLE had speed into the turn then gave way. PERFECTION EXPRESS hit the gate at the
start and had brief speed. SHANGHAI LILLY hopped then veered inward at the start and was never close. STORMY MOON showed little.
