Footnotes
VIA EGNATIA jumped out to the early lead, opened up a comfortable advantage, continued well through the far turn and into the furlong grounds, started to
weaken in deep stretch but was able to hold on. CONO was closest in pursuit along the inside, continued to track the pacesetter from the rail into the far
turn, moved out a path leaving that bend, angled further out in the stretch and put in a late bid but missed. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE unhurried in the
beginning from inside, moved out on the final turn, steered out further in the stretch, closed well and gained the show. STIRLING DRIVE angled to the inside
while placed near the back, tipped out at the three-sixteenths pole, roused in upper stretch and gained ground late. SEA OF LIBERTY settled outside a rival
early, entered the lane between foes and never threatened. FRENCH GETAWAY traveled three deep at the back in the beginning, stayed outside rival to
the far turn, entered the lane outside a pair of rivals and lacked a late bid. WESPHIRE raced between runners early on, steadied off heels nearing the
three-quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. PLAY CHICKEN settled well off the pace on the inside, remained along the fence
to the lane and tired.

Footnotes
HALF PAST TWELVE bobbled leaving the gate, vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals, battled EMPIRE PASS through the turn, cleared entering the stretch
and widened under strong handling. SUE ETTAS GHOST tracked the speed outside rivals, took the turn four wide, rallied into a clear second while unable
to threaten the winner. EMPIRE PASS vied between rivals early, dueled outside the winner around the turn, lost contact at the top of the stretch and
flattened to third. I'M A GIRAFFE had early speed three deep, chased the top pair three wide through the bend and lacked a bid in the stretch. ARTISAN
DANCER was off a bit slow to begin, got bumped from outside then lost her path, drifted out into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and kept on
through the final furlong. MISS RENO shifted in early and raced greenly up the backstretch, entered the turn on the inside, exited two wide and lacked a
rally. MY SWEET MARY steadied behind MISS RENO and altered out early, traveled two wide into the turn, three to four wide into the lane and never
responded. AM YISRAEL CHAI broke in a bit, went up between foes early, chased two wide then moved to the rail on the turn and weakened.
UNFAITHFUL WAYS broke in and bumped rivals, chased outside a foe at the back, came six wide into the lane and was never a factor. MALIBUENA
fractious in the gate, broke a bit slow, traveled five wide into the turn, moved down and entered the stretch three wide and had little left.

Footnotes
AFTER MIDNIGHT sped clear to set the pace and steered to the inside, saved ground through the turn, continued clear to the eighth pole and then met the
challenge from the runner-up in deep stretch and held gamely. LAVA LANE sat off the pace up the backstretch, went between rivals into the turn, moved out
to the three path around the bend, chased three deep in upper stretch, rallied alongside the winner with a sixteenth remaining but could not go by.
SQUARED SHADY brushed inside rival early, stalked on the inside into the turn, saved ground to the lane, bumped rival in upper stretch and finished well
between foes late. SHYLOCK EDDIE tracked from inside then exited the two wide, steered out in the lane and finished well from outside. ACAI stalked the
pace outside a rival, got bumped by SQUARED SHADY while between foes in upper stretch and lacked late punch in the final furlong. WESTWARD
BREEZE brushed with rival soon after the start, unhurried in the beginning on the inside, angled three wide leaving the turn and could not make an impact.
DR WYSONG raced the back of the pack outside a rival, went two wide around the turn and was not a factor. ENSLEYS DREAM in range early off the
inside, went four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY EVELYN took control early, inched away on the backstretch, drew off on the turn and widened under hand urging and coasted in late. CURIOUS
INJI up close early outside the leader, chased off the rail to the stretch and held the place. BIG MOON traveled at or near the back of the pack, angled four
wide around the far turn and gained the show. BANDEENA traveled outside a rival then three deep on the first turn, remained outside rivals to the stretch
and lacked a rally. MEDUSA'S GAZE settled along the inside, angled five wide leaving the second bend and improved position. CLASS CODE traveled wide
through both turns and was not a threat. CONSIDER ME GONE raced off the pace, lacked room past the quarter pole and could not make an impact after
gaining a clear path. QUEEN OF LOVE tracked from between foes to the stretch and weakened. CAN FLY chased along the inside, cut the corner into the
stretch and tired. PATRIOT MISSILE veered out at the start, went four deep at the half-mile marker, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
SO I'M TOLD off a bit slow and broke in, was in a bit tight soon after, stalked the top pair from inside, was in tight alongside a rival past the five-sixteenths
pole, drifted inward in upper stretch, lugged out mid-stretch, drifted back inward in the final sixteenths while overhauling the runner-up. STREET HUMOR
dueled for command from inside, inched ahead at the seven-sixteenths, cleared with three-eighths remaining, drew off around the turn and was run down
late. FORE FLAG moved down to the two path entering the clubhouse turn, steered to the inside and then angled four wide leaving the second bend,
finished well and proved a game third. QUINCEY broke slow then out to bumped rival, settled off the pace, saved ground through the far turn and bested the
rest. PEACEHAVEN traveled in mid-pack early on, raced three deep at the quarter pole, exited the bend four wide and lacked a rally. BLUEBERRY EYES
dueled for command from outside, lost contact at the three-eighths pole, chased three wide into the drive and weakened. BIG SPLASH was off a bit slow
from the outside, angled down to the two path, went three then four wide around the second bend and failed to menace. VELVET GHOST got bumped from
inside at the start, stalked outside a rival, dropped back on the far turn and faded. TRIBAL DANCING off slow to begin, tucked inside on the first turn,
remained along the fence to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CONNIE SWINGLE away quickly from outside, chased three deep to the turn, took aim three to four wide into the stretch, took over nearing the eight pole,
then kicked clear under left-handed urging. CARMEN MIRANDA tracked in the two path around the turn, angled to the rail in the stretch, rallied up the inside
and gained the place. BIG NOVEL tracked outside a rival, between foes on the turn, exited the bend four wide and was along for the show. SALLY
STANFORD sped clear to take control and crossed over, showed the way in the two path into the stretch, overtaken approaching the eighth pole and
flattened to a minor award. BOLD CHOICE came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, dropped back soon after, went three wide into the turn, five wide into
the lane and improved position. MADIHA stalked the pacesetter from between rivals, three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response.
STOPDROPANDROLL turned her head at the start to come away slowly, traveled four then three wide around the turn and could not rally. CAUSE SHE'S A
LADY chased from inside off the pace, two to three wide leaving the turn, came out in upper stretch and never made an impact. DRIZELLA forwardly placed
early on from inside, saved ground through the turn and faded in the stretch run. IRISH WAHINE forced in by rival at the start, tracked well off the rail, went
five wide into the turn, exited the bend six wide, weakened in the drive, eased late and walked off.

clear. CIDER APPLE (GB) dropped early, moved inside, angled out on the final turn, came four wide into the lane, brushed in upper stretch and got up for
second. CINNTE WINNTE (IRE) unhurried in the beginning on the inside, moved out on the backstretch, between into the final turn, closed in around the

around the turn, overtaken at the eighth pole and weakened late. GET ON THE BUS brushed entering the first turn, angled down to the two path early,
bumped approaching the three-eighths pole, traveled three then four wide on the final turn, brushed with CIDER APPLE in upper stretch and finished
evenly. REINA DEL SOL in a bit tight entering the first turn between runners, settled in mid-pack, lacked room leaving the far turn and could not rally.

pursuit from the two path, remained two wide to the stretch and weakened. LADY NOGUEZ pulled a bit early first time through the stretch, moved out on the
backstretch, bumped nearing the three-eighths pole, came five wide into the stretch and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA STREET lacked early speed, moved down to the rail, angled seven wide around the turn, rallied alongside the runner-up in deep stretch and
won going away. DARK PRINCE bumped at the start by SCABBARD, established the front quickly, inched away around the turn, led two wide into the drive,
clung to a narrow lead with a sixteenth remaining and yielded late. SCABBARD broke out and bumped rival at the start, raced off the rail while closest in
pursuit inside a trio of rivals, exited the turn three wide, failed to find the necessary response in the final furlong but stayed on to hold the show.
TACOFLAVOREDKISSES chased three deep between rivals, remained between foes early on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a bid.
INDY JONES hit the gate at the start, settled just out of range, traveled along the inside then two wide into the drive and failed to rally. AFTERNOON HEAT
bumped with rival at the start, trailed six wide into the turn, moved in a bit then back to the six path leaving the turn, steered in some in the stretch and
improved position. EUSTACE chased the pacesetter four deep up the backstretch, three deep into the turn, drifted six into the lane, lost path in upper
stretch and weakened. MOUNTAIN SPIRIT went four wide into the turn, angled down to the rail and came up empty. PALACE PRINCE bumped leaving the
gate, sat off the pace early on, went five then four wide around the turn and was not a factor. STAY GOLDEN forwardly placed between rivals up the
backstretch, started to tire around the turn and coasted to the wire.
