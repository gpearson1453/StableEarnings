Footnotes
RIVER JUMPER was quickly in front to set the pace racing off the fence, went in the two then three path on the turn, extended the margin under steady
handling. ROBTHEQUEEN chased from outside going four then five wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to get up for place. JERRYS WAY shifted in
entering the turn, chased in behind saving ground on the turn, lost place. DANIEL THE DREAMER lacked early speed despite urging, trailed in the two to
three path on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. NAUGHTY SWAGGER pressed the early pace between rivals,
continued the chase three to four wide on the turn, weakened. IRISH CREAM N KAFE chased outside going five to six wide on the turn, shifted in once in
upper stretch and tired. PER THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION, ROB THE QUEEN HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BRIEF WHO moved clear early to dictate terms, shifted in to race in the two path on the turn, held sway under a drive. SPURS N LATIGO steadied just after
the break when in tight then immediately switched well outside the leading trio, was guided back in entering the turn to race in the two path, came out
leaving that bend, appeared poised for second but had to share the place with HALF COURT SAM, who exchanged a bump at the start, steadied ever so
slightly after clearing the gap, exchanged more light bumps late up the backstretch, went in the four path on the turn, kept on under steady urging to run
evenly and share second. EL MAFIA exchanged a bump at the break, steadied early when in tight as rivals shifted around, exchanged some light bumps in
late backstretch, was forced five wide on the turn, tired in the lane.

Footnotes
OUR TIME TO SHINE settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, swung eight deep turning for home, unleashed a strong late kick to get up
near the wire. SWEET REGARDS attended the pace from outside going four to five wide on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, led late but was caught.
MS HIGHSPEED went five to seven wide on the turn coming ten deep into upper stretch, gained steadily to capture show honors. MARIA'S TOWER was in
just a bit tight after the break, settled last but one three wide through the turn, angled eleven wide in about mid-stretch and ran on mildly. K J'S MARK
moved forward to set a pressured pace, entered the turn four wide, began to weaken while drifting four wide out of that bend and continued dropping back.
HEMATITE was mid-pack going six wide through the turn and coming eight wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. CANDY CARMA was coaxed forward to
chase the pace from inside, drifted to the three path leaving the turn and came up empty. SPANKEY THUNDER chased briefly three wide into the turn,
began to steadily retreat, drifted six wide into the stretch and faded. WONTONTOMATO was up close in the early going, lost ground four wide on the turn,
faded in the lane. D ORO CANYON broke a step slowly, trailed racing off the rail and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAGIC JOURNEY was quick to take the early lead, challenged by an outside foe heading into the turn, dueled inside that one but off the fence, edged clear
into upper stretch, held sway under steady handling. BULLY RIDE exchanged a hard bump at the break, angled in heading up the backstretch, moved in
further from four to two wide on the turn and gained late. CATABILITY chased mid-pack, saved ground on the turn, kept on in the lane. LESTER'S
MEMORY broke a bit awkwardly but quickly regained stride and moved forward to chase, went five then four wide on the turn, ran on. SUNLAND STAR was
bumped at the start, went six then five wide turn, came out further into the stretch and passed tired rivals. SWEET BEAU ROLL chased briefly, dropped
back three wide on the turn, failed to rally. REBEL ROUX dueled outside going three wide on the turn, faltered and faded in the stretch. MR CHARLIE KING
exchanged a bump with inside then outside rival at the start, made a mild advance outside foes early on the turn seven then six wide but flattened out and
came up empty.

over, was clear into mid-stretch and held safe. LATENITE SLEWZY was mid-pack early off the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, gained steadily
inside. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL was forced in just a bit, settled toward the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out and exchanged a solid bump in

shifted in, chased inside, came up empty. RAISE OUR FLAG steadied after the break, switched out early, went four to six wide on the turn, lugged in and

inside on the turn, came out in upper stretch, kept on for place. DANI'S CAT stalked the dueling leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, had no extra.
HOMEMADE LOVIN shifted in up the backstretch, tracked inside or two wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SEE
YOU AT THE TOP settled at the rear off the inside, went three to four deep on the turn, swung eleven wide into the stretch and passed rivals. DIVALICIOUS
lacked early speed racing outside, went six to seven wide on the turn, swung twelve wide into the lane. LETHAL ENTITY failed to rally after going five to six
wide on the turn. PREMEDITATED LILY was mid-pack, three to four wide on the turn, and empty in the drive. CHERYL IN CHARGE dueled outside the

Footnotes
AMY'S HONEY was urged at the break to set the pace from outside, opened up three wide late on the turn, lasted while shortening stride. GOLDEN
GODDESS broke very awkwardly spotting the field a couple lengths, raced inside throughout and was gaining but too late. ZONNA was up close vying
inside for the early lead, lost ground on the winner late on the turn, came out a bit for the stretch run and kept on. OUR NATIVE ANGEL was
forwardly-placed between runners heading into the turn, lost ground two to three wide on that bend, needed more. REDHAWK switched off the inside early,
went two to three wide on the turn, swung nine wide in upper stretch and was not a late menace. DADDY HEAT was content to race at the tail early, went
four to six deep on the turn, moved out ten wide into upper stretch and passed some rivals. JEDI JENNIE was mid-pack early going four to five wide on the
turn, failed to rally. BIG LEGS RED was outside five to six wide on the turn, shifted inside a rival leaving that bend and was not a threat.

Footnotes
DESERT REWARD settled well back early, advanced past foes inside on the turn, altered outside the leader in mid-stretch and got up late. HOT CHARLIE
dueled inside a rival coming off the fence leaving the turn, drifted just a hair while clear in upper stretch, was caught late. MONTEREY SECRET stalked
from outside, lost ground on the leading pair three to four wide on the turn, came seven to eight deep into upper stretch and kept on. MY STORM
WARRIOR settled in the back half going four to five wide on the turn, was steadily gaining late. BLUE BEES dueled outside the runner-up going two to three
wide on the turn, weakened. MR. SILVER EXPRESS went six wide on the turn and was not a threat. ROWDY MAMBO was in just a bit tight early, switched
out and chased three deep, came up empty. BABY SHAMU faced mild traffic in the early stages, steadily dropped back four wide, faded.

Footnotes
MEMORY TAKER broke in just a bit, settled off the dueling leaders, went in the two path on the turn, came out six wide turning for home, struck the lead in
upper stretch and held sway. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE set the pace in the clear, saved ground on the turn, drifted out a couple paths into the lane, was
overtaken in upper stretch but kept on gamely in second. IZA DADDY settled toward the rear, went four wide on the turn, gained late. EL CHUMELITO
stalked from outside a foe off the leading pair, went four wide on the turn dropping back, came eight wide into the stretch, lugged in a bit but kept on.
AWESOME K P broke a step slowly, went two to three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MOVE IT MISTER stalked the pacesetter going three
wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch and came up empty. DIVE BAR failed to threaten racing inside.
