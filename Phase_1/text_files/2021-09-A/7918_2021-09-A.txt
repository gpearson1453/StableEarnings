DOLCI raced evenly on the outside advancing wide through the far turn looming in the nine path upper stretch rallying while angling in getting up in time.
BEACH PEACH stalked the pace rallying to draw even on the far turn shaking clear in the three path upper stretch being grabbed by wide rival in the last
strides. ZURLIN advanced on the backside chasing close up on the far turn, vying from mid track down the lane finishing evenly holding the others. GERRY
LYNN gave early retreat then took advantage of weary rivals down the lane gaining position in the six path. ULTRA DIVA stalked through the far turn
weakening into upper stretch. SEEKING VIOLET gave a quick middle move dueling on the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. RUTHYLA fractious broke
through the gate delaying the start then hesitated breaking in the air. LA REINA DEL NORTE set the early pace giving way on the far turn.
