JUSTATAPIN grabbed the early lead, pulled away leaving the turn and held well thereafter under steady pressure. SENNEBEC SUMMER settled well,
commenced a bid on the turn and stayed on while three wide in the stretch. CAVATICA raced forwardly along the inside and kept on well for a minor share.
FRUGAL BETTY stalked the pace and came up empty in the stretch. HER WAY OR NO WAY was always outrun. SINGING ALLI was in tight quarters at
the start, shied early and proved no factor.
