Footnotes
BLOWING BAYOU tracked the pace of CLASSIC LEAH from the inside, moved up to engage that foe nearing the sixteenth pole and edged away through
the closing yards. CLASSIC LEAH broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, remained in control through mid-stretch and gave way to
the winner through the final sixteenth. CLOSE THE SHOW LO broke awkwardly, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into
the stretch and finished evenly late. EMMA'S A BEAST was off a step slow, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and
weakened in the drive. POINT HOPE (IRE) showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHES GOT THE POWER stalked the pace of PRINCESS CAROLINE while racing four-wide throughout, responded when set down for the drive through the
final sixteenth and was up in the closing yards. PRINCESS CAROLINE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when
challenged by AMBERS STORM nearing the quarter, vied with that rival but could not hold the winner safe late. SHE'S MY RIDE was off slow, raced
unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. AMBERS STORM broke sharply to
press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. LADY ELIANA was forwardly
placed from the inside and gradually gave way. RATIONAL showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and was not a factor. LOVE ON THE FLY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
PROUD LION was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, was challenged by POPPY'S C NOTE in mid-stretch, vied with that rival,
bumped repeatedly and held gamely to the wire. POPPY'S C NOTE broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to
engage that foe with a furlong to run, vied and bumped repeatedly and just missed. LOOSE BALL chased the leaders while racing three-wide and failed to
gain in the drive. LIBERTY'S FINALE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response.
PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. PREMIER LEAGUE settled off the leaders
from the inside and gradually weakened. REBEL ROAR broke in the air and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
R B EYE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in time.
ORCADIAN STORM was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, relinquished that duty to MAMACALLMEBOO after going three
furlongs, drifted out late to bump with that rival and gamely held the place. MAMACALLMEBOO pressed the pace of ORCADIAN STORM while racing
three-wide, moved up to gain command nearing the three-eighths pole, was bumped in the closing yards and finished well when clear. COMMAND SGT
MAJOR settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. CANDIED LUTE chased the leaders while racing four-wide
and weakened through the final furlong. WHIDBEY PRINCE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THE RIDER OF
MAMACALLMEBOO LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST ORCADIAN STORM CONCERNING THE BUMPING INSIDE THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND
AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED ORCADIAN STORM HAD DRIFTED OUT AND CAUSED THE BUMPING AND WAS DISQUALIFED
FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
NOOSITA pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew clear. DISCREET DEMONS settled off the
leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid to gain the place. BIG CALI GIRL broke sharply to set a
pressured pace from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. SKY'S THE LIMIT was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and
lacked the needed closing response. PULPIT LINE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BETHEL RIDGE lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. UNCOMMONBLESSING settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. COASTAL AFFAIR was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.
SEARCH THE KINGDOM was off a step slow, showed no early speed and was eased through the lane.
