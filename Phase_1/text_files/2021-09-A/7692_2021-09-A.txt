WYOMING CONQUEST was hustled to the lead and battled with foes throughout but was able to clear and just last for the win. ANYONE SEEN LOGAN
saved ground on the inside then angled out in the stretch drive to make a late rally and closed willingly. AMERICAN CODE was allowed to settle then made
a two wide bid on the turn to challenge the leader then faded. DEL ARGENT was unhurried early from the four path and improved position. BACKCHATTER
tracked the leaders from the inside but failed to menace. GOOSE DRANK WINE pressed the pace from the two path and tired. SUPERSERG had an
awkward start and was never a factor.
