Footnotes
UPO prompted the pace by SOUTHEAST ASIA through the second turn, gained ground on that rival off of the turn, dueled through the length of the stretch
and dug in in the final stages to win the head nod. SIX POINT RACK was rank and hard to place on the first turn, sat just off of the early pace, mounted a
bid four wide off of the second turn, was closing late but just missed on the wire while getting up for second. SOUTHEAST ASIA was sent to set the early
fractions, saved ground on the second turn, was headed leaving the second bend by UPO but kept on to duel that foe and just relented in the final stages to
give up the place. OH BE ONE settled in the midflight in the early going, gained while three wide on the second turn but flattened out in the stretch.
JOURNEY TO RUN settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground while two wide on the second turn and did not offer a late rally. ONE EYED ROBIN
was unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the second turn and did not offer a late bid.

INCH tracked FROST WARNING while three wide on the turn, was urged under right handed encouragement in upper stretch and had a late kick to get by
that foe and was clear in the end. FROST WARNING broke on top and set a quick pace while two wide on the turn, had a clear lead into the lane but was
caught inside of the final sixteenth while a clear second over the rest. TAMARANDO'S MINE chased the pace from the two path on the turn and was
outfinished in the stretch, while holding for third. TALISKER BAY tracked the leaders from the mid-pack while three wide on the turn and made a mild late
gain in the stretch to challenge for third. SUGAR BEETS had no speed early, was four then five wide on the turn and was not a factor. EXCESSIVE CAT
chased the early pace, bolted on the run into the turn, was jogged the rest of the way, was eased, and walked off.

Footnotes
THE GREAT HAYNES tracked the early pace from a ground saving position, gained ground off of the turn to collar GRAZEN DEB and pulled away in the
late going. LIAM'S SECRET chased from the rear of the field, was three then four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn but was outkicked by the
winner while just getting up in the final strides to claim second. GRAZEN DEB broke on top and set the pace while saving ground on the turn, was
confronted leaving the bend and tired in deep stretch, missing for second. SLEW OF FASHION settled in the middle of the field, was three wide on the turn
and weakened in the stretch run. POINT BREAK chased from toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the turn and was not a factor. TESS'S WILD
CAT attended the pace by GRAZEN DEB, was two wide on the turn and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly and set all of the pace through the second turn, had a clear lead into the stretch, was pressured in the final sixteenth
by the oncoming RIDEO but held on to prevail. RIDEO sat just off of the early fractions, saved ground along the rail on the second turn while improving
position, continued that run into the stretch to pressure the winner in the final sixteenth but could not reel him in while besting the rest. IZ INVINCIBLE
tracked the early pace from the midflight, mounted a bid while two wide on the second turn and finished willingly in the stretch run. UNION LEADER settled
toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. LOLO PANIOLO prompted the early pace, was three
wide while still near the front on the second turn but gave way in the stretch drive. SUNNY SPOT hopped at the start and was away slowly, improved
position on the second turn while three then four wide but weakened in the stretch. AIGLE had no speed in the early going, saved ground while two wide on
the second turn and did not rally in the stretch.

KEYSTONE FIELD settled in the midflight, mounted a bid on the second turn while three wide, swung out to the six path for the drive, was under firm
handling through the lane and determinedly got up in the late stages to prevail. LOAFERS BOY had no speed in the early going, improved position on the
second turn while two wide and closed well in the stretch but could not reel in the winner while holding for second. FREEPORT JOE settled toward the rear
of the field, was six to seven wide on the second turn and rallied leaving the bend but could not catch the top two in the late stages. ENOS SLAUGHTER
settled toward the rear of the field, mounted a bid while four wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. BOTTLE OF SMOKE set the pace through
the second turn while saving ground and weakened in the stretch drive. TABLE FOR TEN stalked the early fractions, saved ground on the second turn while
improving position but flattened out in deep stretch. GOING AWAY PARTY tracked the early pace from a forward position, mounted a bid while two wide on
the second turn but tired in the stretch. WINE AND WHISKY attended to the early pace, was four wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch run.
SHOT OF A LIFETIME stalked the early pace from a forward position, was five wide on the second turn while losing ground and faded in the late going.

gave out in the stretch run.

Footnotes
THELUTEISMINE attended to the early pace by PERSISTENCE, gained ground while three wide on the turn, took the lead into the stretch and kicked clear
in the late going. SEVERIN tracked the early leaders while three wide on the turn, improved position leaving the bend and kept on in the stretch to be a clear
second. AUTISM ABILITY chased the early pace from towards the rear, was five wide on the turn, swung widest into the stretch and had a late bid to win
the head nod for third. SLEEP OVER tracked the early pace from the midpack, was three then four wide on the turn, swung out a path into the drive and
finished willingly in the stretch, just missing for third. CHANGING IMAGE chased the early pace from the rear of the field, was five wide on the turn and
made a late gain in the stretch. HANDSOME ACCOUNT tracked the leaders from a forward position, was four wide on the turn, swung out a path heading
into the lane and finished evenly in the stretch run. BIG IRISH EYES chased the early leaders from a three wide path on the turn and showed late interest in
the stretch. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF tracked the early pace from a ground saving position and tired in the stretch run. PERSISTENCE was hustled soon after
the break to set the pace, saved ground on the turn and gave way in the stretch run. INCREDIBLE CHAMP was outrun in the early going, saved ground on
the turn and was not a factor.
