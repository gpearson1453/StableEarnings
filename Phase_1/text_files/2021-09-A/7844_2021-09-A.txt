YOU GO BOY took command at once, stayed out from the inside, ran clear leaving the turn and held under urging. AGAINST THE ODDS was well placed in
the three path then closed a gap too late. R CHA CHA moved outside early to press the winner then weakened in the lane. RING THE BELLA briefly
showed speed. HIGH FLYING GUY was fractious in the gate, broke slowly and quickly fell far back.
