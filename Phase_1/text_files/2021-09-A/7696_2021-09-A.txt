Footnotes
VEGAS GUY broke well then dueled for the early lead to the outside of RUNAWAY HARRY, took clear command from aforementioned rival nearing the
three eighths pole, led the field on a comfortable margin into the lane, dug in while under steady pressure through the final furlong and just prevailed on the
wire. TWISTED DIXIE was reserved inside in the early stages, shifted out quickly while moving up to near midpack down the backstretch, continued to track
well off the dueling pacesetters on the turn, altered course shifting three wide at the three sixteenths pole, commenced a rail down the center of the stretch
but lugged in while switching leads multiple times in the final furlong but finished willingly to the wire. RUNAWAY HARRY dueled for the lead on the inside
down the backstretch, lost ground past the three eighths pole heading into the bend then proceeded to shifted out three wide and bid again for the lead past
the five sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane while under steady pressure to the sixteenth pole. NEW DICE was unhurried in the early going, shifted
three wide into the down the backstretch and came on to pass tiring foes in the lane. R DIXIE DIAMOND chased the pace on the inside into the bend and
failed to menace. COUNTRY BRAVE chased the pace three wide from midpack then retreated past the quarter pole.

down the backstretch from midpack, drifted four wide off the bend and bid belatedly down the center of the track to get up for place. TWILIGHT GALAXY
pressed the early pace on the outside and weakened in the stretch. TOURIST LIKE ME was well back throughout and proved no factor. DUSTY PRINCESS
was pulled up down the backstretch and vanned off.

GIRLS A BULLET tracked the early pace three wide down the backstretch, commenced bid nearing the five sixteenths and continued to gradually gain on
the leader to the furlong marker and edged clear in the late stages while under steady urging to the wire. OWEN'S PLEASURE was unhurried in the early
going, angled out four wide on the turn and commenced a late rally down the center of the track to get up for place. PRINCESS LIVIA was off a step slow
from the gate then was hustled up to a clear lead into the bend, led the field into the stretch but failed to match strides with GIRLS A BULLET and weakened
late. SHIP'S CREEK chased the early pace on the inside, saved ground through the bend and failed to menace. LE TUB showed brief speed early then
retreated on the inside into the bend, shifted out and briefly attempted to make another bid before retreating again to the rear of the field.

THICK HAZE was allowed to settle on the rail through the opening bend, continued to track down the backside then dropped in to save ground into the far
turn, shifted out four wide at the three sixteenths pole and closed with a rush down the lane to get up in the final sixteenth under steady pressure.
MINNESOTA MIRACLE dueled for the lead on the outside, battled while holding a minimal lead into the stretch, dug in while under steady right and
left-handed pressure and edged foe late to hold second. GOPHER GOLD chased the pace two wide in the early stages, continued to track just off the
dueling pacesetters into the far turn, loomed a dangerous threat at the quarter pole, angled out three wide at the three sixteenths pole, drew even with the
leaders at the furlong marker but failed to sustain bid and flattened out to finish third. MINNESOTA LUCKY dueled for the lead throughout, battled gamely
for the lead into the stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. WHERE'S JORDAN was unhurried in the early going, saved ground through the opening
bend, continued to track well off the pace into the far turn, angled inside at the three eighths pole then angled back out three wide at the top of the stretch
but had no late kick. CARAMEL ANGEL tracked inside just off the lead throughout then began to fade at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
MASTER GUNS tracked the early pacesetter on the rail down the backstretch, saved ground through the bend, shifted out nearing the furlong marker and
drove clear under steady pressure. OUTERBANKS chased the early pace two to three wide down the backstretch, dropped into the two path to follow the
leading NO MO HOOCH on the bend, shifted out at the top of the lane losing a bit of ground and finished willingly to edge foe for second place. NO MO
HOOCH tracked the early pace on the outside, took over a clear lead at the quarter pole but failed to sustain bid down the lane and was caught in the final
sixteenth by multiple rivals. WHERE'D THE DAY GO chased midpack between foes into the bend, shifted out for clear run in the lane but finished evenly for
a minor share. TOUSSAINT was off slowly, tracked near the rear of the field, angled four wide off the bend and passed tiring foes late. HAPPY HOUR
COWBOY lacked early speed, saved ground on the bend and failed to menace. DAZZLING DIABLO was sent on the inside, led briefly and faded in the
lane.

Footnotes
SAHM TEQUILA was urged inside foes to gain the advantage after the opening sixteenth, set the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, was headed racing
through upper stretch but resolutely prevailed under brisk right handed pressure. OUT RUN'M, forwardly placed four wide attending the pace, pressed the
issue three wide nearing the lane to strike the front midstretch but was outfinished. TOP DOG tracked just off the first flight five wide racing into the turn,
then continued evenly outside rivals to gain a share in the closing stages. NATURAL CHILL, urged between foes pressing the pace three deep between
foes racing into the turn, dueled between foes to the lane and gave way midstretch. MR. D'S LEGEND vied briefly for command between foes and emptied
out after a half. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn but offered no rally. WARBUCKS settled outside foes in
early stages and failed to menace. GOLDIE'S REVENGE, reluctant to load in the starting gate, dropped out early.

Footnotes
NOCTURNAL MISSION broke sharply to gain the advantage while angling to the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the first turn,
dictated the pace to the second bend, forged clear nearing upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed encouragement LILA'S LUCKY LADY switched
out three wide tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid pursuing that foe into upper stretch but proved only
second best. GET ONE MORE, urged through close quarters inside foes racing into the first turn to gain a forward placing, tracked just off the pacesetter
along the rail racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch losing ground to the top pair but continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. GP'S
AMAZING GRACE angled inwards to stalk just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, came under pressure racing into the far turn,
couldn't match terms with the top pair racing into the lane, then switched out four wide in the lane while lacking the needed late kick. SNEAKY DIANNE
settled three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the lane and continued evenly between foes to late stages.
TIMEINTHETAVERN, off slowly, recovered to gain a position between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the lane
and faded late while racing in close quarters midstretch. MOCHA KISS settled last racing to the first turn, switched out four wide racing into the backstretch
but offered no rally. MILA'S DREAM (IRE) angled to the inside early and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
DETERMINED TO RISE broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the bend, shook clear in upper stretch and
was kept to firm encouragement. HOT ARTIE, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted out entering upper stretch but couldn't
match terms with the winner. BOBBY BOOTS settled inside foes in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some
position while prevailing for a share. DERBYS MONEYMAKER settled outside foes, was fanned five wide entering the lane to gain some position but made
no real impression. WORN A BIT tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and faded late. SAN VALENTINO,
off slowly, was collected to track off the first flight between, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and gave out.
