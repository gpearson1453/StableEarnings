Footnotes
SHINNY was rated inside rivals stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, was prompted to advance entering the lane, tipped to the three path
leaving midstretch and continued with a solid late kick to prevail in time under firm handling. KINETIC SWAGGER broke readily, sped to the lead racing a bit
off the rail, held sway on a narrow advantage to the lane, resisted the winner's bid but proved only second best. KID'S INHERITANCE angled to the inside
tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to edge rivals for a share late.
CHEST CANDY tracked the pacesetter three deep in the opening stages, dropped off the second flight racing into the backstretch and continued evenly
outside foes into the lane. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the far turn and faded in late stages. SAMYAZA,
off slowly, was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. PINTXOS angled to the inside in early stages
racing as part of the last flight, steadied out of tight quarters racing into the first turn and trailed the field to the stretch.

Footnotes
LADY GOLDSTART, brushed by DEFEND THE ROSE, while caught in close quarters three deep between foes in the opening stages, conceded some
position to track the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch steadily gaining
momentum and wrested the advantage in time under firm right handed pressure. TORENO, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled inwards
prompting the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, moved to wrest a clear advantage in upper stretch, came under stout pressure to resist the winner's
bid but couldn't contain that foe while just holding for second. LUVIN BULLIES bobbled at the start to break last, came around a rival on the backstretch.
then angled to the rail tracking just off the second flight racing into the bend, swung out four wide advancing on the leaders racing into upper stretch and
continued willingly to close the gap on the top pair. IN THE RED angled to the inside early while settling last racing to the turn, switched out nearing upper
stretch, was fanned five wide racing into the lane and continued with a mild bid. ORNAMENTAL IRON angled to the inside tracking off the first flight from
just out of striking distance racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. DEFEND THE ROSE shifted inwards making some light contact with the
eventual winner in the opening stages while being prompted to contest the pace, angled to the rail racing into the turn disputing the pace and gave out
leaving midstretch.

MOREISBETTER exchanged some bumps with PURPLE SCOOTER at the break, was righted, then prompted to a position just off the pacesetter along the
inside racing to the turn, stalked just off that foe in close quarters racing through the bend, then came through when presented an opening in upper stretch
to wrest command and kick clear under mild encouragement. EREBUNI broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow advantage between
foes racing into the turn, shifted out to the three path entering the lane and yielded to the winner nearing midstretch. SHES GOT IT, off a bit slowly, was
reserved well off the leaders racing to the turn, swung out entering the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. PURPLE SCOOTER
exchanged bumps with the eventual winner at the start, was righted to track just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded into
the lane. JAGGED ARROW, urged to a forward placing four wide in early stages, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HUNTER'S MAGIC was reserved on the inside through the opening bend, continued to save ground well off the pacesetters into the far turn, shifted out
nearing the quarter pole and commenced a bid for the lead gradually gaining on NOTE PAD through the lane while under steady pressure to the wire.
NOTE PAD tracked the early pace on the inside through the first turn, shifted out at the 9/16, commenced an early move to the lead past the half mile pole,
extended the advantage to take a clear lead into the stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth while under steady right-handed pressure through the
lane. LEFT OF CENTER was allowed to settle between foes in the early going, angled out three wide at the quarter pole and finished evenly to get up for
the show. SURELY A LEGEND was caught out four wide on the first turn, continued to travel just off the pace wide down the backstretch and through the far
bend while failing to menace in the stretch. ADDED DIAMONDS broke well, dictated the pace on the inside, and faded in the stretch. CLAIRE SAILING
showed brief speed three wide and gave way early. DIGGS WON showed brief foot, tired down the backstretch and proved no factor.

DRAMA CHORUS broke readily, was bumped by BRING ME A CHECK, was rated just off the leaders three deep racing to the backstretch, pulled his way
to terms with the leaders three deep between foes racing into the far turn, was roused to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch and kicked away under
firm handling. KID FROSTIE settled last outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted outside foes racing through the backstretch while being prompted to
advance, continued in tandem with the eventual winner racing four wide through the far turn to upper stretch but couldn't match that rival in late stages.
NOBLE PURSUIT settled along the inside as part of the last flight racing to the first turn, gained position between foes just off the inside racing into the
second bend, shifted out while racing in tight quarters into the stretch but continued with interest three deep between foes to edge rivals for a share.
NORTHCUT, reserved off the second flight racing well off the inside to the backstretch, dropped out last after a half, was prompted to advance outside foes
racing into the far turn, swung five wide nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. NOBRAG JUSTFACT angled to the inside tracking off the
first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. BRING ME A CHECK broke
outwards bumping the eventual winner, was urged prompting the pace outside a rival, then between foes racing into the far turn and gave out in upper
stretch. CREATIVE PLAN tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, raced in close quarters through the second bend and faded
between foes into the lane. WARRIOR BOSS, urged along the rail prompting the pace racing to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch.

DIRECT ACTION broke sharply, was rated dropping off the first flight racing to the turn, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper stretch, shifted
out racing through the lane but continued with a steady late bid to prevail in time under firm left handed encouragement. DON'T BOX ME IN, off a step
slowly, was urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, edged clear entering upper stretch and and just failed to
contain the winner. HUNTER JUMPER, bumped at the start, was righted then urged three wide prompting the pace racing into the turn and faded between
foes in the drive. MAGIC REVOLUTION settled along the rail in the opening stages, saved ground on the turn to upper stretch but came through close
quarters to improve position to the end. MINNESOTA RED, caught in close quarters at the start, was settled between foes in the last flight early, shifted out
four wide racing into the stretch to gain some position but made no impact. BOOTLEGGIN POSSE angled to the inside tracking off the first flight and faded
into upper stretch. TAHKODHA KNIGHT angled to the rail racing through the backstretch disputing the pace inside rivals into the turn and gave way after a
half. WILDCAT SKY broke inwards bumping HUNTER JUMPER, was collected, then raced wide to the turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MY COWBOY angled to the rail racing into the first turn setting the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, held sway to upper stretch, then grudgingly
resisted several challengers racing through the lane to prevail under firm right handed pressure. OFF SIXES was rated outside foes tracking off the second
flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to challenge the winner
while being just outkicked. BOURBON WISDOM stumbled at the start, recovered to track the pacesetter outside a rival racing three deep to the backstretch,
steadily advanced to challenge the winner racing into upper stretch but flattened out racing past the furlong marker. TWO THE PUNCH, reserved along the
inside in early stages, shifted out on the far turn but passed only tiring rivals. CANDY COVE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch but offered no rally. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, came under
pressure on the far turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
POINT OF IMPACT tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to gain position along the rail when presented an
opening nearing the far turn, moved to challenge for command inside the pacesetter approaching upper stretch, shifted a bit off the inside once gaining the
advantage and held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement. IRISH CHARLIE settled last near the inside racing to the backstretch,
gathered momentum racing through the far turn, shifted out splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, angled four wide in the lane and continued with interest to
edge a rival for the place honors late. LOVE MY BOSS was rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half,
saved ground awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, then continued evenly inside foes late. SUPER SILVER, forwardly placed three wide attending the
pace to the backstretch, was prompted to challenge the pacesetter in that path in tandem with the winner nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the
closing stages. OWN THE TOWN settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. TALKIN MALICE, urged inside foes disputing the
pace into the backstretch, shifted out once headed after a half and soon gave way. YAK tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing to the
backstretch and retreated after a half. SEEK N JUSTICE, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, was sent clear racing into the far turn and
gave out abruptly in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NATURAL CHILL broke sharply, tracked off the first flight racing four wide into the bend while exchanging light contact with KC'S FIRST B M W nearing the
turn, moved to challenge four wide nearing midstretch, then wrested command and went clear under pressure. KOVACS broke inwards brushing a rival at
the start, was rated off the second flight between in the opening three furlongs, split foes nearing the lane, then angled to the rail in upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. MODRIC broke readily to gain terms with the leaders three deep in the opening furlong, was
taken in hand while getting out markedly racing into the bend, continued five wide through the turn to upper stretch but finished willingly in that path to just
miss for second. HOLDENTIGHT was urged to dispute the pace from the outset racing a bit off the rail, pressed the issue outside a rival on the turn to upper
stretch and gave out in late stages. WEAREINITTOWINIT broke inwards bumping FLY WITH CLASS, was righted to gain a position just off the leaders, was
urged along the rail nearing the turn to dispute the issue inside a rival to upper stretch but emptied out leaving the furlong marker. RAISED ON PROMISES
hopped, then was pinched back at the start, settled outside rivals and never gained contention. FLY WITH CLASS, bumped at the start, settled along the
inside and failed to menace. SIR BARNABUS ducked outwards a bit at the start and soon dropped out. K C'S FIRST B M W, urged three deep between
foes pursuing the leaders while exchanging light contact with the eventual winner nearing the turn, angled to the rail entering the turn while continuing under
pressure and gave out abruptly approaching upper stretch.
