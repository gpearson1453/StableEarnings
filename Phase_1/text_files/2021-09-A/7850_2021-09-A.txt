Footnotes
AGAVE KID bumped lightly with CARSON RULES in the opening strides, was placed on the lead, was briefly engaged by JUST BEN into the turn, edged
clear again past the seven sixteenths while saving ground, shook away from the rest of the field in upper stretch and drew off under a mild drive. LASTEN
IMPRESSION settled near the rear of the main group, chased while saving ground on the turn, offered an inside bid past the three eighths, tipped two wide
approaching the quarter pole, briefly loomed outside of AGAVE KID, proved no match for that foe into the lane, and chased on best of the rest under a drive.
STREET EDGE reared at the break and was off slowly as a result, settled at the rear, took closer order in the three to four path on the turn, regained touch
with the rest of the field nearing the quarter, swung four wide into upper stretch, and kept on between horses to hold the show. LAST SPRING tracked the
leading pair outside of CARSON RULES early, raced in range four wide into the turn, continued in the five path around the bend while in touch with the
leader, was bumped by CARSON RULES into the lane and then floated out into the six path for the stretch run, and chased on mildly outside. JUST BEN
was sent inside but outsprinted to the lead by AGAVE KID, tracked the leader along the inside early, switched two wide approaching the half, engaged
outside of AGAVE KID into the turn, stalked the pace in the three path past the seven sixteenths as AGAVE KID edged clear again, floated out approaching
the turn for home, raced five wide into the lane and flattened. CARSON RULES bumped lightly with AGAVE KID in the opening strides, tracked the leading
pair early, came into the turn in range three wide between horses, continued to track in the four path on the turn, floated out and bumped LAST SPRING into
the lane, shifted back inward at the head of the stretch, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. THE STEWARDS PERFORMED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
START. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
JEFF THE LION chased the leader from the two path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from
the three path approaching the three eighths pole, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive to the wire. PISTOL BOX trailed the field from the
three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid
entering the stretch and gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane, while proving to be no match for the winner. HIGH SPIRITS saved ground
around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position between
horses late. FRONTANA saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far
turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. TAP THE MOJO raced between horses in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and flattened out in late stretch. ONE WAY HOME led the field while saving
ground around the first turn, continued to show the way on the inside for the run up the backstretch, dueled from the two path while racing around the far
turn, gave way in upper stretch and faded further from there.

Footnotes
POSEIDON'S PASSION broke sharply but settled back toward the rear approaching the turn, was keen inside at the rear into the bend, chased at the rear
of the field in the two path, raced into the lane inside, shifted three wide in upper stretch for her rally, responded under a mild drive, struck the front just past
the furlong pole and ran clear. BELLE BREZING was herded out in the opening strides, chased outside of SAVVY ALLY early, raced three wide while in
tight between horses around the bend, floated four wide into the lane, rallied, could not get to POSEIDON'S PASSION but got the nod for place. CHROME
ATTACK settled at the rear, switched outside of POSEIDON'S PASSION into the turn, chased four wide around the bend and five wide into the lane,
responded with a rally, but lost the bob for place. WILLOW MOON broke outward, prompted the pace outside of LIPLINER early, raced just outside of that
pacesetter in the five path on the turn, dueled from the five sixteenths to the furlong mark, was no match for POSEIDON'S PASSION into the final furlong,
continued to vie, but was caught in the final jumps for place. LIPLINER was keen to the lead, set a pressured pace early inside of WILLOW MOON, raced in
the four path on the turn, vied for the lead inside of WILLOW MOON from the five sixteenths to the eighth pole, proved no match for POSEIDON'S
PASSION, kept on inside but was outkicked for the place. SAVVY ALLY tracked the leading pair, chased two wide on the turn, floated three wide into the
lane, drifted out under right handed urging and ultimately proved empty.

PRESENT OF HERO bumped lightly with CATNIP KITTEN in the opening strides, chased the leading trio through the clubhouse turn and down the back
straight, inched closer in the two path on the far turn inside of SPEAK ENGLISH, swung five wide into the stretch for the drive, responded with a rally, came
in and bumped DREAMING OF PARIS midstretch, took the lead over BE AUTHENTIC past the furlong mark, and cleared. BE AUTHENTIC cleared into the
clubhouse turn, was engaged by DREAMING OF PARIS and SPEAK ENGLISH to her outside into the backstretch, set the pace while pressured by those
foes down the backstretch and while racing in the two path around the far turn, kicked clear of DREAMING OF PARIS into upper stretch, was caught by
PRESENT OF HERO midstretch, could not hold that foe off but chased on under a drive. DREAMING OF PARIS tracked the leader inside of SPEAK
ENGLISH early, pulled between horses into the backstretch to engage outside of BE AUTHENTIC, prompted outside that foe down the backstretch and
around the far turn, was outkicked by BE AUTHENTIC into the lane, chased on in upper stretch, was bumped by PRESENT OF HERO and then steadied,
proved no match for the leading pair through the final furlong but chased on best of the rest. IRISH HALO settled at the rear of the main group, chased
keenly into the backstretch, raced between flights of a strung out field down that back straight, continued well off the pace while saving ground around the
far turn, was driven inside into upper stretch, never threatened the top three but chased on well enough to hold a minor award. BIG LUCK settled inside of
CATNIP KITTEN early, continued in second last while well behind the main group down the back straight, raced in the two path in the rear flight on the far
turn, was driven into the lane, improved mildly between horses and just missed fourth. CATNIP KITTEN lightly bumped with PRESENT OF HERO in the
opening strides, settled two wide in the rear flight, continued at the rear down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, and was outfinished in
the lane. SPEAK ENGLISH was keen into the clubhouse turn, tracked the leader outside of DREAMING OF PARIS around that bend, pulled three wide into
the backstretch to prompt the pace, was outpaced by BE AUTHENTIC and DREAMING OF PARIS into the far turn, tracked them outside of PRESENT OF
HERO while racing in the four path, came up empty when driven in upper stretch and weakened. STEWARDS MADE AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH
RUN. THE JOCKEY OF DREAMING OF PARIS CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDERS OF BOTH PRESENT OF HERO AND BE AUTHENTIC,
CLAIMING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

EL ASESINO dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, led the way while saving ground around the turn, dueled gamely down the lane, and dug
in while drifting out in the final furlong, refusing to give way late. LOST IN MANHATTAN chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, drifted out slightly in the final furlong
when EL ASESINO bore into his lane, and dueled to the wire from there, but could not get by the winner. CYRIL'S BOY brushed with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, was
caught entering the stretch and finished evenly. MKAR THE FAST was bumped by the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack
between horses early, navigated the turn from the two path and gained some ground in late stretch. NIGHT THINGS brushed with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, dropped back and trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane,
never threatening. ONE PUTT RICHIE veered in and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up
the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and was outkicked late. LAKE MILLS chased the leaders between horses through the opening
quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
WAR CHEST set the early pace, was prompted by BULLDOG OF BERGEN from near the three quarters, edged clear again while saving ground around the
far turn, was engaged by GATE CREW to his outside into the lane, but dug in, held that foe at bay, and edged slightly further ahead of that foe late. GATE
CREW chased the leading trio through the clubhouse turn, continued to chase the leading pair outside of LAND MARK DEAL down the backstretch, bid
three wide past the three eighths, loomed outside of WAR CHEST into upper stretch, kept on just outside the pacesetter down the lane but could not get by.
LAND MARK DEAL tracked the leader two wide into the clubhouse turn, settled back to track the leading pair inside of GATE CREW past the thirteen
sixteenths, chased the leading pair inside of GATE CREW down the backstretch, took closer order into the far turn, saved ground around that bend, was
driven inside in upper stretch, made grinding improvement inside down the lane but missed the place. INTRADAY (BRZ) was herded in by BULLDOG OF
BERGEN in the opening strides and took up approaching the wire for the first time, chased inside of FIRST MASAMUNE through the clubhouse turn, settled
toward the rear into the backstretch, took closer order approaching the far turn, chased in the two path around the far turn, continued to make gradual
improvement inside horses down the lane and proved best of the rest. BARLEEWON settled near the rear inside, continued at the inside of the rear flight
down the backstretch and into the far turn, saved ground around that bend, was taken four wide into the lane, angled out six wide midstretch to get around
traffic, and rallied well belatedly. FIRST MASAMUNE chased between horses through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, chased three wide
through the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, chased the leading trio while drifting further out, was outkicked in the final furlong, unseated his rider
when returning to be unsaddled, but was quickly apprehended in the winners' circle and walked off the course. BULLDOG OF BERGEN came inward in the
opening strides, tracked the leader inside of LAND MARK DEAL down the backstretch and into the clubhouse turn, advanced to prompt outside of WAR
CHEST near the three quarters, prompted the pace down the backstretch, tracked two wide around the far turn, proved no match into the lane, and chased
on evenly in the final furlong between horses. CURLINGTON settled at the rear, raced two wide in the rear flight approaching the far turn, improved in the
four path around that bend, swung six wide into the lane, drifted out under a drive, and was outkicked. LAKE NAKURU settled near the rear, began to
improve between horses past the half mile mark, continued to take closer order two wide between horses around the far turn, was driven three wide into the
lane but ran only evenly down the stretch. JUNGLE FIGHTER chased three wide through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, began to flatten out
in the five path near the seven sixteenths, was driven between horses approaching the quarter pole, and came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
RADIANT CASTLE raced off the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began his bid approaching the half mile pole, improved
position while racing in the three path around the turn and dueled gamely down the lane, holding off a late closer for the win. NILES CHANNEL broke
sharply, dueled from the rail around the first turn, relinquished the lead entering the backstretch to chase the frontrunners on the inside, continued to save
ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground down the stretch, drifting in the final furlong and just missing the win.
CONVICT PIKE raced in the two path in the middle of the pack around the first turn, began to improve position while racing up the backstretch, challenged
properly from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled gamely in upper stretch and gave way, grudgingly, late. DRAMATIC KITTEN dueled from
the two path around the first turn, dropped back to chase the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn, made a
mild gain of ground in the stretch and was outkicked late. ZARMAE saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch,
began to move up while racing around the far turn, was fanned five or six wide into the stretch and flattened out from there. MISTER CHARMING raced in
the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, navigated the far turn four wide, and made no bid.
CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT dueled for the lead between horses in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
raced between horses in the two path around the far turn and faded entering the stretch. PLEASANT MOON was urged to the lead while racing four wide
around the first turn, showed the way on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn, and tired on the rail in the final furlong.
