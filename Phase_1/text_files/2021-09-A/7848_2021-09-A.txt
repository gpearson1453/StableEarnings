PASSION BELLE was in just a bit tight at the break, settled in behind the leaders in the second flight stalking three wide, moved out four deep late on the far
turn and was carried a further two paths, struck the lead at the head of the stretch, came in a bit once clear and drew away under hand urging. BELLA Y
SOFIA stalked from outside going four to six wide throughout, was no match for the winner but second best. THE TIME'S RIGHT settled of the leaders on or
just off the rail at the back, began to advance two then three wide on the far turn coming four deep into upper stretch, altered in at that juncture and ran on.
DIXIE JEN broke out badly, settled outside going four to five wide throughout, passed tired rivals in the stretch. POW WOW broke outwardly, attended the
pace racing well off the rail going three to five wide through the first turn, kept wide up the backstretch, moved back in three deep for the far turn before
drifting five wide into the lane, came up empty. BETTER DIALHOMME contended along the inside on or just off the rail, came up empty.

Footnotes
MISS MELODY pressed from outside, went mostly four wide on the turn edging away leaving that bend, lugged out in upper stretch and again later while
well clear. ITZ THE DITZ set a pressured pace in the two path, was no match for the winner but held the place. SWEET REGARDS raced mid-pack two
wide on the turn, came out then continued to drift out ten deep in upper stretch, gaind mildly. BLUE LUNA WHO settled inside, came out in the stretch and
gained some. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC chased the leading pair from outside, moved in four then three wide on the turn, weakened. DIVALICIOUS lacked early
speed, raced just off the rail on the turn, was not a threat. HEMATITE was outside a foe in the back half of the field into the turn, went three wide on that
bend dropping back, faded.

OUR TIME TO SHINE broke outwardly then moved forward, was six wide into the first turn but eased back and angled in three deep in the early part of that
bend, settled well back of the leaders last but one, began to advance two to three wide on the far turn, angled out for room leaving that bend then was
carried from seven to ten wide in upper stretch, struck the lead and drew clear. NOBODY KNOWS WHO set the pace racing off the rail facing pressure from
outside rivals, drifted to the three path into upper stretch, was overtaken in mid-stretch and no match. AUTUMN TOUCH attended just off the pacesetter four
wide between runners, came out seven wide turning for home then drifted out several paths, back in several paths, and again back out while racing
erratically. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS pressed the pace from between runners three wide, came out five deep turning for home, had no extra. CAROLS
BOUTIQUE angled in and settled at the rear, saved ground on or just off the rail through the first turn and again through much of the far turn before coming
out leaving that bend, was forced out a bit in mid-stretch to avoid an erratic rival and bumped with a foe, failed to threaten. GRACEANNE broke outwardly,
stalked from outside the leaders five then six wide on the first turn, continued five wide on the far turn while starting to drop back, came out ten deep turning
for home, was lightly bumped in mid-stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ESTEEMED switched outside a rival heading up the backstretch, moved out from three to five wide on the turn while gaining on the leading pair, took aim in
the stretch and got up late under steady handling. BARBARA'S CHAMP shifted in heading up the backstretch, dueled inside a rival but off the fence going
two to three deep on the turn, was clear into mid-stretch but caught. SOUTHERN SUMMER tracked from inside in behind the leaders racing on or just off
the rail, kept on in the drive. AGRONOMO dueled outside a foe early, went three to four wide losing some ground on the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
LINCOLN COUNTY KID settled off the leaders, was six wide into the turn angling in two paths on that bend before coming out seven wide turning for home,
gained mildly. CEBOLLA switched outside a foe heading up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. RIO CUTIE was outside rivals
off the pace, went five to six wide on the turn, came in a bit in upper stretch and was never a threat. BEHOLD'S HOTTIE chased the leading pair briefly,
dropped back four to five wide on the turn, came out eight deep turning for home and was empty. BRIEF WHO trailed inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
PEACEOUTYOURHONOR bumped a rival at the start, settled toward the rear outside, went three wide on the turn fanning six wide into upper stretch, drove
by late. CARRIE'S SUCCESS chased from outside rivals going four then five wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, moved clear in mid-stretch but
was caught. DONNA WHO was bumped at the break, chased from between runners three then four wide on the turn, shifted in once in upper stretch but
then had to alter back out as rivals drifted in, ran on to gain show honors. A GREAT VICE moved clear soon after the start to dictate terms racing off the
fence, went in the two then three path on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and weakened. DANCES FOR KAMIA chased inside foes but in the two
path, came up empty. AGO GO GAL angled in heading up the backstretch, saved ground to no avail. IZE A CRAFTY GAL got away on top but then
stumbled and lost the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
