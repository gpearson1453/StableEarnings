Footnotes
CALYPSO GHOST moved clear into the first turn, controlled the inside and under some coaxing, widened under a right handed drive nearing the lane and
was kept alert while drifting a bit late. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , taken to rate early, dropped in some past the half mile marker, angled back out near the far
turn, circled four wide and finished with decent energy. GLORIOUS MYSTERY had speed outside the winner, took up a stalking spot into the first turn,
chased two wide leaving the far turn and gave way grudgingly. DAT DARES GOLD , brushed at the break, saved ground while not too far back, steadied
nearing the far turn, regrouped to make a slight run past the sixteenth pole then flattened out. SECRET AFFIRMATION , three wide, made a mild run
leaving the five sixteenths, failed to sustain into the stretch and gave way. MISS CHLOE G , brushed at the break, was outrun.

entering the stretch and hung. POLISH COOKIE saved ground the first turn, eased out on the far turn and passed tired foes. GINAMAYA , three deep the

HASHTAG LUCKY broke on top, set a pressured early pace towards the rail, shook clear near the five sixteenths, widened two wide under a drive into the
lane and was kept to task to the wire. EXPECT THE SUNRISE drifted in and bumped with a rival at the break, straightened and stalked three wide, moved
up a bit into the far turn, gave hard chase into the lane, came up empty in the final sixteenth but managed to save place. HUMMIN' THE FUNK settled off
the pace, circled four wide into the lane and rallied mildly. EL BOCHINCHE drifted out at the break and was off slow, pulled her way between rivals into the
first turn, dropped in and stalked, made a slight move leaving the quarter pole, chased into the lane and faded. TIPSY TOURIST forced the pace outside the
winner, stayed in touch to the far turn then tired.

GOODLUCKCHUCK set the pace along the inner rail, opened up leaving the final turn and held sway under urging. SOLOMONIC , three deep all turns,
rallied. MR. PETE prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened late. KADESH stalked the pace, raced along the inner rail in the drive and failed to
rally. MO ZONE , caught in narrow quarters at the break, was not a factor and swung wide in upper stretch. CHARGING LION , along the inner rail
throughout, weakened. SEMI EXCITED , in close quarters at the break, was outrun.

UNCLE CECIL stalked three wide outside a rival, was under pressure into the far turn, bumped with DIRTY DIRTY when four wide into the stretch, made a
grinding run under right handed encouragement, took over late and went clear at the wire. CANHERUN dueled inside, shook clear under asking past the
quarter pole, wandered outward near the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. IRON PEARLS edged up near the half mile marker, dropped in to
stalk, was ridden along leaving the quarter pole, had aim into the lane but failed to seriously sustain. DIRTY DIRTY dueled outside CANHERUN, had that
one get away a bit past the quarter pole, drifted out giving pursuit into the lane, bumped with the winner and gave way. MAGIC OF LOVE settled back off
the pace, saved ground and was outrun. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong fraction was omitted.

VOLNAY dueled inside, shook clear nearing the furlong marker then widened under a steady drive. FANCY PRINCESS chased a contested pace, raced
three wide past the three sixteenths, shifted in through the lane and churned on to nab the place. PRACTICALLY DIZZY , four wide early, bid three deep
into the far turn, pressed past the three sixteenths then faded in the final seventy yards. BOURBON WILDCAT disputed the pace outside the winner, fought
on between foes leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace past the three sixteenths and weakened.

Footnotes
D C FIREMAN sprinted to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch and dug in late under pressure. BIG HAMBONE , two wide
around the turn, chased the pace, remained on his left lead in the drive and closed the gap. CONFUSION BABY BOY , four wide leaving the turn, rallied
late. PROUD ENOUGH lacked speed, raced in the three path turning for home and was no threat. SCOTTSDALE , well off the rail while chasing the pace,
weakened. OUT ONA LIMB raced along the inner rail and weakened. G DADDY , steadied leaving the starting gate, was rank in hand down the backstretch
and failed to be a factor.
