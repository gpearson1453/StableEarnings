Footnotes
MY HEAVY SON unhurried in the early part, racing near the back, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and proved the best late.
DIESEL JACK vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn, drove clear down the stretch, couldn't hold off MY HEAVY SON for the win, but
was best of others. LS'SHOE'S IMAGE challenged for the early lead, raced outside around the turn, weakened and couldn't keep up with the top two.
CABRO TORO broke a step slow, raced near the back and was never a factor. FLAT OUT FABIO pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late.

Footnotes
GINA'S BROTHER challenged for the early lead, took the advantage around the final turn, drove clear down the lane, was all out and held off a late rally by
MORO SAVAGE for the win. MORO SAVAGE unhurried in the early going, moved up, racing wide around the second turn, rallied down the lane and
finished willingly. GOLIATH RIDGE lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. SYMBOL AZTECA raced within
contention, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the home stretch. MACHO MARK void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor.
PUTTER raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn on the outside, faded and finished evenly. MULETRAIN raced within striking distance,
dropped back and was no threat late. ROGER'S WORLD dueled on the front end and was finished early. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
