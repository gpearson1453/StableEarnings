MALIBU MO settled well, commenced a bid on the turn, rallied while five wide in the stretch and was along in time. SAND WALKER chased along the inside
and stayed on well in the stretch. SAILOR CHOW raced forwardly while three wide, moved closer on the turn and lacked the needed bid. PAY DIRT
grabbed the lead, was brushed aside on the turn and no factor in the stretch. EL VALE never menaced. WINNING MOMENT was always outrun.

Footnotes
HIDDEN RULER raced in striking position while four wide, took over leaving the turn and edged clear under steady pressure. LONG TERM THINKING
settled well early, advanced on the turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch. NO SHIRT NO SHOES grabbed the early lead, was headed on the turn,
did not factor in the stretch but kept on for a minor share. SIR WALLY WALLY stalked the early and weakened. BASIC CHANCE chased while three wide
between foes and faded.

Footnotes
CAMPFIRE TALES led early, edged clear on the turn and responded gamely in the stretch. ICE AND FIRE saved ground, angled off the rail into the stretch
and finished willingly. SHY RUNNER settled along the inside, hugged the rail in the stretch drive and rallied. ATLANTIS ALANA swerved out at the start,
advanced on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. YOU JUST WATCHME never menaced. SAWYOUINOURDREAM raced forwardly while three wide
and faded. HOLIDAY ROMANCE was always outrun.
