SUMMER RETREAT set the pace, took command on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. AMNESTY stalked the early
leader, was a factor from the inside on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. HESATHRILLER was hustled early and roused
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. WATER POLO was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path
at the top of the stretch evened out. TOBRUK was in touch but chased from the inside on the turn and had no late kick. J M R VICTORY LAP was off the
pace and showed little in a dull effort.

ABSTEMIOUS was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held sway. TRINITY THUNDAH was unhurried
early, moved up on the turn, angled out through the stretch and finished well. TEXT ME TOO was away alertly, raced evenly on the turn and from the three
path at the top of the stretch was up for show. TOLERATE was in mid pack and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had
nothing left. NAKED IN THE WOODS was up close but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch faded. GRAPES tracked the
leaders from the outside but lost ground on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. CONQUER THE BREEZE was well
back, showed nothing and was never in contention.

JERSEY DIAMOND set pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BORN TO BE KING was off
slow, a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. THY KINGDOM was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and was
up for show. OPTIMYSTICAL was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch needed more. BLOWBACK
was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. PUT A HEMI IN HER was in mid pack and
hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. TARA CITIZEN was in range but chased on the turn and from the five
path at the top of the stretch had no rally. POUROSO was well back and showed nothing in a dull effort.

YES PLEASE stalked the early leaders, had a slim lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. LIL'S TURN
was in touch, roused on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and just missed. TEAM WIN was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path
at the top of the stretch finished well. ARCELOR forced the early pace and dueled from between foes on the turn but from the three path at the top of the
stretch was all out. EXPRESS BANKING was in range and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but needed more. HASN'T HIT ME YET set a pressured
pace and was a factor on the turn but came up empty. MUSICAL FLIGHT had no speed and showed little while outrun.

and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. CAPTURE THE RIDE was in range and a factor on the far turn but from the three path at
the top of the stretch was all out. CAPE DESIDERATO was in mid pack and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
leveled off. JUSTINTIMEGOSNORTH was in touch but chased on the far turn and had no late kick. GIANTBALLS OF FIRE was off the pace, trailed the field
on the far turn and had no impact. ICE BLUE had no speed, raced evenly on the far turn and was never a threat. LEFOOTWOSTOMPS stalked the early
leader but was in tight on the far turn and came up empty.
