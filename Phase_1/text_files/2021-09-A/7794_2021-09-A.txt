Footnotes
SUNDANCE STAR broke well, battled briefly for command with ROSEHILL ROAD down the backstretch but forged a clear lead heading into the turn and
extended the advantage to the wire while being roused with moderate vigor through the lane. SHE APPEALS HOLY was reserved between foes in the early
going, angled to the inside at the top of the lane and closed well to get up for second. ROSEHILL ROAD was hustled to battle for the lead on the inside
down the backstretch and weakened in the lane. TIMBER LADY chased the pace from midpack early and had no late kick through the lane but maintained
position late to hold on for a minor share. SUMMER SWINGER was allowed to settle outside in the early going and failed to menace in the lane. HOLY
SOUL lacked early speed then trailed throughout.

brief bid on the bend and finished evenly through the lane. MO MORE dueled for the lead on the inside and gave way. R DEJA VOO showed brief speed out
of the gate and tired past the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
FUTURE PERFECT tracked on the inside through the early stages, saved ground on the far turn then angled out three wide at the top of the lane, took
command into the stretch, drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole while being hand-ridden appearing to make brief contact with COASTAL WATERS which
resulted in a jockeys objection following the race, and finished well to the prevail on the wire. COASTAL WATERS was unhurried in the early going on the
outside, continued to track from the rear into the far turn, swung out four wide at the top of the lane, commenced a rally down the center of the turf course
while drifting in slightly under right-handed urging, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole when FUTURE PERFECT lugged out briefly, and finished willingly to
the wire. CREATIVE MIND dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening half, led the field into the stretch but weakened in the final stages.
SMARTY ALEX settled near the rear early, saved ground on the far turn and made a late rail bid to get up for a minor share. DARK SOLUTION chased the
pacesetters on the outside throughout, shifted out at the top of the lane and had no late kick. FLIMFLAM MAN dueled for the lead throughout, failed to
sustain bid past quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
GETCHA broke readily to gain terms with the first flight three deep attending the pace racing to the backstretch, was prompted to wrest the advantage
nearing upper stretch and went clear through the lane under steady encouragement. EMMETT CAT, pulling outside foes racing to the first turn, tracked off
the first flight in the three path to the backstretch, was prompted to advanced in that path nearing upper stretch, exchanged some contact with ME AND
ROSE midstretch but continued with a steady late response to prove best of the others. SHAKELAS DESTINY, off slowly, settled off the second flight along
the inside to the backstretch, angled out four wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share late. ME AND ROSE, urged along
the rail prompting the pace from the break, dueled for command into the far turn, shifted out once headed by the winner pursuing that foe into upper stretch,
exchanged bumps midstretch and faded in late stages. PIRATE BIRD angled inwards tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, switched out racing
into the lane but had no rally. HEAVENLY GAZEBO, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset, gave way racing through the far turn. QUIET
PATRIOT trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MORGS WORLD angled inwards in the opening stages while being rated between foes tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance splitting foes three deep racing into the far turn and produced a sustained response under left handed pressure to reel in the leader. ROLLIN
BLACKOUT tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the first turn, split foes midway through the backstretch advancing sharply to the lead, forged clear
racing through the far turn, held sway on a commanding margin into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. STRAWBERRY
LANE was rated inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, tipped out three deep entering the lane to gain position between foes, then
angled to the rail in the closing stages while continuing with interest to edge rivals for a share. LADY CLARE exchanged bumps at the start, was caught
wide racing into the first turn tracking off the second flight, continued four wide into the far turn to upper stretch but had no closing response. TAKING
CHARGE DESI, urged to the lead inside foes racing into the first turn, dueled for command inside to the far turn and gave way. LIPSTICK LADY, carried
wide by LOCK IT DOWN racing into the first turn, continued in brief pursuit of the leaders four wide on the backstretch and emptied out between foes racing
into the far turn. IMPULSUS, pulling against restraint while shifting off the inside racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight on the backstretch but
offered no rally. LOCK IT DOWN exchanged bumps at the start, was urged between foes disputing the pace to the first turn, drifted wide entering that bend
impeding LIPSTICK LADY and faded after a half.

Footnotes
ROLLS ROYCE DEAL tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening quarter, angled to the rail racing into the turn, came through inside the
leader to challenge for command in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear late under firm handling. SAVED BY ZERO broke sharply, dictated
the pace along the inside racing into the turn, continued a bit off the rail to upper stretch resisting the winner's bid but proved only second best. HERBIE,
forwardly placed three wide between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in that path to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. DANZ A REBEL
tracked just off the pacesetter racing four wide to the turn and faded in that path into upper stretch. SHOW BUSINESS tracked off the first flight along inside
in the opening quarter and faded racing into the turn. MASTERFUL STRIDE, off slowly, failed to menace. ST. BIRETTA dropped out early.

Footnotes
SCREWBALL prompted to gain a contending position while caught four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards to track off the leaders outside a rival
racing into the backstretch, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and wrested the advantage in the closing stages
under firm handling. ANGEL'S MAGIC was urged to the lead in the three path racing to the first turn, dictated terms on a narrow advantage off the rail racing
to the backstretch, dueled for command outside a rival nearing upper stretch, continued to contest the issue between foes while weaving about under
pressure leaving midstretch and prevailed for the place honors late. RED WAVE angled to the rail racing to the first turn while moving to terms with the
pacesetter prompting that foe, dueled for command inside that foe on the far turn into upper stretch while gaining a narrow advantage but weakened late.
YO DAWG angled inwards tracking just off the leaders near the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out in upper stretch, was urged to advance between
foes racing through the stretch, then altered course repeatedly when losing his path to ANGEL'S MAGIC late. THIRSTY KISS, forced in by DA GHOST at
the start, was settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide entering the lane and displayed some late interest to close the gap on
the leaders late. KING OF THE KIDS tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn, worked his way to the inside racing into the lane but
offered no closing bid. HONEY'S SUPERMAN tracked off the second flight inside foes to the backstretch but faded from contention early. DA GHOST
veered inwards at the break impeding THIRSTY KISS, was collected while settling into stride and never menaced thereafter. DARK LEOPARD tracked off
the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED ANGEL'S MAGIC FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM FOURTH.

late. TRENDY NEVE tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, shifted three wide after a half gaining position, continued to make brief
progress in that path between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened in the lane. CSILLA, caught wide racing through the chute while being prompted to
contend, shifted inwards on the first turn to force the pace outside a rival, dueled for command outside that foe to the far turn, then between foes into upper

through that bend. ME SAY SO tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way nearing the lane. MAJESTIC ICE,
