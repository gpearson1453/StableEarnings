Footnotes
BESITOS CRIMINALES was hard to load, chased the leading trio, moved out from three to five wide advancing on the leaders through the turn, drifted out
leaving that bend, struck the lead in mid-stretch then edged clear while drifting out again late. REEL EM IN vied inside two others on or just off the rail, came
out a bit entering the stretch while edging clear, was overtaken and no match but second best. VEIW FROM THE BAY broke a step slowly, settled last but
one, shifted in and saved ground through the turn, got up for show honors. ROWDY MAMBO settled off the leaders, went two to three wide on the turn, ran
on mildly but needed more. CHROMATIC JAZZ vied outside runners three to four wide, weakened. LOPIN JOE broke awkwardly, lacked early speed,
swung four wide into the stretch and passed a tired rival. ZAMBEZI FEVER vied between runners going two to three wide on the turn, was done by the
stretch and came up empty.

BERNICE WHO raced in pursuit of the leader going four wide on the turn, angled in at the top of the stretch, edged past late under steady handling. FOXY
RED set the pace in the clear, went in the three path on the turn, was outfinished. RIGHT FOR YOU chased the leader from outside early, went five wide on
the turn, kept on evenly in the lane. MISS ABILITY was lightly brushed at the break, settled at the rear, shifted out from two to four wide on the turn coming
back in a path leaving that bend, gained mildly late. JAZZY HEAT broke inwardly, tracked along the inside into the turn, dropped back and shifted out three
wide by the late part of that bend, angled further to be six wide at the top of the stretch and failed to make a bid. ALSONO'S HUNTER broke inwardly and
was in a bit tight, switched out early, went widest going six deep on the turn, failed to threaten. SHE'S RAINED OUT broke inwardly lightly brushing a rival,
chased two wide, came up empty.

SHEZA DANDY R F pursued the leader three wide, struck the lead at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under steady handling.
RECEPTION settled off the pace, moved out from three to five wide on the turn then seven deep into upper stretch, was gaining but too late. ADORABLE
BRITTANY was mid-pack just off the leaders, went four wide on the turn, kept on to get up for show honors late over PINK SKY, who chased the leaders in
behind, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. ATTILA'S TATTLE settled last but one, saved ground on the turn, came
out turning for home and failed to rally. SHUG'S BEST got away alertly, set the pace inside, came up empty. M G M SPRING broke awkwardly, was well
back early, swung eight wide into the stretch and was not a threat.

Footnotes
QUICK TO FUSS bumped the inner rival at the break but quickly recovered to set the pace in the two path facing some outside pressure, was clear into the
stretch and held sway. NOVA STAR chased from outside, went four wide on the turn, edged nearer but couldn't get past. MOTOWN MAMMA tracked
inside, came out in mid-stretch and ran on to hold show honors. STREAMING TIGER broke a step slowly and steadied when in tight at the start, switched
out and advanced outside foes four wide to be in range on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. FABULOUS FORUM was bumped at the break, settled in
behind moving from two to four then back to three wide on the turn, altered eight wide in upper stretch and ran on. BODIE'S LOVE chased the pace from
between runners three wide into the turn, was empty for the drive. BINGOS SYSTEM bobbled and steadied at the start, faced traffic and had to alter out
heading up the backstretch, trailed in the four to five path on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SEXY DEXY broke outwardly, settled off the leader early, advanced into the turn to challenge, went three wide on that bend, kicked clear turning for home,
held safe. IZA DADDY settled toward the back, went two to three wide on the turn, came out six wide turning for home, ran on to get second. MO GEE was
forced out at the start and veered out a bit then, settled outside toward the rear, went five to six wide on the turn, veered out in mid-stretch, was running late
but missed the place. PURELY POLITICAL angled in up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, came out five wide into upper stretch and lacked the
needed late kick. BAYERN TO BE WILD broke a half-step slowly and had no early speed, moved out and went four wide on the turn, came out seven to
eight deep turning for home then angled in once in mid-stretch. AWESOME K P was urged clear, set the pace, dueled briefly inside a rival on the turn, came
up empty. BECOME AN INSIDER saved ground to no avail. TOMEGA was forwardly-placed early, dropped back two to three wide on the turn, faded in the
lane.
