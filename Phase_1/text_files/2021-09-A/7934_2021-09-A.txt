Footnotes
ULTIMATE BARONESS allowed to settle, raced blocked through the turn on the two path, waited, angled out when clear in the stretch, then made a steady
gain and drove clear late. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin quickly, held sway to the furlong
marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. NO QUESTION tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. COZZENE'S CAT allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid
four wide into the lane and flattened out. MA MEATLOAF well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and weakened the final furlong. MILE END well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
faded late.

turn, bid on that path into the lane, then lost ground while holding a share. RED CAT (CHI) mid pack, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the lane and flattened out. LOWCOUNTRY allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path and faded. OUR

Footnotes
YADI allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain, then drew off inside the
furlong marker. GOLDEN OAK allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the place.
BEACH PASS mid pack, looped to position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show.
REVANS REIGN well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then lost ground, while
gaining a share. SKYDIVING mid pack, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the final furlong.
MOTATAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. DERBY MODEL passed
tiring rivals. KICK IT CHARLIE tracked the pace, raced boxed through the second turn, steadied into the stretch, then angled out and could not gain.
CONCEALED CARRIER well placed and outside, faded after a half. ADIOS BOBBY stalked the pace on the outside, moved up four wide through the
second turn gaining a short lead, then had no stretch rally. HE'S A BELIEVER was never involved.
