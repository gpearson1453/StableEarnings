paths, bid nearing the quarter pole and closed to the lead in the four path midway on the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane, was steadily encouraged leaving
the eighth pole but was caught inside the sixteenth and relented later yards. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW settled close inside the first turn, bid leaving the five
sixteenths pole and angled to the five path midway on the far turn, then finished well; widest. CAROLINA BAMBINA rated a slim lead inside, came under

ELLIES LIL CASTLE dueled to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn and
dug in under a determined stretch drive to win the nod from the game effort of MY PRETTY EYES, who chased the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail
on the turn and challenged past the eighth pole then dug in gamely to the finish. DEREKA'S BLUFF pressured the pace and contested the turn at a close
disadvantage two deep, then outfinished in a stretch long duel. CARSON CASTLE engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path
on the turn and finished well; widest. DIXIE SUNRISE gave only distant chase, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly down the lane.
VACATION SECRET was shuffled back at the start then gave chase inside.

HOLLYWOOD BROWN chased, raced near the rail on the turn then eased to the four path approaching the top of the lane, dueled to the front mid-stretch
and held on when taken in hand. PARTLY DANDY came away a step slow then angled to the outside to give chase, progressed in the six path on the turn
then dug in under steady handling to take second inside the sixteenth pole. IAMTHEBESTTOO raced with the pace inside and contested the edge nearest
the rail on the turn, was caught mid-stretch then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. BELLA FEMMINA gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five
path and finished evenly. SINGING HARMONY was hustled to contention and contested at even terms two deep on the turn, but dropped back into the
stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. SISTER JOANN gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. CHARITABLE MISS
saved ground. AUNT MAGGIE gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail then drifted into the lane.

far turn and took the lead past the eighth pole, ran clear in the upper stretch and just lasted. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled back about the three path
early on, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four and five paths of the far turn, was closing well through the stretch and just missed.
KATALIMA saved ground off the pace, challenged leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep toward the quarter, raced clear midway on the
far turn but was caught past the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving
the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail toward the quarter then faded through the far turn. LIL SWEETHEART stalked the earlier pace two deep but
dropped back rounding the second turn and faded past the seven sixteenths pole.

HOBE SOUND saved ground close to the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved in the four path of the far turn, took the lead past the eighth
pole, raced clear mid-stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. WALL raced well back saving early ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, steadily gained in the four path of the far turn, angled in at the head of the lane and finished well to duel for second
mid-stretch. PROTA rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, but
was caught inside the eighth pole then outfinished for second mid-stretch. GIO DUDE saved ground on the first turn and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly down the lane. HAN SENSE stalked from
the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, then weakened in the stretch.
FIRE DOWN BELOW raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three
eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and passed some rivals. AWESOME BUZZ settled close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole then faded off the rail approaching the top of the stretch. DESTINY'S CHARGE raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and
showed little response through the backstretch. TO THE FRONT rounded the first turn in the five path and showed little response. PEPPI THE HUNTER
was never a factor.

Footnotes
FEEL THE LOVE settled off the pace in the four and five paths and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, drew close off the
rail midway on the far turn, took the lead mid-stretch and ran clear later yards. EYE OF THE NEEDLE raced with the early pace three wide then stalked into
the first turn, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and drew clear past the pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught mid-stretch and relented
later yards. TAPTAP settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid toward the three eighths pole and improved position in the three path of the far turn,
then finished well while gaining on the runner-up. CASTLE'S TUFFY was bumped off stride at the break then stalked off the rail, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. TEST ME I DARE U broke inward and into Castle's Tuffy and
raced well back saving early ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, improved her position off the rail on the far turn though showed little more.
HAPPY SAISON saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response and raced in the four path of the far turn.
LOVE TO ZOOM raced with the early pace inside, was met leaving the nine sixteenths pole then faded through the backstretch. TINA'S SONG raced with
the early pace between horses and took a slim lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole, was caught toward the three eighths and gave way from the five
sixteenths.
