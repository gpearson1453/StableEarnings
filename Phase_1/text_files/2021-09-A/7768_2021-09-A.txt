Footnotes
COMEDY TOWN broke inward, closed to mid pack, hustled from the rail through the turn, angled out upper stretch, rallied gamely and was up late under a
drive. AIM FOR THE SKY broke outward but had speed and forced the issue, led early turn, was engaged late turn, dueled, was edged by a closer in deep
stretch but outfinished CHECKERBOARD FLOOR for the place award. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR had speed, set a pressured pace, was headed early on
the turn, dug in and rebid along the rail, dueled into the stretch, battled to the late stages and gave way grudgingly. SANDY BAY was herded outward
leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, chased four-wide on the turn then finished all out. MIRACLE SILVER was rated at the back of the pack, was hustled
three-wide on the turn, moved to the rail at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely along the fence. SPEEDY BOLT stalked the pace, was hustled
three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
IN MY OPINION raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch, led a 16th out and held sway under a drive. USING
COCONUTS settled at the rear, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. BELIEVING
stalked, chased three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch and shook clear but failed to sustain the drive. SECRETS TOLD stalked the pace, chased two-wide
into the stretch, bid but was no match, chased, then evened out late. BAHIA GIRL raced in mid pack,was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
finished gamely in vain. SHAN'S TIGER sprinted clear late backstretch, set the pace, was joined upper stretch, dueled, then gave way. DAREDEVIL IS
BACK, in range, was hustled from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and evened out late. LADY AT BLAME raced in mid pack, was hustled
four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. CHASING SHADOWS settled off the pace, closed four to six-wide on the turn but never reached
contention. FROSTED FOLLY broke outward, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
BOSSY HOLIDAY cleared quickly, set a tepid early pace and maintained an open length advantage throughout, kept to his task down the lane. HUNT
MASTER was away slowly from his inside post, moved up in behind the pack chasing the leader into the turn, came two to four wide to the top of the lane
and angled out to get a seam at the eighth pole, closing well late to be a clear second. KIDDIE HOLIDAY was on hold while wide early, moved up four wide
on the turn to be second and appearing a menace to the winner but laid in down the lane and was all out to hold the show spot late. DOUBLE SAW was
taken back while inside late backstretch, circled the field two to five wide on the turn and widest into the stretch, lugged in outside the eventual place finisher
in upper to midstretch and hung when the show spot was his to lose late. I'M A CHI TOO was three wide and stalking the leader down the backside, in
between rivals chasing on the turn but was outkicked for a minor award in the final furlong. FORITTABLE sat along the rail in midpack, was asked for run on
the turn but did not respond, running in place down the stretch. SAILOR'S PASSION stalked the leader early, dropped back to chase on the inside into the
stretch but faded in the final three sixteenths. ANSELMO hesitated and then broke out extremely wide when finally exiting the gate, trailing by a wide margin
throughout.

DOWNY BOY had speed, dueled into the turn, forced the pace from the rail, bid upper stretch, gained the lead and held under a drive. REDOUTE'S LIGHT
raced in mid pack, closed three to five-wide on the turn, was up close in the stretch and gained steadily to the end. MOON OVER MONTANA had brief
speed then stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide from mid pack on the turn and finished all out to the wire. FIRST SPRING, in range, took command
mid turn, was headed upper stretchy and chased to the end. ARTISTICO, rated off the pace, circled four to six-wide late turn, was determined but leveled
out in deep stretch. CERRADO raced in mid pack, saved ground, chased gamely into the stretch but evened out late. EPILOGUE raced in mid pack, closed
three to five-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. SUITEDCONNECTED closed to mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then
lacked a rally. PICCADILLY BEAU dueled early then forced the pace from mid turn, chased into the stretch but gave way.

Footnotes
HAZELBROOK broke outward, stalked the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, swept to the lead a furlong out and held
sway under a drive. SILVER DAHLIA, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied outside and was gaining
steadily. IMAGERY raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and showed a good late effort. RED EQUINOX
raced in mid pack, closed from the rail and two-wide late turn then got back to the fence and rallied inside. STOKES moved up to duel, led into the turn, set
the pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and gave way grudgingly. HARD STREET dueled, forced the pace into the turn,
chased two-wide, the leveled out in the final 16th. BEAT THE SYSTEM, off slowly, moved up and dueled briefly, dropped back to stalk then finished evenly.
ENCHANTED LADY, away slowly and off the pace, saved ground on the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. PIQUET raced in mid pack, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. WEST PAW stalked close up early, chased three to five-wide through the turn but
flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE SEARCH won the break but was allowed to stalk the early leader, bid turning for home and had the front by midstretch, inching away and
opening up in the final stages. DECIMATOR chased along the inside on the backside, was in between and steadying early on the turn, came two to three
wide on the flank of the winner turning for home but couldn't match that one's kick, stubbornly holding on to be second best. I'M DASHING was three wide
chasing down the backside, came three to four wide to loom outside the top two finishers turning for home but was outkicked by that pair, holding the show
spot over a host of rivals. LONG POND settled off the pace in the two path, moved in behind a wall of horses late on the turn and in early stretch, came
between rivals and exchanged bumps with a foe before clearing and closing into the fast late pace for a minor award. CARL G broke out and bumped a rival
at the start and settled off the pace, was three to four wide on the turn to move into range and inched up widest down the lane when the pace was
quickening. POUND GREEN was bumped by a rival at the start and trailed, rallied into the back of the pack and into a tight spot in upper stretch before
tipping out and closing mildly late outside the rest. RITMO DE CUECA (ARG) led soon after the break, was stalked and pressed by the winner on the turn
and into the stretch, headed at the eighth pole and retreating from there. PRINCE OF THIEVES along the rail and guzzled back early, rallied into traffic in
upper stretch and levelled off in the final furlong. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE hopped at the start, settled in on the rail behind and was behind the leader turning
for home but had no run down the lane.

LUZ DE LA LUNA stalked the pace, chased two to four-wide through the far turn, rallied, had the lead mid stretch and finished under a hand ride. STREGA
pressed the pace, was hustled from the rail on the final turn, rallied gamely and was just up for place. LOADED VIXEN led quickly, set a reserved pace, was
roused at the top of the stretch but was passed a 16th out and chased to the end. ANYQUIST pressed the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn,
chased into the stretch, was a bit green but very game to the end. INTRO was away slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide
through the far turn and rallied determinedly. CLASSIC QUEEN raced in mid pack, chased from the rail on the far turn and was all out through the stretch.
GINA settled off the pace, saved ground throughout, was hustled on the far turn but never reached contention. WAY OF LIFE broke slowly, raced three-wide
in mid pack through the first turn, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally.

a rival wavering a little in front of her. CEFALO broke outward but showed a turn of speed, drew off a long lead, set the pace, was collared in the final furlong
and chased to the end. RAPUNZEL'S DREAM settled in mid pack, chased late turn, was blocked upper stretch, angled out and rallied. CAPABLE moved up
quickly to stalk the pace, was taken in hand, saved ground on the turn, encountered traffic in the stretch and finished evenly. HANCHY raced in mid pack,
