KING PARKER was battling for the lead in the two path took command midway on the turn and drew clear to win handily. YOUNG PHILLIP made a move
on the inside on the turn came to the two path for the drive and was second best while not a threat to the winner. SLICK IT UP raced three wide on the turn
and had could not make up the needed ground. EL DIABLO GRANDE showed good early speed along the rail but tired through the stretch. GOLD LABEL
was away very slow spotting the field five lengths and never mounted a rally.

WRATH showed good early speed but could not get to the rail and battled in a stretch-long duel on the outside to prevail by the narrowest of margins.
COUGAR COUNTRY battled for the lead from almost the outset along the inside and lost a tight photo finish. COWBOY DON was along the inside the
entire trip was a clear third in the stretch but finished on even terms for the show while tirning. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN was along the inside but could not
go with the top two was clearly third in the stretch but tired and was caught to finish on even terms for the show at the wire. FLOWER BEACH was up close
to the pace while off the rail and drifted out through the stretch while tiring. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE came three wide entering the stretch and never
mounted a serious rally. PICADILLY ROADSTER raced along the inside off the pace and had nothing in the stretch run.
