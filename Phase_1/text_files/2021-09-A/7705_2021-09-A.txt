Footnotes
TRANS MISSISSIPPI chased the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals, edged ahead at the furlong marker, then shook clear
late and lasted under steady pressure. ZIDIKAI allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside, made a steady gain and lacked the
needed late kick. CLASSY LYNN allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then evened out the final furlong.
COUNTESS JESSICA well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. BETTERTHENYOURX sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin to the turn, then drifted out into the stretch and faded.
KARA LOT was no factor.

Footnotes
STATE CROWN tracked the early pace, pulled to contention down the backstretch, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the
leader into the stretch, then shook clear and drew off while drifting out. JEAN V'S LEGACY allowed to settle, gained position three wide through the second
turn, bid on that path into the lane, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. LA LIMONADA allowed to settle, looped three wide through
the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. DR KAAK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged
into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. TAPPINGINTOSUCCESS mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path
and weakened in the stretch. GRAY ROYALITY was a brief factor and was outrun.

Footnotes
PATRIOT DRIVE allowed to settle, gained position two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, lugged in slightly, was
bumped, then drove clear while drifting in further. CHIC N WILBUR stalked the pace on the inside, angled out to gain position on the two path through the
second turn, bid on that path, then drifted out, bumped a rival, straightened and lacked the needed late kick. GREAT mid pack, gained position on the two
path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, then was bumped and pushed into a rival while steadying, then could not gain. COOPER'S
CRESCENT set the pace on the outside, shook clear down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong.
JEN'S SONG was never involved. COLONEL TALBOT well placed and outside, faded through the second turn. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF
FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF GREAT AGAINST THE RIDER OF CHIC N WILBUR WAS ALLOWED FOR INTERFERIENCE IN THE STRETCH

Footnotes
C THE KING mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged ahead late.
DETANGLER vied for the early lead on the inside, moved up to gain a short lead down the backstretch, shook clear into the second turn, held sway to the
final furlong and was outfinished. NAMARUNU (GER) allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
closed well for the show. PADDY ALL DAY well placed, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out.
TALK LESS mid pack, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. REAL
GLITTER ran evenly. MAD JACK broke open the gate pre start, then was no factor. CANDY MY BOY set the early pace off the rail, stayed on when
challenged down the backstretch, held position through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.
