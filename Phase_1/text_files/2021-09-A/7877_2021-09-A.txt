Footnotes
CLEMENZA tracked the pacesetter in the early stages, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside in the final furlong, surged in deep stretch and was just
up at the wire for a share of the win. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT showed good early speed to set the pace, showed the way into the stretch, dug in gamely in
final sixteenth and held on for a share of the top spot. A FAREWELL YODEL chased the leaders, raced inside into the stretch and rallied mildly. ALITE
chased the pace, lacked a bid and weakened in the stretch. HE'SAREARVIEWTOWN raced off the pace, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane
and had no rally. ENANO was off slowly and outrun. SIR JULIO was off slowly and steadied, then outrun.
