HE'S A SHOOTER sprinted clear soon after the break, angled in, set the pace along the inner rail and pulled away the final quarter mile under confident
handling. TYLER TIME raced in the two path, chased the winner throughout and held the place. SUPER HOUDINI lacked speed, raced inside horses,
eased out near the eighth pole and failed to rally. HUNTER JOE hesitated at the break, advanced three deep on the second turn to reach contention,
remained in three path entering the far turn and retreated when tiring. LET US MAKE GOLD hugged the inner rail, stalked the pace to the final turn then
retreated. RAGING WHIRLWIND was outrun.

FEDERALE broke in the air, recovered and found a seam early allowing him to engage GLENGAR from the outside, vied into the backstretch, was nudged
clear with three eighths remaining, moved away leaving the quarter pole then held sway under steady hand encouragement. TOM TERRIFIC saved ground
early while off the duel, angled out near the half mile pole, chased two to three wide, advanced to be the closest pursuer leaving the far turn and kept on
willingly on his left lead. VICTORY GIVEN , taken to rate early while saving ground, angled out near the quarter pole, made a mild move then flattened out.
MYSTIC TIMES , three to four wide, failed to respond. GLENGAR sped to the front, was joined passing the wire the first time, dueled inside then faltered
after five furlongs.

BOOGIE WITH ME , displaying sharp speed, went clear in the opening furlong, was nudged along setting the pace towards the rail, moved away to a solid
lead leaving the quarter pole, responded to rousing into the lane and maintained a comfortable advantage under a drive. RAN CHAR gave hard chase two
wide and continued willingly to save the place. FOGGY DREAMS settled early, came under pressure and commenced a run leaving the three eighths
marker, circled three wide into the lane, steadily gained but was out kicked for the place. PHANTOM SHOT lagged back, circled four wide into the lane and
failed to menace. LE WEEKEND , beaten to the lead, tracked inside into the first turn, eased out under pressure past the three eighths, had no kick into the
far turn, faltered and was eased late. HELL IN A SHELL , in the clear near the half mile marker, saved ground leaving the far turn, faltered and was eased
late.

ABOVE THE LIMIT accelerated to a large lead soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail and was ridden out. MATTITUDE broke badly when
acting up in the starting gate, bore in leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three deep and rallied. SOME IS NINE hugged the inner rail and failed to rally.
PEACE OUT , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in the drive. SEE THAT GIRL saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally.
SUMMER ODDS trailed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

FORCED vied outside STRETCH THE TRUTH while nudged along, held a short lead into the lane then edged away late under a steady hand ride.
STRETCH THE TRUTH , bumped at the gate, rushed up between foes, dueled to the inside of the winner and gave way grudgingly. ONE MORE FACTOR ,
bumped at the break, flashed speed then steadied back off foes in the opening furlong, circled the turn three wide but could only muster up a slight
response. JOEYVILLE , off the pace, was under pressure three wide into the lane and had belated action. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT came out at the break and
bumped with a rival, saved ground chasing the dueling leaders and faded. PEPE AND HEYWOOD , fractious in the gate, broke poorly, dropped well back
then had late interest.

GALLANT GOLD set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and was kept under pressure in the drive. ALL FOR LOVE , in the
two path both turns, chased the winner and weakened. SUMMER ASH broke slowly, hugged the inner rail, was in hand waiting for room at the head of the
stretch and lacked the needed late response. AMERICAN PLAYBOY , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way. FOREVER YOURS , four
deep the firs turn, faltered. An objection by the rider of ALL FOR LOVE against the winner for alleged interference entering the stretch was not allowed.

came up empty. BENEATH THE STARS was rated back at the break, raced three wide around the first turn, chased between rivals leaving the far turn and
lacked a bid. SPLENDID VIEW saved ground and faded. CHICA RABIOSA lagged back, circled four wide into the lane and failed to menace. TOY TIGER

Footnotes
CONGRESS HALL stalked the pace, hugged the inner rail through the stretch, closed and was up late. GOLDEN LASSIE , in tight quarters leaving the
starting gate, steadied behind foes soon after the break, circled the first turn three wide, circled the far turn four wide, led turning for home and weakened.
SACRED LADY , close up early, raced in the three path on both turns and weakened. SUBLIMITY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail
and tired. DON'TBAGGAGECHECK , steadied in traffic early, chased the pace and weakened. SOLEA , steadied behind the fallen rider soon after the
break, fell back, pulled up and walked off. SPIRIT OR SPITE bobbled soon after the break then unseated her rider when taking bad steps about a sixteenth
of a mile after the break. There was a stewards' inquiry the early running but no action was taken.
