TRUSTING FRIEND urged off the pace inside, angled out on the turn and was up in the final strides following a long drive. HERE WEGO lacked speed,
moved inside on the turn, rallied late but just missed. MASS APPEAL vied outside throughout and continued gamely to the finish. HARD WEST alternated
for the lead along the rail and weakened slightly. PHARAOH'S CITY dropped far back then passed a stopping rival. DON'T MAKE IT EASY prompted the
pace three wide then began fading on the turn.

into the stretch to gain the place. TRUE BOLDNESS chased four wide, moved closer on the final turn and finished willingly. SUPERHIGHWAY broke
slowest, raced very wide and flattened out. KID MACHO lacked speed inside, moved out on the final turn and was no factor. MUCHO MAS GRANDE
dropped back in the two path and lacked a rally. JAMMINWITHBRANDON raced within range for half a mile and gave way. MY MAN ELVIS set the pace
early and stopped abruptly on the final turn. AMERICAN ROMA prompted the pace then proved empty after three quarters.
