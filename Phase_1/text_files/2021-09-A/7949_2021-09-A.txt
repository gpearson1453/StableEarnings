DAVID'S GEM broke well, set all the pace, widened at will into the stretch and won easily. TIP SHEET never far back, advanced two wide through the far
turn drawing closer to the winner then was no match while well clear for second in the four path. MAKE THE RULES stalked the pace and went evenly in the
four path. LEVANTO (ARG) chased the winner into the far turn then weakened. GEH SCHNELL passed tiring rivals. TILL THEN was no factor. LAST DROP
OF WINE stumbled at the start, had speed for a half, stopped on the far turn, pulled up in upper stretch and was walked off.
