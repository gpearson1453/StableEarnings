Footnotes
CRYPTO FLAG dropped well back from early contention then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, closed the gap in the three and four paths of the turn and
steadily improved to take over and draw off late yards. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path then dug in to take
second the final strides. SONDEOFF engaged in close chase inside and raced at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear toward the head of
the stretch but was caught flattening stride later yards. STONES ROAD had a brief early lead then pressured the pace from the three eighths pole, raced a
close factor in the three path of the turn, but flattened inside the eighth pole. REAL APPEAL gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened.
DAUGHTEROFTHESTARS set a pressured early pace, dueled between horses into the turn but dropped back midway through the turn and weakened the
final furlong.

paths, raced outside into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, then flattened in the three path of the far turn. MR. SNAP took the
lead toward the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, gave up the lead at the three eighths and gave chase from that point, but

VINTAGE GIN took quick control to rate the pace inside, was under hand pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn then
kept alert to prove much the best. FONDA ROMANA settled back saving ground the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch then angled to the
seven path rounding the far turn, dug in from the head of the stretch and took second under the wire. SAILING ROCK saved early ground then gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, improved her position in the five path of the far turn then nipped from second under the wire. PUT POSITION rounded the
first turn in the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and
ran evenly through the lane. DAMISELA stalked the earlier pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
weakened the final furlong. DAH PHILLY settled off the pace saving early ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn.
WIKI WOOD rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn. The
three quarter fraction was hand timed.

JUST A BIT SASSY broke outward to make contact with Jimmysextragirl and raced in the three path the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch, bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn, raced clear into the stretch and was steadily handled to
widen. EARNED THE SHOT saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved position in the five path of the
far turn, then dueled for second mid-stretch. GLORIOUS MYSTERY was hustled along to contest the early pace but was caught past the three eighths pole,
engaged in close chase from that point, though, flattened the final sixteenth. JIMMYSEXTRAGIRL was bumped leaving the gate and stalked in the four path
the first turn, rallied to the lead past the three eighths pole, contested the advantage off the rail into the far turn but was caught toward the head of the
stretch and weakened the final furlong. INFINITE REWARD settled off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of
the far turn. KATIE'S BAYOU contested the early pace but dropped back from between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole and weakened at the
rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
SCOTTISH MAN broke a step slow and settled back in the four path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily progressed in the
four path of the far turn, dug in to come between horses mid-stretch and dueled for the nod through later yards. GRECIAN ADMIRAL rounded the first turn
in the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled inside the drifting Flashy Ready Rick at the eighth
pole, caught that one mid-stretch but couldn't hold off the determined effort of the winner. LUNAR IMAGE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled to the four path into the stretch and finished well to take third the final yards. FLASHY READY RICK
angled to the inside to rate a clear pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but drifted toward the top of the
stretch and was caught while flattening stride mid-stretch. MELTECH stalked the pace from the three and four paths, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn. RUM RUNNER RED raced well off the early pace while saving ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole, eased outward into the far turn and was carried a bit wider toward the head of the lane. EXPLOITATION showed little response through the
backstretch. WISH IN THE CASTLE was not a factor. COLLECTION BOX raced close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven
sixteenths pole then faded through the backstretch.
