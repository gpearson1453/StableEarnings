Footnotes
NENE ROMANO broke on top and set the pace through the turn while traveling in the two path, had a clear lead into the stretch but was pressured late,
drifted in the final sixteenth and held on over an oncoming runner-up. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ tracked the early leaders into the turn, gained ground while four
then five wide on the turn, closed the gap on the winner in the stretch but could not reel him in and was a clear second over the rest. DIZZY LIZZY settled
toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the turn and finished willingly in the stretch, but was not challenging the top two. P T RANGER prompted the
early pace, was three wide while gaining a bit on the winner but was outfinished in the stretch run. SMOKEY DESERT had no speed in the early going, was
three wide between foes on the turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. KAZAKHSTAN chased the early pace while saving ground on the turn and
tired in the stretch. STAY BACK settled near the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
K P D DAY settled off of the early fractions, mounted a bid while two wide on the second turn and had a late push in the stretch to prevail. AWESOME
DUDE settled in the midflight, improved position while two wide on the second turn and continued that run in the stretch to win the head nod for the place.
TRASH TALKIN CAT set the pace while being prompted, saved ground while two wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the stretch, just missing
the head nod for second. RAILSPLITTER tracked the early leaders from the middle of the field, was three wide on the second turn and made a mild late
stretch bid. BOYSON had no speed in the early going, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch. VANTAGE POINT prompted the
pace and gave way in the stretch. BERNALINHO settled near the rear of the field, was three then four wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the
stretch drive. VOICE OF VICTORY tracked the early leaders, lost ground on the second turn while three wide and weakened in the stretch. ROUEN stalked
the early pace from a forwardly placed position, was four wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
DIAMOND DATA briefly dueled on the front end with DRASARIO, put away that rival on the turn while saving ground and drew off in the stretch, gearing
down at the end. WHISPERING FLAME settled at the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn while mounting a bid and kept on in the stretch to save
second. WILD WAGER chased the early leaders from a ground saving position on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch for third. DRASARIO (IRE)
pressed the early pace by the winner, was outrun on the turn while two wide and faded in the stretch drive. PROOF OF PARANOIA settled in the middle of
the field, was three wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch. FOREST VICTORY sat just off of the early pace, took up on the second turn
while in tight quarters and was then eased in the stretch and walked off. MASTER DIAMOND lagged throughout and was eased and walked off in the
stretch.

SMOKIN ENCOUNTER sat just off of the early quick pace, saved ground while two wide on the turn, closed the gap quickly on the pacesetter off of the turn,
dueled with the runner-up in the final sixteenth and gamely prevailed. THAT'S BIND BABE tracked the early leaders while improving position three wide on
the turn, dueled with the winner inside of the final sixteenth and was denied the win, while a clear second over the rest. CAJUN BETTOR had no speed in
the early going, improved position while four wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch. FOSTER BOI broke sharply and set the quick pace from a
ground saving position, had a clear lead into the stretch but tired in the late going. REGAL LADY chased the early pace from the midfield position, was three
wide on the turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch. TOMAHAWK TUESDAY tracked the leaders from toward the rear of the field and was not a
threat. PREACHER BROWN had no early speed, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. C'MON JENNA attended to the early fractions, lost ground
on the turn, bled, was pulled up and was vanned off.

MAMBA QUEEN broke on top and set contested fractions through the turn, was met by VA VA VOOM off of the turn and determinedly turned that one away
in the final sixteenth to prevail. VA VA VOOM contested the pace by MAMBA QUEEN, gained ground on the winner off of the turn but could not reel her in in
the final sixteenth while holding for second. CRYSTAL PROOF sat off of the early pace while saving ground, swung out for the stretch drive and was closing
the margin on the top two in the late going. VALRAVN tracked the leaders from a three wide running position on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch
run. LIVIN' AT THE BU was a bit slow into stride, chased the field from the rear while three wide on the turn and did not have a late rally in the stretch.
FLASHIN PASSION chased the leaders from the midflight while saving ground and faded in the stretch. DUBLIN BLUE ECHO checked while in tight
quarters in the first eighth of a mile, chased from near the rear of the field and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GEE GEE WHIZ settled at the rear of the field, mounted a bid on the second turn to circle the field while five then six wide, surged in the final sixteenth and
won the head nod on the wire to prevail. MOUNT PELLIAR settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn, continued to save all the
ground into the stretch and rallied along the rail in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while besting the rest. ROARING TIGER traded pace duties
with EVENEREVENWORSE, was three wide on the second turn while vying for the lead, continued to battle up front off of the turn but was outfinished in the
late going, while holding for third. BIG CITY BANE stalked the pace from a forward position and was outkicked in the stretch, just missing for third.
INFATUATE was pinched at the start and tracked the early leaders from the midflight, saved ground on the second turn and rallied in the stretch, just
missing for third. CROWN AND PICKLES stalked the early pace, was four wide on the second turn, was outrun to an opening inside of the final sixteenth,
checked in tight quarters and finished evenly in the late going. BROKEN FINGER stalked the pace from the midflight while saving ground on the second turn
and had no final kick in the stretch run. EVENEREVENWORSE traded pace duties with ROARING TIGER, vied for the lead leaving the second turn but
gave way in the late stages. FINAL FINAL had no speed in the early stages, was four wide on the second turn and was not a factor. BLAKEFORD sat off of
the early pace, lost ground on the second turn and was empty for the stretch run.
