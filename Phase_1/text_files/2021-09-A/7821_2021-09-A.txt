Footnotes
JOLTING JOE was well rated early on the inside, then was two wide on the backstretch, eased out for racing room on the turn to make a three wide move,
quickly assumed command leaving the turn and was given one left handed pop with the riding crop approaching the furlong marker and drew off while being
hand ridden the final furlong. BUCKETS OF RAIN set the pace while being well handled on the inside, then was headed by the winner by the quarter pole
and offered no resistance but saved the place late. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS tracked the pace on the inside to the three sixteenths pole, angled out and
lacked the needed rally, bested rest. HAPPY CAMPER was allowed to settle while five to four wide on the backstretch, came four wide into the drive and
had no rally. TRUMPS REVENGE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace four wide on the backstretch, came three wide into the drive and
weakened. BOLD ADVENTURE prompted the pace two to three wide and weakened.

EMPIRE'S SCORE steadied slightly shortly after the start, then was rated early and advanced three to four wide on the turn, tipped out five wide leaving the
turn and closed well to get up in time under a drive. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT stalked the early pace four wide, then made a three to four wide to take command
leavi9ng the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but could not hold off the winner late to just miss. SUDDEN SHIFT dueled for the lead on the inside
and kept on to the wire while fading late. JEFF THE RUNNER dueled for the lead two wide and faded in the drive. COMPLEX JUSTICE chased the pace
two wide and came into the drive two wide and drifted out through the lane but lacked the needed winning bid. UNBRIDLED VICTOR chased the early pace
on the inside swung out three wide for the drive but had no rally. FASHION NUGGET was void of early speed and failed to menace. SON OF BATMAN was
allowed to settle early and was five wide by the quarter pole and had no response.

drive. STARLET EXPRESS stalked the winner and made a three wide bid entering the drive but hung late. DOWNDELANE was reserved early on the
inside, advanced on the turn and eased out three wide by the quarter pole, then angled out in the drive and was sent down and closed well late but too late.
HOOSIER PREMIUM was allowed to settle early, split rivals by the five sixteenths pole, then was two wide by the quarter pole and finished evenly. BERTIE
THE BEAUTY was four wide into the first turn, then had a four to five wide pursuit on the backstretch and tired. PRINCESS LENNY was five wide into the
first turn, then raced wide and had no menace. MYERS TIGER was fractious in the gate, then was up with the pace early on the inside, then was in tight and
checked into and on the first turn, chased the pace on the inside down the backstretch and folded.

SCOTTY'S ON EDGE was well placed while three wide on the turn, angled in by the quarter pole to make a inside bid leaving the turn and quickly drew
clear, then moved off the inside in the drive and drew off to prove much the best under mild urging. BOLD BIZNESS was off slowly, then advanced four to
five wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive and failed to gain on the winner while second best. MALIBU CLASSIC dueled for the early lead three to
four wide and weakened, bested rest. CHARLIE TWO SOX pressed the pace five wide and weakened. LEO'S ROAR stumbled at the start and dueled for
the lead two to three wide and folded. CAST IRON ALEX was off slowly, then raced three to four wide and was not a threat. PROTECTED AREA chased

Footnotes
WHATS UP SWEETS was five wide into the first turn, then rated four wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move by the quarter pole, and drew
away in the furlong grounds to prove much the best under a drive. POLYESTER BRIDE set the pace on the inside and was headed by the furlong marker
and could not go with that rival while staying on for the place. MISS DONNASUE was rated along the inside, swung out five wide by the three sixteenths and
improved position late, along for the show award. EVIE tracked the pace two wide and faded in the drive. PEARL GIRL tracked the pace three wide and
weakened in the drive. PERTINACIOUS TIZ was six wide into the first turn, stalked the pace five wide and was empty in the drive. WARIS steadied slightly
while four wide into the first turn and tired. COURT WHIST was taken back early and trailed throughout.
