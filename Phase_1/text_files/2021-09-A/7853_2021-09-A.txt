DELIGHTFULLYWICKED led inside, repelled several challenges and drew away through the stretch under moderate coaxing. SHOULDA HAD IT saved
ground to the stretch, angled out, took aim at the leader but tired. AND SEEK prompted the pace outside, was asked for run on the final turn but faltered.
INGREIDO wide throughout, offered a middle move into the final turn then faded. COMMANDER'S INTENT stumbled at the start, dropped back in the two
path and was no factor. THE EXCEPTION lacked speed and chased far behind throughout.

OUR TINY DANCER angled inside moving clear on the first turn, controlled the pace then extended her margin through the stretch under a brisk hand ride.
HIGH FRONTIER rated off the pacesetter, made a brief bid then proved no match in the stretch. PAINTED LOVE advanced inside before half a mile but
failed to sustain her run. HOLD THAT GHOST raced wide throughout and failed to make an impact. HIT A HOMER HONEY was urged close up outside
briefly then gradually weakened. DEBBIE'S TREASURE trailed early and was never in contention. BRUMMAGEM raced outside and gave way on the final
turn.

UNDER THE RADAR settled far back, moved boldly along the rail on the turn, angled out near the quarter and wore down the pacesetter in the final yards.
VANCE SCHOLARS hustled to a clear lead inside, continued gamely with the advantage but was nailed at the wire. NATO chased outside, moved inside in
the stretch with no response. SHOT TIME prompted the leader outside to midway on the turn and faded. SHED A TEAR unseated his rider and ran off
during the warm-up and was ordered a late scratch.

MIAMI CROCKETT vied outside, edged ahead on the turn then gamely held rival safe the entire stretch. PASCAL CHANT dueled along the rail throughout
and battled to the finish but could not get by the winner. SHOWTIME CAT broke a bit awkwardly, bumped with opponent near the half mile pole and lacked
a rally. ROCKET BLAST bumped with third finisher down the backstretch and was no factor. Objections by the third finisher against the winner and the
fourth finisher against the third finisher were both denied.
