Footnotes
TAPPED TO THE MAX pressed from outside three wide, took a narrow lead by the five-sixteenths, edged clear in late stretch while being kept to the task.
MAINFRAME JUDY vied between runners two wide into the turn, was a game second but yielded only grudgingly near the wire. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE
broke inwardly bumping and bothering a rival, chased from outside going four wide on the turn and failed to rally. FLYING FALCON prompted the pace
inside, began to weaken midway on the turn, came out in mid-stretch and continued to drop back some. TYGER TENNESSEE was bumped, bothered and
steadied at the start, raced last but one well off the leaders in the two path into the turn, swung five wide out of that bend and ran on. I AM
ALLTHATYOUARE broke slowly, was devoid of speed and never a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY SOUTHWESTERN HOPE WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FIFTH BEHIND TYGER TENNESSEE FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START.

Footnotes
VANNA broke a half-step slowly then was coaxed forward to challenge for the lead inside but off the fence, edged away from rivals inside but off the rail on
the turn, drifted to the four path turning for home, drew off under steady handling. CURL attended the pace from outside going three to four wide, drifted to
the six path turning for home, was not persevered with in the lane once clearly beaten and safe for the place. LOOKINANDCOOKIN was off slowly and
lacking early speed, went into the turn four wide and exited eight deep, improved to get up for show honors. ALL STEAMED UP raced near the inside on or
just off the rail through the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. CANDY CARMA chased from outside four to five wide on the turn, came
into the stretch seven wide and made no bid. SENSATIONAL SONG had the early lead for about three-sixteenths, dropped back two to three wide on the
turn and faded. CHERYL IN CHARGE was fractious in the gate, raced mostly three to four wide, was not a threat and not persevered with in the lane.

past late under urging. FOLLOW THE FACTS broke on top but was outsprinted early, soon sped clear under some encouragement to dictate terms in the
two path into the turn, drifted four wide into the stretch, was still clear but caught late. PROUD ZONING had the early lead but was then forced to chase
three wide into the turn, came out five wide for the drive and had no rally. AL RHYTHM switched off the rail racing in the two path, had no late bid. MORO
APPEAL hopped at the start, moved forward outside foes four then three wide on the turn, had no late kick. VIVID FEVER settled, saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
OVERTIDE set the pace moving clear after the opening three-sixteenths, went in the two path on the turn, widened into upper stretch and held sway under
steady handling. QUITE LOVELY was fractious in the gate, chased inside, switched out on the turn to be three wide late on that bend, held the place.
CAYCEE'S MARK was in the back half of the field, forced five to six wide on the turn, ran on to improve. ZIVA DA'VID was outsprinted early, went three to
four wide on the turn, had no rally. SEVENTH HENNESSY saved ground moving from two wide to the rail then back out on the turn, came out further in
mid-stretch, failed to menace. RAISE OUR FLAG saved ground along the inside at the rear, shifted eight wide in upper stretch and passed tired foes.
BOSSY BABY broke awkwardly and bumped a rival, went three to four wide on the turn, came out in the stretch and was not a threat. SEXY PROPOSAL
was bumped at the break, moved forward early to chase from outside, dropped back four to five wide on the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRICKESSY stalked the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, came into the stretch six wide, just got up late. BULLY BABY set the pace inside on or
just off the rail, had the lead till late stretch but was caught. CARMON'S DANCE pressed the pace two to three wide, was four wide at the top of the stretch
and still in contention but lacked the needed late kick. BETTY C chased from outside going five to six wide on the turn and coming seven wide into upper
stretch, kept on to close mildly. SILLY NOTION broke a step slowly and lost the path at the start, angled in soon thereafter, came out three wide early on the
turn, maintained that path through much of the bend before shifting six wide into upper stretch. DOUBLE STORM raced two deep through the turn, failed to
rally. NOTHIN BUT CLASS hopped at the start, saved ground on the turn before coming out three wide into upper stretch, was forced in about mid-stretch
by a drifting rival. IRISH CREAM N KAFE chased early, moved in from four to three wide on the turn while dropping back, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch then
came back out, tired. TEF'S LITTLE CAT broke outwardly, lacked early speed, went four to five wide on the turn, came into the stretch six deep and was not
a threat. LILBLUECHICKNFRY chased briefly up the backstretch, moved out two wide early on the turn but soon pulled up, was vanned off.
