Footnotes
SACRED SKY set the pace while racing three wide, then was sent down approaching the furlong marker and responded well to draw clear to prove best
under a drive. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid by the five sixteenths pole, continued that bid leaving the turn but
flattened out in the final furlong while staying on to be second best. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was rated along the inside early, then eased off the rail to be
two wide by the quarter pole while advancing, but lacked the needed stretch bid, held show award. MANUELITO was reluctant to load, then chased the
pace four wide and lacked the needed rally while just missing the show spot. COLONEL HUBERT was outsprinted early, then was put to heavy crop urging
at the three eighths pole and had no rally. SWEET SKY prompted the early pace two wide, then moved to the inside on the turn and weakened.

HUNGRY HENRY prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and drew clear leaving the turn, then was kept to mild pressure to prove
best. FAMILY TRADITION was allowed to settle early in traffic, then was three wide by the quarter pole, shifted in to the inside in the stretch and closed well
to gain the place award. PRIVATE ROAD tracked the early pace two wide, then eased out leaving the five sixteenths pole and came five wide into the drive,
then ducked out by the eighth pole, rallied well on the outside while racing greenly. ROOSTER RUN stalked the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn
to vie for command but weakened in the drive. HERE AND NOFURTHER was a little slow into stride, them made a five wide mild bid on the turn but came
up empty in the drive. ASHWINS ORB passed the tiring rivals. BENNY'S FIDDLE was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside and gave way by the
quarter pole. XKUZ chased the early pace and weakened. THISPOINTINTIME failed to menace. BOURBON DELIGHT was outrun early and was wide on
the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
NATIVE CHARM was taken back early and moved to the inside, continued to save ground on the inside on the turn, was blocked and steadied by the
quarter pole, then when rook made a quick inside move by the three sixteenths pole, drew clear in the final furlong under a mild drive. COMPLETE was
allowed to settle early on the inside, eased off the rail by the quarter pole and swung out five wide for the drive, rallied. CHOCTAW BINGO set a pressured
pace on the inside, then shook clear leaving the turn and moved off the rail, then faded late while saving the show award. BARREL OF DESTINY was
reserved early and was four wide on the backstretch, then was three wide on the turn and by the quarter pole, angled in by the furlong marker and had a
late rally on the inside. EMBARRASSING was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but came up
empty in the drive. AUNTIE MABEL stalked the pace four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened. NATIVE LION chased the early pace
and made a mild bid on the inside by the quarter pole and weakened. MALIBU MARLEE chased the pace in between rivals and tired. LADY MCKENZIE
was bumped at the start, failed to menace. SWEET N WICKED pressed the pace three wide and folded.
