Footnotes
SECRET'S DOUBLE set the pace racing off the rail, went mostly in the two path on the turn, held well under steady handling. CANYON DEL ORO chased
the winner from outside, went three wide on the turn, could make no headway. COMING ABSTRACTION settled off the leaders inside, came out near the
five-sixteenths, was four wide by the quarter pole and seven wide at the top of the stretch, ran on mildly. BONFIRE PARTY broke inwardly just a bit, was
forwardly-placed tracking inside, shifted four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. POP QUIZ went five wide on the turn and was urged along
midway on that bend, swung nine deep into the stretch and failed to rally. NONAME BANDIT chased briefly from between runners, went two to four wide on
the turn and steadily weakened. JAZZIE DREAM lacked early speed, dropped well back going three to four wide on the turn, came into the stretch five wide
and was eased to the wire, walked off. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong time was unavailable.

Footnotes
JUGGLES had the early lead then attended outside a rival, went two wide on the turn regaining control, edged clear into upper stretch, held under a steady
drive. MT. TAYLOR switched out heading up the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit,
was gaining but too late. DON WITH THE WIND stalked the leading pair from outside, went three then four wide on the turn, kept on to secure show honors.
ROAD TO HEAT prompted the pace inside, weakened. WESTERN SMOKE bumped a rival lightly at the start, shifted in, saved ground along the rail on the
turn, angled out six deep turning for home, ran on. PROVOST was lightly bumped at the start, made an early advance two to three wide heading to the turn,
dropped back and faded. COOL AND QUICK broke a bit awkwardly, trailed while shifting well off the inside, went four to five wide on the turn, swung seven
wide into upper stretch and was not a threat.

bit turning into upper stretch, dug in to edge clear late. ATILL I CHIME dueled outside the winner, went three wide on the turn, was a game second but
outfinished. AWESOME WALKER tracked inside, altered outside the top pair past the three-sixteenths, went evenly thereafter. DANCINSTARDUSTLADY
pursued the leading trio three to four wide and failed to rally. ZEN YETI tracked mid-pack inside, came out for the stretch run and was not a threat. ROYAL
QUEEN shifted in heading into the turn from five to three wide, came out turning for home then shifted back in. BRYNLEE'S LEMONADE failed to threaten
going five wide on the turn. AMY'S HONEY failed to make a bid after going three then two wide on the turn. OUR SOARING ANGEL exchanged a light
brush and steadied in tight quarters at the start, switched out heading up the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, failed to menace.
