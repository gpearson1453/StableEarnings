Footnotes
NO MORE MASK sprinted to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail and was kept to her business in the
drive. HOLIDAY CONNECTION , a forward factor outside the winner throughout, chased that one in a willing effort. TITANIC ROSE , two wide stalking the
pace down the backstretch, eased out to the three path on the far turn and offered a mild rally. CARIBBEAN FLOW hugged the inner rail, stalked the pace
and weakened. KISSES FOR HANNAH , bumped by BLUEGRASS ON TAP leaving the starting gate, circled the first turn three wide and gave way.
BLUEGRASS ON TAP bumped KISSES FOR HANNAH when coming out at the break, was three deep entering the backstretch and steadily retreated the
final three furlongs.

UNREQUITED LOVE dueled two wide outside ALWAYS SOMETHING, shook clear approaching the stretch, wandered outward near the sixteenth pole,
was corrected with right handed rousing and dug in tenaciously to prevail. BEHIND THE COUCH tracked behind the dueling leaders, eased out three wide
and found room leaving the far turn, moved up to have aim into the lane, made a grinding run outside winner and just missed. LUCRE settled inside off the
contested pace, angled out near the three eighths pole and was put to a ride, circled five wide around the second turn but could only generate a mild
response. ALWAYS SOMETHING disputed the pace inside the winner, stayed willingly to upper stretch and faded. TAM CHAR , three wide and outside a
rival early on, pursued the dueling leaders past the three eighths, failed to kick on while four wide past the three sixteenths and weakened.

MONKEY'S MEDAL settled early, angled out leaving the half mile marker and was put to pressure four wide, steadily gained under a hustling ride past the
quarter pole, sustained under a drive to take command near the sixteenth pole, kicked clear and was taken in hand through the final strides. FIND YOUR
BOAZ edged up nearing the five eighths then bid between foes with a half mile remaining, saw the leader kick back clear into the far turn, gave hard chase
and found more between runners to get the place bob. TALENTED DR. B quickly went clear and secured the inside, took pressure past the half mile
marker, shook back clear leaving the three eighths pole, remained clear under asking into the lane, could not resist the winner in mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. ALWAYS FORGIVEN lost ground four wide pursuing the pace, dropped in a bit near the far turn, shifted back out in the drive and continued with
interest. SHAKA STYLE saved ground and faded. NOVA BOY , three wide with early pursuit, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths pole.
DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE prompted the pace three wide, faltered leaving the far turn, was eased from the head of the lane then walked off.

LIKE ME OR NOT stalked the pace while far off the inner rail, moved up four deep turning for home, closed steadily and was up at the wire. TAKE ME
HOME , bumped by CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST leaving the starting gate, raced three deep around the first turn, advanced outside RAVENEL to challenge
for the lead leaving the backstretch, dueled the final quarter mile and just missed in a game effort. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST came out at the break,
showed speed along the inner rail, dropped back leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail through the stretch and showed a mild, late gain.
RAVENEL made a two wide bid for the lead on the backstretch, dueled to the stretch, weakened and her rider dropped his whip near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM prompted the pace outside the leader, drew alongside into the far turn, dueled and gained a slim lead near the three sixteenths, was
urged clear nearing the lane then widened under a solid drive. CAIRO QUEEN sped to the front, set a pressured pace towards the rail, dueled from the far
turn to the three sixteenths, kept on willingly and saved the place. BODES SUNSET , bumped early, saved ground early, angled out near the half mile
marker, circled four wide into the lane and had a mild response. GRECIAN DANCER was steadied soon after the break, saved ground while well off the
pace, continued inside into the lane, altered out near the sixteenth pole and had a mild kick. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY , bumped and in tight between foes
after a furlong, saved ground in mid pack but lacked a solid response. LOOKIN FOR CANDY , bumped early, chased a contested pace three wide, stayed in
range to upper stretch then faded.

BLUEFIELD chased two wide, angled out mid turn, circled three wide with momentum into the lane, sustained nicely under left handed asking, forged to
command inside the sixteenth pole and was edging away at the wire. PRIME LIME quickly went clear, set the pace towards the inside, was under a drive
holding the lead past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. GOLD AND STRIKE broke slowly, was hustled along around the turn, came three wide
for the drive and rallied. MY LOVELY GIRL lagged back early, angled out five wide for the drive and had belated action. MISCHIEFS MODEL , away alertly
along the inside, was urged along past the three eighths but failed to keep pace. JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT rushed up early, chased the leader two wide,
remained a presence to the sixteenth pole then gave way.

Footnotes
MCLUCY saved ground around the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, eased out to the three path entering the far turn, closed outside horses
in the stretch, led late and edged clear. HICKORY MADE prompted the pace two wide, gained a short lead mid way on the far turn and weakened late.
LADY TIZMO sped to the early lead, angled in approaching the first turn, hugged the inner rail setting a pressured pace and weakened. BULLETS LADY
stumbled badly at the break, circled the far turn, floated five wide leaving the far turn and rallied outside foes. BROADWAY TROUPER raced in the two path
down the backstretch and weakened. LADY PERRY lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the far turn and gave way. CAN I EVER , jostled at the
break, was checked in tight quarters entering the first turn.
