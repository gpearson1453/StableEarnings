Footnotes
FINDING MISCHIEF raced two wide around the first turn then took the inside position and tracked in range of the early leaders, waited patiently around the
final turn, launched a rail bid at the top of the lane, took command in the upper stretch and finished going away. LORD DARNLEY rated not too far back in
early stages, picked up the pace four wide with three furlongs left to run, roused five wide into the lane, stayed on with response and finished second best.
BYE BYE DAVID raced two wide around the first turn then settled off the pace, given cue three wide heading into the upper stretch and steadily edged up
closer through the lane. STAR DEPUTY rated off the pace then launched a rail bid top of the lane, ranged up closer at the furlong marker then finished
evenly. BACKCHAT broke out and bumped a couple times with rival at the start, rated not far back through the backstretch, began to pick up the pace then
steadied at the three eighths pole, hustled along four wide into the lane and had no late kick. JOHNNIE GOT JETS broke sharp and set the pace through
the backstretch, repelled bids around the far turn then got collared by the winner in the upper stretch and gave way. DUEL FUEL was allowed to through
early stages, was ridden along three wide entering the far turn and failed to kick on. HILLBILLY got bumped at the start then raced wide into the lane and
never threatened. HE AIN'T NO SAINT raced five wide around the first turn, rated in range to the far turn, ranged up to threaten near the five sixteenths pole
then failed to sustain bid in the lane. LINGUIST settled and saved ground, went four wide into the lane and failed to menace. JUSTICE WARRIOR was
forwardly placed into the backstretch, loomed a threat at the quarter pole then came up empty in the lane. HALFWAY RIGHT staked the early pace then
retreated midway around the final turn.

Footnotes
TOOLEGITTOQUIT steadily edged up closer through the backstretch then poked a head out in front at the three eighths pole, cleared on top then saved
ground into lane, stayed sharp in response and drew off. BLAZINONBAYOU bobbled at the start the raced in contention of the early lead, could not move on
with eventual winner past the three eighths pole but stayed on with response, got bumped by ASPROPODIA late on the turn and came out wider, kept on
gamely and dug in for place. J D'S VISTA settled in the opening quarter then edged up three to four wide midway around the turn, got brushed past the
quarter pole and carried out wider entering the lane, ran on through the lane and secured a share. ASPROPODIA raced in range up the inside, went two
wide at the quarter pole and raced in tight quarters, bumped with BLAZINONBAYOU late turn then weakened. YES IT'S FREE hustled along two wide
through early stages, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a needed rally in the lane. ALLSYSTEMSAREAGO set a pressured pace through the
backstretch, got headed at the three eighths pole and steadily faded. RUBYINTHESTARS showed response in the opening quarter then quickly dropped
back. KOZY VILLAGE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DOMINEERING quickly established the lead and set the pace by a comfortable margin through the backstretch, roused for more turning for more,
responded and held clear under a driving finish. STARSHIP MISHKA was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, picked up the pace
entering the far turn, hustled along four wide into the lane, stayed on with response and got up late for place. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY tracked the pace
inside through the backstretch, saved ground and headed in pursuit leaving the far turn, sustained a steady two wide bid through the lane and got edged out
late for place. KATZ A DREAM rated off the second flight going through the backstretch, coaxed two wide around the final turn then shifted out five wide for
the drive and had a mild improve. UPTOWN QUEEN was unhurried racing in the back, saved ground into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. RED
WIND tracked the pacesetter through the backstretch, remained in contention around the final turn then faded in the lane. BRODY'S HONOR went three
wide around the first turn then settled off the early pace, was ridden along three wide around the far turn and failed to move on. GREGS POSSE stalked the
pacesetter, went two wide around the final turn then emptied out in the lane.

GOLDEN JUAN raced in pursuit off the clear leader to the turn, edged up closer then launched a three wide bid at the quarter pole, battled with ROMAN
POET in the upper stretch, cleared on top at the eighth pole, dug in gamely, held off the bid from DESERT RULER and held firm. DESERT RULER was
ridden along into the turn, shifted out and hustled up along the outside entering the upper stretch, ranged up to threaten GOLDEN JUAN in the final furlong,
was solid in response but had to settle for second best. HEY PORTER tracked the pace to the turn, hustled up and got carried out wide turning for home,
stayed on with response then angled in at the eighth pole and held show. YES I'M A BEAST chased the early pace, launched a wide bid turning for home
and needed more for serious impact. ROMAN POET was ridden a long in contention around the turn, launched a rail bid heading into lane, battled with the
winner in the upper stretch then came up empty in the final furlong. LAKI LIO sprinted to a clear lead, got collared leaving the turn and tired in the drive.

OFFICIATING hustled along in steady pursuit, was set down three wide for the drive, took a slim lead at the eighth pole then dug in gamely under firm
pressure and kicked clear. PAPETU got bumped back at the start, raced off the pace in the opening quarter pole then circled up three wide to race in
contention at the quarter pole, raced up close with a furlong left to run, could not reach the winner but stayed on with solid response and cleared second
best. DARK TIMBER applied pace pressure to EXCHANGE DAY through the backstretch, vied for the lead around the turn, battled back in the upper stretch
then steadily weakened in the final furlong. EXCHANGE DAY set a pressured pace through early stages, dueled inside around the turn, fought back to the
eighth pole then had no late kick left in reserve. GO MIKE got bumped inward at the start, remained reserved in the back then swung four to five wide into
the lane and never threatened. ALABAMA SLAMMER chased in range through the backstretch then failed to sustain bid midway around the turn. EL SOCIO
hopped at the start then bumped with rival and steadied, raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. FULMINI showed response in opening
stages then dropped back.

the backstretch, battled into the upper stretch then came up tired in the final furlong. BREAKTHROUGH chased the top flight in the opening quarter then

Footnotes
VALID EXCHANGE tracked the early pace along the inside, shifted out and launched a bid at the quarter pole, roused five wide into the lane, moved up to
challenge CURRENT HOPE in the deep stretch, dug in determinedly under pressure and drove by late. CURRENT HOPE vied for the lead with FOSTER
HOPE into the turn, shook free near the five sixteenths pole, hustled along four wide into the lane, fought back when challenged by the winner in deep
stretch then got overtaken in final stages. FRANKIE Z was reserved in the back, responded two wide in the upper stretch and rallied for a share. QUICK
STEP ED raced off the early pace, went five wide into the lane, moved out wider, edged up closer and just missed show. SIXTY ONE raced off the top two
flights around the turn, stayed on three wide into the lane then gave way in the final furlong. JUST LIKE MIKE raced up close three wide through early
stages then weakened near the quarter pole. UNION GAP saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. UNCLE PIP chased four wide into the lane
and failed to move into close contention. FOSTER HOPE vied for the lead inside of CURRENT HOPE through the backstretch then failed to match strides
past the five sixteenths pole and dropped back.
