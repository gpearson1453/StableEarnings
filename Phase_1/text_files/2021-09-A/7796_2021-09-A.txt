Footnotes
LINDA'S NEKIA stalked the top pair down the backstretch, took command through the far turn, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. MY FRIEND
LINUS was allowed to settle off the early pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole, slowly closed in through the stretch and just missed in a
game effort. KION broke to the outside sharply to begin, pressed the early leader and weakened through the drive. SINCERE MAN was off slowly, settled
towards the back of the pack early, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and never was a factor. MISTER MISTER showed good
speed from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TONE showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace, was challenged near the half mile pole by Jaquavious, dug in around the far
turn and edged clear late to prove best under strong encouragement. JAQUAVIOUS was bumped at the break, tracked the leader in the early stages, made
a bid to press the leader near the half mile pole and was out finished in the drive to finish second best. FARCICAL settled off the early pace, raced four wide
into the upper stretch and had not enough. NOTHIN REALLY was bumped soundly at the break, dropped back early and never was a factor.

RED HOT MESS pressed the early pace, took command through the far turn, raced well clear through the stretch under steady pressure and raced in hand
in the latter stages. GOLDEN EFFECT settled off the early pace, moved up five wide at the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. TRIPLE
TIARA was slow early on, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and showed good late interest. BLUEBERRY INDYGO showed
good speed from the inside and weakened in the drive. REIGN ON AND ON was unhurried early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late
response. I'M A CUTIE was forwardly placed to lay up close early and tired readily.
