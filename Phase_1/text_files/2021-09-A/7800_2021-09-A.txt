QUEEN'S MISSION broke on top, showed the way in hand, was let out leaving the bend, responded to mostly hand urging in the lane and was much the
best. GUEST IN MY HEART was rated just off QUEEN'S MISSION, roused on the turn, was under a drive in the stretch but no match for the latter.

Footnotes
AUNT STELLA soon had the advantage, set a pressured pace from inside, was all out through the stretch and kept AROSE FOR LYLA at bay. AROSE
FOR LYLA was a step slow at the break, progressed from outside, angled in beside AUNT STELLA with two furlongs left, fought gamely through the lane,
did not have enough left but was easily second best. CESSO vied for the lead just outside AUNT STELLA, did not keep up two wide on the bend, swung out
some for the stretch run, began to flatten and gradually lugged in under right-handed urging. CHARLO chased from just off the inside, advanced from inside
upper stretch, leveled off the final furlong and altered outside CESSO nearing the wire. DIAMONDS AND BOOTS chased from inside, gained a striking
position along the rail on the bend, moved out to the middle of the track at the top of the lane and gave way. TIME BREAK was an early factor three wide
but gave way on the turn.

CREAL DREAMER stalked the pace from between horses, went for the lead two wide on the bend, gained the advantage midstretch then gradually opened
up while kept to a drive to the waning yards. INSIDE THE CIRCLE soon had a clear lead, was challenged on the turn, put to a drive leaving that bend, could
not hold back CREAL DREAMER the last eighth but proved easily second best. BONNIE DANCES in contention early from outside, progressed three wide
on the bend to take over third then could only maintain his position the last quarter mile. TEARS ON A RIVER angled outside B G ATTACK on the turn,
came four wide into the lane and had no late bid. WAVE THE GOLD failed to menace in a wide trip. B G ATTACK raced in the second flight between rivals,
did not keep up into the bend, angled to the inside and continued to fade. ABOVE NIKE ducked outward after the start, broke through the fence, losing his
rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into ABOVE NIKE'S start but no action taken after their review.

Footnotes
MIAS MOONBEAM advanced from outside, was four wide taking the turn, angled in slightly upper stretch, took the advantage, was clear inside the last
furlong and held GONZO at bay under steady handling. GONZO lost ground three to five wide through the bend, surged the final furlong, was too late but
got up for second. DEANO pressed the early pace, improved position three wide on the turn, altered out when his path narrowed at the top of the lane and
was the gap on the weakening MIAS MOONBEAM late. CHERNYAHOVSKIY in midpack early, was two to four wide through the bend and found best stride
belatedly deep stretch. STUMP forced out some at the start, was taken up and bobbled some behind CHERNYAHOVSKIY leaving the chute, rushed up
between rivals to gain the lead midway on the backstretch, was challenged from both sides on the turn and gradually wore down from inside for the stretch
run. BEHIND ENEMY LINES was widest taking the bend and had no significant stretch bid. ARCH FLYER broke on top, was overtaken midway on the
backstretch, had the rail on the turn and gave way for the drive. The rider of STUMP loved an objection alleging interference from CHERNYAHOVSKIY just
aftef the break. After their review, the stewards' did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
MEETMEINSTLOUIE soon had the lead, lengthened command along the rail on the bend, was under a drive in the lane, began to wear down the last eighth
but held on under steady handling. TWO MORE TIMES chased from between horses, progressed two wide on the bend, moved clear for second from inside
rivals in the lane and drifted out as she closed the gap on the leader deep stretch. LA GUERRERITA veered out to avoid PRINCESS MANDII near the
five-furlong marker advanced three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, steadily progressed and caught LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS for third.
LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS jostled with PRINCESS MANDI and briefly with SHE'S A BIT START while in tight quarters shortly after entering the main track,
took over third four wide on the bend, floated out further for the drive and leveled off. SHE'S A BIG STAR was bumped shortly after entering the main track,
advanced from inside but gave way on the turn. MIKE'S LADY bumped with PRINCESS MANDII at the break, altered to the outside leaving the chute, raced
widest through the bend and passed a few tired ones in the stretch. ABBMAR helped prompt the early pace, improved position just outside
MEETMEINSTLOUIE on the turn then gave way from between horses in the lane. UNEEKY in midpack early between rivals, faded four wide on the bend.
PRINCESS MANDII bumped with MIKE'S LADY at the start, jostled with LITTLEBITOFBLUESKYS when caught in tight quarters after leaving the chute,
clipped ABBMAR'S heels near the five-furlong marker and fell. There was a stewards' inquiry into PRINCESS MANDII'S fall at the five-furlong pole but no
action was taken after their review.

Footnotes
RACETOTHEFINISH pressed the early lead from just outside, drifted out slightly upper stretch, took the advantage nearing the sixteenth marker, edged
ahead and held on under steady handling. INDICIA chased from outside, lost ground five wide on the bend, moved to the inside entering the stretch, closed
well but was too late. COWGIRL KIMMIE forwardly placed between horses, lost ground four then five wide through the turn and rallied belatedly the last
furlong. MARYS LAST SONG was sent to prompt the pace between rivals, fanned four wide into the lane and also found best stride too late. TIZ HOPPIN
soon moved clear, had the rail on the bend, floated out some for the drive and gradually wore down deep stretch. LOUIE P progressed two wide on the turn,
angled out some for a clear path upper stretch, took over third but leveled off in the waning yards. WAY TOO SMARTE showed little.

D' YANK advanced from inside to vie for the early lead, battled in the lane and slowly edged ahead inside the last eighth. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER
prominent between rivals, went for the lead on the bend, battled outside D' YANK in the stretch, slowly yielded the final furlong but lasted for the place.
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE made a small leap from the gate, helped press the early pace, was blocked on the turn, angled out widest midway on the bend, lost
further ground entering the stretch, closed well, was too late but clearly best of the others. TWO BIT KID displayed early speed between rivals, did not keep
up two wide on the bend, drifted out some upper stretch, was straightened but continued to yield. POCKET PLAYER soon trailed, saved ground and had no
late bid. STALLONE pressed from outside, angled in some leaving the quarter pole, did not keep up into the lane, was steadied when TWO BIT KID came
close upper stretch and continued to give way.
