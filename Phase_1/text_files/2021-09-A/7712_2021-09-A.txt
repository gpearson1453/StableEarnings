SHIP IT RED tracked just off the leaders four wide in early stages, steadily advanced on the leaders three deep racing into upper stretch, wrested the
advantage in late stages to prevail under firm encouragement. SKIPPY'S STRIKE tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted out four
wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while edging a rival for the place honors. PLANE TALK, urged inside a rival disputing the pace
from the outset, edged forward in upper stretch but was collared in late stages. SOUL READY settled last along the inside, angled out five wide in upper
stretch and continued with a mild bid. AMANOFMYSTATURE, slow to gather stride, was prompted to track off the first flight along the inside racing into the
turn and faded into upper stretch. TAKE ME UP BRADY angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival from the outset into the turn and gave way
midstretch. RACE TIMES OMITTED PENDING REVIEW

Footnotes
FIRE EXTINGUISHER, off a step behind the leaders, was hustled up the rail to dispute the pace inside foes, shook clear racing into upper stretch and
widened late under pressure. JOHNNY UP tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the bend, shifted three deep in the lane and
continued with interest to edge rivals for the place honors. WESTA WAVERLY broke sharply, pressed the pace between foes through the backstretch into
the turn and weakened in the drive. GOLDEN GULLEY tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight, dropped out least nearing the lane, angled to the
rail racing through the stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. J J'S WILDCAT tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, tipped out
racing into upper stretch, then was held up losing some position when caught in tight quarters late. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY joined the pace three wide in the
opening stages, drifted out nearing the lane and soon gave way.

Footnotes
CHAMPS SUCCESS angled inwards to track just off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three deep nearing the far turn to gain
terms with the leaders, pressed the issue between foes in that path through the second bend to upper stretch and edged clear under pressure. FAKE
SOLUTION was rated off the second flight between foes in early stages, split foes three wide to bid inside the leaders racing into upper stretch and edged a
rival for second. OXWOOD, caught in tight quarters just after the break, was reserved last to the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and
continued to make a mild gain. TOUR THE WORLD tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to terms with the first flight
four wide racing into the far turn, then flattened out between foes in the drive. SQUARED STRAIGHT, urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage to the first turn, dueled for command through the far turn into upper stretch and gave way. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK was urged prompting a
rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes into the far turn and gave out nearing the lane. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY angled to the inside
racing to the first turn to track just off the first flight under light reserve but faded early.

SOMEONE SAID SO, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, disputed the issue on a narrow advantage between foes into the turn,
turned back the challenge of BERRY GOOD racing past midstretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. HOTASAPISTOL, in touch with the
pacesetter three wide between foes tracking that rival into the bend, proved no match nearing the stretch but continued well enough to edge a rival for the
place honors late. BERRY GOOD, caught in tight quarters at the start, recovered quickly while angling sharply to the prompting the pacesetter into the turn
but weakened in late stages. FULL OF GRACE tracked off the first flight along the inside and continued evenly into the lane while proving no real threat.
EVEN PANDURA, urged to a forward placing four wide in the opening quarter, steadily faded racing into the turn. SARJENALLI dropped out early.

BAILDON, rated outside foes tracking the leaders into the first turn, pulled her way to the lead three deep midway through the backstretch, shifted to the
inside on the far turn disputing the issue inside a rival, turned back a rival's challenge nearing the lane and held sway to the end under firm encouragement.
QUALITY CHROME was rated outside foes to the backstretch, continued three wide on the far turn, angled inside foes entering the stretch and proved best
of the others. GOLDIE'S DELIGHT tracked the pace outside foes to the backstretch, continued three wide into the lane and finished evenly late. SURELY A
LEGEND sped to the lead angling to the rail on the first turn, lost the advantage racing into the backstretch, switched outside foes to make a second effort
prompting the pacesetter into the second bend and faded in the drive. BRIAR THICKET, forwardly placed along the inside, lodged a brief bid between foes
and emptied out early. CLASSIC WHISKEY tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and faded early. DANIELLE'S DEAL, fractious in the

ROCKTIZWAY was urged disputing the pace inside rivals racing a bit off the rail in the opening stages, shifted inside on the turn, went clear in upper stretch
and held sway to the end maintaining a safe advantage under pressure. P CLUB tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, split foes three
wide nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to close the gap late. SIERRA HOTEL bobbled at the start, settled last while angling inside, swung
out five wide racing through the lane and found his best stride late to gain a share. HOTFOOT tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to
upper stretch and continued evenly. SUPERIOR'S BOY tracked off the first flight racing four wide into the turn but offered no closing bid. HURTS SO
GOOD, urged between foes prompting the pace, gave way racing into upper stretch. HAWKWOOD tracked off the second flight along the inside and faded
early. GIANT GAMBLE broke readily, made brief pursuit of the leaders in the four path racing into the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
I'M A SPECIAL STAR was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, forged clear racing through the turn while angling to the inside and
held sway to the end under steady pressure. BOSS HUGO tracked off the first flight three deep early, continued with a steady bid racing into upper stretch
and proved best of the others. POVERTY FLATS tracked the leaders along the rail from out of striking distance racing into the turn, tipped out in upper
stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share between foes. FRONT OFFICE tracked the leaders four wide, then three wide racing into upper
stretch but lacked the needed closing bid. AZUSA ST. tracked the leaders between foes racing to the turn and came up empty in the drive. PRICE TO PAY
dropped out last racing through the backstretch and failed to menace. HENRY O'HENRY, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the
outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER CONSTITUTION broke readily to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace racing into the first turn, responded when urged to dispatch that rival on
the far turn, went clear into the stretch under pressure and held sway on a diminishing margin to the end while shifting out late. QUANTUM LEAP, unhurried
outside foes racing four wide to the backstretch, made steady progress three deep on the far turn and closed the gap on the winner through the stretch while
failing to gain even terms. FLASH OF PROMISE shifted inwards to split foes racing into the backstretch to make sharp progress after a half, was urged to
advance between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. MISTER K tracked the pace between foes in the opening half, angled inwards on
the far turn, then shifted four wide racing through the lane in an even effort. SOUL COAXING settled last to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing into
the lane but made no impact. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper
stretch. KHAKI JACK angled to the inside early and soon dropped out.
