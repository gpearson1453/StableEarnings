Footnotes
SENORADIABLO settled off the pace, rallied inside on the turn, shifted out, got a head in front in the upper stretch and inched away under left handed
urging. BOLD REY dueled two wide to the second turn, drew off for a clear lead, responded when challenged, went willingly to the wire and was outfinished
in a good effort. SEMI SWEET trailed the field in a steady effort and was along for show. MS SALLY saved ground in an even effort and was not a threat.
RED NOVA was hustled along, dueled inside, tired on the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

BREWERY GULCH set a pressured pace, inched clear in the upper stretch and held under urging. MANCUSO AT THE MIC rallied between horses on the
turn, went four wide entering the stretch, bid willingly, didn't have enough late and finished second best. DOUBLE DOWN BROWN pressed the pace, fell
back in the upper stretch, continued willingly and held for show. BODEGA was void of early speed, saved ground, advance inside on the turn and closed
well. SOLEROCKER pressed the pace while racing inside, fell back on the turn, came again, hung late and lost position. ROUSING RUBBLE was not a
factor. TIGER'S SONG was outrun. EL PATRON JET pressed the pace four wide, dropped back into the turn and gave way. Hand timed.

second. HERZEN lacked a rally in an outside trip and failed to menace. HAVE A LIL PEPPER showed speed to the turn and flattened out. BECKHAM

Footnotes
OUR LIZZY LOU pressed the pace while racing along the rail, shifted out on the turn, closed steadily and wore down RUN FOR BELLE to get up in the final
strides. RUN FOR BELLE set the pace to the final strides and was outfinished in a game effort. FAITH IN EXCESS pressed the pace between horses to the
turn, fell back, leveled off and was all out for show. FICTIONAL lagged early, rallied five wide on the turn, bid and hung. MERRY MARIE was not a factor.
TWIRLY GIRL led early, showed speed to the turn and gave way. IN IT FOR LIFE showed speed to the turn and stopped. Hand timed.

NO SUPAH FOR YOU broke slowly, rushed to contention, pulled away in the upper stretch and extended the lead under urging. PRIVATE JOKE broke
slowly, advanced inside, angled out for the drive, bid, hung and was all out for place. THIRTY SECONDS OUT stalked the pace, lacked the needed late
response and settled for show. PERFECT SURPRISE set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. BRAVE HELIOS lagged
early, went wide in the drive and improved position. RED CHARGER pressed the pace while racing along the rail and stopped into the turn. MONTANA
JACK went wide in the drive and passed a tiring rival. DIMERA stopped into the turn and was vanned off. Hand timed.
