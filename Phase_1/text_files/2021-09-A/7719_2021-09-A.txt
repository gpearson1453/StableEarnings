PATSY'S BIG GIRL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin down the backstretch, held through the turn, then lasted under steady
pressure. ON A TOUR tracked the pace, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and closed
the gap on the winner late. JOYFUL PRAISE well placed, looped four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. BEARS
BREECHES mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, weakened and held a share. TAILADIOS allowed to settle,
looped three and four wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and improved her position. BUST OUT LADY was no factor. PRAIRIE

Footnotes
TOTAL DISTRACTION set a pressure pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then drove clear late. SOUPER BOOM bumped at
the start, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner and held the
place safe. JINGLE BELLS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed
the place. HATS OFF TOO YOU vied for the early lead on the outside, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. ECHO
ALPHA SIX well placed and three wide, angled in to the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and evened out. BUSCH LATTE ran evenly.
ABANDONED improved position. SUPER STRIKE well placed and outside, held position four wide through the turn, then had no rally. DIAMANT was never
involved.
