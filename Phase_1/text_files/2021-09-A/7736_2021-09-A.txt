Footnotes
LA CUBANA took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and was kept alert in the
stretch. AIM'S JUBILEE chased and improved off the rail on the turn, raced hemmed in through the upper stretch but recovered stride a sixteenth away to
take the nod for second under the wire. MAY MAYS CASTLE pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back on the turn and was nipped
from second under the wire. A BLONDE THING gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and finished well. WAGER WORTHY chased inside and
raced at the rail on the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and ran evenly through the lane. PRINCESS HALO hesitated leaving the gate and raced well
back from early contention, angled to the eight path rounding the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. HOOK THE CHAIN gave only distant chase and
saved ground on the turn. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS engaged in close early chase inside then faded at the rail on the turn. IHEARTRAINACOMN was not
a factor.

RULING settled off the early pace then gave chase from the five sixteenths pole, closed the gap off the rail on the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and
edged clear the final yards. ZAINO BOYZ was hustled clear and angled to the inside then rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole,
rounded the turn at the rail, dug in under steady handling into the lane but was headed mid-stretch and relented later yards. CASH FOR THE SOUL chased,
raced in the four path of the turn, ran evenly to late stretch then flattened nearing the wire. GAMING JACK chased off the rail, drifted toward the head of the
lane and finished well to pass rivals. BRIAN'S AVENUE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and finished evenly. KYLE chased, raced near the rail on
the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. EPIC WEST never factored and ran in the five path of the turn.

MOLLY BOLTS saved ground racing well back from early contention, started a steady bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five
path and got up in the final yards. I'M EXCEE saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn,
came between horses in deep stretch and got up for second under the wire. MISSPOTOFGOLD stalked the early pace two deep then took over nearing the
half mile pole, came under pressure at the quarter pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, was met into the stretch, dug in under steady handling but
weakened in the final yards and fell past the wire. CONGA IN PARIS saved ground through the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran in the
four path of the far turn, raced evenly to deep stretch but flattened stride nearing the wire. COWGIRL NIGHT set the early pace inside, was met nearing the
half mile pole and gave chase through the backstretch, recovered near even terms into the stretch but dropped back with a slipped saddle a sixteenth away
and fell over Misspotofgold past the wire. RAINBOW RIVER raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SHO U
RIGHT settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded from that point. SPRITZ OF SPRITE raced off the pace in
the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole then weakened on the far turn. The Steward posted the inquiry before making this
race official.

Footnotes
RARE ONE pressured the pace and ran in the three path of the turn, dug in to take a slim lead mid-stretch and was inching further ahead nearing the wire.
GRANDMA SCHNUR chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and dueled gamely to to deep stretch before relenting; grudgingly. BRONX PRINCESS
set a pressured pace, ran near the rail on the turn, gave up the lead past the eighth pole and weakened. RED LIL SHIPMENT gave chase, raced in the
three path of the turn and showed little further. TAPIZAR GIRL chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path then weakened.
CROOKED WAYS was sluggish into stride, chased through the backstretch and saved ground on the turn. JASIRA gave chase, ran in the four path of the
turn and was not a factor. This race was hand timed.
