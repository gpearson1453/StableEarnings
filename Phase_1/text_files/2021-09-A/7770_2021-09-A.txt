Footnotes
ABUELO NUNO dueled for the lead on the outside up the long backstretch, began to edge ahead while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and held that margin to the wire while mildly drifting in the stretch. SYMBOLIST pressed the pace between horses through the opening half mile,
navigated the turn from the two path, and chased the winner home, finishing evenly. EGOMANIAC bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
raced off the pace in the early going, moved up to chase the leaders from the three path around the turn, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, cut
in with a furlong to go and was outkicked from there. DOM CAETANO (ARG) bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dropped back to trail
the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and was not a threat. NED CHRISTIE dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, began to retreat entering the stretch and continued to tire from there. DUE TO A
TIMER MALFUNCTION, NO TIME IS AVAILABLE FOR THE HALF MILE MARKER.

Footnotes
CHISLER was close up early, settled back to chase behind the tracking flight near the five eighths, chased the leading trio in the three path on the turn,
swung three wide into the lane, drifted out significantly from there but nonetheless rallied under a drive, found his best in the final sixteenth and got up in
time. TALKTOEACHOTHER broke in and bumped LITTLE TOOT in the opening strides, nonetheless soon led, was engaged by IRISH TUFF into the turn,
vied inside that foe around the bend while racing in the two path, shrugged off IRISH TUFF in upper stretch, carried a clear lead through midstretch, drifted
out late and was nailed in the final jumps. GOLD INCENSE tracked the pace between horses early, tracked the leading pair into the turn, saved ground
around the bend, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, chased TALKTOEACHOTHER in upper stretch under a drive, could not reel that foe in, flattened
out slightly late but held the show. IRISH TUFF stalked three wide early, engaged outside of TALKTOEACHOTHER into the turn, vied outside that foe
around the bend while racing in the three path, proved no match for TALKTOEACHOTHER into the lane, and flattened out. LITTLE TOOT was bumped by
TALKTOEACHOTHER in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, was pushed along near the five eighths but dropped back a few lengths, raced into
the turn in the rear flight outside of BLOOMING GARDEN, was urged in the five to six path around the bend, dropped to the inside in upper stretch, rallied
mildly and missed fourth narrowly. MAGA COUNTRY settled at the rear early, raced near the rear in the three path on the turn, floated into the six path for
the stretch run and lacked a rally. BLOOMING GARDEN settled at the inside of the rear flight, was driven in the three path at the rear on the turn, continued
under a drive inside in upper stretch, and never mustered a bid.

Footnotes
BETTER THINK TWICE saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position from the three path around the far
turn, launched a bold outside move nearing the quarter pole, quickly took over entering the stretch and drew off to the wire while drifting out late. POLITO
saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around around the far turn, raced into
traffic approaching the eighth pole, switched outside to find room, and gained ground to the wire while never threatening the winner. THIRSTY OWL pressed
the pace from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path around the far turn, led briefly entering the
stretch, was quickly overtaken by the eventual winner and chased that rival home, getting caught for place in the final strides. BEHAVIN MYSELF saved
ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the far turn and in upper stretch
and was outkicked in the final furlong. GOOD YEGG raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the two path and faded in the stretch. MYUDDERMAMASAPAINT chased the leader from the three path around the first
turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire from there.

BATTLE SCARS settled at the rear, continued patiently in the two to three path on the far turn, began to edge closer past the five sixteenths, swung six wide
into upper stretch, rallied well under a drive and took the lead in the final sixteenth. RICHIESGOTGAME chased the leader two wide around the clubhouse
turn, was keen outside of CLARESTOWN approaching the three quarter and took closer order, tracked the leader two wide down the backstretch, bid two
wide past the three eighths, engaged outside of NIP N TUCK near the five sixteenths, continued to bear down outside that foe in upper stretch, led near the
furlong mark, but was caught by BATTLE SCARS past the sixteenths and proved second best. NIP N TUCK soon cleared, set the pace inside, was
engaged near the five sixteenths by RICHIESGOTGAME and SMOKEY HARBOR to his outside, clung to a narrow lead in upper stretch, reluctantly ceded
the lead to RICHIESGOTGAME past the furlong mark, and flattened slightly late. SMOKEY HARBOR settled in second last through the clubhouse turn and
down the backstretch, bid three wide near the five sixteenths, attended the pace into the lane, but flattened out past the furlong mark. CLARESTOWN
chased the leader inside of RICHIESGOTGAME through the clubhouse turn, pulled to take closer order on the leader near the three quarters, raced at the
inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, saved ground in the pocket around the far turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed
finishing kick.

Footnotes
STORMINSIDE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and drew off to the wire, much the best. SPLASH FOR GOLD raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, angled in to
save ground around the turn, and gained ground mildly in late stretch, the best of the rest. SHANGHAI POINT pressed the pace on the outside in the early
going, dropped back to chase the leaders while saving ground around the turn, continued to chase the eventual winner down the lane and was outkicked in
the final furlong. WILLOW RIDGE raced inside off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and weakened on the rail late. TRE LEE
DIVINE raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and made no bid. DIDDLEY pressed the pace between
horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, gave way approaching the quarter pole and tired further
in the stretch.

DREAM KEEPER prompted the pace outside of STORM'S REFLECTION down the backstretch, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took
the lead near the three sixteenths, and cleared while ridden out. PHAROAH CAT tracked the leading pair down the back straight and in the two path on the
turn, was driven in four wide in upper stretch, could not reel in DREAM KEEPER but kept on willingly for the place. CLYDE'S GREEN GO chased the
leading trio down the backstretch, continued well off the leading trio in the three path on the turn, floated six wide into the lane, rallied late under a drive
though never threatened the top two. POQUITO MAN dwelt at the start and trailed down the backstretch, took closer order while saving ground around the
turn, was driven four wide into the lane, and sustained his rally between horses. KINGSBURRY ATTACK settled at the rear of the main pack inside, saved
ground around the turn, was driven in the three path in upper stretch, and chased on evenly. COWBOYS FEATHER broke outward, was hard to settle early,
raced at the rear of the main group outside of KINGSBURRY ATTACK, chased in the six path on the turn, was driven six wide from upper stretch, and
lacked the needed kick. STORM'S REFLECTION was placed on the lead, set the early pace while prompted by DREAM KEEPER to his outside, continued
on a pressured pace in the two path on the turn, was headed near the three sixteenths, and weakened inside. THE STEWARDS PERFORMED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START OF POQUITO MAN. UPON REVIEW, THEY MADE NO CHANGE.

BACKSIDE BEAUTY hit the gate leaving it, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began
his bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, pulled clear with a furlong to go and won going away. NICE AND TRUE
tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled gamely down the lane, could
not go with the eventual winner and just held the place. ME TOO MO dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle from the
two path around the turn, was caught with a furlong to go and finished well, just missing second. GODSGIFT trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn, and continued to gain ground on the outside in late stretch. OZETTE pressed
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back slightly from the three path while racing around the turn and finished evenly. COOKIN ROSES
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked from the rail in the stretch. GO STORMIN
GIRL raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly while never threatening. BOBBIE TOO
TOO was fractious in the gate prior to the race, broke well and led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around
the turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
YOU SPLIT TENS tracked the leader inside early, chased the leader two wide on the turn, bid three wide into the lane, took a narrow lead midstretch, and
drove clear from near the sixteenth. SIMPLE LOGIC tracked the leading pair inside of Z U SOON early, improved position to chase the leader inside of YOU
SPLIT TENS past the seven sixteenths, bid on the leader between horses into the lane and was put in a little tight in upper stretch, battled on inside of YOU
SPLIT TENS until proving no match near the sixteenth mark, veered out sharply near fifty yards out, lightly bumped GIVIN UP NONE, and held a share of
the place. GIVIN UP NONE chased three deep down the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn, was pushed along near the five sixteenths and took
closer order to the leading line, swung five wide into the lane, kept on willingly to the finish and got up for a share of the place late despite being bumped late
by SIMPLE LOGIC. Z U SOON was forward in the opening strides but settled back to track the leading pair between horses, chased in the three path
between horses on the turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch, found his best nearing the sixteenth pole, rallied, but checked hard near fifty yards out
when SIMPLE LOGIC veered in. BEEALEA broke slowly and was awkward into stride, settled outside of FLASHY RICHIE in the rear flight, raced in the
three to four path on the turn, went to a drive nearing the quarter, swung five wide into the lane, and raced evenly late. DEMAND RANSOM was sent for
pace between horses, shook clear into the turn, set the pace in the two path around the bend, was confronted into upper stretch, remained in range inside to
the furlong mark and emptied out inside. FLASHY RICHIE settled at the inside of the rear flight, saved ground through the turn, was driven inside in upper
stretch, and lacked the needed rally. THE STEWARDS MADE AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN ADDITION THERE WAS AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF Z U SOON AGAINST THE RIDERS OF SIMPLE LOGIC AND GIVIN UP NONE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON
REVIEW, STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SIMPLE LOGIC FROM SECOND TO FOURTH FOR VEERING IN LATE AND CAUSING Z U SOON TO CHECK.
