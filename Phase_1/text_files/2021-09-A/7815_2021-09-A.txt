DOUBLE DOWN BROWN stalked the pace, was roused on the turn to challenge, closed under steady urging and wore down SILVERS BLING to get up
late. SILVERS BLING set the pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and yielded in the final strides. EZ RULER was void of early
speed, raced wide and improved position in an even effort. PAST LIFE saved ground to the turn, angled out and had no stretch response. ROUGE SUNSET
stalked the pace to the turn, tired and stopped. Hand timed.

WITHIN THE LAW was hustled along inside to press the pace, closed steadily, wore down BEAUTY BLACK and drew clear late. BEAUTY BLACK was in
tight at the start, set the pace to deep stretch and was outcosed to finish second best. LIEUTENANT MARGIE angled out in the upper stretch, drifted out in
the drive, lacked a rally and was along for show while no threat to the top two. SINCERE WARNING was in tight at the start, showed speed to the turn,
dropped back and faded through the stretch. ARIES was a bit fractious in the gate, broke slowly, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. CALIFORNIA
DREAMER raced outside in an even effort, lacked a bid and was never a threat. Hand timed.

Footnotes
GEORGIAN ROAD dueled inside, drew clear in the upper stretch and held well in a driving finish. NO SUPAH FOR YOU pressed the pace three wide, fell
back leaving the turn, continued willingly to the wire and earned place. OVER EZ lagged early, bid inside on the turn and closed well to get up for show.
VIDAKS BACK dueled two wide to the upper stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and lost position. KING LEBRON showed good early speed while racing
inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally. A NEW TREND hesitated at the start to be off slowly and failed to threaten
in an even effort. KEYSON pulled up and was vanned off. Hand timed.

CHIEFTAIN'S LAD dueled to the second turn, came in, drew off for a clear lead, drifted out in the drive under left handed urging and held under pressure.
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY stalked the pace while racing inside, was checked hard on the second turn, angled out to be wide in the drive and closed well in a
game effort. VICTORY LANE dueled two wide to the second turn, fell back, bid, hung late and held for show. CATS TOUCH stalked the pace, was carried
out on the turn and lacked the needed late response. GOLD TREASURE was void of early speed, was carried out on the turn and lacked a bid. QUETTA'S
IN CHARGE was void of early speed, raced wide, was carried out on the turn and showed little. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT moved up along the rail to challenge
for the lead entering the turn, fell back, clipped heels and lost his rider. Following a stewards' inquiry, CHIEFTAIN'S LAD was disqualified and unplaced for
causing interference on the turn. Hand timed.

WITH THATBEINGSAID was reluctant to load, assumed command on the turn, drew off and extended the lead while kept to task. OUT OF SPEIGHT came
out at the start, took command into the turn, led briefly, fell back and was no match for the winner. WAR MAIDEN was never far off the pace, put in a steady
effort and was along for show. SPICY SOMMELIER showed good early speed while racing inside, was taken back entering the turn, bid and hung.
CHARMINGKINDAGAL failed to threaten in an even effort. STEINWAY was not a factor. LOTSA LENA got away alertly, led early, dropped back and
steadily faded through the stretch. COPPER PEG raced wide and was outrun. Hand timed.
