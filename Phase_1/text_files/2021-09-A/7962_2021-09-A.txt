SUCCESSFULLY DONE set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid to shake clear on the turn, then drew off leaving the turn and then held sway late to
prove best under a drive. BROKEN JUSTICE chased the early pace four wide and came five wide into the drive and closed well late. SHIPSHAPE chased
the early pace three wide, came four wide into the drive and offered a mild late rally but needed more, bested rest. BLAZEN JUSTICE chased the early pace
on the inside, then eased off the rail and came four wide into the drive, angled out widest to offer a belated rally. PRINCE ACT was settled early and was in
between rivals at the three eighths pole, then was three wide by the quarter pole and offered no late rally. STAND AND SERVE pressed the early pace
three wide and weakened.

ALL LUCK prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to shake clear, then drew out leaving the turn and was kept to mild pressure to
prove best. ZING was allowed to settle while three wide on the backstretch, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the drive, was
finishing willingly when rider switched to left handed crop urging and ducked out sharply, then angled in losing a iron and held the place award late.
MARIAH'S FORTUNE was well placed early on the inside, then eased off the rail to make a bid splitting rivals by the quarter pole, but needed more in the
stretch while besting the rest. IGGY BIGS tracked the early pace and made a mild four wide bid on the turn but came up empty in the drive.
THISNAMEISOKAY broke in the air, then was four wide into the first turn, then settled five to six wide on the backstretch and tired. GIDDY UP ZOEY set the
pace on the inside and gave way on the turn.

well in the stretch when switching leads and edged away late under a drive. HEAVENLY HELLOS stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the
turn to take over nearing the quarter pole, then moved to the inside by the three sixteenths pole and was clear by the furlong marker but was headed by the

of a mild while staying on to best the rest. AUNT RUTH was rated early while two wide and weakened. BOURBON PRINCESS was six wide into the first
turn, chased the pace five wide and tired. PROTOMAGIC was four wide into the first turn, then was reserved early and came five wide into the drive and had

FIREBALL BABY stalked the early pace four wide, made a bid leaving the half mile marker and shook clear entering the turn, then drew off leaving the turn,
then was kept to mild pressure to prove much the best. PRETTY ASSETS was settled back early on the inside, then eased off the rail and was five to six
wide by the quarter pole, angled in by the furlong marker and rallied well to be second best. HITTHEFLOORRUNNING pressed the pace three wide and
then stalked the pace three wide by the quarter pole, shifted out five wide by the three sixteenths pole and faded, bested rest. EXPECT INDY chased the
early pace five wide and then was four wide by the quarter pole and weakened. APRIL'S NO FOOL was rated early then made a inside middle move to vie
for the lead nearing the half mile marker and then tired leaving the quarter pole. PEARL TIARA was rated between horses and four wide early and then
stopped. BREWSKY vied for the early lead inside of a trio while off the rail then folded after a half mile.
