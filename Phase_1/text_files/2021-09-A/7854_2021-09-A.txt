Footnotes
BLUE RIDGE RED moved up to contest the issue soon after the start while three wide, narrowly showed the way through the turn, headed late in the bend
and into the lane closest to the inside, battled back to edge away late in a determined effort. PRADO'S PRIORITY balked at loading, broke with the leaders,
pressed early in the turn off the inside, put a head in front late in the bend, continued to lead through upper stretch, lost back the advantage to the winner
past the furlong marker, could not match that one to the wire, saved the place. SCORING DRIVE in the second flight along the inside, continued to maintain
contact with the top two into the lane, getting to the runner up late. MY LITTLE LEO went one paced throughout while racing off the inside, lacked closing
response. ZOEY'S HIPPIE broke back off the lead pack, chased the dueling leaders early in the turn, began to fade before turning for home. LAST NATIVE
CAT remained back in failing to rally. SMART BATTLE broke back and was never a threat. SOLAR STAR off a step slow, was outrun while racing wide.

Footnotes
SIGN OF WAR broke sharp, sprinted clear soon after, dueled late in the turn and into the lane, fell back, lodged a brief second bid nearing the furlong
grounds, found more to be clear again at the wire. CPRIORITY forwardly placed early outside, moved up to join the winner from the outside late in the turn,
fell back off that one when straightened for home, lodged a brief second bid nearing midstretch, drifted out and could not keep pace, clear of the others.
SPRY CHARLIE last to leave, moved up to race in mid pack while in some traffic entering the turn, two path and clear into the lane, made little inroads on
the top two to the wire while saving the show. YOAKAM chased the winner early after breaking with that one, fell back in the run through the turn, went
evenly through the lane while gaining a bit late for the third spot. GYPSY'S SOULMATE within striking distance in the run up the backstretch, began to
weaken early in the turn. K T'S JILTED GROOM broke back and failed to menace. LUCKY BIG DADDY trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
CARIBE NIGHTS never far back, advanced to lodge a bid outside the leader in the turn, showed the way into the lane long drive to the wire, dug in late to
narrowly prevail. BIG ROJO fractious in tossing his rider in the post parade, reluctant to load, fell back off the pace, four wide into the lane, lodged a willing
rally down the middle of the strip to be gaining late. WILLIAM GUSTAVO forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch along the inside, fell back a bit off
the two leaders in the turn, lodged a late bid inside the winner, not enough for the top two in the final strides. BOURBON SKY broke a bit to the outside, off
the early pace and the inside, moved a bit closer three wide late in the turn, lacked a late punch to finish up evenly. REBEL MENACE broke back and failed
to menace. RUSSET MOON broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch, briefly dueled inside the winner turn, stopped in the drive to finish far back.

good determination to be up in time. NIN TO WIN settled off the pace, patiently handled far turn, advanced three wide and between foes into the lane under
clever handling, lodged a late bid, led a few jumps from the wire, nipped very late to miss. MIZZEN MONARCH vied early off the inside, stalked that same
leader in the run up the backstretch, took over late in the final turn, briefly clear past the furlong marker, could not last. NON BINDING settled off the pace
along the inside for six furlongs, moved out a bit for the drive, between foes midtretch, finished up evenly in lacking a significant closing response. BEYOND
D'ORO vied early while racing three wide, chased the issue the middle half, had little left for the stretch run. STREAMER last away, trailed most of the way,
made little impact. DARING DARIAN a pace factor along the inside for six furlongs, gave way through the stretch. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO

Footnotes
EL WARD forwardly placed early off the inside, advanced to challenge outside the leader before a half, dueled into and through the final turn, fell back past
the furlong marker, regathered and lodged a second bid late, kicked clear. ROCK ON COWBOY bothered slightly start, sprinted well clear soon after the
start, responded when challenged dueled the middle half, shook clear again nearing midstretch, challenged again by that same foe late, outkicked, clearly
second best. AMBASSADOR HOUSE broke out but sharply, raced within striking distance, raced outside, four wide turning for home, not match top two,
finished up best of the rest. P T'S FLASH lacked early foot, improved position off the inside, not enough for the show. GOTTATAKEHIMTO settled behind
the leaders, continued one paced, lacked a closing response in the drive. THIRSTY WIND remained back and was never dangerous. SCHEMER settled in
the main body early, had nothing for the drive. MISS MABELEE in the second flight off the inside, was finished after five furlongs. QUARTER MILE
FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CALABASH cleared to the inside past the wire the first time, dueled the middle half inside, disposed of that rival to be clear again into the straight, held the
runner up comfortably safe late while coming a bit late while still clear. MUFFIN NUTS in the second flight while just off the inside the opening half, dropped
inside and moved closer while saving ground through the second bend, could not get to the winner late while remaining along the inside. TIO BLAS lacked
early foot toward the inside, asked along and made a moderate advance second turn, three wide, brushed into the stretch, late acceleration to be up for the
show while closing the gap on the top two. PAYNT BATTLE chased the winner early, advanced and joined that one from the outside before a half, dueled
into the far turn, began to weaken turning for home, folded late to be caught for the show. WAYPOINT brushed start, settled off the pace, moved closer in
the far turn off the rail, faltered in the drive. SUNRISE KITTEN trailed early, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat. ATLANTIC
RULER in tight, shuffled back to be last away at the break, raced back, four wide turning for home, weakened. READY REDDING broke in, brushed, settled
in the second flight, began a steady fade just before a half.

Footnotes
GRILLIN settled in mid pack well off the inside, roused when turning four wide into the lane, engaged the leader inside the furlong grounds, wore that rival
down under firm handling. KEHRON'S CREED closest to the early pace, moved up to duel outside the early leader turn, showed the way into the stretch,
responded when challenged by the winner with less than a furlong remaining, proved stubborn to the end. CHARZEE BABY went one paced behind the
leaders, lacked a serious closing kick to finish best of the others. COOL SPRING broke on top, set the early pace inside, dueled through the turn while
remaining along the rail, faltered in in the drive. IRISH PRIORITY void of speed, dropped inside for the drive, remained back in failing to seriously menace.
MISS OCEAN EXPRESS broke back, lacked speed, five side into the lane, failed to rally. SWORN SILENCE last away, always outrun. MONEY INTHE
STARRS forwardly placed early, gave way turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
BIG MONEY MACHINE outrun early, continued back in the run up the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, tipped out for the drive, and finished
full of run to be clear at the end. STANDING MAN in the second group while racing off the inside, three wide into the lane, moved out slightly, roused while
widest, rallied up to be up for the place late, not a match for the winner. FRANK THE MAYOR within striking distance, advanced to press the issue into the
far turn, took over midway on that bend, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, caught late. ONE TIME GEM broke on top, closest to the early
leader, closed the gap on that one before a half, vied through the final turn and into the stretch, weakened the final furlong. JUST GUN IT chased early, fell
back the middle half, in some traffic into the straight, lodged a brief rebid a furlong out then faltered. CHAOSMOS in the main body early, moved a bit closer
midway, came up empty in the drive in lacking a further bid. SAVING ARGUMENT broke well, showed the way through the first turn, narrowly held the
advantage after a half, gave way when headed in the final turn. BAYOU JAM remained always back in failing to threaten. THREE EYED RAVEN was also
finished early. DUE TO TIMER BEING TRIPPED PREMATURELY. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TRAPPE THE CAT last to leave, lacked speed toward the inside, in some traffic while continued to save ground into the bend, moved out, four wide turning
for home, finished full of run down the middle of the strip to be up in time. ROARING QUINN with the pace from the start, dueled in the two path into and
through the turn, continued to alternate for the advantage past the furlong marker, held the advantage late, could not contain the winner, game for the
runner up spot. D'LADY FIRED UP set or forced the pace while along the inside, dueled with the runner up, gave ground grudgingly to the top pair late.
LIGHT AS A WHISPER within striking distance while racing outside, came up empty for the drive. GRACE'S VISION raced briefly forward along the inside,
began a steady fade early in the turn. TOSHITA FOREVER raced back off the pace, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. ST JOAN broke
back, trailed throughout in showing little.
