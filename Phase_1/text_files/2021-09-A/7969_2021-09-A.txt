well back came wide into the drive and finished well while never a threat to the winner. QUICKTRIP VAN chased the pace in the two path but could not
make up the needed ground. ROCKY JACK showed good early speed on the rail but tired through the stretch. MUCHO GIFTED came through along the
inside on the turn but had no stretch run. WILLY B stalked the pace in the two path but tired through the stretch.

R DUB broke well but was allowed to settle off the pace came through between rivals at the head of the lane and moved to the inside and was able to
outfinish Colonel Pike for the win. COLONEL PIKE showed good speed in the two path opened a good lead mid stretch but could not hold off the winner.
BAUDETTE BLIZZARD raced in the two path while off the pace and lacked a winning rally. UPPERCLASSMAN was pinched back at the start rushed into
contention along the inside got into tight quarters and then tired. DUN SOBER showed good early speed along the inside but had little left for the stretch run.
LITTLE NO WAY was away alertly but dropped back quickly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TOP OF THE PODIUM came three wide on the turn to get into contention and proved best through the stretch. FEAR THE FLASH showed good early
speed in t6he two path and was able to hold second. ORPHAN ANGIE was away very slow and was rushed and able to save the rail battled for the lead and
gamely held third. DIXIE CAT showed some early speed three wide but never mounted a rally. SEATTLE TWIST came five wide entering the stretch but did
not mount a rally. MYSTIC WIND was well back and moved to the inside and never mounted a rally. SWEET CAPRI raced in the two path in the middle of
the pack and never offered a rally. SILENT SURPRISE was six wide throughout and never a serious factor. BUTYOUCALLEDME was eased entering the
turn and walked off.
