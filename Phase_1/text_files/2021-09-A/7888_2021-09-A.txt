Footnotes
OLIVIA DARLING broke alertly, vied three wide, led on the turn, drifted in slightly at the top of the stretch and gamely remained clear. LITTLE MISS SASSY
dueled between rivals, was in a bit tight into the stretch, altered course but could not get by the winner. CENTER STAGE made a menacing four wide bid on
the turn then went evenly late. CHARDONNAY hustled inside to duel to the stretch and continued willingly. AIN'T SHE A PISTOL dropped back at the start
and trailed throughout. A claim of foul by the runner-up against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

FIFTY forced the pace three wide, led into the stretch and edged away driving. INSIDE RISK saved ground throughout, loomed a stretch threat but flattened
out in the final furlong. E J'S REVENGE moved clear inside early, was engaged on the turn then weakened in the stretch. PERFETTO dropped far behind
then closed the gap with some late energy. AMERICANO steadied along near the half mile pole, angled out soon after and faded. WON DOZEN BANKS
prompted the pace to the turn and gave way readily.

Footnotes
SOMETHINGANDCHANGE quickly sped to the front, repelled his challenger near the quarter pole and quickly drew off under moderate pressure. HEART
OF SAVINO prompted the winner to the final turn, tired but lasted for the place. WINE TO ROSES dropped far behind, advanced wide on the final turn,
moved inside rallying through the lane. AMUNET settled off the pace in the two path and lacked a response. CHALK HILL chased near midpack and failed
to make an impact. MAYBE IT'S TIME raced off the leaders and was never a factor. FIVE STAR PHIL well placed behind the pacesetters but gave way
readily. SHE'S MIZZEN BAGS was reserved off the leaders and weakened steadily.

LAMPLIGHTER JACK prompted the pace three then two wide, took over into the lane and held gamely with challengers from both sides. TANKERVILLE
advanced inside to the stretch, angled out, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. EQUAL JUSTICE angled inside early, rallied into the stretch with
a gradual gain. DAVID'S PROSPEC rated close up inside, moved out in the stretch and closed well. YOWZA YOWZA YOWZA outrun early, swung very
wide into the stretch closing the gap. CAPTAIN THUNDER settled off the pace, made a brief bid into the stretch then flattened out. SARASOTA BOY set a
measured pace inside then gave way through the stretch. OFFICER COUNTRY dropped back outside early and was always outrun. PAY THE KID trailed
early and was never in contention. ROARING RIVER forced the pace between rivals to the far turn and stopped. KAMEHAMEHA chased three wide early
and gave way.

outfinished. WHISPURRING KITTEN chased off the pace, moved very wide into the stretch and closed well. CATSOUTOFTHEBAG broke a step slowly,
angled out in the stretch and lacked a solid bid. FLYINGONTHEGROUND forced the pace three wide, led on the turn and into the stretch but tired slightly in

Footnotes
KIANG vied inside, lost the advantage on the turn but came again in the stretch and gradually moved clear. PURRS WELL advanced wide to the front
midway on the turn, led into the stretch but hung. THE FIRE WITHIN dropped back early then offered some late energy. LIL CHITU forced the pace, vied
between rivals on turn then weakened. CONFUSION chased inside, lacked room through the turn and flattened out. OULOG trailed early then passed tiring
rivals. FREUD WIND lacked speed in the two path and was never in contention. VIOLET'S BROTHER dropped back early and was always outrun.
