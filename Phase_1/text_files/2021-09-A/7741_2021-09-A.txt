Footnotes
MO REWARDS bumped with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, moved up outside the five-eighths pole then came under urging, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, was driven into the stretch in the two path under a right-handed crop, dropped back to the rail while gaining fast at the
three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop while making a bid outside the furlong marker, took the advantage into the final sixteenth then moved clear
under strong urging. WILD APPEAL was forced in by MAGICAL KNIGHT early then taken up some before being switched out, raced in third position under
a strong hand-ride, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong
marker, drifted in coming to the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead while losing the lead into the final sixteenth and was outfinished but clear for
the place. COASTAL CHAOS came out in front then was hustled, had the rider drop his hands early then take a light hold while carried in some, fell back
fast while put back to a vigorous hand-ride, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch under a left-handed crop then drifted out coming to the three-sixteenths, was switched to a right-handed crop before the furlong marker, remained on
his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and lacked the needed response while up for the show. MAGICAL KNIGHT
broke in then was hustled, angled in while going to the front and tightened it up on several foes, disputed the pace on the inside of DORSODURO, vied
along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a left-handed crop, lost the advantage while still on his inside lead outside the furlong marker and
tired. DORSODURO stood in the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, rushed up on the outside to dispute the pace, vied in the three path
on the turn, raced a bit greenly late on that bend, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BET broke in and
bumped with a foe, checked sharply when put in tight outside the five-eighths, moved out around the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the four path
and failed to respond.

Footnotes
BUBBLE ROCK tracked the pace just off the inside, was under a rating hold along the inside through the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
got roused at the three-sixteenths, rallied up the inside to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive getting geared down
inside the final sixteenth to the finish. VACCINE OF HOPE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and kept on to secure the place honors. NAY SAY (IRE) fractious in the gate prior to the start,
chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. SHE'S
STORMY brushed at the start by SEBAGO LAKE, who broke outwards, established the front and showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, tucked
inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just
inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. SIRIUS PRINCESS broke in at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the
quarter pole, cornered three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. OLD PHO hustled from the gate, chased four wide until tucked to the two path into
the turn, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. DETERMINED CHARM two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked
inside through the turn coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch and made no impact. SEBAGO LAKE
broke out at the start brushing SHE'S STORMY, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued four to five wide at the head of
the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NO QUE NO broke out and bumped REPO ROCKS then had that foe clip his heels, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was
asked at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch in the three path under a drive, took the advantage inside the furlong marker and prevailed under
strong urging. REPO ROCKS was bumped by the winner while last away then stumbled while clipping his heels, spotted the front a few lengths, settled off
the pace, moved up between horses with a half-mile to run, drafted two path to the inside on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, chased
inside under the crop in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the place. RISK PROFILE was hustled from the start, moved up
to contest the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper
stretch in the two path under a drive, lost the lead while drifting out inside the furlong marker and was outfinished then denied the place while just able to get
the show. COUSIN ANDREW came away in good order, was taken in hand near the three-quarter pole then reserved off the pace, went three wide while let
out on the turn, was roused with five sixteenths to run, chased outside in the four path into upper stretch, was taken in hand briefly while momentarily near
the heels of a foe outside the furlong marker, continued in pursuit of the leaders to the wire and missed the trifecta. GOOD CULTURE dropped well behind
the rest of the field while well out in the track, went three to four wide on the turn, floated eight wide into upper stretch and gained late but failed to impact.
RIFT VALLEY settled on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, dropped back along the rail under urging on the turn, swung five wide into upper
stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
RUSE broke sharply at the start right to the front, showed the way in hand along the inside through moderate splits settled into a comfortable rhythm, came
under challenge for the initial time in earnest near the five-sixteenths and was placed to coaxing in response, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away
under a drive to the finish holding well to prevail. PANSTER broke out a step at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on willingly to the finish to secure the place honors. CATCH THAT PARTY away
well, showed early speed getting on near even terms for the front before going three then two wide through the first turn being placed to a hard hold mouth
agape to ease off RUSE, settled just off the inside in closest aim of that leader isolated between that rival and the main body of the field in behind, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, paused just inside the eighth pole as RUSE came outwards safely in
front, then kept on to the finish getting collared for the place honors in the final jumps. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid
pack behind the cover of a rival, tipped three wide into the clear with nine-sixteenths to go and came under light coaxing at the three-eighths tucked back to
the two path, spun three wide for home and offered up a mild bid. VOLIERO saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths
remaining, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position passing tired rivals. MR. KRINGLE two to three wide through the opening bend, settled
unhurried two to three wide near the rear, tucked inside into the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. AUSTRIAN just off the inside through the first turn, raced three to four wide in the clear down the backstretch near the rear of the
field, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened. NOBLE CONQUEST broke a half a beat slow, saved
ground growing detached at the tail of the field early on, came under a ride with three furlongs remaining, spun four wide at the head of the stretch and
made no impact. COUNT FROST tracked the pace two to three wide under encouragement from the five-sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
DEE BO leaned out and brushed the gate at the start, was taken in hand behind POSSE CAN DISCO when that rival crossed in front early, established a
good position just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked in the three path into the stretch, chased under a left-handed crop while
remaining on his inside lead, took the advantage just inside the furlong marker and drew away while still on his inside lead to prove much the best.
MATTY'S MARAUDER was hustled from the start, settled under some urging, went four wide while put to stronger encouragement on the turn, was driven
five wide into the stretch and got up for the place while no match for the winner. LITTERBOX moved up on the outside to press the pace, vied in the three
path on the turn, took the lead while asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and weakened then
lost the place while able to get the show. NOCTILUCENT was taken up in traffic near the nine-sixteenths and dropped back, went four wide while asked on
the turn, chased outside into upper stretch, made a cameo bid at the furlong marker then also weakened. TRIPLE AMERICANO was urged along at the
rear, went three then four wide on the turn then was driven five wide into the stretch, moved further out around the three-sixteenths while in reasonable
striking position but failed to respond. APEX PREDATOR lost his footing at the start but broke with the field, raced just off the early pace, dropped back in
the two to three path while grabbed with the left-rein near the three-eighths, spun four wide into the stretch under the crop and came up empty. POSSE CAN
DISCO angled in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked in the two path into the
stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths then was quickly pulled out of the race while traveling choppy and was vanned off.

Footnotes
EMARAATY (GB) was taken under tight restraint early, tugged at the bit while reserved under a snug hold in the two path, shifted four wide while roused at
the quarter-pole, rallied outside to take the lead into the final furlong, fought with the runner-up until near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear on his inside
lead late to prevail. VOODOO ZIP was taken under a tight hold early, brushed with CHOCOLATE BAR while leaning on that foe on the initial straightaway,
went two then three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, stalked three wide on the final turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, made a bid while
put to a drive in upper stretch, battled with the winner to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place. CHOCOLATE BAR brushed with
VOODOO ZIP while being leaned on early, saved ground while reserved along the rail, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, angled out from
behind horses outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick while able to secure the show. WINNING FACTOR settled on the inside at the rear,
was roused outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch under the crop, angled out inside the three-sixteenths then moved a bit further out and
lacked the needed response. ENTERTAINMENT went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the opening bend, showed the way with a clear
advantage down the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and gave way.
PRINCIPLED STAND (GB) showed early foot on the inside of a rival, was taken back off the pace while inside into the first turn, moved to the two path
midway through that bend, was rated while tracking the pace, ranged up while let out in the two path on the final turn, made a bid while asked outside the
quarter-pole, battled between horses in upper stretch, was in crowded quarters while dropping back into the final furlong and had nothing left. PARLOR
broke out and was off slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, was caught mostly four wide around the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked four
wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

GOLD PANDA coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from the pocket, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch nudging PURPLE HEARTED three wide, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged away to the
finish kept to task. BIG BOBBY shied out at the start as PRINCE OF PHAROAHS broke outwards along his inside and bumped LUNA'S IN CHARGE into
WORK OUT forcing that rival to clip the left front leg of GREAT WORKOUT, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS broke out at the start coming outwards two to three paths and
causing BIG BOBBY to shy out bumping LUNA'S IN CHARGE into WORK OUT and in turn GREAT WORKOUT, showed the way in hand just off the inside
under pressure from PURPLE HEARTED to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. GREAT WORKOUT broke a half
a beat slow and was clipped in the left front leg when bumped solidly by WORK OUT'S hindquarters due to pressure to that rival's inside and bobbled
heavily, recovered and had the rider steady and assess his charge who strode choppy four wide early on conceding eight to nine lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased detached at the tail of the field tucking to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths as
the shock of the blow began to wear off, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out a furlong from home and ran on through to the finish showing
good courage after a rough beginning. PURPLE HEARTED prompted the pace from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, went to spin just off the inside for home and found GOLD PANDA there and was nudged back three wide into upper stretch, dug in and
weakened in the final furlongs. MASKED MARAUDER bobbled at the break, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and tired. WORK OUT got bumped solidly at the start by LUNA'S IN CHARGE due to pressure from BIG BOBBY and in some regard
PRINCE OF PHAROAHS in a hip check of sorts that knocked him askew clipping the left front leg of GREAT WORKOUT and forcing that rival to not only
smart but bobble heavily, chased four then three wide from mid pack, tucked to the two path into the turn and came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to
go, spun three wide into upper stretch and faltered. LUNA'S IN CHARGE got bumped at the start by BIG BOBBY and in turn bumped WORK OUT solidly
into GREAT WORKOUT, then was forced to steady conceding five to six lengths to the front, chased four then three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TIZ KAZ NOW showed brief speed five then four wide down the backstretch, tucked
three wide into the turn and faded under coaxing from midway, went six wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
PULSATE was well placed behind the leading duo, went two then three wide while asked on the turn, rallied into the stretch, closed well to get the lead
inside the furlong marker, drifted out some under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. BACKTOHISROOTS bumped
hard with MAXWELL ESQUIRE at the start, bumped again with that foe early then was taken up some, settled towards the back, started the turn in the two
path, shifted four wide just inside the five-sixteenths then was roused outside the quarter-pole, turned into the stretch under the crop, rallied outside under a
right-handed crop into the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while able to get the place. GUILDSMAN (FR) settled nicely on the inside, saved
ground on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive approaching the furlong marker and finished willingly on the inside of
foes to garner the show. NOBLE EMOTION was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the inside of MAVEN while off the inside, moved in leaving the
backstretch, was asked along the hedge on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, bumped with MAVEN while in the two path outside the furlong
marker, battled into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then lost the show late. HOLIDAY STONE settled on the outside, traveled three wide around the
turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then was guided out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. MAVEN showed good speed from the outside post, set
the pace under pressure to his inside, needed a snug left-handed grip cornering into the turn, vied in the three path under urging on that bend, bumped with
NOBLE EMOTION in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. MAXWELL ESQUIRE
bumped hard with BACKTOHISROOTS at the start, bumped again with that foe early then was taken in hand, settled at the rear, raced inside early on the
turn then moved to the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole then moved out some under a drive in upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position
while getting closer into the final furlong, had no room behind horses in the final sixteenth and coasted to the wire while losing any chance.

Footnotes
FEDERALIST PAPERS two to three wide in pursuit near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and remained patiently handled until
roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied outside rivals getting lightly bumped near the eighth pole as SITTING PRETTY bumped FLEETING
GLIMPSE into her at that juncture, closed well through to the finish to be up in the last jumps to the wire. LADY VALENTINE established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside remained patiently handled until roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in stubbornly through the
length of the stretch fending off a host of rivals until nailed in the very last strides to the finish. PRUNING tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled
until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong fighting on latched on to the finish but
ultimately missed at the end. SITTING PRETTY saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, tipped to the two path into the far turn and came under light coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home in behind PEACEBETHEJOURNEY, leaned on FLEETING GLIMPSE just as they straightened
away for home and was denied the lean, attempted to lean her way out a trio of times to the eighth pole each one with growing force and causing her to
force FLEETING GLIMPSE into FEDERALIST PAPERS to her outside before bumping FLEETING GLIMPSE solidly from her rightful lane at the eighth pole
then forcing that foe to steady in behind FEDERALIST PAPERS, surged late now with a clear lane and lugged in briefly near the sixteenth marker before
missing on the line. PEACEBETHEJOURNEY forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive in contention to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. FLEETING GLIMPSE
just off the pace two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, got leaned on by SITTING PRETTY
straightened away and denied the move keeping her rightful lane, then got leaned on directly after twice more just past the three-sixteenths denying twice
more the move, got bumped with more force nearing the eighth pole and in turn bumped FEDERALIST PAPERS to her outside, then got bumped solidly by
SITTING PRETTY a fifth and final time when that rival bulled her way out a furlong out, got forced to steady and alter slightly off the heels of FEDERALIST
PAPERS and backed away weakening to the finish. MAYHAP saved ground near the rear of the field coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered
just off the inside for home and offered no response. GAILHORSEWIND tracked along the inside from near the rear until tipped two then three wide with
seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing three wide at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. GAUFF (IRE)
two to three wide in pursuit, began to retreat to the tail of the field with seven-sixteenths remaining, grew detached at the rear, went three to four wide into
upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.
