Footnotes
GAVICHI tracked the early leader while racing along the inside down the backstretch, moved up near the quarter while continuing to race near the rail and
finished well to draw clear under steady handling. RAPIDAMENTE was sent along to set the early pace, raced two to three wide into the upper lane and was
no match for the winner. SPECIAL FREEDOM stalked the pace from the outside, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough in the
drive. LITTLE BURRITO was squeezed back while racing between rivals in the early stages, raced near the back of the pack early, moved up five wide into
the upper lane but had no final bid. STEELY BAND was allowed to settle early on, raced two wide and had no response. HOW LUCKY stalked the early
going from the inside and weakened through the stretch run. DREAMANYTIME raced far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

LOAD UP MOE was allowed to settle early on, made a bold move half way down the backstretch, raced near the rail at the quarter pole and held gamely to
be clear late under strong handling. COMMISSIONER G stalked the early pace, raced six deep into the upper stretch and finished second best. MY
FREEDOM showed good early speed to set all the early pace, was rated down the backstretch, raced well off the inside through the upper stretch and
weakened in the drive. FOREFRONT raced five wide around the first turn, settled off the early going, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late
rally. NOT INVENTED HERE stalked the pace from the inside and tired. HACKER MAN was unhurried early, angled four wide nearing the three sixteenths
pole and had no response. TITHED dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MO NORMAL tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, led into the upper lane and finished well to edge clear under strong encouragement.
FROSTERIA showed good early speed to set all the pace, was challenged around the far turn and couldn't match strides with the winner to finish second
best. RED HOT AND BLUE settled off the early pace, made a steady advance near the quarter pole while racing four wide and gained ground willingly in the
latter stages. INDIAN HEART was unhurried early on, raced three wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. THREE COINS was slow early on, angled
six wide through the stretch run and had not enough. POTION stalked the pace while racing between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. HEY
BABE stalked the pace from the inside and tired. BELLSWILLBERINGING checked sharply nearing the seven eighths pole, angled out and never was a
serious threat.

SQUARE PEG showed good early speed to set all the pace, dug in gamely into the upper lane and was clear late late under strong handling.
MARKETABILITY raced five wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from the outside, took aim a the leader through the upper stretch but couldn't match
strides with the winner to finish second best. WILL TAKE ROSES stalked the early going, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough
in the drive. MELODIOUS SINGER was off slow, raced a bit rank early, threw his head entering the first turn, raced three wide in the stretch run and had no
late rally. MIKEY'S JEWEL raced up close early on, raced near the inside and retreated through the stretch run. ATLANTIC PRINCESS settled off the early
going, raced two to three wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PAPA LUKE showed good early speed to set all the pace and held gamely to prove best under steady handling. SMITTEN ENOUGH was off slowly, rushed
from the inside to lay up close and kept on to the wire while continuing to race from the inside. HAIL SOUTHERN raced in tight quarters while racing
between rivals early on, moved up five wide into the upper and finished willingly to the wire. OXBOW PIONEER dropped back early, moved up along the
inside through the stretch run and showed good late interest. BELMULLET raced up close early and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing two to
three wide. BIG POLO stalked the pace from the outside, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. HERCULES HARBOR was slow
early, raced four to five wide through the lane and never was a factor. STILL THE ONE dropped back to the back of the pack early and never threatened.
The half mile fractional time was hand timed.

back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. FAST LANI was off slowly, rushed from the inside to duel with early rival,

Footnotes
DULCE KIARA was off slowly, angled in soon after the break, recovered quickly between horses, led around the far turn and drove clear in the final stages.
CAUSE I SAID dropped back early on, moved up wide through the stretch run and made a good late bid. CONGRATSROSY stalked the early pace, raced
six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. TAP DANCE FEVER raced up close early on, raced four to five wide through the upper
lane and tired. WAR BALLAD was quick to begin to set the early pace and tired readily in the drive. War Ballad was unsaddled on the backstretch and had
to be vanned off.

Footnotes
COOKE CREEK dropped back early, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to draw clear late under steady handling. LUCKY ACES
was allowed to settle early on, moved up four to five deep into the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. GRUMLEY was off slow, rushed from the
inside to show good early speed and weakened a bit in the final stages. BOLD MEDICATION was urged to lay up close early on and weakened while racing
near the inside. SMARTHUMOR stalked the pace and tired through the stretch run. STERLING HILL was coaxed along from the start and failed to sustain a
bid. ONLY CHILD was slow early on and never threatened.
