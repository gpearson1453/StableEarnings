FLYIN IT stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead past the three eighths, widened on the far turn and was steadily
handled through the lane. GLORY MARCH saved early ground then bid leaving the three eighths pole, eased outward on the far turn and entered the
stretch about the five path, dug in from the eighth pole and dueled to take second the final yards. WILD CAPPUCINO settled off the earlier pace about the
three path, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced close about the three path of the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. WHIZ
PASS raced well back from early contention and left the second turn outside, bid past the three eighths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn, drifted
toward the head of the lane and ran evenly in the lane. WIN THEN GRIN rounded the opening turn about the five path and settled off the pace from the
seven eighths pole, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened off the rail on the far turn. CHARLOTTE DE BERRY took the lead
midway on the first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the three eighths then faded at
the rail on the far turn. VIOLANE raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and was never a factor.

DAZZLE ME settled back off the rail the first turn, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn about the three path, dug in
for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. LADY MACHO rated close two deep then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to even
terms midway on the far turn, took the nod toward the top of the stretch, dug in with the advantage from the eighth pole but was caught mid-stretch and
relented later yards. BRIDGING THE GAP rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole but was met at the rail midway
on the far turn, gave up the edge nearing the head of the lane, flattened inside the eighth pole then just lasted in third. MARY'S JEWEL saved early ground
racing well off the pace, bid mildly and just missed third widest. COMPLETE SURPRISE settled off the pace about the three path, gave chase from the three
eighths pol then flattened on the far turn.

SINGANOTHERSONG chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path then dug in to take third the final yards. BLUE PLAID pressured the pace
through the backstretch but dropped back at the quarter pole, raced in the three path of the turn then weakened. UNION GRACE steadied on the chute then
chased inside to no avail.

DUSKY took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths, widened at the
rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. FLASH LIGHTENING stalked two deep, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch for second. NOW I'M BROKE was shut off at the heels of Dusky leaving the three
quarter pole and settled off the pace inside the first turn, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NEW SOUTH raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid nearing the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and ran evenly down the lane. YOUREASCOLDASICE saved ground on the opening turn and
was well off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, angled to the six path on the far turn and ran evenly outside through the
stretch. CANHERUN rated just off the pace inside, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then
weakened. TOMMY PIES rounded the opening turn in the six path, showed no response past the three eighths pole and was eased. As a result of a
Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Dusky, lodged by the rider of Now I'm Broke, the former was disqualified to third place for
shutting off the latter leaving the three quarter pole.
