CHIPSHIRE perfectly placed to far turn, rallied with a three wide run, roused lightly and went clear as much the best. KINDOFBLUEKITTEN inside trip to far
turn, angled out quarter pole and ran on for place. WEEKEND GETAWAY trailed to the stretch, angled out into stretch then back in to split horses in late
stretch for the show. HALF LEGEND raced evenly off rail throughout while never a real threat. WANTA BALLERINA inside pace to the stretch, overtaken
and emptied out in the drive. MIZZEN THE COVE chased and dueled leader to the half but faded from quarter pole. Race was hand timed due to a timer
malfunction.
