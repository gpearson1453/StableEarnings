Footnotes
FINANCIAL DRAW gained along the rail on the turn, eased out into the lane, asked, gained and then drifted in at the sixteenths pole and under pressure
proved best. STORMY NEW YORK vied for the lead along the rail, shook clear some a furlong out, was hooked nearing the sixteenths pole, drifted out after
that slamming into LIAMS MAJESTY and then outran the latter for the place. LIAMS MAJESTY vied for the lead along the two path, chased in the lane,
gained some to challenge from between, was then forced in leaving the sixteenths pole by the winner and then was slammed late by STORMY NEW YORK
while missing the place. TUCKABUCKAWAY tracked the leaders along the two path into the turn, three path out of it, altered in for room leaving the furlong
marker, appeared to be blocked nearing the sixteenths, took up sharply and then checked to the wire. PERFECT SYMPHONY lagged far back, saved
ground, lodged a bid inside and checked late. ANOTHER SHOT close up four wide early, four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. A stewards inquiry was
posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in no change.
