MYSTIC TIMES broke alertly and contested the pace three to four wide outside JACK BO, shook clear under left handed rousing soon into the lane, kept on
under solid handling through the final furlong and held sway. AMEN CORNER settled off the pace, edged up between rivals mid turn and churned on
willingly towards the inside to steadily gain. GLENGAR settled in the clear, came six wide for the drive and rallied mildly. GREEK PRINCE broke a step
slow, edged up four wide outside rivals nearing the turn, took closer order mid turn, came five wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. EXTRA MEDIUM
saved ground and faded. JACK BO vied inside the winner while attempting to get out, failed to kick on soon into the lane, was eased through the final
furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
TORRES DEL PAINE , right to the early lead, set the pace near the rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. RESIDENT LIBERAL stalked the pace,
raced in the two path between horses on the far turn and rallied outsid. MR. SHADES OF GRAY , two wide stalking the pace throughout, finished gamely.
STRINGFELLA bore in on foes leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turns, angled out for the drive and passed tired rivals. DADDY'S COZY ,
forced in leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and weakened. MARYLAND PRIDE , four deep around the far turn, lacked a
rally. MINT GAME , bumped leaving the starting gate, was checked near the quarter pole and failed to be a factor. TALE OF DIXIE , between horses around
the far turn, weakened. LOST MY VOWCHER , three wide the first turn, advanced four deep leaving the backstretch, remained on the far turn and gave
way. SIR LENNY , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
NOTION INTERRUPTUS , close up four wide between rivals, lodged a quick three wide bid outside the leader mid turn, sparred into the lane, gained a slim
lead in mid stretch then edged away late under a drive. HOT TO PARTY advanced inside foes to take a short early lead, took pressure into the turn, briefly
went clear near the three eighths, dug in when engaged mid turn, battled two wide and to the inside of the winner into the lane, kept up the fight past the
sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. C TWO pulled her way forward to the inside of rivals early on, tracked around the turn, had aim on the leaders into
the stretch then faded. BELLATORA broke a step slow, edged up between rivals into the far turn, chased three wide past the five sixteenths but failed to
seriously sustain through the lane. SARA PLAIN N TALL broke outward and bumped with a rival, lagged off the early pace and failed to menace. UNION
BETTY , bumped and steadied at the break, steadied again mid turn and failed to menace. VERYAN , three wide between rivals stalking the pace, failed to
kick on past the quarter pole and gave way. ARBELA forced the early pace between foes, could not quite keep pace leaving the three eighths then stumbled
when in tight quarters near the five sixteenths. BOBBINI lost ground five wide while chasing the early pace, was carried out some mid turn and faded.

Footnotes
TAKAFUMI (BRZ) rated kindly off the inside, took aim of the embattled leaders and was given his cue past the five sixteenths, lugged in when moving to a
short lead past the three sixteenths, shook clear with a furlong to go, dug in under left handed asking and held off B DETERMINED. B DETERMINED
settled inside, moved up past the five sixteenths, swung five wide into the lane, made a bod run outside the winner but just could not get past. BE
YOURSELF , between foes near the five eighths marker, advanced outside a rivals after six furlongs, shifted five wide into the lane and closed steadily.
CHAO saved ground in a good spot, moved closer under coaxing leaving the far turn, angled out and advanced four wide into the lane, loomed near mid
stretch then flattened out late. KARTANO settled in the clear while off the rail, advanced under a ride past the five sixteenths, worked between into the lane,
steadied off the winner near the three sixteenths but failed to pick things back up in a serious fashion through the final furlong. REAL FACTOR prompted the
pace two wide, bid to attack into the far turn, dueled on a short lead into the lane then gave way approaching the sixteenth pole. FLEETRIDGE , three to
four wide, gave way. ARMANDO R was outrun. IT'S SIZZLING TIME broke inward, corrected and went clear, set the pace towards the inside, was joined
into the far turn, vied to upper stretch then surrendered.

MS HEADLEY , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, opened up in mid stretch, was kept to her business in the drive and ran on her left lead the
final sixteenth of a mile. MOONSAFE hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path turning for home and rallied. MY MY GIRL , well
placed in the three path on the turn, dropped back some approaching the stretch, swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. PRETTY
EDGY , four deep on the turn, weakened. BACKSTREET GAL was outrun. MILLIE CHILD prompted the pace outside the winner around the turn and
weakened. BUCKEY'S CHARM was outrun.

Footnotes
MIRANDA'S DESMOND rated forwardly, bid four wide between rivals into the lane, shook clear in mid stretch then held firm under a drive. AWAY TO
RETURN pressed the early pace two wide, chased mid turn, bid between foes into the stretch to threaten for command, shifted in and bit and kept on
gamely inside the winner. BROADWAY MELODY saved ground mid turn, angled five to six wide for the drive and closed willingly. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR
settled off the pace, angled very wide for the drive and rallied. MISS BOSCONOVITCH tracked inside, eased out and moved up between foes near the
sixteenth marker but was out kicked. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK sluggish from the gate, lagged well back, angled out into the lane then made a nice run in
handy fashion between foes. SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS stalked the pace, bid three wide between foes into the lane, challenged but. BIRTHDAY WISH ,
urged off the rail mid turn, came four wide for the drive, drifted in briefly, corrected and rallied between rivals. PEACE OUT , three to five wide, made a quick
move nearing the lane, chased past the eighth pole then faded. RONA lacked speed, swung wide and failed to menace. KELLY GREEN saved ground mid
turn and failed to threaten. SEE THAT GIRL had speed inside, shook clear around the turn, could not resist challenges into the lane and faltered.
