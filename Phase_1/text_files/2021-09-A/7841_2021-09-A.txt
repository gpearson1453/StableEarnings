Footnotes
UNCAPPED tracked the top flight through early stages, vied for the lead at the quarter pole, roused forward along the outside and held a slim lead at the
eighth pole, dug in racing in the seven path in deep stretch and prevailed under a driving finish. BOBBY BABY raced off the early pace, launched a two wide
bid in the upper stretch, advanced into close contention in deep stretch but could not hold off the winner. KITTEN'S MAN settled through early stages, was
set down five wide for the drive, gathered momentum under steady pressure and finished with good response. MOROCCO tracked the pace on the inside,
tipped out two wide at the head of the lane, moved up into close contention at the furlong marker, battled on into late stages then weakened in deep stretch.
RANSACK vied for the lead racing between rivals, fought back to the furlong marker then gave way. LOST IN LIMBO vied outside of a pair of rivals, stayed
up close to the eighth pole then weakened. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT raced in the back, went two wide into the lane and never threatened. AFLEET MOMENT
vied inside of a duo then faded in the lane. STOCK DEAL was allowed to settle, saved ground into the lane and failed to move on. WHEREWEGOIN was
unhurried, came four wide into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
VOLUBILE was allowed to settle through stages, launched a five wide bid near the furlong marker, roused forward and held a slim lead at the furlong marker
then just lasted under a driving finish. ARTIE'S LADY raced off the early pace, went six wide into the lane, steadily moved up closer then angled in to race
three deep in the final sixteenth, was getting to the winner in final stride and just missed. CAVE RUN raced off the second flight, came three wide into the
lane, raced in traffic near the quarter pole, angled in, got through and sustained a steady bid for a share. ALIEN SEASON vied for the early lead, got
collared by the winner near the eighth pole and flattened out. CAIRO CAMPAIGN tracked the top two early leaders, roused four wide into the lane, brushed
with rival near the eighth pole and lacked the late needed response for impact. LOVER BOY raced in range, launched an inside bid near the quarter pole,
failed to sustain response and gave way shortly after. RIVERS OF LITE raced off the pace, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally.
FLOROPLUS vied for the lead in early stages, pulled up while injured in the stretch run and vanned off.

MAX K. O. stalked the top two leaders through early stages, launched a three wide bid down the stretch, took command at the eighth pole and finished
clear. DON'TASK DON'TTELL prompted the pace around the turn, held a slim lead at the quarter pole, got collared by the winner at the furlong marker and
had to settle for second best. THE LAST ZIP set a pressured pace around the turn, could not move on for the lead in the upper stretch but stayed on for a
share. SHORTLIST was unhurried, hustled up five wide nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed response for impact. MOONSHINE NOW settled
off the second flight, was ridden along three wide at the quarter pole and failed to move on. SUPER SOL raced in the back, saved ground and failed to
move into contention. ATREYU tracked the pace on the inside and faded in the lane.

SNAPPER SINCLAIR set the pace over a compact flight in the early going, saved ground into the lane, held a length lead over pursuers with a furlong left to
run and kept clear under steady pressure. BOB AND JACKIE hopped at the start then was forwardly placed through early stages, launched a two wide bid
at the quarter pole, sustained a steady bid and finished second best. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME raced up close and stalked the pacesetter around the turn,
given cue three wide in down the stretch, stayed on with response and secured a share. MAJESTIC EAGLE rated outside rivals while never far back in a
compact field, roused five wide at the eighth pole and lacked the needed response for serious impact. PENALTY tracked the pace outside a foe through
early stages, hustled up four wide in the upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. STRONG TIDE got in tight and checked sharply after the
opening quarter, lost all momentum and dropped back to last, launched a rebid racing seven paths wide in the upper stretch and failed to kick on. SPLIT
THE WICKETS steadied when STRONG TIDE checked sharply and tipped to the two path, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed rally.
NECKER ISLAND settled inside through early stages, tipped two wide at the head of the lane and failed to move on. ERON DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) raced
off the pace, was ridden along six wide in the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA ANGEL got bumped and was off slow at the start, trailed in the opening quarter, caught up with the field midway around the turn, raced seven
paths wide into the lane, responded under a drive, moved up closer, angled in under pressure, advanced to challenge UNDER ONE SKY past the furlong
marker then kicked clear. UNDER ONE SKY tracked the top two leaders around the turn, went five wide into the lane, roused forward and led the way at the
eighth pole, drifted in under left handed pressure and failed to be late match for the winner. BEE RIGHT raced near midpack, hustled along four to five wide
with a furlong left to run and got up late to capture show. CAILIN DIANA vied for the lead with ALREADY CHARMING, shook free and led the way late on
the turn, got collared in the upper stretch and gave way. PERFECTIBLE LADY rated off the pace, saved ground then tipped three wide and failed to kick on.
CHATON ROUGE was unhurried, saved ground into the lane and had no response when called upon. WAY TOO PRETTY tracked the pace on the inside
then dropped back in the lane. HEAVENLY HELLOS raced three wide around the turn and never menaced. ALREADY CHARMING was very fractious trying
to load into the gate, vied for the lead around the turn then came up empty.
