Footnotes
RULE THE SEA was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. OUTCLASS set the pace and took
command on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and was no match for the winner. SILVER SUNRISE was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK was in range but chased on the turn and had no late kick.
KECAMEIFYOUCAN stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch flattened out. DONT WAKE THE
BEAR was in touch and hustled along on the turn but failed to fire. ROSES LITTLE GIRL showed no speed, trailed the field on the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
SWEET FINALE was up close, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. EASY ACCESS broke
poorly, gained ground on the turn and had a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch but was second best. PENNIESFROMABOVE was in touch and
had a good position on the turn but needed more. MADAME BOVERY was well back, closed the gap on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch.
STEPITUPSTEPHANIE was away alertly and dueled from between foes on the turn but faded. STELLA UNREAL settled off the pace and was roused on
the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. NUDGENUDGEWINKWINK set a pressured pace and was hustled along on the turn
but had nothing left.

Footnotes
I HAVE FEELINGS was away alertly, set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task. POWER HOUSE was in range, moved up on the turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. IT'SNICETOBENICE tracked the early leader from the outside and was a factor on the far turn
but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more. BENADETTE'S LADY was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but was no real threat.
SEALED WITH A KISS stalked the early leader and had a good position on the far turn but had no kick. GIOVANNA PONTI was off slow and saved ground
on the far turn but was not a factor. UNCLAIMEDTREASURE was off the pace, trailed the field on the far turn and had no impact. CONNORS SENIORITA
was in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. GLIB MARYLIN was well back, showed little
and was never in contention.

factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. OBLIVIOUSLY was off slow and had a good position on the turn but had no late
kick. GOSUDARINA had no speed and saved ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no threat. WORDS OF GOLD was in
mid pack but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. PETITE AMIE dwelt at the start, showed nothing and was

Footnotes
STORMY SUZIE tracked the leaders from the inside, raced evenly on the far turn and angled off the rail to get up in time. LILIBET set the pace and had a
clear lead on the far turn but failed to hold. SECRET ARCHANGEL stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but finished evenly. VINYASA
was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and was up for a share. RASPBERRY WILD was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was no real
threat. KEEP YOUR SILENCE was in range and hustled along on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. SHOW SOME
SKIN was in touch and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. PRESSURE FRONT was in mid pack but
chased on the far turn and flattened out. PRINCESS MORO was unhurried early, showed little and was never in contention. LIGHT IT UP had no speed and
showed nothing in a dull effort.
