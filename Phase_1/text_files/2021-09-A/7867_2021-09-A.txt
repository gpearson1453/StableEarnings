Footnotes
THECHROMEWEKNOW cleared quickly, pressed into the stretch, rebroke, stayed clear under good handling. PLATINUM MAC between horses to the turn,
four wide into stretch for place. KING BING HAWK off tardy, lagged back to the stretch, ran on late for show spot. CLEAR TO CLOSE no speed to the
stretch, improved position while no real threat. TRAMORE BAY outside position never far back to deep stretch, faded late. HART WELL inside position
throughout, faded down the lane. CALL PAPA never a factor. NOT NOW RAND unruly in the gate, good position to the turn, gave way readily. ALLURING
AMERICAN bobbled badly at the start, lost best chance.

Footnotes
CHISMOSO lunged at the start, recovered quickly and rushed to turn, took over and went clear tons the best. LT. FINN inside trip to turn, shuffled back,
came running again, no match. LACE REVOLUTION speed to the turn off rail, inherited rail out of turn for show. RICKI TORNADO no speed to the turn, split
horses to quarter pole, moved up late. BLACKSMITH STRONG unhurried early, never made an impact in the stretch run. GREAT OCEAN ROAD off rail
chase to turn, could not keep up and faded. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE never menaced. ABOUT TO RAGE sprinted clear from outside to the turn but wilted in
the stretch.
