VIDMER'S COURAGE chased outside, rounded the turn in the four path and closed steadily through the stretch to take second under the wire.
BRAYDEN'SWARRIOR set a pressured pace off the rail, contested even terms two deep on the turn, remained a close factor to mid-stretch, but dropped
back a sixteenth away and was nipped from second under the wire. ASK ME HOW IKNOW engaged in close chase through the backstretch, rounded the

Footnotes
NURSE TOMPKINS saved ground off the early pace, closed the gap in the five path of the far turn, rallied outside through the stretch to get up the final
yards and raced clear under the wire. PRINECESS DOIR was jostled at the break and rounded the opening turn about the four path, started her bid with the
winner leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in for a brief slim lead late stretch, then
outfinished the final yards. DISTORTED SPLENDOR closed to the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, was caught into the backstretch,
dropped back toward the seven sixteenths pole but continued in close chase from that point, raced off the rail on the far turn, recovered a brief lead
mid-stretch but flattened late yards. MISS WILD stalked the early pace from the two and three paths and took the lead two deep into the backstretch, came
under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met past the eighth pole then flattened the final sixteenth. GANDARI
broke inward to make contact with Prinecess Doir then raced in the three path of the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path then weakened inside the sixteenth pole. SHE'S ALL COURAGE broke out to make contact with Prinecess Doir, raced in the three
path of the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. THAT KENNEY KID rated close to the early pace inside, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened.

Footnotes
COMMCAT rounded the first turn about the three path then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved
in the five path of the far turn, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drew away later yards. NAJWA rated close to the early pace inside, picked up
the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then dug in to take second later yards. SONDE AFFAIR broke awkwardly and
rounded the first turn about the four path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, angled outward through the upper stretch
and closed well for third later yards while gaining on the runner-up. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE came away awkwardly then closed to the lead toward the three
quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the three eighths, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in from the
top of the stretch but was caught a sixteenth away and flattened stride. GATTOLOTTACHARM stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. SUZIE Q SONDE rounded the first turn about the four path and
settled just off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. QUINCYS WAY saved
ground racing well off the pace and showed little response. MASTERDANCER settled off the pace about the three path on the opening turn then faded past
the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
SONDE ST BLUES raced with the pace two deep from the five eighths pole and took the lead at the nine sixteenths, came under pressure nearing the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled through the lane. HARD BEING ME settled off the rail the first turn then eased outward
into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, couldn't threaten in the stretch and had to settle for second best.
BRILLIANT IDEAS saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole and improved his position in the three path of the
far turn, then flattened stride the final sixteenth. LUCKY PENGUIN raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, bid past
the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. MELDON saved ground. BECOMING SMITTY raced with the pace inside from the five
eighths pole, was eased leaving the nine sixteenths and had to be euthanized on the track. Per Stewards Ruling #69, Sonde St Blues has been disqualified
from earnings.
