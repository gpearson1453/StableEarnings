COAST GUARDSMAN showed good early speed and was quickest from the gates but had to stalk the early pace came two wide on the turn to take the
lead and was all out to hold on. TOM FOOLERY cleared the field to take the lead and the rail shortly after the start but could not go with the winner in t6he
stretch. MR. B. G.'S CREED was stalking the pace in the two path then went to the inside for the stretch run and was closing well. UNCLE TAP was not able
to get to the lead and raced in the inside behind the pacesetters and had no response in the drive. WAR BEAU chased the pace and tired through the
stretch.

FIRST ALTERNATE broke towards the outside and then engaged for the lead from the outset took a clear lead into the backstretch took a breather then
drew clear as the rider pleased on the second turn with the outcome never in doubt. PRANKED chased the winner was asked for run on the second turn
and could not go with the winner while clearly second best. BEHOLD THAT WORD was well back in the early stages passed a few horses in the last half
but was never a threat to the top two while clearly third best. BONES AND ROSES was well back and passed a tired foe for fourth money. INAGOODWAY
showed good speed for the first half but then gave way quickly.
