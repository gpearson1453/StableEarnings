the pace, weakened in the drive. TRIKKI NIKKI raced in the three path on the turn and lacked a rally. ALLURING RUMBA gained a two wide lead mid way
on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. MISS OLD BAY , four wide on the turn, was not a factor. SACRED LADY , four deep on the turn,

Footnotes
WICK stumbled at the break, was hung out five wide advancing to a forward position near the seven eighths, dropped in a bit for the backstretch run and
was taken to rate, quickly gained three wide when given his cue past the five sixteenths, dueled outside THE BIG MOZZ from upper stretch, gained a slim
lead a furlong out then kept on under repeated right handed encouragement to prevail. THE BIG MOZZ took over early and set the pace towards the rail,
handled some pressure leaving the five eighths, dug in when confronted by the winner in upper stretch, kept on valiantly but wasn't quite good enough.
ROYALIAN , taken to rate inside, edged up near the five eighths, waited a bit leaving the far turn, angled out and was put to pressure pursuing the top pair
into the lane but failed to seriously kick on. ICHIGO , three wide early, prompted between foes mid way through the backstretch run, failed to keep pace
under asking past the five sixteenths, shifted in and faded. DOC ELM , off last when breaking awkwardly, was sent up between runners into the first turn and
attended the pace, rated back off foes in early backstretch, dropped back past the three eighths, angled five wide and came up empty. HEROIC DEED , four
wide into the first turn, stalked the issue three wide through the backstretch, failed to kick on after six furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
HOME BREW , with the leaders soon after the break, drafted back between runners heading towards the turn, was under asking saving ground past the
three eighths, moved up along the rail nearing mid stretch, altered out for room, closed sharply between rivals, was given one asking with the right stick,
surged to command a sixteenth out then eagerly pulled away under steady handling. TOPS THE CHART sped to the early lead and set the pace towards
the rail, got engaged in a duel around the turn, continued the battle while two wide into the lane shook clear a furlong out, failed to resist the winner but kept
on gamely for the place. SLAATS gave hard chase of the leaders while three wide, came wider for the drive and churned on with interest. VON HOFF broke
a step slow, rushed up soon after to reach contention, tracked the embattled leaders past the five sixteenths, steadied lacking room in mid stretch, found
room for the final sixteenth and kept on willingly. PRACTICAL SENSE drifted in at the break, raced off the pace and between rivals, edged up a bit near mid
stretch but lacked a solid finish. ONE TEN prompted the early pace two wide, moved to engage and dueled outside TOPS THE CHART from the three
eighths, kept up the battle past mid stretch then faded. SOUPER ROYAL MOON , three wide off the early pace, angled five wide for the drive but failed to
generate a legitimate response. SCHOOLYARD BULLY broke slowly, was under asking mid turn, eased out and faded.

Footnotes
BIZ BIZ BUZZ bumped with DANCER'S ACT leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep, drifted in when taking command inside the eighth pole then
drew out. RADICAL RIGHT saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and rallied while on his left lead.
CAPT. CANDY accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, set the pace along the rail and weakened the final furlong.
THE MAN TO SEE lacked speed, raced in the two path leaving the turn, eased out and rallied mildly. HEAVENLY TRIP ran off about a furlong when briefly
loose before the start, raced forwardly in the three path on the turn and weakened. SENSON , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. HARD
TRAVELER was not a factor. KING SABAN , a forward factor along the inner rail to the stretch, tired. SKY OF GOLD raced along the inner rail on the turn
and was not a factor. DANCER'S ACT , pinched back after bumping with the winner leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
SPOTTED BULL drifted out soon after the break, settled back off of a contested pace, was under pressure off the rail leaving the three eighths, swung
seven wide with momentum into the lane, straightened away and closed strongly under a drive to be up in time. SEMPER FI chased towards the inside,
edged up past the five sixteenths, eased out into the lane, shifted back in near the three sixteenths, rallied inside rivals to take a slim lead past the sixteenth
pole, kept on gamely but was caught in the final jumps. ALPHA CHI RHO vied outside THE CAIRO KID while under some rating, edged away a bit three
wide past the five sixteenths, was overtaken soon into the lane, fought on between foes past the sixteenth marker and stayed on well to the line. MAGIC
MULE settled outside a rival, angled five to six wide and made a bold run to command in upper stretch, appeared to briefly clear in mid stretch, ceded
command past the sixteenth pole then hung late. EGO MAN, fractious in the gate, was well placed pursuing the dueling leaders, angled four to five wide
nearing the quarter pole, stayed on range to mid stretch but came up empty. MOSS BOSS broke slowly, saved ground nearing the quarter pole and failed to
menace. AS SEEN ON TV stalked off the rail, was under asking four wide while chasing the duel into the lane, lacked a kick past the three sixteenths and
gave way. THE CAIRO KID was sent up to the inside of rivals early on, sparred for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
HARD ROCK GOLD hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, drifted out a bit near the sixteenth pole and dug in tenaciously to narrowly prevail. TRUST
DADDY stumbled at the break, advanced four deep turning for home, bid for the lead in mid stretch and just missed in a game effort. NATAGAR , bumped
by NIGHT BOSS leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace outside the winner and gradually weakened in the drive. THE CLAM KING stalked the pace,
advanced in the three path to challenge for the lead between horses turning for home and weakened late. BOWIE TWO STEP hugged the inner rail on the
turn, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. NIGHT BOSS bore in and bumped NATAGAR when stumbling at the break then failed to be a factor.
TRASH TALKIN LARRY was done early.

Footnotes
TOWN OF GOLD , off the pace while saving ground, angled out four wide into the lane, leveled off under strong handling in mid stretch, sustained under
pressure and forged ahead in the final strides. FEDERALE broke sharply, dueled towards the inside shook clear under pressure in upper stretch, wandered
outward inside the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner. SUE LOVES BARBADOS dropped off the early pace, picked up
momentum between runners nearing the lane, angled out five wide and advanced with the winner past the furlong grounds, kept on to late then hung
through the final yards. FLANK SPEED broke slowly, lagged off the early pace, saved ground into the lane, shifted out past the three sixteenths and closed
steadily. HARD TO BE HUMBLE , away alertly and got engaged in a pace battle outside FEDERALE, sparred with that one to the head of the lane, chased
past the eighth pole then faded late. GALE WINDS , bumped at the break, moved up between runners mid turn, dropped in near the three sixteenths but
went evenly in the final seventy yards. IMA IMA STARBOY stalked the duel three wide, failed to kick on under pressure into the lane and dropped back.
GRAN CITY , bumped at the break, moved up early and chase along the rail, steadied when put in tight near the three sixteenths, altered out but lacked a
finishing kick. STARBURST flashed speed four wide, dropped in a path to chase into the turn, failed to kick on mid turn and faltered.
