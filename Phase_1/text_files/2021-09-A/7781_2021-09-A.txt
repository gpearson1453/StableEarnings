BADGER GAL tracked two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered stretch in the four path, took aim on rival, headed rival in upper
stretch, and drove clear. LUCKY DAUGHTER easily cleared rivals exiting the chute, not asked for any speed and stayed clear entering the turn, entered
stretch on the lead. EXPENSIVE DEVON settled into a good tracking position along the rail on the backstretch, continued to track along the rail on the turn
and into the stretch, stayed on well enough to best the rest. GO VAIDAGIRL broke out and bothered BEYOND THE CLOUDS at the start, settled into a
stalking position two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and into the stretch, responded well to urging and closed gap while three wide.
GODDESS APHRODITE saved ground throughout, and lacked needed rally in the lane. BEYOND THE CLOUDS off slow, settled two wide on the
backstretch, continued two wide on the turn and failed to make an impact.
