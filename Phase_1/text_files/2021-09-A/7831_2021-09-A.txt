TWIRLY GIRL stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. UH
OH LUCY broke sharply, set the pace with a clear lead and was caught near the wire. POLAR ROUTE raced in the back, advanced inside around the turn
and offered a mild bid to be along for show. GLITTER GULCH was void of early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. ADRIENNE'S
PROGENY showed speed to the turn and gave way. LADY EFFORT raced mid pack in an even effort and did not threaten. Hand timed.

led to the turn, fell back and was no match for the winner. MAGNIFICANT MONEY was reluctant to load, showed speed to the turn, dropped back, had no
further response and held safely for show. MISS MY MAMMA raced in the back, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a response. A. P. SQUARED
showed little. Hand timed.

and angled out on the turn, bid three wide, closed steadily and was gaining late. MR VIEW bobbled at the start, raced inside in a steady effort and was along
for show. DYNA CAT was outrun in an even effort. THE PUBLIC HALO broke awkwardly to be off slowly, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. CHILL
HAZE showed speed to the turn and gave way. Hand timed.

JEN LORS LEGACY vied inside, inched clear, responded when challenged to duel and drew clear near the sixteenth pole under steady urging. PRIVATE
JOKE raced close to the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled to late stretch and yielded grudgingly. MATSON pressed the pace, swung
wide leaving the turn, bid, hung and held safely for show. BLOWIN SMOKE was checked into the second turn, swung wide entering the stretch and bore out
in the drive. MI MALDITO AMOR raced close to the pace while saving ground and was through after a half. OUTLAW BY NATURE vied to the second turn,
tired and stopped. PLEASE DO TELL pressed the pace while racing outside and was through after a half. The rider of BLOWIN SMOKE lodged an objection
against the rider of PRIVATE JOKE for alleged interference into the far turn. No change was made. Hand timed.
