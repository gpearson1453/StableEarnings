Footnotes
GIO NASTY ONE set a contested pace, was headed on the turn and dug in gamely in the stretch. CATALOGUE forced the pace, gained a narrow lead on
the turn and kept on willingly in the stretch. CHUCKMATE chased while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and rallied. FOURTH DESIGN raced
forwardly while three wide and had no finishing punch. MORO CHARLIE never menaced. BLANK IT was always outrun. THEBOYFROMJERSEY was
outpaced while four wide and faded. IL EST VITE showed little. RONNIE CLOUD took no part.
