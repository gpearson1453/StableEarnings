was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then rallied determinedly, but missed. VICTOR'S DESTINY bumped at the outset, settled in mid pack, saved
ground on the turn then closed along the rail in the stretch. FAST NEGOTIATIONS bumped with CALL ME WALLY at the break, settled off the pace, came
three to five-wide through the turn and gained steadily in the stretch. CALL ME WALLY brushed with FAST NEGOTIATIONS leaving the gate, settled off the
pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished with some interest. WEISSER led quickly, set the pace, dueled on the
turn, was headed a furlong out and gave way. BRASS COMPASS pressed the pace, bid early turn, dueled two and three-wide on the turn, was headed at
