Footnotes
BUBBA stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied along the rail, gained a narrow lead at the furlong marker and was all out to win by the narrowest of
margins. SKYLIME chased the pace into the stretch, loomed boldly three wide before the furlong marker, matched strides with the winner late and just
missed. BO RHAPSODY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch, drifted then faded. CHOCOLATE SOLDIER failed to
menace. BOBBIE'S DERBY BOY was no threat. GOTIGER SPECIAL was no factor.

Footnotes
KNIGHT'S CROSS was hung five wide into the clubhouse turn, advanced steadily four then three wide, made the lead near the furlong marker and proved
best under right handed urging. IHADADREAM trailed for a half, moved up through the far turn, shifted out to the six path, closed fast late and got up for
second. DOUBLE DEEP sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch then was outfinished in the four path. ADHHAR never far back,
inched closer along the inside before a half, had speed into the stretch and faded late along the rail. SPEEDY MOBILE was a forward factor into the second
turn then weakened. ENJOY BASEBALL failed to menace. CANDY EXCHANGE well placed inside, dropped back on the far turn. AUTHENTIC COWTOWN
chased the pace two wide from the three path for six furlongs then weakened. MAKE THE RULES was no threat.

LITTLE MATILDA close up from the start, rallied two wide through the far turn, made the lead entering the stretch, set the balance of the pace while drifting
out to the middle of the racetrack and won under right handed urging. HIGH FIRE allowed to settle, loomed boldly outside the winner in upper stretch, was
carried wide and finished second best. RIPROARING broke in front, set the pace to the top of the stretch along the inside then weakened. FRESHMAN
CLASS chased the pace near the inside and faded late. DOUBLE OAKED failed to menace. TURN TO ME SUCREE pressed the pace two wide into the
first turn, suffered and injury leaving that turn, was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
JUDGE HEAD stalked the dueling leaders into the far turn, rallied three then two wide, matched strides to the wire, was bumped nearing the wire and
proved best under strong handling. YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE dueled for the lead along the inside for a half, inherited the advantage, matched strides with the
winner the length of the stretch, drifted out bumping that one near the wire and just missed. STONE COLD CAT unhurried early, found his best stride late in
the five path. VICTORY DIVISION moved up along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. MUSTANG WILLIE unhurried, swung wide and failed to menace.
JIMTOWN was no factor. MACADOOOO KID battled for the early lead two wide and was through after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN AND THE RIDER OF YOU'RE MY BOY BLUE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
