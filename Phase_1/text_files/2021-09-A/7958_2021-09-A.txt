Footnotes
EXTRAPOLATOR with the pace from the start following an alert break, cleared early in the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the stretch under
token encouragement to win ridden out. BUBBA SMACK chased the winner throughout toward the inside, could do little with that rival through the lane,
clearly second best. MR SOLO DOLO bumped start to be off a step slow, trailed for three furlongs, improved position through traffic to be up for the show,
not a threat to the top two. FUNNY ACTOR in the main body in the run up the backstretch off the inside, moved a bit closer three wide through the turn while
just outside the runner up, flattened out in the drive to lose the show spot late. HESACALENDARBOY broke out, bumped, close up early along the inside,
began a steady fade after three furlongs. HEAVENLY TRUMP in a bit tight at the start, remained back in failing to menace. CHURCH POINT broke out,
moved up to mid pack, four wide turn, trailed home in failing to rally.

Footnotes
DIAMOND PALACE broke out, bumped foe, in the second flight while three wide in the run up the backstretch, advanced to challenge while between rivals
through the turn while remaining in the three path, clear into the lane, maintained a clear advantage late while kept to task with first a left handed then right
handed crop. COMBAT COMMAND within striking distance off the inside, challenged four wide when moving with the winner midway on the turn, could not
match that one through the stretch, clear of the others. FLASH ME BACK bumped both sides at the break, void of speed in racing near the back, three wide
through the turn. PILLAGE DA VILLAGE broke alertly but inward to bump FLASH BE BACK, was straightened to clear early, showed the way through most
of the turn, headed entering the stretch and began to weaken. MISS JENNY'S HALO went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response after saving
ground. SPECIAL STORM prompted the pace off the inside, challenged between foes and inside the winner turning for home, hung in the drive. MY LITTLE
FLACO last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
EPONHER with the pace three wide out of the chute, continued to vie up the backstretch, began to edge away in the turn, clear entering the stretch, held a
comfortable advantage to the wire while being kept to pressure while drifting slightly. WHO DAT GREY settled in the second flight early, moved closest to
the winner and chased that one into the lane, could do little with that rival in the run to the wire, edged clear for the second spot. CUSTOM MADE asked
along to keep up with the leaders early, fell back to lose some position through the turn, came back for the show in the drive to be well clear of the others
while in the two path. SILVER MAID broke out to help crowd KAITLYN'S COURT, was straightened and turned in an even effort while racing off the inside.
HAIRTRIGGER HEART broke in and raced back, continued to lack speed for five furlongs, improved position with some mild, belated interest. HER GREAT
GRANDPA raced back and well off the pace outside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. HUSHED COURT ROOM broke alertly, vied up
front early along the inside, was finished after a half. KAITLYN'S COURT crowded back at the start to be last away, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TIN DELAY within striking distance while off the inside, advanced to race closest to the leader by midway on the final turn, lodged an outside bid upper
stretch, floated out, edged clear and held sway under steady handling while remaining well out in the strip. SOBEK prompted the issue from the outside
early, continued to prompt the pace in the run up the backstretch, took over in the second turn, showed the way into the lane, drifted out to float the winner
out soon after, fell back off that one past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end, far clear of the others. DATSWHATILIKE in the second flight off the
inside, in some traffic late in the final turn, proved no match for the top pair in the drive, narrowly saved the show.l. STARVICTORY turned in an even effort,
between foes inside the furlong marker, outkicked for the show spot. HOPE FOR CHANGE broke on top, set the pace for five furlongs, gave way when
headed by the runner up in the far turn. VALIANT DEFENDER last away, was never a threat in trailing throughout. OPENING QUARTER MILE
FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MISTAKE PRESENT forwardly placed off the inside, advanced three wide into the lane, came in to soundly bump WHENTHEDOVESCRY, dueled with that
one to the wire, brushed with that same rival late, gained the nod at the wire. WHENTHEDOVESCRY closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch,
moved on that one while between rivals into the stretch, bumped by MISTAKE PRESENT when straightened for home, dueled with that one to the wire,
exchanged brushes late, missed. ONEHOLYLION settled behind the pace inside, continued to save ground when moving slightly closer entering the stretch,
proved no match for the top two in the run to the wire. WARRIORS GEM lacked early foot, asked along late in the turn, improved position to be gaining for
the show while also not a threat to the top pair. MEDAL OF COURAGE went one paced throughout while racing in mid pack. OUACHITA failed to menace
while racing outside. DIXIE BEAT fell back after the start and was always outrun. BLACK JUSTICE last away, was used to move up and clear before a
quarter, continued to show the way through the turn then caved when confronted by the top two entering the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF WHENDOVESCRY AGAINST MISTAKE PRESENT
FOR INTERFERECNE IN UPPER STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
BODE'S LIGHT broke well, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed after five furlongs, clear into the lane, continued to maintain
daylight past the furlong marker, enough left to hold off the runner up in the final strides. SNIVELING forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back
steadily in the run up the backstretch, lodged a nice three wide move to reach contention turning for home, saw that progress stall a bit midstretch, coming
again late to miss. RARE STRAIN settled off the pace, continued one paced into the stretch while toward the inside, finished up evenly to prove best of the
rest. CONATIVE lacked speed for six furlongs, picked off some tiring rivals to improve position without posing a serious threat. STEAL IT BACK raced back
in the main body off the inside, continued back to lack a closing response. WILD ONE FOREVER off a bit slow, trailed much of the way off the inside,
fanned six wide into the stretch, also passed faltering rivals while not a threat. SUGARLAND EXPRESS forwardly placed in the early, going tired while five
wide exiting the final turn. LUCKY BREAK dueled up front off the inside, four wide when giving way turning into the stretch, continued to falter and was
jogged in far back. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

OUTLAW X. off the pace and the inside for a half, asked along late turn, four wide when commencing his rally, accelerated past the furlong marker and
finished full of run to win going away. FREUDIAN SIP void of speed inside, continued to save ground through the turn, made a belated run up the rail to
narrowly annex the place. FAMILIAR RHYTHM also lacked any early foot, came four wide and behind the winner into the lane, shifted out widest for the
drive, also lodged a late and willingly rally to narrowly miss the place. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI took command after the start, set the pace, expanded that
advantage past the furlong marker, caved in when confronted late. QUALITY PRODUCTION forwardly placed, chased the leader past the furlong marker
and was also found lacking late. WAYFARING STRANGER within striking distance, lacked a closing punch. HALF A BITE back off the pace and the inside,
five wide turning for home, failed to rally. SOUTHPINE GIFT made little impact in remaining back. RUSTON VOW closest to the leader for a half, gave way.
TENSAS TALK off a step slow and trailed throughout. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT MISSING DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WILD BERT away away in good order, briefly raced with the winner early along the inside, chased that one through the turn and crept a bit closer in the two
path late in the bend, shifted out further for the drive, proved no match, clearly second best. MAY HOUR back off the pace toward the inside, came in the
two path for the drive, lengthy duel for the show spot, edging away for that position, no threat to the top two. HAIL STATE forwardly paced off rail, moved
slightly closer in the three path late turn, lacked a further advance while dueling for the third spot, weakened. CHIMNEY ROCK off a bit slow, trailed most of
the way and was never a threat. BLACK SWORD in mid pack early, lacked a response in the drive while very wide down the lane. VIOLENT WAYS broke
alertly, used a bit to clear and work way to the inside, set all the pace, drew out through the lane in a sharp effort. BIG BAND'S LUCK steady fade off the
inside.

Footnotes
POINT OF VICTORY away well from the outside, alternated up front in the run up the backstretch off the inside, continued to duel far turn, shook clear into
the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage to the wire under firm handling. RACELYNN settled off the inside, continued inside into the turn, steered out
three wide turning for home, rallied for the place while not a threat to the top two. CRIDER CHASE broke on top, set or forced the pace inside the winner for
a half, first to blink turning for home. GLADS LOVE CAT forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, went evenly through
the lane. CYBER SNEAKER in mid pack while racing outside, five wide into the lane, bothered slightly in upper stretch, lacked a serious closing response.
FLAT ROSE lacked speed, came four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally. KLEINMEISTER void of speed, also was four wide out of the turn,
improved a bit in upper stretch while coming out a bit, flattened out in the drive. MADELYN'S MOMENT reared, broke in a tangle to spot the field several
lengths, remained always back while wide. MISS HURRYUPNWAIT within striking distance early, stopped through the stretch, jogged in.
