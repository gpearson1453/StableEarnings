Footnotes
CREATIVE MIND, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, continued in a protracted skirmish for
command while being headed between calls late but held DARK SOLUTION grudgingly to the end under firm handling. The latter gained terms attending
the winner's pace under light reserve racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue racing into upper stretch to strike the front late but was outfinished.
SMARTY ALEX was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled three deep after a half while moving to position in second
flight, was urged to bid in that path racing into the lane but finished evenly late. TOUR THE WORLD settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep between foes into the stretch and continued to make mild progress. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY angled to the
inside tracking off the first flight racing to the far turn but lacked a closing bid. OXWOOD, caught in tight quarters just after the start, was held up along the
inside racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. SWAMPDRAINER, raced three wide into the first turn, shifted inwards to track the leaders
outside a rival in second flight and steadily faded into the far turn. BIZ KID ducked inwards at the start, tracked off the second flight between foes to the first
turn and dropped out early.

Footnotes
MY BOY LOLLIPOP, caught four wide in the opening stages, was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance nearing upper stretch, gained contention between rivals in the lane, then altered course five wide in the closing stages while
continuing with a steady late bid to prevail under pressure. SIERRA HOTEL, forwardly placed three deep in early stages, was rated off the second flight
outside a rival racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch exchanging some contact with I'M AN EIGHT but continued willingly
to challenge for command while being outkicked by the winner. STITZY was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance racing into the far turn, split rivals nearing upper stretch, then angled to the rail when presented an opening to challenge for command midstretch
but lacked the needed final kick. I'M AN EIGHT, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn, was carried out three deep by the
pacesetter bidding between foes entering upper stretch, was bumped lightly near midstretch and weakened late. MINNESOTA LUCKY sped to the lead
along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, shifted out while being roused to resist several challengers but gave out between foes late. SO ALIVE
settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. MESA SKYLINE, bumped at the start, settled
outside foes to the backstretch and never gained contention. IRISH MAJOR proved no factor. TEDDY TIME, off a bit slowly, proved no threat. REAL LUTE
switched out three wide tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch and dropped back early. COPPER FIDDLE angled to the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch and emptied out racing through the far turn.

BAYOU COLONEL was urged inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening stages, edged forward nearing the turn, shook clear racing into upper stretch
and was kept to firm encouragement. TWISTED DIXIE was rated off the second flight between foes in early stages, angled to the inside nearing the turn,
saved ground to upper stretch and came through close quarters to edge a rival for the place honors late. RUNAWAY HARRY, urged prompting a rival's
pace racing through the backstretch into the turn, weakened in upper stretch. OUT RUN'M tracked off the first flight between foes into the turn and
continued evenly late. BRASKA settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. R DIXIE DIAMOND proved no factor. WIND OF DISCRETION
was off slowly and never gained contention.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER, pulling inside rivals, then steadied in close quarters racing just off the pacesetter into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper
stretch to advance through close quarters between foes, then continued with a steady bid to prevail in time under some left handed pressure and confident
handling. TORENO was rated between foes racing just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, altered three deep after the opening three sixteenths, was
urged to press the pacesetter into upper stretch but couldn't contain the winner while edging a rival for the place honors. PERFECT FANNY, urged to the
lead while angling inwards setting the pace a bit off the rail, angled to the rail dictating terms on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, dueled for
command to late stages but was outkicked. P CLUB, forced inwards while shifting into the path of COMPANY STORE at the start, angled to the inside
tracking just off the leaders, gained momentum shifting off the inside midway through the turn, was urged to bid between foes, then steadied out of tight
quarters in upper stretch, altered course four wide in the lane and continued with a mild bid while failing to gain terms with the leaders. RUSTY CAGE broke
inwards bumping P CLUB, was righted to pursue the leaders three deep into the turn to lodge a brief bid nearing the lane but shifted inwards and gave out
abruptly nearing midstretch. COMPANY STORE, bumped, then forced inwards while being steadied out of tight quarters just after the break, shifted outside
foes racing into the turn, was forced wide into upper stretch and never gained contention.

Footnotes
HEART ON THE RUN was urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail racing into the turn, turned back a rival's challenge nearing
upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin under firm encouragement. SKY HIGH SUSAN tracked the pacesetter in the four path from within striking
distance racing to the turn, continued with a steady effort in that path into the lane and narrowly prevailed for the place honors between foes on the wire.
LIPSTICK LADY, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter from the outset into the lane, weakened in late stages. LATIN NIKKITA tracked the leaders
inside foes off the second flight racing through the backstretch, came around a tiring foe racing into the lane, then angled sharply to the rail in late stages to
just miss for second. REID'S FANGIRL tracked off the second flight racing well off the inside into the turn, was fanned five wide in upper stretch and
continued with a mild bid. LEX K tracked the leaders between rivals in second flight in early stages, angled to the rail entering the turn and steadily faded
into the lane. JACKIES IRISHDREAM settled between foes out of striking distance early, angled to the inside racing into the bend but proved no threat.
ANNIE M, held up outside foes in early stages, failed to menace. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE hopped at the start and never gained contention. ELLA'S VISION
broke slowly and never seriously menaced. KEBA LUCKY DAY dropped out early.

SHES GOT IT settled inside foes dropping off the second flight racing through the backstretch, gathered momentum entering the turn, swung four wide
nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest command and go clear under pressure. BRAHMS IS WHO tracked off the second
flight outside foes racing to the turn, was fanned five wide entering the lane and proved best of the others. DROP O' CHOCOLATE was hustled to the lead
along the inside, set the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch and gave out in late stages. AIR WALKER settled between foes in the last flight early,
angled to the rail racing into the turn and continued with an effort to gain some position inside foes late. PRETTI TA KELA tracked the leader inside foes in
second flight racing to the turn, lost some ground while shifting off the inside leaving the midway point of the bend, then angled out to race four wide
between foes into upper stretch but had no rally. ARNOLD'S PATSY tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to the turn and
faded into upper stretch. AKSARBEN SUMMER tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing into the turn and came up empty midstretch.

Footnotes
O'BABE broke sharply to gain a clear advantage in the opening stages, dictated the pace in the three path on a narrow advantage through the backstretch,
moved clear racing into the bend while angling to the inside and widened the advantage through the lane under firm encouragement. LUCY'S LOOKIN
LEFT was urged along the rail to prompt the pacesetter inside foes racing into the turn, continued in pursuit of the leader while switching outside that foe
entering the lane but proved no match. SAINT SARENA broke slowly, then bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the lane and
continued with interest to gain some position. SUMMER FIREFLYS tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing into the turn and faded
between foes into the stretch. THE CHAMPS KID, bumped at the start, was righted to track just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn but gave
way into upper stretch. RUNNERS HEAT, off slowly, never gained contention. GRAY FILLAY ducked out at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
EVEN PANDURA vied for command between foes through the backstretch, was taken in hand when conceding the lead racing through the turn, shifted out
three wide racing into upper stretch and produced a solid second effort to regain the advantage in time under right handed pressure. MOCHA KISS tracked
off the first flight inside foes in the opening quarter, saved ground through the bend, then continued willingly along the rail to challenge for command inside
foes late while being just outkicked by the winner. PEAK OF CHIC, pinched back at the start, switched out five wide early, was hustled to advance on the
leaders shifting inwards crossing the paths of ULTRA CORDIAL and LIBERTY FLIES racing into the turn, gained a brief advantage nearing upper stretch
but failed to sustain that momentum in the last furlong. LASTING INFLUENCE broke outwards bumping at the start, was switched off the inside while being
prompted to advance between foes, was shuffled out of close quarters midway through the backstretch, then continued with interest in the closing stages to
split foes three deep while making some belated progress to improve position. JUST SPLENDID tracked off the first flight four wide early, altered course
shifting to the inside avoiding traffic nearing the turn to race between foes to the lane but had no rally. COCO LOCO MAMA switched out to race six wide on
the backstretch and failed to menace. ULTRA CORDIAL tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, was steadied while being shuffled out of
tight quarters midway through the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. SWEET AS CANBE, urged inside foes prompting the pace from the outset,
gave way racing into the turn. LIBERTY FLIES joined the pace three wide in early stages, lost her path racing into the turn and gave way abruptly.

Footnotes
RIVERBOAT GAMBLER, forwardly placed six wide racing on terms with the first flight through the backstretch, shifted inwards racing into the turn while
being urged to wrest the advantage three deep leaving the three furlong marker, opened a clear advantage nearing upper stretch and responded to firm
encouragement to widen the advantage. CRIME SPREE, in touch with the leaders four wide between foes tracking just off the pace in early stages,
continued with a steady effort in that path racing to upper stretch and proved best of the others. DRIED PEPPER, reserved along the rail dropping off the
second flight racing into the turn, swung out sharply in upper stretch to race five wide in the final furlong and continued well enough to gain a share.
SOMETHING SUPER, forwardly placed five wide between foes in the opening stages, dropped off the first flight racing into the turn and continued evenly
into the lane. PRINCE RAMA tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and continued with an even effort
between rivals. MINE MY TIME tracked off the first flight outside foes racing three deep to the bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but had no rally.
CAN IMAGINE, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. LOUIS LE GRANDE broke awkwardly
and failed to menace. JIMMY'S MARCO, reserved between foes in early stages, proved no threat. CANDY PRINCE broke readily, vied briefly for command
three wide between foes on the backstretch but gave way early. VEGAS GUY, urged inside foes pressing the pace racing into the turn, gave way abruptly
entering the stretch.

Footnotes
MOONSHINE MOXY, urged between foes disputing the pace from the outset, shook clear nearing upper stretch and continued under firm encouragement
to maintain the advantage to the end. CRAZY GOOD tracked off the first flight four wide in the opening quarter, was prompted to advance three wide racing
through the turn to upper stretch and continued willingly to the end to close the gap. LAURA N LUKAS tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along
the rail racing into the turn, angled out to the three path in upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. CANTERBURY GOLD, urged inside
foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way in the drive. COSTANARMANDALEG stumbled at the start, was collected, then continued
evenly between foes into the stretch. PEARL HASTHE MUSIC was outpaced early. FORTHELOVEOFLYDIA was urged three deep prompting the pace
through the backstretch and dropped out early. HOLY STAR DISLODGED HER RIDER IN THE POST PARADE, NECESSITATING HER LATE SCRATCH.

Footnotes
FEEDING FRENZY angled to the inside stalking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, was urged to advance inside the leaders to gain terms with the
first flight after a half, moved to challenge for command nearing the far turn racing along the rail, continued under stout pressure in a prolonged drive and
edged clear late. ITWASTHEDEVILSIDEA, caught four wide between foes racing to the first turn, dropped off the second flight while angling to the inside
racing into the backstretch, was steadied when losing his path momentarily to the eventual winner nearing the half mile marker, tracked just off the leaders
into the second bend, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and edged a rival for the place honors late. KOVACS joined the pace three wide
racing into the first turn, pressed the pace outside the eventual winner racing through the far turn into the lane but yielded to that foe late. TOP DOG tracked
the pace outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper stretch and made an effort to gain some position while no real
threat. TIMBER LADY settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and passed inside tiring rivals. EMMETT CAT,
urged between foes pressing the pace into the backstretch, gave way after a half. HEAVENLY GAZEBO tracked off the first flight between foes in early
stages, continued in pursuit of the leaders three wide to the lane and gave out in the drive. SHAKELAS DESTINY, caught five wide racing into the first turn,
never gained contention. MODRIC, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing to the backstretch, emptied out abruptly after a half.

DIRTY DEEDS tracked just off the leaders in the four path racing through the backstretch, angled sharply to the rail nearing the turn, continued with a
steady bid to gain terms with the pacesetter bidding inside that foe midstretch and edged forward under firm handling. SQUARED STRAIGHT was urged
disputing the pace a bit off the rail racing through the backstretch, edged away to a clear advantage entering the turn, dueled outside the winner past
midstretch but yielded to that rival late. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK was settled off the second flight along the rail racing to the turn, angled out five wide in
upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share in late stages. DIABLO CUERNO tracked off the first flight along the rail in the opening
quarter, was steadied momentarily when losing his path to the eventual winner racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid.
LOW TIDE WARNING broke inwards bumping, dropped out last early and never gained contention. MEDICINE MAN stumbled at the start, was quickly
righted, then urged pressing the pace outside a rival racing to the turn but gave way early. UNCLE FRANK tracked off the second flight three deep racing to
the turn and faded between foes into the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF DIABLO CUERNO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE TURN BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
