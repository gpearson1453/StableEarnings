Footnotes
OCTOBER SURPRISE settled off the early pace in the two path, moved out to be three wide onto the backstretch, moved slightly closer into the far turn,
roused when straightened for home, bid, took over with a sixteenth remaining, enough left to hold off the runner up safe late. OH MY ACHING ARCH rated
off the pace while saving ground, continued to be patiently handled into the far turn, asked along late in that bend, steered out four wide for the drive,
finished willingly to be steadily getting to the winner late. DECLARE WAR lacked early foot, improved toward the inside turning for home, steered out a bit
around a tiring rival with less than a furlong remaining, little late gain on the top two, best of the rest. SANDBAGGER AL sprinted clear to set the pace,
moderate fractions inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage approaching the furlong marker, weakened when headed by the winner late to lose a
couple more positions in the final strides. SIR POKERFACE void of early foot, moved out and made a middle move into contention on the outside second
turn, flattened out in the drive. THE BIG IRISHMAN chased the leader for five furlongs, gave way final turn.

Footnotes
ACHANCETOWIN in the second flight in the run into the turn off the inside, challenged between rivals entering the stretch, shook clear with a furlong
remaining then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. SILVER MAID off a step slow, lacked early foot, came three wide and behind the winner
turning for home, slowly getting to that rival late, well clear of the others. AMELIA'S ANGEL moved up to duel up front closest to the inside soon after the
start, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner entering the stretch, weakened while saving the show late. AMBER PASS broke alertly, dueled up front in
the two path into the turn, got out through the bend, drifted out stretch while weakening. LA LOLA headed up the second flight, crept a bit closer late in the
turn, carried out five wide by AMBER PASS into the stretch, went evenly to the wire. PHANTOM POINT back off the pace while racing outside, was six wide
outside of traffic turning into the stretch, failed to muster a closing response.

early going, made a steady advance into contention the middle half, challenged three wide into the straight, gained the advantage and was briefly clear
inside the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the second spot. RESPOSADO narrowly set the pace along the inside, dueled
through the second turn, briefly held her position in midstretch and then weakened, comfortably maintained the show. WHO DAT GREY pressed the pace
from the outside, dueled and held a slight advantage turning for home then faltered. HILLY in mid pack early, began to fade after five furlongs, finished well

ARCHIE broke alertly, relinquished the advantage soon after, rejoined the leader to duel up the backstretch off the inside, held a narrow advantage into the
lane, long drive while between rivals, proved best in a game effort. BINDING settled off the pace, moved closer behind horses late in the final turn, moved
out for the drive, set down, closed well late to narrowly miss. TRIVISTA in the second flight, advanced and challenged three wide and outside the dueling
leaders turning for home, long drive, outkicked by the top two late while between that pair at the wire. IN CHARGE HALO sprinted clear through the first
turn, dueled inside the winner up the backstretch and into the far turn, remained closest to the inside into the lane and then weakened in the run to the wire.
THETRASHMANSCOMING off a step slow, trailed early, was never dangerous in picking off a single tiring rival. COOL INDIVIDUAL remained always back.

WILD MALLORY broke on top, cleared before a furlong, given a breather through the turn, drew out steadily through the stretch under an intermittent right
handed crop. EZEE ENOUGH closest to the winner off the inside early, continued to chase that one through the turn and into the straight, no match in the
run to the wire, fully extended to hold the place. GALAXY THIRTYSIX last away, trailed for three furlongs, came on the outside for the drive, roused, getting
to the runner up late. SUCKERFORAGREY went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. SOCIAL GALAXY raced back off the early pace, also
failed to muster a response in the drive.

LOOKIN FOR LARRY asked a bit after the start to clear from the outside, extended advantage through the turn in hand, continued to widen through the
stretch without being asked for his best. THE THREE KS raced back off the early pace toward the inside, split foes turning for home, chased the winner past
the furlong marker, could do nothing with that rival, edged clear for the place. KANNON WITH A K chased the winner early along the inside, vied for the
runner up position past the furlong marker, outkicked for that position, best of the rest. BRAD EYE fell back to trail for three furlongs, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. RENE'S PRINCE bumped at the start, raced in the second flight for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch
drive. CHURCH POINT broke out, bumped RENE'S PRINCE and was last away, moved up in mid pack while three wide turn,came five wide into the
stretch, backed up.

LIBERTY DIAMOND forwardly placed while racing off the inside, advanced and challenged three wide into the stretch, dueled nearing the furlong marker,
kicked well clear late under steady handling. AKIANE'S SOLDIER back off the pace while racing outside, moved closer four wide turning for home, proved
no match for the winner through the lane, clearly second best. SUMITUP broke in, came in contact with a slow breaking MISS E. FU, was quickly
straightened to show the way up the backstretch along the inside, vied into the lane remaining closest to the inside, weakened the final furlong and was
unable to keep pace with the top two. OAK HILL SENIORITA lacked early foot, three path into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch and finished up evenly.
CITIZENS REWARD off slowly then veered out to steady, spotted the field several lengths as a result, continued to lag turn, picked off a tiring rival while
never a factor. MISS E. FU off slow and was bothered, moved up to a forward position the opening quarter, bid, dueled turn, stopped from between horses
in upper stretch, trailed home.

Footnotes
BITSY'S OTHER HALF outrun for five furlongs off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn when commencing his rally, ran by the leader with a
sixteenth to run to win going away. PERMANENTDETENTION broke on top, clear before a quarter, dueled in the run up the backstretch, clear again turning
for home, continued to hold a sizable advantage past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST lacked early foot,
came three wide when moving slightly closer, continued a mild rally to finish well clear of the others. DARK MATTER chased the runner up early, moved up
to duel with that one up the backstretch and into the far turn, began to falter late in the final bend, continued to fade through the lane. COWBOY BRAD
forwardly placed for five furlongs, had little left for the drive. JUSTA SABER broke a step slow and failed to menace. CHARLIE'S STAR in mid pack and
outside through the first turn, was finished after a half.
