Footnotes
MY PAL MATTIE forwardly placed along the inside in the run up the backstretch, shuffled back a bit while continuing to save ground into the turn, remained
along the inside through the bend, lodged a rail bid when straightened for home, kicked well clear to win ridden out. MIZSPELT pressed the issue up front
outside, three to four wide turn, vied into the lane, no match winner. PERFECT PERIGEE broke on top, raced forwardly placed two out to three wide, raced
between horses into the stretch, lacked a significant closing response to finish up best of the rest. YANK CRIME raced off the pace and the inside, also
lacked a meaningful closing response. PIONEER PRIDE away well, showed the way early toward the inside, continued to hold a narrow advantage turning
for home, allowed the winner the inside into the straight, gave way when headed by that rival; soon after. LAST APPEAL threw head just as the gates were
sprung, broke awkwardly to spot the field several lengths, never close in trailing well back.

Footnotes
RICHARDS DREAM never far back while racing outside, ranged up to challenge four wide late in the turn, dueled through upper stretch while remaining well
out in the strip, drove steadily clear the final furlong. IMA SUNNY SONG off a step slow, moved up to a forward position before a quarter, challenged and
put a head in front three wide midway on the turn, dueled into the stretch inside the winner, continued on equal terms past the furlong marker then could not
keep up, remained clear for the place. SHANGHAI BROTHER away well, set the early pace inside, fell back off the top two late in the turn, evenly through
the lane while narrowing the gap slightly late on the runner up. COLE'S SENSATION bumped then steadied at the start, fell back to trail, came four wide into
the lane, improved slightly while not a serious threat. WILD CAJUN GRIP bumped with COLE'S SENSATION at the start, fell back off the early pace and
failed to menace. UNBRIDLED HOPE chased the early leader to that one's outside, began a steady retreat before a half.

MAGAWILDTIME closest to the leader, moved out and joined that one to duel in the two path under restraint backstretch, vied through the final turn, opened
a larger advantage when putting away the other speed approaching the furlong grounds, responded late when challenged, dug in the final strides to
narrowly prevail in game fashion. DEER CROSSING in the second flight while between horses, continued in some traffic final turn, three wide into the lane,
roused for the drive, late bid outside the winner, denied in the final strides. SECRET VISTA fractious in the gate, broke back a bit, settled inside, two path
into the lane, rallied for the show spot while not a threat late to the top two. DRILLING REPORT took command past the wire the first time, clear first turn,
dueled in hand along the inside backstretch, continued to contest the issue second turn, proved stubborn until inside the furlong marker. DREWHUSTLE fell
back to trail after the start, moved out, came five wide into the lane, lacked the needed closing response to finish up evenly. DUSTY BOY within striking
distance off the inside, raced four wide out of the final turn, had nothing for the stretch run.

MAINTAINANCE MATT lacked speed outside, began to advance while four wide into the turn, reached the front turning for home, dueled past the furlong
marker, held sway under steady handli.ng. MUCHO MARVIN broke alertly, set the pace inside, continued to show the way turn, responded when confronted
by the winner entering the stretch from the outside, dueled, gave ground grudgingly. DEBONNAIRE DUDE in the second flight toward the inside, two path
into the lane, rallied from between horses the final furlong to gain the show. LITTLE TOE chased the leader off the inside for a half, gradually weakened
through the stretch. MISTAKE PRESENT forwardly placed early along the inside, also began to fade entering the stretch while remaining inside. GIANT
MESA failed to menace. BROADWAY ICE fell well back after the start, remained sluggish and was well beaten after jogging in.

Footnotes
REAL CITY SPEED asked a bit early to make the early advantage, shook well clear in the turn, steadily increased that advantage through the lane under a
firm hand ride to win ridden out. FIREINTHESTORM broke in forcing TIZNOW WIND inward, moved up after the start to the second flight, raced three wide
through the turn, finished willingly to be up for the place, no threat to the winner. BIG RESULTS broke well, raced forwardly into the turn, chased the winner
through the bend, had nothing for that one through the lane, caught late for the place. BROKEN RIB reluctant to load, broke in mid pack, lacked speed,
raced four out to five wide through the turn, improved position while not a serious threat to the top three. WAITA MINUTE HAYES raced in mid pack, saved
ground through the turn, improved slightly while also not posing a serious threat. THE BIG SHOW broke with the field, raced one paced off the inside, had
little left late. ST JOE broke well from the outside, raced closest to the leader early while well clear of the others, began a steady retreat before three
furlongs. GOLDUSTER settled off the pace, lacked a response in the drive. TIZNOW WIND forced in at the start, remained always back. BOLD MOON
broke in, was never closet to be outrun. IRON N STEEL off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CUSTOM GULCH broke back, moved up early into contention late backstretch, dueled through the turn off the inside, shook off that rival into the lane, clear
past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe under steady handling. TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH last away, moved out, four wide advance into the turn,
lost some ground to the winner while forwardly place into the stretch, chased that one past the furlong marker and was slowly gaining late, clearly second
best. CAJUN SHOTS in the second flight early off the inside, lost some slight position to the top two in the turn, went evenly through the stretch to finish well
clear of the others. TYPHOON ZING sprinted clear after the start, dropped to the inside, dueled through the turn inside the winner, weakened in the drive.
EXOTIC TOWN lacked speed outside, four wide into the lane, failed to menace. FORTHELOVEOFLUCY forwardly placed along the inside, shortened stride
into the turn, pulled up in apparent distress, vanned off.

Footnotes
ONEROLLOFTHEDICE back off the pace and the inside, ranged up four wide to lodge a bit turning for home, exchanged a brush with the runner up, put a
head in front with a furlong remaining, lost the advantage a sixteenth out, came back in determined fashion to put a head in front at the wire. FOUR
PRINCESSES chased the early leader off the inside, advanced and challenged late in the turn, three wide into the lane, brushed with the winner entering
the stretch, headed nearing the furlong marker, regained the advantage late, grudgingly relinquished the advantage in the final strides to miss in a game
effort. SOUTHERN LIAISON within striking distance, came three wide through the turn, lacked a winning bid in the drive to prove no match for the top pair.
BROKE FINANCING forwardly placed early along the inside, lost some position through the turn while continuing to save ground, moved out a bit for the
drive and went evenly to the wire. SHE'S GONE D'WILD back off the pace while racing three wide, lacked a closing kick. COBRA CASABLANCA took over
soon after the start, set the pace for three furlongs inside, faltered when headed by the top two late in the turn.

Footnotes
SPECIAL STORM broke forwardly, prompted the issue up the backstretch while three wide, moved to challenge late in the turn, dueled into and through
upper stretch, drew clear the final furlong under steady handling. COMERUNNINBOYS back off the early pace, in the two path turn, split foes late in the
bend, finished willingly to be edging away for the place. BIG BOSS MAN broke alertly, set or forced the pace off the inside, dueled with the winner inside
that one upper stretch, weakened and was caught for the second spot. NO QUARTER settled in mid pack off the inside, moved out and came four wide into
the lane, improved position slightly while not a threat to the top trio. RIVER KING void of speed, passed some tiring rivals while also not posing a serious
threat. IZZY B WINN last away, trailed, also picked off a couple of faltering rivals while not dangerous. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE dueled up front closest to
the inside, gave way just before a half. SHADY MONKEY popped stall doors prior to the start, broke in good order, raced forwardly and three wide, stopped
in the drive.
