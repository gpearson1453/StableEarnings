winner. JILLY FROM JERSEY close up early, dropped back on the turn then came on again late in the six path. READY TO CHARM battled for the early
lead towards the inside, dropped back on the turn, altered course off the rail to the four path in mid stretch then finished evenly. BLACK BUTTE close up

SUN DRESS never far back, passed rivals rapidly three wide on the turn, made the lead before the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip under a
strong hand ride to win as much the best. BAD KARMA close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide near the quarter pole then was no match for the
winner. TALKBACK stalked the pace three wide and finished with good courage two wide. COSI MOMOSI failed to menace. ARROWSPHERE pressed the
pace along the inside into the stretch and weakened late. MOR BREEZE set the early pace two wide then stopped.
