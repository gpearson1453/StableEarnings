Footnotes
DECREE OF LOVE stalked the pacesetter through early stages, came three wide into the lane then advanced to challenge DAISY BEE for the lead, gained
a clear advantage at the eighth pole and stayed sharp under steady pressure. HARDSPUN WOMAN rated off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane,
angled in a few paths while gaining down the stretch and got up late to take place. DAISY BEE stalked the pace, made a bid late on the turn, vied for the
lead with the winner at the quarter pole, could not move on with rival but sustained bid then got edged late for place. CANDY KICK got bumped at the start
and settled off the pace, hustled up two wide in the upper stretch and had a mild improve. SEIVER rated near midpack, saved ground into the lane, headed
in pursuit up the inside through the stretch and needed more for late impact. DECK OF CARDS tracked the pace positioned in range of the early leaders,
came three wide into the lane, shifted fiver wide under pressure and lacked a needed rally. MISSION BELLE was unhurried, raced two wide late on the turn
then shifted out widest in the upper stretch and posed no threat. TWIN CAUSE raced in the last flight along the outside going by the half mile marker, was
ridden along into the lane, had a mild improve then flattened out. BRASH set the pace, got collared by rival leaving the far turn then gave way.
CARIOQUINHA was ridden along three to four wide in the lane and failed to move on. HADLEN was reserved in the back, saved ground into the upper
stretch and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
STAR COMMAND was allowed to settle and save ground through early stages, shifted out approaching the upper stretch, edged up closer then launched a
five wide bid nearing the furlong marker, advanced to challenge RECORDED in deep stretch, dug in under firm handling and edged by. RECODED was a
bit stubborn to load, tracked the top pair through early stages, raced four paths wide into the lane, vied for the lead at the eighth pole, held a slim lead,
fought back gamely when confronted by STAR COMMAND but got denied in final strides. SPANX LEGACY raced in range and saved ground into the lane,
launched a bid up the inside at the quarter pole, raced up close with a sixteenth left to run then finished evenly. DANCE RHYTHMS was forwardly
positioned through early stages, launched a two to three wide bid at the head of the lane, vied for the lead mid-stretch then had no closing response.
GAMBLIN TRAIN edged up closer late on the turn, given cue two wide at the head of the lane, raced in range at the quarter pole then flattened out.
COUNTRY CHICK raced off the pace, hustled up three wide then shifted wider in the drive and failed to kick on. FLASH N' DANCE was away in good order
and set the pace, held on top at the head of the lane then got headed and gave way. ROGUE TOO raced along the outside not too far back in the opening
quarter then had no response when called upon. TILTINGATWINDMILLS trailed around the turn, stayed outside and never menaced.

a clear lead out of the gate, held on top into the lane, continued with a narrow advantage over RUSYLER down the stretch, reached equal terms with rival in
deep stretch, fought back from the inside then got edged out in final strides. CHEEKY CHAPS raced in contention positioned off the top two leaders, hustled

SOCIAL CHATTER was well rated off the early leaders while never too far back, got clear four to five wide near the furlong marker, gathered sharp
momentum under steady pressure and surged clear nearing the wire. MINER'S QUEEN cleared on top and angled closer to the inside, set the pace and
remained on top by a slim margin in the upper stretch, dueled with TOP OF CLASS in deep stretch, stayed on gamely from the inside and got denied when
winner swept by late. TOUCH OF CLASS raced up close tracking the pacesetter, went five paths wide into then lane, advanced to duel with MINER'S
QUEEN in late stages, stayed on gamely then lacked a final bid. LUBNA (GB) raced in range along the outside around the turn, hustled up six wide at the
quarter pole, sustained a steady bid then closed with response and gained closer contention. TETELLA saved ground through early stages, tipped out three
wide for the drive, raced in traffic past the quarter pole then got clear and finished evenly. MADAME READY raced just off the early pacesetter, had aim on
the leader a furlong out then weakened late. CAROLINE'S STORY raced near midpack in the opening quarter, hustled along three wide in the upper stretch
and failed to kick on. MOMENTOUS MISS chased the pace around the turn then failed to keep pace in the lane. TARANTA (IRE) lacked speed, raced along
the outside in the lane and had no response.

DRESSED was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the turn, edged up closer then tipped three wide in the upper stretch, roused
forward three deep in late stages, cleared on top then pulled away. MY DAWN was away in good order and angled closer to the inside, tracked the
pacesetter around the turn, headed in pursuit and vied for the lead with PIPELINE GIRL in the final furlong, failed to be a match when the winner rallied by
and had to settle for second best. PIPELINE GIRL cleared on top and angled in from the outside post, set the pace around the turn, continued on top by a
narrow margin in the upper stretch, vied for the lead with MY DAWN in the final furlong, was no match for the sharp winner in deep stretch but stayed on
and held a share. TIZPLENTY raced up close around the turn, roused forward along the inside in the stretch, remained in strong contention at the furlong
marker the lacked the needed kick for serious impact. TRADE SECRET tracked in close range, launched a bid in the four path in the upper stretch, raced in
contention then flattened out. DEVINE CHARGER steadied along the inside in early stages and lost position, was set down driving five wide in the lane and
responded evenly. STREET TAPPER rated off the early pace, was not far back late on the turn, hustled up five wide in the upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. LITTLE LUCERITO settled early and saved ground into the lane, launched a bid up the inside and failed to kick on. OFF RAMP hustled up
along the outside at the quarter pole and came up empty. MARIAH'S CANDY showed response in opening stages then steadied, dropped back and never
threatened. TAYLOR'S SECRET saved ground late on the turn and had no response when called upon. BAYTOWN VALLEYGIRL was reserved in the back
and made no impact.

Footnotes
FAMILY WAY stalked the pace through early stages and remained well placed just off the top two leaders late on the final turn, raced in striking distance at
the eighth pole, vied in deep stretch, dug in three deep under pressure and edged away. LA LUNE (GB) raced off the early speed, picked up the pace past
the half mile marker, prompted into contention, vied between foes in deep stretch and got edged out in final strides. GO BIG BLUE NATION tracked in
range, hustled up at the head of the lane, vied for the lead down the stretch, battled back from the inside then lacked a closing kick. LUCK MONEY rated
through early going, was not far back late on the final turn, raced five paths wide in the upper stretch, prompted into closer contention but lacked the needed
response for serious impact. STAND TALL vied for the early lead then edged back to track along the rail, tipped out three wide in the upper stretch and
finished evenly. MICHELINE raced near midpack, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. THREE FLAMINGOS settled off the early pace,
went six paths wide into the lane and failed to move on. EESHA MY FLOWER raced off the pace then four to five wide in the lane and never threatened.
BLAME DEBBIE vied for the early lead then held clear on top around the turn and tired in the drive. NAOMI BROADWAY (BRZ) saved ground and failed to
menace. JOY OF TREASURE settled inside and had no response when called upon. PALLAS ATHENE stalked in close contention then faded around the
final turn.

out late on the final turn, accelerated three deep mid-stretch, quickly cleared on top then geared down late. TIME FOR TROUBLE stalked the pace through
middle stages, vied for the lead around the final turn, fought back in the upper stretch then failed to be a match when confronted by the winner, stayed on
and secured second best. ZANESVILLE raced off the early pace then prompted into contention around the final turn, went four paths wide into the lane
sustained steady response and cleared the rest. JIMMY D raced near mid-range, picked up the pace leaving the final turn, went five wide into the lane and
had a mild improve. ENGLISH CHALLENGE settled early then edged up closer past the half mile marker, shifted out three wide for the drive, made mild
progress in the upper stretch then flattened out. HERECOMESYOURMAN stalked the pacesetter and came up empty in the lane. MOGOWAN cleared on
top after the start, set the pace through middle stages then dropped back. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO settled out of the gate and raced three wide around the
