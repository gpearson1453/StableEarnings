holding under wide pressure. SHY GUY stalked the pace looming into upper stretch extending abreast the leader in the four and five paths being right there
at the end. SOUND OFF dropped back early lagging through the far turn, taken ten wide in upper stretch found stride coming quickly at the end needing one
more jump. WORTHY TURK slow early lost ground to lane finding best stride late seven wide. JOHN'S ROCK raced evenly in mid pack remaining in range
to upper stretch lacking a closing punch. TORO DE TORO stalked the pace chasing close up into the lane weakening under a drive near mid track. SILVER

Footnotes
GLAMOROUS LIFE went evenly to mid turn giving a quick burst three deep into upper stretch blowing clear being ridden out. SUGAR HAPPY stalked the
pace chasing on the turn, was steadied briefly when in close between horses past the three sixteenths pole quickly recovering to save place on the inside.
BOUJEE KITTEN raced evenly to upper stretch moving in the three path there holding spot late. EKATI'S HONEY slow early was bumped by a tiring pace
setter near the eighth pole finishing evenly as no menace. NEEDACARCALLLOUIE played no factor. MAPPED OUT gave way on the turn. MAMMA J broke
sharply setting a clear pace through the turn then stopped abruptly in upper stretch. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SUGAR HAPPY AGAINST
THE RIDER OF GLAMOROUS LIFE FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE SIXTEENTHS POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.

DILEMMA sent clear set the pace widening a bit into upper stretch holding firm in the three path. TRINNI CUTIE PIE chased on the turn saving ground to
upper stretch proving willing on the rail though second best. MISTERKAPLAN raced evenly through the turn mustering enough down the lane to best the
others. VOODOOISM chased the pace through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. HONOR THE TAB slow early played no factor. CAUSELUCK was
never involved. POSH TOTTY was always outrun. MISS UTOPIA veered in bumping at the break, a step slow after tired to lane.
