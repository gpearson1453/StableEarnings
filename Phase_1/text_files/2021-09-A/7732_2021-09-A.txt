Footnotes
SUMMERTIME BANDIT broke alertly, soon got clear, rated a bit in the run through the turn, drew out through the stretch while under brisk handling the final
furlong. MY LITTLE FIRE forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch while in the two path, came three wide into the lane, chased the winner past the
furlong marker, proved no match for that one, drew clear for the place. SISTER CHLOE lacked early foot off the inside, came four wide into the straight,
rallied late for the show. TRACK SMART away in good order with the winner, chased that one for a half, no match, faltered final furlong. SARAH ADRIANA
broke in and slowly, moved up to mid pack inside, steadied when in tight quarter nearing the three furlong marker, moved out, went evenly to the wire.
DEVIL WITH A DASH fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to lag far turn, closed some of that large gap with some mild late interest. BOURBON
BLUES in the main body outside for three furlongs, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
CUSTOM KAT broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight in the two path, shifted out to be three wide for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up
in time outside the pacesetter. RELAX TOWN narrowly showed the way out of the chute, dueled through the turn in the two path, continued on equal terms
with that rival upper stretch, put that rival away to garner a slightly larger lead a sixteenth out, failed to contain the winner while remaining clear of the others.
THE THIMBLE broke alertly, raced with the pace onto the main track inside, dueled inside the runner up through the turn, began to weaken past the furlong
marker, narrowly salvaged the show spot. WISE GUY vied up front early three wide in the run up the backstretch, fell back to head up the second flight in
the turn, went evenly through the lane to miss the show. CALLTHEWOLFE went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. ZARAZI last away,
trailed, finished far back in showing little.

Footnotes
EBRIO underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke on top, was hustled well clear past the wire the first time, set a legit pace up the backstretch while
under light restraint, continued to show the way into the straight but by a diminishing margin, responded when confronted late, refused to relent and edged
away again late in a game effort. DECEMBER SEVEN allowed the pace to go early while racing off the inside, came four wide into the lane, challenged
while widest of the lead flight late, denied, all out to hold the place. MAROON MANIAC bothered slightly at the start, raced back, improved while saving
ground into the lane, mild, late bid inside the top pair, not enough for either of those in the final strides. TIGERBEACH broke to the inside, chased the winner
most of the way, moved closer off the inside second turn, continued to apply pressure past the furlong marker then hung up late. LEROY JENKINS last to
leave, remained always back. AVAILABLE STAR forwardly placed in the early going, staged a steady retreat.

JOE G'S PAYBACK broke alertly, showed the way into the turn, continued to show the way into the stretch under light restraint, firmly roused with a left
handed crop just inside the furlong marker when clear, drifted out and continued to slowly expand that advantage under continued steady handling. BIND
ON EARTH within striking distance toward the inside for three furlongs, crept closer while between horses exiting the turn, could not keep pace with the
winner the final furlong, clearlys econd best. BIND ME UP behind the pace while outside, also closed the gap a bit on the winner late in the turn, four wide
into the lane, went evenly to the wire in lacking a further response. BIRDCATMOUSE one paced, lacked a closing response. ROSE RUNNER chased the
winner for three furlongs then gave way in the drive. FLAT SCAT last to leave, continued to race sluggishly up the backstretch, bit rank in the turn, distanced
through the stretch after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
COMMANDER SCOTT cleared soon after the start, held a sizable advantage onto and up the backstraight, continued to hold a comfortable lead into the
stretch, enough left to hold off the runner up. RARE STRAIN lacked early foot while saving ground, began to move late backstretch, angled out three wide
while continuing to advance into the stretch, finished with good energy to be rapidly getting to the winner late, clearly second best. DATSWHATILIKE went
one paced throughout behind the winner to finish up best of the rest while lacking a significant closing response. AND YET ANOTHER chased the winner for
six furlongs, had little left for the drive. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT off a step slow, failed to menace. MAJESTIC SOCIETY remained always back. TIN DELAY
raced outside through the first turn when with the main body, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
CRIMSON ZIP away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, narrowly showed the way past the
furlong marker, drifted out under an initial left handed crop with a sixteenth remaining, came out again to float BOSTON REPO out in the final strides,
narrowly held that foe off at the wire. BOSTON REPO broke alertly, allowed the leader to go early while in close pursuit, advanced to duel in the two path
through the turn, continued on equal terms upper stretch, fell back off that same foe a bit inside the furlong grounds, floated out and bothered when that one
drifted out late, coming back late to narrowly miss. BROADWAY JONES lacked early foot in the two path, began to rally exiting the turn, split foes with less
than a furlong remaining, finished well to be clear of the others. THATS IT IMLEAVING broke back, void of speed for a half, improved position with some
belated interest. BUCKETS reluctant to load, settled in the second flight for three furlongs, had little left for the drive. SONOMA CRUSH broke awkwardly
and remained always back. DIXIE BEAT was finished after three furlongs. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH
DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF BOSTON REPO AGAINST CRIMSON ZIP FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE WANING
STRIDES, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
SPELLBINDING within striking distance into the first turn outside, continued to maintain contact with the leaders up the backstretch, four wide into the lane,
lon g drive, proved best while fully extended at the end. HEART THAT BINDS in hand while also within striking distance, saved ground most of the way,
shifted out around the early leader for the drive, finished willingly to gain the nod for the second spot over than same foe. EXACTA broke on top, set almost
all the pace inside, proved stubborn until the very end, narrowly missed the place. GREAT IN RED forwardly placed while racing off the inside, lacked a
winning kick in the drive. TECATE TIME went one pace throughout to also be found lacking in the late going. EXPLOSIVELY HOT remained back in failing
to rally. ISOLATION pressed the issue for five furlongs and gave way. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS rank, fell far back early.

Footnotes
LEMNISCATE away in good order, raced with the pace from the beginning outside, three wide through the turn when showing the way, pulled away through
the lane while kept to pressure. WIN YA WIN raced in the second group off the inside, steered out four wide turning for home, finished well to be up for the
place, not a threat to the winner. STRONG RULES forwardly placed toward the inside, went evenly through the lane while unable to keep up with his
entrymate, outkicked late for the second spot. TURN ON THE MAGIC lacked speed for a half, improved position through the stretch while not posing a
serious threat. SOUL SONG broke on top, set or forced the pace for a half and gave way. LOVE TO SINGH fell back to trail after the start and was never a
factor. WHENTHEDOVESCRY last to leave, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
POINT OF VICTORY broke with the leaders, showed the way up the backstretch, shrugged off her nearest pursuer turning for home, drew out under brisk
handling. EPONHER broke well, prompted the winner from the outside up the backstretch, moved a bit closer to that one by late in the turn, proved no
match through the lane, clearly second best. CUSTOM MADE broke alertly, raced forwardly and outside, had little for the top two in the drive, narrowly
gained the nod for the show at the wire. OUR LITTLE GIRL bumped start, also raced in the second flight and off the inside, long drive for the show, missed.
KAITLYN'S COURT off a step slow, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. ITS GLITTER TIME raced in mid
pack for a half, backed up through the stretch. STORM CAT'S CRY bumped at the break, steadily faded after a quarter and finished far back.
