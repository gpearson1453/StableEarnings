Footnotes
LITTLE ROSALYN sat just off the pace inside, engaged CAGEY in the far turn, gained the advantage into the lane and drove clear late. TEMPLE OF ZOOM
tracked inside early, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the three sixteenth pole but lacked the rally needed and finished clearly second best. FLASHY
SISTER rated off the pace while three to four wide, chased through the final turn and passed tiring rival. CAGEY contested the early pace racing three wide
leaving the chute, dueled through the final turn but was unable to sustain the bid needed and gave way. HEREVERYWISH sat in range early but lacked a
serious bid.

LIGHT FAST FEET took command away from the gate, saved ground while showing the way, opened up to good margins after the quarter pole and was
kept to tasking under intermittent handling. COUNT ON IT sat in striking position but was no match for the eventual winner and held. CUVEE TEE raced
near the back of the pack, chased through stretch and just held on for show. LA CHICA DE FUEGO trailed the field and bid belatedly. NO COLLUSION
reserved off the pacesetters and tired.

NEVVARE unhurried early, swung out to the four path at the head of the lane and won driving. LANNY MAC raced five wide entering the backstretch,
trailed, chased five wide at the quarter pole and was along late to score place. HERE COMES BARNEY set a pressured pace, dueled outside of
PADDSDAYCHARM then battled into the stretch exchanging brushes, inched clear of the fore mentioned and was caught late. PADDYSDAYCHARM
pressed early from rail, moved up to challenge the lead, dueled gamely inside, brushed outside rival and weakened late stretch. DANCING WILLIE chased
the early dueling pacesetters and faded. RISING REVOLUTION failed to menace.

outside and missed. MIDNIGHT TAKE raced three wide entering the turn and improved late. FOREVER LADY bid belatedly. SOARIN DIVA hurried inside

WISER TIMES led the field through the backstretch while saving ground, was roused at the quarter pole and drew clear. LONESOME CAT tracked from rail,
chased the leader through the stretch and finished second best. IGNITE THE MOON fractious in gate, vied three wide into the opening turn, tracked four to
five wide, chased the leader in the final turn and flattened out in stretch. EXPLORER BILL raced four to five wide into the first turn, hustled outside entering
the lane and lacked a closing response. RYANWATER raced at the back of the back, chased and improved late. VISION QUEST sat mid pack from the
three path and faded inside. BARE BACK JACK failed to menace. PATRICK was gapped early and showed a mild interest late. TANNIN vied two wide
early, raced in closest pursuit from the three path and was done early.

Footnotes
AWESOME KNIGHT dueled outside for the early lead, took pressure through the turn outside of SMILEY, disposed of rival entering the lane, was overtaken
then battled back gamely taking a slim lead and refused to relinquish control. OUR MONEY CAT stalked the pacesetters from the two path, ranged up four
wide at the quarter pole, struck the front into the stretch but was out finished. BONANZA CREEK shuffled back leaving the chute, chased and rallied steadily
outside to earned show honors. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND broke well then was allowed to settle in the four path, lugged in leaving the backstretch, chased
wide improving outside and gave way late. DIVALDO stalked three wide, lodged a mild bid into the lane and flattened. COMMISSION MAN away last to
trailed the field, chased and passed tiring. TORCHLIGHT chased outside and tired. IMPERIALITE settled along rail, chased through the turn and gave way.
BRING HOME STANLEY hustled away after a tardy break, saved ground through the backstretch and faded inside. SMILEY vied inside, pressed from the
rail, was unable to move on with rival nearing the quarter pole and stopped. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of BONANZA CREEK
against the rider of AWESOME KNIGHT alleging interference away from the gate was not allowed.
