Footnotes
VANISHING FAITH set the pace near the inside, and widened steadily through the stretch under pressure. OVERTHEBLUESKY saved ground for nearly a
half-mile, moved out approaching the stretch, and rallied outside to be along for the place. SHES A GIFT chased three to four wide, stayed on her left lead
and lacked a rally. RENEESDREAMGIRL pressed VANISHING FAITH from outside to upper stretch, and faded. AMAZIN QUEEN showed speed for a half,
and tired. DOLCISIMA raced four to five wide around the turn, and went by faders. KATIES A LADY was no factor two wide. HIGH HEAVEN was outrun
three wide. PURE AMBITION was outrun three to four wide. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA tired inside. KINGSTON QUEEN reared at the break spotting the field
five lengths or so, and remained far back. SUSPICIOUSLY SWEET trailed far behind.

Footnotes
BELLE'S KINGDOM rated inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. THATS ALL
SHEWROTE stalked the pace from the rail, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and settled for
second best. MY BEAUTY PRINCESS set the pace along the rail for six furlongs, could not keep pace with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on well
enough to hold third. PARTY SWAGGER hit the starting gate then was shut off at the start, raced well back two wide and improved position in the lane.
JAZZY T was bumped just after the start, saved ground off the pace, checked off heels nearing the quarter pole, swung wide soon after and passed tiring
rivals. UNMARKED MONEY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. EXAGGERATED MOMENT chased the pace three wide, angled in nearing
the quarter pole and came up empty. AMERICAN EMPRESS steadied along inside early, lost action and dropped back nearing the quarter pole, cut the
corner into the lane to make some progress but tired through the final furlong. FASTLIFE chased the pace four wide and retreated through the lane.
SOLDAT TEMPTATION had brief speed three wide. MY TURNING POINTE veered in at the start and bumped JAZZY T, raced well back two wide and
made little further impact. EMPEROR'S SONG pressed the pace two wide and stopped nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BLESSED JOURNEY waited for room inside approaching the five-sixteenths, found a seam and split rivals for clear sailing in the three-path turning for
home, overpowered OLD TIME REVIVAL from outside into the final furlong and pulled away. OLD TIME REVIVAL set the pace in the two-path, proved no
match for the winner leaving the eighth-pole, but held to remain clear of the rest. UNCORK THE BOTTLE raced close up inside to the stretch, and lacked
the needed closing response. TONALISM stumbled at the start and was slowest away, shifted out five wide approaching the stretch, and posed no threat.
SHANANIES PAYNTER raced in range between horses into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, and faded through the last eighth of a mile. DARK
AGES saved ground and failed to menace. DIAMONDS ENJOY pressed the pace outside, and tired after a half-mile.

Footnotes
PHARAOH'S PROPHECY set the pace along the rail, re-cleared around the far turn and held clear under a steady drive. CLASSIC FILM saved ground in
range around the first turn, moved up to bid two wide nearing the half-mile pole, could not quite match strides with the winner around the far turn but kept
trying outside of that foe through the lane and be clearly second best. THE DUNGEON saved ground off the pace, tipped out near the quarter pole and ran
on for the show. PANADERO chased the winner two wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn and was one-paced through the stretch.
UNION FREEDOM was in tight early, raced off the pace two wide early, saved ground around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. STEEL CITY DUDE
played no factor while racing three wide. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM chased three wide and was through after a half.

KIGER pressed ACASEADAY from outside, reached the front after six furlongs, battled through a long drive and held off rivals to his outside while drifting
out slightly. HARD TEN went along in the second flight early, moved out five wide rallying into the stretch, bid between horses through the final stages and
narrowly missed while in tight near the finish. SAMARONTI got pulled off THE BEAST GOES ON at the break, then steadied sharply soon after, lagged well
off the early pace outside, came six wide off the turn, loomed outside the top two through deep stretch but was outfinished. GODS BLESSING settled in the
two-path for six furlongs, was in with a chance among six horses fanned across the track a furlong out, but was outfinished inside the top trio. THE BEAST
GOES ON saved ground into the turn, moved to the two-path past the quarter-pole, challenged inside rivals through the furlong grounds, then flattened out.
MACHO REAL saved ground, made up some ground through upper stretch, then weakened. LAZARETTO raced forwardly through the turn while shifting
out four wide, and tired through the late stages. ACASEADAY set the pace inside, got collared by KIGER after six furlongs, and gave way. AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF HARD TEN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED, SEVEN-FURLONG FRACTION UNAVAILABLE.

PIPER stalked the pace two wide, could not gain in upper stretch, kept trying outside of the pacesetter and was up in the final strides. VIVI'S DREAM'S set a
clear pace along the rail, held clear past the sixteenth pole and succumbed in the final strides. ROYAL HABIBI was sluggish at the start, dropped far back
inside, raced four wide around the far turn and finished strongly outside. CAPTURE THE GENIE chased the pace three wide, had the rider drop the whip in
upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ONE SLICK FACT went evenly while racing two wide. DE PURA SANGRE chased the pace two wide and faded
in the lane. COMPETITIVE STAR had early speed outside, bore out entering the turn, angled back in nearing the quarter pole and had no further bids.

Footnotes
MUTED vied early between BULLET ON TAP and LADY BAFFLED, shook away soon after completing a half-mile, and was kept busy to extend the
advantage. LADY BAFFLED bumped with READY TO RUMBLE at the start, pressed the pace outside rivals, could not go with the winner turning for home,
and went clear for the place. BULLET ON TAP vied early inside rivals, could not go with MUTED into the stretch, got outfinished for second and was much
best of the remainder. CHROME SAVAGE broke slowly, lagged far back for a half, and went by tired horses. FULL OF ATTITUDE broke slowly, fanned six
wide into the lane, and never got close. VINTAGE GIRL stumbled at the start, and raced far back inside. UKIYO was finished early. LILY'S LEAD retired
early inside. READY TO RUMBLE bumped with LADY BAFFLED at the start, raced wide and tired. PRINCESS PUP hopped slightly at the start, and
dropped far back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
KAUFY BEAN set a clear pace inside, held clear under a drive and was vanned off after the finish. AMBASSADOR JIM trailed inside early, advanced two
wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied widest. PLENUM prompted the winner two
wide and was outfinished for the place. TIMMY M. settled off the pace inside, advanced three wide around the far turn and flattened out between foes in the
lane. TRIPLE JEOPARDY was in range inside and lacked the needed rally. PALEMMA played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
ROUGH ENTRY pressed the early pace outside LEGAL DEAL, poked a head in front from between horses coming to the quarter-pole, battled inside
ISOLATE through the stretch and gamely prevailed. ISOLATE broke a step slow, recovered to a forward position four then three wide, challenged outside
ROUGH ENTRY turning for home, stayed on his left lead through a long drive and was outfinished. TROPHY CHASER chased early inside, lacked room
entering the turn and lost some position, shifted two wide at the top of the lane, moved further out for clearance approaching the furlong grounds and
finished willingly outside the top two. PUDDING advanced four wide to loom a threat after a half-mile, then flattened out. LUSITANO raced two three wide
around the turn, moved further out through the drive and could not gain. BREWMEISTER was a step slow to begin, raced four to five wide around the turn,
and made no headway through the lane on the far outside. LEGAL DEAL sprinted clear early, got headed by ROUGH ENTRY after a half, and gave way.
UNTITLED was outrun three wide.
