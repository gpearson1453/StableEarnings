command nearing the final furlong then drove clear in midstretch. SLEEPY N JOYFUL was slow early, began a run three wide on the turn and finished
willingly. MISSAWLET dueled inside early, bore out under left hand whip in early stretch, bumped with MAKEMEASAMMICH then weakened.
MAKEMEASAMMICH dueled two wide, came in, bumped with MISSAWLET in early stretch, came out, bumped with the winner soon after then tired.
Objections by the rider and trainer of MAKEMEASAMMICH against the winner were not allowed. BUTTON CANDY raced two wide and failed to menace.
MNEMOSYNE was outrun. BELL THE CAT stopped inside. GREEDY LIKE JEANE showed little. KAZ'S PRINCESS delayed the start when unwilling to
load, stumbled badly leaving the gate and unseated the rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but the results stood.

front nearing the quarter pole then drew off under intermittent urging. FOLE'S NOTION was unhurried, rallied the three path around the final turn, moved
closer in early stretch then flattened out. ROLLING PALISADES took command at once, ran out entering the first turn, came over on the winner entering the
far turn then stopped in the lane. CATTLE DRIVE was slow early then passed tired ones. MOON MEISTER was carried wide by the early leader into the first
turn while pressing outside, remained close into the far turn then stopped. I SEE THE STARS wasn't far back outside early, advanced wide around the final
turn then stopped in the lane. MY DEVILS CHILD was caught wide around the first turn and trailed.

HARD BELLE dueled outside in the three path from the outset, was carried wide into the stretch and held stubbornly. TRIPLE A. PLUS stayed along the rail,
loomed boldly in midstretch but wasn't enough. MARTINKELLY dueled inside the winner into the final furlong then weakened. VENOMOUS STATE rushed
the gate just before the doors opened, was in the grasp of the assistant starter when the doors opened, left slowly then made up some ground late.
ATHELSTANE came out on the turn and failed to menace. SHANGHAISCHOOL tired outside.
