Footnotes
MIGHTY LORD was away in good order along the inside to engage for the lead from the start opened up on the field on the turn and drew clear without
asking while winning easily. DIVINE TASK was off slow to trail early hustled into position just off the pace while three wide moved clearly into second in the
stretch and was geared down late. WHERE'S FREDDIE raced four wide on the turn went to the inside through the stretch and was making a mild bid.
EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY was away in good order to engage for the lead in the two path for the first quarter and then backed up after that. E'S BIRTHDAY
BOY trailed throughout and was never a serious factor. KNOCK ON IT broke in sharply after the start and unseated the rider and walked off the course.

Footnotes
FLAWLESS CLYDE showed good early speed while on the outside hooked up with Capital Reef on the turn and that pair fought it out for the final three
eighths. CAPITAL REEF showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail by the turn hooked up with the winner in a match race to the wire and was
outfinished for the win while second best. WHATATRIP saved ground along the rail the entire race and when the field went wide came into contention but
could not match strides with the top two. PAPA SUGAR came six wide on the turn losing some ground and made a mild bid in the lane. STRYKER'S
DREAM raced along the inside behind the pace and could not make up the needed ground. MY MILAGRO showed some early speed for the first quarter
and then faded. ZAMZOOMIN was up close to the pace while four wide and then faded. TOMBI showed no early speed and appeared a bit rank was well
behind the pack for much of the race. BABY BE FAST raced three wide on the turn and never mounted a rally. MIDNITE EXPRESSION raced four wide the
entire race and had nothing left for the drive. KINGDOM QUALITY was off slow and was never a serious threat. LAST STRATEGY was off slow and well off
the lead throughout.
