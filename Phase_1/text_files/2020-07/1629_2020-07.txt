Footnotes
CEZANNE went three wide into the first turn, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, started to move midway around the far turn, gained control at the top of
the lane, kicked clear of BRONN and inched away, drifted inward in the final furlong and held sway. MONGOLIAN LEGEND unhurried in the beginning,
entered the first turn four wide, angled in shortly after coming into the backstretch, settled a bit off the rail, split foes on the far turn, rallied and proved
second best. BRONN sped to the front, controlled the pace up the backstretch, challenged by the winner around the far turn, lost command approaching the
quarter pole and bested the rest. ITSTHATTIME bumped by rival into the first turn, lost the whip near the three-quarter pole, angled to the inside, drifted out
into the stretch and had little left for the drive. NEVER EASY pulled early and bumped inside rival entering the first turn, raced three wide then steered out
into the clear, went three deep into the far turn, asked around the bend and lacked a response.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN WINDOW three wide into the first turn, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, went three deep into the far turn, drifted into the lane, gained
command nearing the quarter pole, dueled with the runner-up in the late stages and held gamely. MESO bumped leaving the gate then angled in, reserved
from off the rail, raced three wide then angled out leaving the bend, challenged from the outside and dueled with MONGOLIAN WINDOW through the final
furlong but lacked the late punch to get by. PERFECT ICE STORM between foes early then two wide, stalked a bit off the rail then along the inside to the
stretch, angled out some in the lane and kept on for a clear third. MAJESTIC DIVA settled along the inside, came out on the far turn and passed tired rivals.
SHE CHERIE broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, settled early, raced off the rail, advanced up the backstretch, in tight and steadied between foes
at the seven-sixteenths marker, traveled two wide into the lane and tired. TIZ TOFFEE off alertly, set the pace a bit off the rail then came out entering the
backstretch, angled in entering the the far turn, overtaken by the winner at the top of the lane, gave way and was not persevered with.
