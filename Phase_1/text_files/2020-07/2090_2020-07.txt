EITHER outrun early, advanced outside through the second turn, responded when sat down for the drive but just missed. LANGFUHR'S ANGEL dueled
from the inside early, fought up the backstretch, battled through the second turn, remained engaged with the winner but could not keep pace.
WHATDUZITMATER forced the early pace outside but had nothing left. DEVASTATING BEAUTY was never a factor. PROUD BLESSING showed little.

Footnotes
MARRAZANO broke sharp from the outside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the second
turn, remained well clear at the eighth pole and held sway. MADISON'S WILD ONE stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the
second turn, responded along the rail and rallied for the place. QUIET BARBARA forced the early pace from the inside, remained forward for the drive but
could not keep pace. BAR TAP squeezed at the start and could only improve position. VERITY JANE was never a factor. DADDY'S ANGEL hard to load,
chased the early pace outside and was finished after going a half.

Footnotes
SHAR'S TREASURE dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, shook loose entering the second turn, opened a clear margin at
the eighth pole and held sway. WICKED REBEL broke out at the start, bumped with ELIJAH GHOST, stalked the early pace from the inside, inched forward
entering the second turn, responded along the rail for the drive and was just up for the place. ELIJAH GHOST bumped at the start, pressed the early pace
from the outside, held a forward position for the drive but was outnodded for the place. NO KA OI chased the early pace from the outside, dueled up the
backstretch
but
came
up
empty
in
the
drive.
ENCHANTED

went
evenly.
WILLY
SPECIAL

CAPTAINONTHEROCKS was no factor. CRESCENT CITY STAR was no threat. TAPIT'S TEMPLE dueled from the inside and gave way.
