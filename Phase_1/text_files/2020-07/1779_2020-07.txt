Footnotes
DIVA'S RANSOM broke with the leaders, settled in the second flight toward the inside into the turn, steered out three wide turning for home, took over in
upper stretch, drew clear under steady handling. VERONICA'S DREAM last away, raced off the pace, in some traffic late in the turn, altered course to the
outside, widest in the drive, finished willingly to be edging clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. EREBUNI broke back, raced in the second
flight outside, came four wide into the stretch, went evenly the final furlong, outkicked for the place. LADY BELACQUA away in good order, set the early
pace inside, dueled through the turn while continuing inside, weakened in the final furlong to lose several positions. HONEST TINA broke on top,pressed the
leader from the outside into the turn, advanced to duel in the two path around the bend, gave way in the drive. DE LAST DANCE void of early foot, remained
back. DAYLIGHT DEELITE raced off the pace outside, four wide late in the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SON OF A SAINT last away, raced four wide into the first turn, made a steady advance in the three path into contention second turn, briefly dueled in the
two path turning for home, shook clear and steadily drew out under pressure. THAT'S D 'CAT settled off the pace and the inside, advanced in the three path
into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, proved no match for that one, drew clear of the others. SPIRIT OF CALEDON broke back, raced
off the inside, four wide through the second turn, modest interest in the lane to finish best of the rest. MOMENT worked way clear late in the first turn,
showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner into the lane then began to five way. HAWKS PEAK void of
speed for six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. MACANDALES forwardly placed inside, remained within striking distance for
six furlongs then had little left for the drive. CAJUN CARMELIZED with the early pace between horses, chased leader middle half then faltered.

Footnotes
GEAUX GOLDEN light bump at the break, asked to clear just after the start, showed the way into the turn closest to the inside, shrugged off a couple of
rivals to be suddenly clear when straightened for home, expanded that advantage while being kept to task. CLASSY KITTEN in the second flight while
racing off the inside, moved out for the drive to be three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. UNTUTTABLE SPEED in
mid pack early inside the runner up, moved out to be four wide into the lane, mild rally to be along for the show, no threat to the top pair. BIGJIM'S
SILVERGAL forwardly placed while off the in side, crept slightly closer to the winner turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run, lost the show late.
LEGALLY BINDING forwardly placed while in the two path, also had little left with the real running began at the head of the lane. BROKE AND PRAYING
remained back in lacking a rally. IFITSMEANTTOBE bumped lightly with the winner at the break, fell back, sluggish, wide, well beaten.

Footnotes
SPECIAL BINGO in the second flight for a half just off the inside, advanced through some traffic to be closest to the leader exiting the final turn, engaged
that one just inside the furlong grounds and wore that same foe down under firm handling. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU forwardly placed past the wire the first
time, moved out and took over early backstretch, was clear through the second turn, continued to show the way into the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms
with the winner then proved no match late, remained clear for the place. TROLL AND STROLL took up at the start, raced back, advanced far turn, three
wide into the lane, rallied for the show, no threat top two. ROYAL GALAXY lacked early foot, continued back, four wide when making a mild advance second
turn, flattened out in the drive to be caught for the show. LONE STAR CLASS ducked in sharply at the break, raced forwardly in to the first turn off the
inside, got out through that bend, prompted the issue up the backstretch and began to give way. CLASSIC EMMETT tucked in past the wire the first time to
save ground, remained devoid of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. HEZA FORTUNE broke alertly, cleared to the inside to show
the way through the first turn, lost the advantage to the runner up before a half then started a steady retreat. BOSTON BOOM carried out first turn, gave
way after four furlongs, finished far back.

Footnotes
HE'S A CLIMBER forwardly placed from the start, advanced up the inside to take over after a half, got clear in the far turn, maintained a comfortable
advantage to the wire while being kept to task. DE BIRD IS DA WORD prompted the early pace off the inside, continued to stalk the issue after the winner
gained command after four furlongs, asked along late in the final turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. DREWTEMPO fell back after the
start, void of speed, staged a mild rally to gain. HONOR MY SPEED sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace off the inside for a half, allowed the
winner the inside soon after and began to fade. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE broke out to help tighten up ZARTASTIC, settled off the pace and went evenly
throughout in lacking a rally. KYE'S ADDYCAT broke in, bumped with ZARTASTIC while putting that rival in tight resulting in him clipping heels, was
straightened to race forwardly early and then stopped after a half. ZARTASTIC put in tight at the start, bumped, clipped heels, unseated rider. FOLLOWING
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. DUE TO THE THE LOOSE
HORSE TRIPPING THE TIMER AT THE HALF MILE MARK, THE FOUR FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME WAS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY.

Footnotes
DREWZANO brushed at the start to break back, began to steady advance after a quarter, three wide when roused into the lane, closed full of run to be up in
the final jump. D'ROCK broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate for the advantage into the straight, shook clear inside the furlong
marker, nipped in the late going to narrowly miss. LENAPE DRIVE in the second flight racing along the inside, proved no match for the top two in the final
furlong, all out to hold the show late. D'ROCKETMAN void of early foot, continued to race well back through the turn, roused into the lane, improved through
traffic. SHOWCASE MALL in the second group while racing off the inside, lacked a late punch to be outkicked for the show spot. SPENDAHOLIC went one
paced throughout in also lacking a closing kick. REECE'S PRIORITY bothered slightly at the start, recovered to move up and duel inside the runner up,
continued to race on equal terms with that one past the furlong marker, caved in late. SEAHAWK WAVE broke in to bother a couple of inner rivals, raced
back, was finished early while four wide late in the turn. WAYFARING STRANGER was always outrun.

BOSTON BIND broke alertly, showed the way early, shook clear into the turn, maintained a daylight advantage to the wire while being kept to task. SHOT
ON WINDY HILL raced in mid pack early out in the stretch, advanced to be closest to the winner exiting the turn, continued to chase that rival past the
furlong marker, marginal gain late, clearly second best. CLASSIC HEATH broke slowly, continued to race back, came three wide out of the final turn, staged
a mild rally to annex the show. ROUND QUARTER raced in the second flight for a half, had little left for the drive. TIZ NEYNEY AND RAD back off the early
pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, failed to make an impact in the drive. BIG BOSS MAN chased the winner for four furlongs while off
the inside, gave way in the drive. GRAND TY fell quickly back after the start, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
IRISH HUSTLE unhurried early, continued back, moved out, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed with good resolve to collar the leader late and prove
best. SOMEKINDAWICKED also raced back in the early going, advanced with the winner three wide and inside that one into the straight, could not match
strides late but still managed to finish willingly to earn part of the place. TEMPLE SHADOW pressed the issue off the inside, dueled off the inside, fell back
slightly off the other speed when straightened for home, rebid and took over inside the furlong marker, led late, gave ground grudgingly in the late going. MI
COPA REBOSA broke alertly, with the early pace, dueled closest to the inside the middle half, showed the way upper stretch then faltered in the final
furlong. CRIMSON FELINE away in good order, settled in the second flight while between horses, came up empty when called on for the drive. OLD
FASHION AMOUR flashed speed for a half closest to the inside and faltered. STAR GAZE last away, was never a factor. SPARTANBURG four wide
through the first turn when forwardly placed, continued with the pace up the backstretch, got out in the second turn, fell back and jogged in.

Footnotes
CUSTOMS IN DIXIE broke well, raced in the second flight off the inside in the run up the backstretch, advanced and challenged between rivals turning for
home, took over, clear late, enough left to withstand the runner up. TEN TAP DANCES broke back, lacked early foot, came six wide out of the turn when
beginning to moved, closed with good energy down the center of the track to earn the place, too late for the winner. FICKLE FLASH in the second group
toward the inside, moved out three wide for the drive, closest a furlong out, flattened out a bit in the late going but managed to hold the show. RHETT'S
RACER broke with the leaders, within striking distance outside, raced four out to five wide in the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a winning
response. STANG IT forwardly placed off the inside, advanced with the winner and challenged three wide and outside that foe late in the turn, failed to
sustain that effort in the drive. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK void of speed outside, came six wide out of the turn, managed only to improve position slightly, no
real threat. MISS MABELEE raced near the back of the main body outside, lacked a serious closing response. KOHENSRISING went one paced to come
up empty for the drive. TWO WITH A TEN tired after a half. GETTOTHEPOINT remained always back. EYE ON THE LADIES sprinted clear soon after the
start, showed the way into the turn inside, stopped when headed by the winner turning into the stretch.
