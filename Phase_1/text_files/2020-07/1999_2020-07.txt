Footnotes
GREY MASK was bumped by DANCIN NICKY in the opening strides, stalked outside SOUTHSIDER down the backstretch, encroached outside that foe
past the half mile mark, took the lead past the seven sixteenths, continued to set the pace into the lane, went to a drive approaching the furlong pole and
held sway. SOUTHSIDER was pushed along to the early lead, faced a challenge from GREY MASK to his outside past the half mile pole, lost the lead to
that foe near the seven sixteenths, switched outside GREY MASK near the five sixteenths, chased outside that foe under a drive down the lane but could
not reel him back in. VALID STORM chased the leading pair down the backstretch, was pushed along in the four path on the turn, went to a drive in the
lane, and proved no match for the top two. COME ON DOVER was reluctant to load, raced two wide in the rear pair, raced in the five path on the turn while
being pushed along, was driven into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. DANCIN NICKY broke inward and bumped GREY MASK in the opening strides,
raced at the inside of the rear pair to the three eighths, trailed from the three eighths while racing in the two path, and was empty for the drive.

RIDE RICHIE RIDE broke sharply, led the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept
to the task to the wire. MKAR THE FAST hopped up slightly leaving the break, trailed the field in the early stages, came around the turn in the three path,
and made a strong rally while drifting out slightly down the stretch, finishing well. DEWY'S HIT settled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the two path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole, and improved position in the stretch. VALIANT VINNY pressed the pace on the outside in the
early going, raced in the two path around the turn, and faded entering the stretch. LEND IT TEWMEY raced just off the pace in the opening quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROSKI chased the leading flight inside of GO VO down the backstretch, continued to chase in the three path on the turn, swung out past the five sixteenths,
was driven three wide in upper stretch, mounted a sharp rally, blew past the leading pair approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. KYZAN broke
inward and bumped JIVE DADDY lightly in the opening strides, then lightly bumped FERLIN HUSKY, pressed the pace from between horses in the leading
flight, kept on to duel outside of JIVE DADDY in the lane while under a drive, could not match ROSKI in the final sixteenth but chased on second best. JIVE
DADDY was lightly bumped by KYZAN early, soon led inside while pressured by KYZAN and TIO CHUY, dueled with KYZAN down the lane, and flattened
out in the final furlong. WEILAND raced at the inside of the rear pair early, continued toward the rear in the three path on the turn, went to a drive toward the
inside in upper stretch, came well off the inside for the final furlong, and chased under a drive. FERLIN HUSKY was lightly bumped by KYZAN in the
opening strides, settled at the outside of the rear pair, began to flatten two wide near the three eighths, floated out into the lane and proved no threat. GO
VO chased the leading flight outside of ROSKI early, raced in the five to six path on the turn, went to a drive past the five sixteenths, and proved empty in
the lane. TIO CHUY raced three wide in the leading flight, began to empty out with a quarter mile remaining, and weakened between horses.

Footnotes
CROCE D'ORO bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, opened up down the stretch
and was much the best. CITALI raced between horses in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
improved position in the stretch. SUPERMANS CAPE pressed the pace from the outside through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the
turn and couldn't go with the winner while finishing evenly in the stretch. R H SMOAKEM raced between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in
the three path and made no bid while racing evenly down the stretch. LANDING GEAR raced outside towards the back of the pack through the opening half
mile, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. SERTOMAN raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, dropped back sharply near the
three eighths pole, saved ground around the turn and was not a threat. RICHIESONARAMPAGE raced on the inside near the pace in the early going, began
to drop back while racing in the three path around the far turn, and continued to tire in the stretch.

GUEST IN MY HEART settled toward the rear inside of TANGO CITY, saved ground through the turn, went to a drive inside near the three sixteenths,
advanced smoothly, got through between BACKSIDE BEAUTY and the rail, led near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. TANGO CITY was bumped by
BACKSIDE BEAUTY in the opening strides, settled two wide near the rear, swung out into the lane, rallied three wide, and got up for place in the final
strides. BACKSIDE BEAUTY hopped at the break and then came in to bump TANGO CITY, went keenly to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the
turn, carried a clear lead into the lane, drifted back and forth in midstretch, was headed near the sixteenth pole and lost second in the final strides. SEVEN
SEVENTEEN tracked the early pace outside of POSITIVE DANGER, settled to midfield into the turn, chased in the two path around the bend, came three
wide into the lane, and was outfinished. POSITIVE DANGER raced at the inside of the tracking flight, saved ground through the bend, came under hard
urging into the lane, chased the leader between horses in midstretch, and flattened out in the final furlong. AWESOME INDRA proved difficult to load into
the gate, was wrangled to the rear early, trailed in the two path on the turn, went to a drive into the lane and offered no bid. ESTARDO was midpack early
but advanced to track the pace outside of POSITIVE DANGER into the turn, tracked two wide around the bend, went to a drive between horses into the
lane, and emptied out. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION ONLY QUARTER MILE AND FINAL TIMES ARE REFLECTED. Missing times determined
following video review.

Footnotes
DIAMOND DAVE saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, launched an outside bid nearing the quarter pole, entered the
stretch from the five path and continued to gain ground from the middle of the track to just get up for the win. GOLD HAWK saved ground around the first
turn, raced on the outside in the middle of the pack from there, navigated the far turn from the three path, made a bid entering the stretch, took over the lead
with a sixteenth of a mile to go and was caught in the final strides. CADET CAPTAIN raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the second turn and gave way grudgingly in late stretch. ORCUS raced in the two path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, launched a bid from the path approaching the five sixteenths pole and finished evenly from there.
MIRACLE MOUNTAIN bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn, raced inside up the backstretch, navigated the
far turn from the path, entered the stretch in striking position and weakened in the final furlong. SATURDAYS HANGOVER trailed the field from the two path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn and never threatened. VOLGOGRAD raced in the three path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. FORT
RAMSEY bumped with the horse to the inside leaving the gate, led the field from the two path around the first turn and into the backstretch, saved ground
around the second turn and tired entering the stretch.

GOOD MONGOLIA set the pace, dueled inside of ROMANTIC ATTACK when she engaged near the three eighths, opened up on the rest of the field along
with that foe, and edged to the lead again in the final furlong. ROMANTIC ATTACK broke slightly inward and bumped LOGI, floated wide into the first turn,
stalked three and then two wide around the first bend, continued to stalk two wide down the backstretch, advanced into the second turn to engage the
leader, dueled outside of GOOD MONGOLIA from near the three eighths while drawing clear of the rest of the field, continued to duel outside into the lane,
but was outfinished by GOOD MONGOLIA in the final furlong. HEAVEN ESCAPE chased toward the rear along the inside through the first turn, advanced to
midfield inside of TANNAH'BLU for the backstretch run, continued patiently in the two to three path into the far turn, made up ground between horses past
the five sixteenths, kept on under a drive inside into the lane, angled out for the final furlong, improved but could not get to the leading pair. MILA'S DREAM
(IRE) stalked inside of ROMANTIC ATTACK on the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the far turn,
chased on two wide into the lane, came out four wide for a bid late but was outfinished. TROPHY BRIDLE broke a step slowly, settled at the rear while
saving ground, swung out into the lane, carried LOGI out when she came further out midstretch, and passed outside of tiring horses. TANNAH'BLU settled
three wide near the rear through the clubhouse turn, chased midpack two wide down the backstretch, continued two wide in the five path around the far turn,
swung three wide into the lane, and ran evenly late. LOGI was bumped between GOOD MONGOLIA and ROMANTIC ATTACK in the opening strides and
tossed her head after being bumped, raced keenly between horses into the first turn, settled back in the rear pair into the backstretch, continued two wide in
the rear pair through the far turn, raced outside near the rear in upper stretch, was carried out midstretch as TROPHY BRIDLE came out, and proved no
threat. PAULETTE raced rank between horses into the first turn, settled midfield down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, was pushed along
inside into the stretch, but came up empty. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THERE WAS NO STRETCH-CALL FRACTIONAL TIME. Missing time

Footnotes
CLEAR N CONVINCING raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from
the three path nearing the quarter pole, and pulled clear in the stretch. HIGH ON SUGAR raced on the inside in the middle of the pack around the first turn
and up the backstretch, ran into traffic coming around the second turn, brushed mildly with TETSU when angling out to find room entering the stretch, and
gained ground late while drifting out slightly in late stretch. GOOD INTENT navigated the first turn from the three path, pressed the pace on the outside up
the backstretch, continued to duel for the lead from the two path around the far turn and into the stretch and finished evenly. URBAN LIGHT (IRE) saved
ground around the first turn, raced up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the rail, angled out to the three path around the far turn and passed tiring
horses in the stretch. ECRU saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the inside, came around the far turn in the two path and
improved position from the rail in the stretch. TETSU raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, raced in the
four path around the far turn, was brushed slightly by HIGH ON SUGAR entering the stretch and flattened out from there. FOLLOW THE SIGNS saved
ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the far turn and tired entering the stretch. CONTRACTION
broke sharply, angled in to run in the three path around the first turn, dueled for the lead between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the far turn and tired in the stretch. MIDNIGHT JOKER trailed the field the entire way around the oval, and despite saving ground throughout was never a
threat.
