PAYNT YOUR EGGS saved ground on the first turn, came off the rail entering the stretch, angled inside and grabbed the lead in deep stretch, holding off a
foe who was edging closer. LEMON BLITZ was bumped at the start, took the lead inside past the first quarter, dueled a foe on the turn and into the stretch,
lost the lead late to the winner, but came again to just miss. CHRISTIANS CITY was bumped at the start, led early inside, backed up on the turn and found
more in the stretch for the show. VANDROSS was gapped off the lead, out wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the stretch, shifted a bit inside and
gave up show in deep stretch. ICE CHEST was eager to move up and challenge the leader from the outside into the far turn, dueled to the eighth pole and
gave way. WARRIOR'S DREAM was last early, wide on the backstretch and wide on the far turn, then had some late rally. STARLIN was bumped at the
start, bumped again near the turn, then ran evenly in the stretch. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2020-BP-020 DATED 08/20/2020,

DEALIN' STELEN tracked the lead inside, came off the rail on the turn to split horses while three wide and entering the stretch, and proved best late.
PRESSONREGARDLESS was very wide into the stretch, closed well, but flattened out, posing no serious threat to the winner. HIGLEY O'PRADO raced
back early, steadily advanced, was under pressure in the stretch and grinded out the show spot. RUSSIAN TO TAPIT split horses on the backstretch, was
asked on the turn while on the rail, and gained position late. SWIFTY SAM raced toward the rear, came up the rail in the stretch and flattened out. GET
SOME MUNY shifted inside shortly after the start, chased the leader in hand, and came seven wide into the stretch before losing position late. BOO REID
dueled from outside for the lead and backed up at the eighth pole. UNBRIDLED REBEL contended briefly and did not threaten. BREAKERS POINT led
inside and faltered in the stretch. LION LION was widest on the backstretch and lost touch with the field on the turn.

Footnotes
RIKER went between horses onto the far turn, drifted out while in front down the stretch and drew clear late. MANSOOR bothered a foe at the start, was in
back of a tight group, was closing late but the winner found more to prove too much. LIZZY'S LURE was bothered by a horse at the start, led off the rail but
gave way in mid stretch while keeping third. VALYCOVE was five wide on the first turn, raced mid pack, came six wide into the stretch and evenly gained
fourth. GIANT TRICK racing never far back, was shaken up on the turn to challenge the leader but tired in the stretch. PETE MARWICK steadied after the
start, and again on the first turn, moved up the rail to get close on the far turn but came up empty when needed late.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE was rank early, steadied inside nearing the turn, took the lead in the stretch while well inside the other foes who were all out wide, and had
enough to prevail. FANCY FOX raced behind the pace, was pushed on to challenge for the lead coming into the stretch, could not contain the winner but
took second while losing the whip very near the finish. CURIOUS RUTH was off a step slow, came off the rail to move up between horses on the
backstretch to take the lead, lost position mid stretch and then held third. IVY O'DAY raced evenly, was urged four wide on the turn and held position in the
stretch. BUCH OF DAISIES never threatened. NOOK raced five wide on the turn and posed no threat.

when needed in the stretch. SUPERSTAR DIVA had good position from off rail but failed to gain from quarter pole. REDHOT KATIE dueled with the pace to
turn and gave way readily thereafter. GRAMS FUTURE never a menace.

Footnotes
CALBOYZEKE pressed pace to the turn, pounced when ready three wide past the quarter pole and drew off through the stretch run as much the best.
KINETIC ART perfect position down inside, ran on for place while forcing way through tight spot past the sisteenth pole while no match for the winner.
GRIND LINE raced off rail throughout and rallied along for the show spot. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA inside speed to the turn and gave way readily in the
stretch. HE'S A BRAT no speed to the stretch and only improved position while never a threat. HEIDI'S SINATRA failed to menace. ROLLIN MY OWN
speed to the turn while used up and dropped back in the stretch. CAPTAIN RILEY never a menace. LUZON CHARGER wa through early and dropped back
readily.
