handed whip, the rider switched to a right handed whip and just lasted. IRON DRILL never far back, closed willingly three then two wide and was steadily
cutting into the winners advantage through the final stages. PAYNT GUNNER dueled with the winner along the inside, shifted out to the three path then was
outfinished. KING OF LIGHT bumped at the start then stalked the pace in an even effort. DIDDY DEW failed to menace. TATIS passed tiring rivals inside.

Footnotes
GIZMO JONES stalked the pace near the inside into the far turn, lacked racing room, shifted out four wide past the quarter pole, split horses to make the
lead and finished full of run to win as much the best while in hand. ISTILLGOTIT hopped at the start, trailed for nearly a half, closed determinedly three wide
through the stretch and got up for second. RIKER checked repeatedly through the clubhouse turn, advanced in the four path on the far turn and finished
with good courage. PALTARREVENGE vied for the lead three wide into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead, battled into the stretch, got out and
lost ground. FAT DADDY chased the pace into the far turn, rallied two wide to make the lead briefly then came up empty. STELLAR TRICK away alertly, set
the pace along the inside for six furlongs then weakened in the final furlong. BARNACLE BILL was no threat. LEO D bopped at the start and was outrun.

Footnotes
JUNIOR GILLIAM trailed through the turn, swung out to the eight path entering the stretch, drifted in to the four path under right handed urging while circling
his field near the furlong marker, the rider switched to a left handed whip and was along in time. ASTRO JAK broke in front, set a pressured pace into the
stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker and just missed hanging on. I AM IRON MAN stalked pace the pace along the inside and went evenly.
SHAKURR checked at the five eighths pole, offered a bid four wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. ROBERT'S PRINCE moved up three wide
into the stretch then came up empty. ALEX THE DUDE had good early speed then faded. KATALOX pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave
way.

Footnotes
CIRCUS RINGS had speed from the start along the rail, steadied while lacking racing room on the turn, waited to the quarter pole, angled out and shot past
the leader with a rapid move two wide leaving the turn and widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under brisk handling. TICKETY BOO
trailed while never far back, had a mild late rally in the five path and finished second best. HAPPY ISSUE never far back, swung wide and finished
determinedly in the seven path. MOBIL LADY moved up three wide into the stretch while under constant urging then leveled off. ADVENTURE LAND broke
in front, set a pressured pace in the two path into the stretch and weakened in the final stages. DANCIN' ROSIE was through after a half. ARROWSPHERE
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way.

and proved best under strong handling. NATURAL BLING trailed into the turn, swung wide, closed fast through the stretch in the six path and was steadily
cutting into the winners advantage. STAR MABEE with the second flight two wide, finished with good courage three wide. SHEZA FINE JUSTICE found her
best stride late in the seven path. SISTER'S CREED was hustled up the inside to gain a slight lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace for a half, had
speed until deep stretch then faded. PANAMANIAC was a forward factor near the inside into the stretch then faded. BLANCONIA pressed the pace two

Footnotes
INTO THE OUT broke in full stride to set all the pace while getting quick fractions and widened through the stretch while getting out despite right handed
urging to win as much the best. DANEFIELD never far back, advanced steadily into the stretch, drifted to the middle of the racetrack and was no match for
the winner. MASTER LEGIONAIRE unhurried, found his best stride late while also drifting to mid track. KOLE MAN CAN chased the winner into the stretch,
drifted ot to the middle of the racetrack and lost ground. GOES TOO FAST had brief speed. PRECIOUS JULES passed tiring rivals. CHIEF BIG HEAD was
through early. GOLDEN MONEY was no factor. MUSTANG WILLIE was no threat.

Footnotes
NOT REGRET battled for the lead three wide into the turn, shook clear, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under a strong hand
ride to win as much the best. EASY EYES bobbled at the start, chased the pace from the three path and finished clear for second. SEE YOU AT THE BAR
never far back, finished with good courage in the five path. SUSIES WHO battled with the winner two wide into the turn then faded. DREAM ON
GORGEOUS was no factor. YACHT had brief speed. LOST A SOCK dueled along the inside down the backstretch and was through early.
