Footnotes
FOX ROX rated inside just behind the leaders, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
edged up late. MIDNIGHT PUNK stalked the early pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane taking command, then was no match for the
winner late and held the place safe. MASTEROFTHEHOUSE allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and closed well
for the show. COOPER'S CRESCENT set the early pace well off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch and faded the final furlong. WILD
WINTER broke a step slowly from the gate and passed a tiring rival. LOVE THAT JAZZ well placed and outside, held position through the turn, then had no
rally.

TOUCH OF LA GREY tracked the pace on the inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, took command
quickly, then lasted under steady pressure. HOLY TRUTH allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn on the two path, bid between rivals into the
stretch, made a steady gain and missed. BETTYS BOMBER mid pack, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and
flattened out. SAINT ADORABLE well placed and between rivals, held position through the turn three wide, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in
the drive. MR MCGUERTY passed tiring rivals. MIKE MIKE well placed and outside, gained a striking position four wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane and had no stretch rally. JUST A JOKER showed little. HURRY POTTER set the early pace pulling and stopped.

late, while clearly best of the rest. DIAMANT allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled widest in
the stretch and closed well for the show. LEBASI allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, then angled in
and got up for a share. GENUWINE passed tiring rivals. URBAN BUCKEYE well placed and outside, held position through the turn, bid three wide into the
lane and weakened in the late going. FIFTY PLUS ran evenly. NEGRO AZABACHE tracked the pace, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch,
then faded the final furlong. DRAGON FIVE was no factor. AFTER THE MONEY well placed and inside, faded after a half.

Footnotes
SAMURAI ZIP sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. TRAVEL
TRUE well placed, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest.
REEDER well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. CAPTIVATED
well placed, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. NICEANDEZ mid pack, saved ground on the two
path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out. FRENCH ACCENT well placed, saved ground through the turn, bid between rivals into
the stretch and weakened in the drive. SOURCESANDMETHODS ran evenly. BOBBY V. improved position, widest. C THE KING was no factor, outside.
ALWAALY well placed, held position three wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally. SWEET N SILVER never far back, moved up three wide through
the turn and faded in the drive.
