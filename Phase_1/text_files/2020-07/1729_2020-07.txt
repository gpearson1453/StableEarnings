Footnotes
LAST BATTLE forwardly placed up the backstretch off the inside, moved closer while between horses in the turn, shuffled back turning for home while still
between rivals, switched out, set down, came back to challenge again late, dug in final strides to narrowly prevail in a game effort. EASY TO MISS lacked
early foot while racing toward the inside, angled out to be three wide for the drive, challenged inside the winner late, not enough in the final strides to miss.
THUNK prompted the early pace outside, vied four wide through the turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two
late, saved the show. MR LEO with the pace while between rivals, three path through the turn, continued to vie past the furlong marker then began to
weaken. LAST APPEAL fractious prior to the start, broke sharp, set or forced the pace for over a half, faltered through the stretch. BROTHER JUKEBOX
within striking distance three wide behind the first flight for four furlongs, came up empty for the drive. SUPER MAMBA last to leave, failed to menace. IDE B
STRANDED fell back to trail after the start and showed little.

Footnotes
SET HUT broke sharp, set the pace just off the inside, remained clear through a lively half mile split, shrugged off his nearest rival entering the stretch,
steadily increased that advantage under a firm hand ride to win ridden out. MY PAL TORRES forwardly placed up the backstretch while racing outside,
continued to chase the winner through the turn while in the three path, proved no match for that one in the drive, fully extended to prevail for the place.b.
SONG N A CAT broke back, continued to be outrun into the turn, saved ground through the bend to improve into the lane, continued to improve past the
furlong marker, getting to the runner up late. MADIBA last to leave, void of early foot, roused three wide into the lane, improved while racing through some
traffic, not a serious threat to the top three. PRAYER BOY void of speed, passed tiring rivals while also not posing a serious threat. HOT'N NOTTY in the
second flight while off the inside, tired in the drive. DIXIE BEAT settled in mid pack early, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick.
MONTBROOKS MIRACLE was finished early. C C HARRIS behind the pace off the rail, raced five wide when beginning to give way turning for home,
stopped in upper stretch and was jogged in while well back.

Footnotes
TAPIT ON RACE DAY outrun early, advanced through some traffic in the turn, came four wide into the stretch, challenged outside the leader past the
furlong marker, wore that rival down under steady handling. SAILING JETT broke on top, set the early pace inside, continued to show the way through the
turn, two path into the lane, responded when the winner came alongside approaching midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to that one until late, clearly
second best. GOING JAPANESE forwardly placed off the rail, pressed the runner up through the turn, could not keep up with that one or the winner in the
stretch, remained clear of the others. COACH O within striking distance along the inside, also had little for the top pair in the drive, outkicked for the show.
UNBRIDLED PULPIT void of speed, four wide throught he turn, improved a bit in the drive, not dangerous. ABSOLUTE DRAMA last to leave, remained
sluggish in trailing far back for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never involved. IT'SMYLUCKYMOMENT in mid pack early, had nothing for the
drive. OUR BUCKET LIST pressed the runner up early just off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
LIAM SKYE close from the start outside, dueled in the run up the backstretch and through the far turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, long drive to
the wire, proved best in a determined effort. FAST VERDICT in some traffic along the inside into the first turn, steadied soon after, moved out, three wide
second turn, rallied to be in time for the place. SILVER KING last to leave, raced back and four wide through the first turn, moved toward the inside second
turn, dropped to the rail for the drive and rallied up the inside to earn the show. OUTLAW X. settled off the early pace, stalked in the second flight up the
backstretch, crept closer in the three path turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. CLASSIC GREELEY settled in mid pack early, failed
to respond when called on for the drive. MANGELSEN away in good order, set the early pace inside, dueled closest to the inside the middle four furlongs
then gave way in the drive. I'M D'CAT void of early foot, bothered slightly early in the first turn, fell further back and was never a threat to be always outrun.
STRIKING STAR forwardly placed for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
SHE'S GONE D'WILD broke well, dueled up front for a half off the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, drew off steadily to win
ridden out. AT ONCE lacked speed, improved position inside of a couple of rivals turning for home, lugged approaching the furlong marker, proved no match
for the winner, clear for the place. AMERICAN MOM last away, trailed for a half while saving ground, continued along the inside to improve position through
the stretch. C C CROWN'S CHOICE broke sharp, dueled inside the winner for a half, was beginning to give way in upper stretch when lugged in, shied from
rail, continued to fade. SEVEN COME ELEVEN void of speed in racing back, continued to trail while four wide through the turn, passed a few tiring rivals
well after the issue had been decided. CHARLIE ROADS forwardly placed in the early going, faded. KATHLEEN'S DAY was finished before a half.
CUSTOMS BELLA ELLA broke through the gate prior to the start, second flight for a half, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
BEN'S MAGIC STONE settled off the early pace toward the inside, moved out when beginning to advance far turn, three wide into the lane, collared the
leader with less than a furlong remaining from the outside, wore that rival down under firm handling. LITTLE TOE broke on top, got clear into the first turn,
continued to maintain a daylight advantage up the backstretch and into the far turn, still had daylight with a furlong remaining, responded when challenged
late and gave ground grudgingly, remained clear for the place. RANDY PAUL last to leave, void of speed, began to move far turn, continued with a steady
rally off the inside, getting to the top two late in finishing up willingly. FROM NOW ON broke back, saved ground, moved out for the drive, improved position
while not a threat to the top three. BUCK DYNASTY prompted the pace for three quarters in the two path, little left for the stretch run. QUALITY
PRODUCTION also in the second flight for six furlongs, tired in the drive as well. OVER FUNDED raced in mid pack off the rail, came four wide out of the
final turn, failed to muster a closing kick. WHAT POWER five wide through the first turn, failed to menace. CAMERON RULES four wide in the first turn, also
never menaced. CAJUN CASH stopped after four furlongs, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
I'M ALL MIXED UP moved up to press the issue soon after the start, dueled through the turn, drew strongly clear through the lane to win ridden out.
KNIGHTS RANSOM off the early leaders while off the rail, raced four out to five wide turning for home, finished willingly to earn the place late, could do little
with the winner. HALF HEROINE forwardly placed while racing outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, proved no match for the winner, caught
late for the place. ELLIE D CAJUN last away, raced back off the pace, steered out to be three wide into the lane, improved position. RACELYNN lacked
speed outside, was fanned six wide into the lane, improved slightly while lacking a serious closing response. SMART N HOLY within striking distance
behind the leaders early, faded. SKEDADDLE BABE broke on top, flashed early speed inside the winner, dueled with that one through much of the turn
before giving way in the drive. UNSPEAKABLE JOY broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
HEZA PRIORITY in the second flight while along the inside, waited brief behind some traffic into the lane, brush, split foes past the furlong marker, gained
the advantage then dug in late to narrowly prevail in a game effort. SLITHER with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled through the turn, brushed
with the winner midstretch, proved stubborn to the end to miss. PAPA BRO also raced with the pace from the outset, dueled through the turn inside the
runner up, vied past the furlong marker then weakened slightly to be unable to match the top two late, remained well clear of the others. COMMANDER
SCOTT in the second group while racing outside, crept a bit closer three wide turning for home, flattened out in the drive. REACH THE CIRCLE lacked early
foot, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position. ALAN'S ARGUMENT lacked speed well off the inside, four wide exiting the turn, went
evenly through the stretch. TITANIUM PLEDGE off a step slow, trailed, remained back. GEM OF CARLOS forwardly placed early, began to back up before
three furlolngs.

Footnotes
DON'T LOOK broke well, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, dueled up the backstretch, put that rival away into the turn, second duel through the
bend, larger lead late turn, pulled away steadily in the drive under pressure. HUGHES DONT LOSE broke well, moved up inside to duel with the winner,
could not keep up with that rival in the drive, saved the place. RUNCIMAN last to leave, continued to lack speed up the backstretch, steadied behind some
traffic late in the turn, dropped inside and rallied up the rail to annex the show. GRIP TIGHT went one paced while racing off the inside. NOCOMET in the
second group while off the inside,came four wide into the stretch, failed to mount a closing kick. K FOR KOHEN void of speed off rail, failed to menace. MY
HARVEY tired while racing toward the inside. IMPRESSIVE GREELY vied early outside the winner, began a steady fade before a half. GRANDDERBY
stopped before a half, far back.
