Footnotes
TIO WIL pressed the pace outside IRISH PAUL, took over after a half-mile, and drew away under a mild drive. SEMPER FI broke a step slow, advanced
inside after a quarter-mile, came off the rail for the stretch run and rallied without seriously menacing the winner. IRISH PAUL set the pace inside for nearly
a half, and weakened through the lane. LIGHT FURY chased outside the leaders to the stretch, and was one-paced to the wire. CAPITAN FOFO broke out
bumping DIAMONDS PROSPECT, raced two wide and failed to threaten. I'AM BEOWULF was outrun four wide. DIAMONDS PROSPECT got bumped by
CAPITAN FOFO at the start, and was outrun inside. TRINNI ENERGY was outrun three wide. COMMENDABLE MAN was finished early.

Footnotes
FANTASTIC KINGDOM was widest of a foursome contesting the front approaching the turn, took over in upper stretch and drove clear. TAKE THE OVER
argued the pace inside three rivals going to the half-mile pole, could not stay with the winner into the lane, but held well for the place. DANA GRACE was
sent up to vie for command between horses midway up the backstretch, and weakened through upper stretch in the two-path. LET'S GO BABY saved
ground and failed to menace through an even effort. DUBAIAN was not a factor two wide. TEGLA argued the pace between horses in the three-path, and
dropped out of the fray midway on the turn. PURO BLANCO showed brief speed outside, and tired. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
OH DEBORAH vied outside SILVER PACKAGE before letting that one go into the turn, rebid after straightening away for the drive, swapped back to her left
lead taking over past the furlong marker, and widened under pressure. SILVER PACKAGE bumped with BLUE PAYNT at the start, vied early inside OH
DEBORAH, cleared off around the turn, could not hold that rival off in mid stretch and held the place. BLUE PAYNT got sandwiched at the break between
SILVER PACKAGE and OH DEBORAH, raced well back to the top of the stretch, moved outside and finished well. MIDNIGHT FAME was skittish loading,
pressed the pace three wide, and faded in upper stretch. THE RAIN IS COMING saved ground behind the leaders around the turn, and lacked the needed
response when called on. RUTHIES RACER hit the left side of the gate at the start, raced two to three wide, and retired early.

Footnotes
DR HARLAN bumped lightly with TIP SHEET at the start, stayed close early under a hold, moved off the rail to go after FOR THE ROAD in upper stretch,
forged past from outside entering the final furlong and drew off. FOR THE ROAD sped clear after the start and moved inside, sailed along unbothered to
upper stretch, and could not hold off the winner while clearly second best. CHARGE CARD was a step slow at the start, was outrun near the three-path to
the stretch, and was along for the show without becoming a factor. PAPACHO saved ground outrun early, moved out in the stretch and passed tired horses.
POOL BOY CHARLIE chased outside the pacesetter early, and faded through the stretch. TIP SHEET bumped lightly with DR HARLAN at the start, was
ridden along two to three wide on the turn, and came up empty. PARTICULARITY dropped back between horses early on the turn, and drifted wide past the
quarter-pole.

Footnotes
AWESOME GERRY was ridden along four wide around the turn, closed in outside TOP BOSS entering the final furlong, reached the front a sixteenth out
and pulled clear. TOP BOSS dueled inside SCREEN STAR and ATTU ISLAND early, got the best of those two by the top of the stretch, could not deny the
winner but stayed on much best of the rest. SCREEN STAR argued the pace between horses, dropped back near the three-sixteenths as if done, moved to
the rail and continued on with good courage. BASTIEN LE BROWN checked greenly and dropped back just after the start, was taken out five or six wide
through the turn, and improved on the far outside late. ATTU ISLAND pressed the pace three wide for three-eighths of a mile, and gave way turning for
home. WIN FOR WINSLOW raced two to three wide, and faded through the stretch. EL SICARIO was no factor four wide. PERUVIAN DANCER lacked
speed far back throughout. CAPTAIN LIO was roused early inside, and had no response.

Footnotes
MORNING STRIDE saved ground taking closer order after a mile, waited patiently behind the leaders past the quarter-pole, split horses in upper stretch and
drew off under good handling. RIJEKA (IRE) saved ground to the third turn, moved out three wide coming under a ride midway on that bend, moved to the
far outside for the drive and overhauled ON A SPREE for second near the finish. ON A SPREE stayed in range toward the inside or in the two-path for 10
furlongs, shifted to the four-path looming a threat at the head of the lane, was clear for second through deep stretch, but surrendered that spot weakening
on his left lead. KREWE CHIEF raced two to three wide, had the rider lose the whip early on the final turn, and had no rally. MAX K. O. moved inside with a
clear lead into the first turn, lost the advantage to RENAISANCE FROLIC first time through the stretch, rebid outside that rival after six furlongs, dueled
through the third turn, and was empty by upper stretch. RENAISANCE FROLIC tracked outside MAX K. O. on the first turn, sped off after a half-mile and
moved inside, got rejoined by MAX K. O. midway up the backstretch the second time, dueled through the final turn, and had nothing left in the stretch.
GOLDEN DECISION raced two to three wide, and stopped after 10 furlongs.

Footnotes
GO GONE GONE sped clear and moved inside after the start, let out a notch to repel a bid from TENCH early on the turn, increased the advantage at the
top of the stretch and was kept to pressure to hold sway. TENCH made an early run outside GO GONE GONE but was repelled, stayed on the chase the
rest of the way and was best of the others. BENEFACTOR was slow to begin after brushing the outer side of the stall and bumping solidly with SOVEREIGN
IMPACT, raced four wide outrun to the stretch, and rallied to go clear of the remainder. COUNTRY SINGER was isolated around the turn tracking the
leaders inside, and came up empty in the stretch. SOVEREIGN IMPACT bumped solidly with BENEFACTOR at the start, raced between horses three wide
around the turn, and lacked a solid response. MUKULWITZ saved ground and was never a factor. ALIEN INVASION was hustled away from the gate to no
avail, and dropped far back approaching the stretch. OUTAMINE was finished early two wide.

Footnotes
ALL AROUND got bumped between MAN OF HONOR and GLORY OF FLORIDA soon after the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, came four wide off
the turn, and kicked in on the far outside to run past an embattled trio in the closing stages. MAN OF HONOR was bumped by ALL AROUND early,
recovered and stayed close into the turn, got through inside JOE DI BAGGIO with a bid along the fence turning for home, and fought gamely to the finish.
JOE DI BAGGIO set the pace slightly off the rail, entered the lane coming under fire from both sides, and weakened slightly late. GLORY OF FLORIDA was
crowded by EXPENSIVE STYLE and forced into ALL AROUND shortly after the start, raced well back for a half-mile, moved out in upper stretch and was
going well to the finish. EXPENSIVE STYLE absorbed a solid bump from SAINT BENEVOLENCE at the start, came in causing crowding soon after that,
chased early between horses, loomed outside the leaders three wide into the lane, and gave way a sixteenth out. LEMNISCATE pressed JOE DI BAGGIO
from outside to the stretch, and faded steadily. SAINT BENEVOLENCE ducked out into EXPENSIVE STYLE at the break, chased early between horses
three wide, and weakened under pressure on the turn. HE'S INCREDIBLE bobbled at the start, raced four wide and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
BUDGET BUSTER was four wide into the first turn, moved in a bit tracking behind the dueling leaders up the backstretch, got out-moved into the far turn by
EL GRAN CACAO and tapped on the brakes, regrouped swinging four wide into the lane, and was along in time outside. TIZ LUNA dueled outside
BEINFUN for better than six furlongs, shook clear into the stretch, and stayed on stubbornly on the rail to save a share of second. MR TITO'S saved ground
until moving to the two-path midway on the far turn, rallied gamely between horses past the sixteenth-pole and finished on even terms for the place just
inside the winner. I AINT TELLIN was slow into stride, saved ground far back for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and was going well too late between
horses. YADI was slow to get going, raced two wide outrun to the quarter-pole, moved inside through upper stretch and gained to the finish. RED SORRELL
steadied along through the first turn and entering the backstretch, continued to lack room on the rail entering the far turn, shifted out three wide finding
himself behind a wall of horses turning for home, altered course outside past the eighth-pole and finished with good courage. BEINFUN vied outside TIZ
LUNA to the head of the stretch, and gave way. SNORING BARTH saved ground early, moved in from the three-path around the far turn, and could not
make an impact. RAGS FOR BRITCHES lagged far back to the stretch, shifted out widest and remained outrun. EL GRAN CACAO stayed in range early,
lodged a brief three-wide bid outside the duelers past the five-sixteenths, and retreated into the stretch. MIKE IS READY settled in the middle of the field for
six furlongs, and faded four wide leaving the far turn. JANUARY WON was three wide early near the back, and never got close.

Footnotes
GRAN ETIQUETA raced close up four wide for six furlongs, took over from outside in upper stretch and drove clear on her left lead. DARESCA broke out,
moved up between horses along the backstretch, swung five wide rallying into the lane, and went clear of the rest on her left lead. SILVER PALMS dropped
back inside through the backstretch run, got through inside the leaders to loom a threat on the rail turning for home, but flattened out in the last eighth of a
mile. CRYSTALINA saved ground early, came two wide into the stretch, raced between horses through the furlong grounds and needed more. RACK
DADDY raced four to five wide, and tired after six furlongs. SURPRISE ARRIVAL was in the two-path battling for command inside DONA CAMILE into and
around the turn, and gave way in upper stretch. DONA CAMILE was crowded a stride out of the gate between TIZNOISE and GRAN ETIQUETTE, went up
to contest the top outside SURPRISE ARRIVAL, and faltered through the drive. TIZNOISE came out just after the start, and was always outrun. LET'S GO
LUNA was finished early. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.
