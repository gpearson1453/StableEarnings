Footnotes
WILLOW MOON broke quickly and established the lead up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and was hand ridden
in the final sixteenth of a mile. KISSMEONEMORETIME chased the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the turn in the
two path and could not go with the winner down the lane while proving to be the best of the rest. DUSTY MILLER raced in the middle of the pack up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and raced evenly in the stretch while never threatening the top two. TRUE TO JEANINE raced on the
rail at the back of the pack early, saved ground around the turn and offered no bid in the stretch. I DON'T WANT TO GO broke in slightly leaving the gate,
was straightened out quickly by her rider, trailed the field up the backstretch, began a mild bid nearing the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from the
three path and faded from there.

Footnotes
SCATERRA led at the half mile mark between horses, set a pressured pace into the turn, began to inch to a more defined lead from the three eighths,
cleared in upper stretch, went to a drive approaching the furlong pole when already well clear, and continued to draw off. RUBY ROUND HERE raced four
wide in the leading flight early, settled back to chase the leading trio from the seven sixteenths, pursued in the five path on the bend, swung four wide into
the lane, ran on outside and got up for second in the final jump. SUNSHINE LINE raced three wide in the leading flight, did not go with SCATERRA from the
three eighths, came three wide in the lane and continued to chase that foe while proving no match, and lost second in the final jump. GRACIANA settled
near the rear, raced in the two path on the turn, was driven into the lane, proved no match for the top three, and was all out to hold fourth. BACK IT UP was
fractious in the gate, stumbled in the opening strides, took back to the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, and had no rally in the lane. BIG WIN was
hustled for speed up the inside but outsprinted from the half by SCATERRA, was urged to prompt the pace while saving ground through the turn, had no
response when driven approaching the turn for home, weakened, and was not persevered with late.

HONEY MUG settled off the pace up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the quarter pole, took command at the eighth pole and
continued to pull away while drifting out slightly in the final furlong. RELEASE THE HEAT dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, entered the stretch still locked in battle, and could not go with the winner while finishing evenly. LUCKY FEVER dueled for the lead on the
outside through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the turn, dropped back entering the stretch, and finished evenly while proving to be no
match for the winner. PLACATI trailed the field from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, and offered no bid entering the stretch. NEW
RULES contested for the lead on the inside in the opening strides, dropped back headed into the turn, saved ground around the turn and continued to tire
from there. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THERE ARE NO TIMES FOR THE MIDDLE FRACTIONS OF THIS RACE. Missing times determined
following video review.

NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) soon led, raced on a clear lead in the two path on the turn, and remained well clear under a drive in the lane. TRE LEE DIVINE
chased early, was pushed along near the half mile mark, tracked three wide on the turn in the four path, disputed second position with ELUSIVE FORCE
down the lane while no match for the winner, and edged to a clear second in the final furlong. ELUSIVE FORCE tracked three wide early, came in near
EXPECT ELPRADA past the half mile mark, tracked the pace between horses around the turn, went to a drive into the lane, disputed second position to the
furlong mark and flattened out late. MY CURBY raced at the inside of the rear pair, took up past the half mile mark to avoid the spill, continued in the rear
pair on the two path on the turn, and lacked the needed rally in the lane. FOUR LEFT FEET settled at the outside of the rear pair down the backstretch and
in the five path on the turn, and made no bid. DRAMA STAR was urged for speed along the inside, tracked well off the leader while saving ground through
the turn, and weakened from the three eighths. EXPECT ELPRADA grazed the gate, tracked the pace between horses early to the half mile mark, stumbled
when in tight after ELUSIVE FORCE came in past the half mile pole, unseated the rider when he stumbled, and walked off the course after being
apprehended by the outriders on the clubhouse turn after the race. AFTER AN INQUIRY, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE, DETERMINING THE
FOOTAGE TO BE INCONCLUSIVE.

Footnotes
DIVE DEEP led the field from the rail up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the turn and managed to hold off the late closers to get the win.
SAVAGE stalked the frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to launch a bid from the three path passing the quarter pole, made up
ground on the leader the length of the stretch, but couldn't get by. CHARLIECANDO raced well off the pace in the early going, saved ground around the
turn, began a bid at the eighth pole and was gaining ground quickly near the wire. ON K P raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in
the three path, angled out in the stretch to find racing room and passed tiring horses from there. SUPRISE CAT stalked the frontrunners from the rail in the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and came up empty in the stretch. MS. DRAGONETTE chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch and around the turn, navigated the turn from the two path and tired in the final furlong. GRAND HIDEAWAY trailed the field from the two path
the entire way around the oval and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SILVER QUARTERS raced two wide in midpack, advanced comfortably three wide past the three eighths, disputed the pace two wide in upper stretch, was
driven to the lead midstretch, and held. ACCESSIBLE settled two wide in the rear pair through the first turn, continued at the rear of the main pack down the
backstretch, took closer order in the three path on the far turn, was driven three wide into upper stretch, rallied well three wide and narrowly missed. LEMON
KICK settled midpack inside of SILVER QUARTERS, tracked the leading flight in the two path through the second turn, saved ground into the lane, kept on
toward the inside but was held at bay. DRAYKE'S CHANNEL raced rankly into the first turn and bumped RULE FOLLOWER near the seven eighths, stalked
the pace two wide through the clubhouse turn, pulled to the lead past the three quarters, dueled two wide past the nine sixteenths, began to flatten out
between horses approaching the quarter pole and had no extra for the drive. RULE FOLLOWER was keen to the lead early along the inside despite being
bumped near the seven eighths, was headed past the three quarters by DRAYKE'S CHANNEL, pulled to reengage inside that foe and dueled inside from
the nine sixteenths, continued to dispute the pace with SILVER QUARTERS into the lane, but weakened in the final furlong. BURL raced at the inside of the
rear pair around the first turn, was hard to settle into the backstretch, dropped several lengths off the pace and settled, took closer order when pushed along
in the two to three path on the far turn, swung to the far outside into the lane, and lacked the needed kick under a drive in the lane.

RIVER EVANGELIST trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to improve position around the far turn, made a
wide bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, entered the stretch from the two path, took the lead on the outside and held on for the win. MCHENRY saved
ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained
ground late on the outside in the stretch. LETTHEBIGSHOT ROLL tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced
between horses headed into the far turn, began his move from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, lead briefly with a furlong to go and gave way
grudgingly. FORT RIDGE raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three
path, launched a bid between horses entering the stretch and continued to improve position from there. GOLDEN GIFT saved ground around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch on the inside, raced on the rail around the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. FLEETWAY raced in the three path around
the first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside near the pace, moved up to challenge from the three path around the far turn, lead briefly entering
the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ALLEGIANCE dueled for the lead on the outside in the opening half mile, raced in the two path the entire way
around the oval and faded in the stretch. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF dueled for the lead on the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, and was
through after a half mile.

Footnotes
LEMON BLITZ dropped to the inside near the seven eighths, tracked the leaders inside of INDEPENDENT INDY, improved inside through the far turn,
switched outside of CROW MOON past the five sixteenths, engaged outside that foe near the quarter pole, put him away into the final furlong, and held
narrowly. CAUSE FOR PARDON settled in the chasing flight inside of COLOMBARD through the clubhouse turn, chased midfield down the backstretch,
saved ground through the far turn, came into the lane under a drive, switched three wide for the final furlong, rallied well under a drive and just missed.
ROAR OF THE LION settled at the inside of the rear flight through the first turn, took slightly closer order into the backstretch, improved between horses
through the far turn, shifted four wide for the final furlong, kept on but could not match the top two. CROW MOON went keenly to the lead, set a pressured
pace through the first turn and down the backstretch run, cleared off while saving ground into the far turn, was engaged by LEMON BLITZ to his outside
approaching the quarter pole, dueled inside that foe under a drive, but weakened past the furlong mark. INDEPENDENT INDY tracked the leading pair
outside of CAUSE FOR PARDON, was urged three wide on the far turn, went to a drive near the quarter, but came up empty. COLOMBARD raced two wide
in the chasing flight through the first turn, settled back toward the rear down the backstretch, continued two wide in the trailing flight through the second turn,
and was no factor. SYRUP pressed outside CROW MOON through the first turn and along the backstretch, could not go with that foe into the second turn,
flattened out three wide on the far turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, and proved empty. V MAN raced two wide in the rear flight through the first
turn, trailed down the backstretch, saved ground in the rear flight through the far turn, and never mustered a bid.
