Footnotes
SHARP STARR remained along the inside route after the field had been sent on its way, flashed interest after the half had been rattled, inched up being
lightly hand urged, quickened working her way into the four path from midpoint on the turn to the five-sixteenths pole, came up towards the head of the
stretch and was set down, still stationed in the four path, took charge during the ensuing furlong, then drew off even further, kept busy to the end. LA KARA
MIA tracked the front runners within striking distance, from just of the rail, got cued up for the drive home, spun three wide into the lane, failed to keep pace
with the winner but had enough to secure second. CALIDAD attained a prominent position, was in path three forcing the issue as the widest of three until the
five-sixteenths pole, get let loose heading home, saw the top one snatch away the advantage soon afterwards, ventured onward and got outfinished for the
place too. CROSS KEYS cut over to the rail after the break, was the innermost of three contending for the top all the way to the five-sixteenths pole, stepped
into the stretch and faltered. ADRIATIC HOLIDAY bobbled at the start, was three wide entering the turn and sent out four wide under encouragement exiting
it, lacked a response. DANCING SLIPPERS did battle from path two from between rivals until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, folded. CENTRAL
PERK pursued the pace from the two path, angled five wide into the lane with little left and backed away readily, mildly hand ridden.

Footnotes
CATCH A CAB five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path five furlongs from home, raced two to three wide through the turn
patiently handled, angled five wide for home, got roused when taking over command straightened away, edged clear under a drive and was taken in hand
nearing the finish the outcome in no doubt. MISSION COMMAND tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked to the inside at the five-eighths, saved
ground through the turn, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. CURLIN'S LEGACY just off the inside at the
tail of the field in the early stages, tucked to the inside five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick. HONORABLE HERO three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing
three furlongs from home, went five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in offering up a bid a furlong from home, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in
the late stages. CONTROL GROUP coaxed from the gate, settled forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival
through the latter portion of the turn, got set down when taking command spinning three wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and
weakened. TRUE GOLD coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing under threat at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside for home displaced from the front, tired in the stretch. BLUE PIGEON forwardly placed three wide down the backstretch, began to fade nearing
the far turn, went four wide through that bend dropping to the rear under a light protective hold, spun three wide into upper stretch and was eased through to
the finish, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
BLACKJACK DAVEY kept watch on the front runners from along the inside until the end of the backstretch, was let out a notch slipping into the two path at
the half mile pole, came under the whip being asked to pick it up a furlong later, tipped into the four path at the five-sixteenths pole in preparation for the
drive home, crept up menacingly a few strides later, unleashed a bold move to take charge stepping onto the head of the stretch, shifted over closer to the
rail having shot to the top, not sufficiently clear of ROYAL SUSPECT though thus causing its pilot to check hard and lose momentum, kicked away
proceeding along on a slightly erratic course before being geared down in the final seventy yards. MICROSECOND rated stalking the pace during the
opening phase from path two, slid into the pocket coming up the the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed within striking distance, angled four wide into the
lane, went on to secure the place. ROYAL SUSPECT along the outside throughout, increased his presence after the first fraction had been finalized, vied
from path three as the widest of three during the run around the bend, saw the winner come in sharply at the head of the stretch after having inhaled a
threesome of front runners, checked in close proximity to a shiftijng BLACKJACK DAVEY, recovered sufficiently enough to nail down third. JADE'S DREAM
a forward factor, disputed the pace from the two path, going about the task from between rivals on the turn, spun into the stretch and backed away. RIVER
NILE rank and requiring some restraint from the rider during the initial stages, was still sighted pulling on the bit from midway on the backstretch to the half
mile pole, left that station three wide, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, had no offering. PACIFIC JAZZ went over to the rail with
advantage, was forced to fend off a pair of rivals to the outside after stepping onto the turn, relinquished for good as three-quarters was being completed,
then gave way. WAKANDA FOREVER pursued the pace from the two path, under a drive prior to the half mile pole, fell back weakening on the turn, fanned
out into path six from upper to midlane and fell back even more. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on an incident at the top of the lane, in addition to a
claim of lodged by the rider of ROYAL SUSPECT against the rider of BLACKJACK DAVEY alleging interference, the result was allowed to stand and the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
STAY FOND pinched shortly after the start, got guided over to the rail a few strides shy of the half mile pole, was switched over to some hand
encouragement approximately a furlong down the road, was steered into the two path at the top of the lane, closed in on the ones to catch in a steadfast
manner, altered course towards path three inside the sixteenth pole, wore down the runner up and edged away. COTTON CANDY CUTIE assumed the top,
cut over to the inside route, showed the way, feeling some pressure from the outside, had it pick it up in intensity when two others parked out three and four
wide respectively added themselves to the pace picture, got set down getting put to the test by MY LAST MILLION as they spun into the lane, beat back the
stiff challenge, had no answer when the winner arrived on the scene with less than a sixteenth to go, stayed on for second after yielding. TAYLER'S THE
BOSS tracked the pace from just off the inside, got set up along the right rim of the inside route for the drive home, inched up, was maneuvered four wide
late, ventured onward with a mild response to be along for the show. MY LAST MILLION pressed the issue from path two, doing so from between rivals on
the bend, challenged in earnest heading onto the top of the lane, got staved off, then weakened in the final furlong. PRINCESS MIKAYAH pursued the pace
from path three on the turn, was moved out in the stretch until about seven wide, rallied mildly. MALARKEY sat forwardly placed three wide, was put to a
drive disputing the pace as one of the middle members of a quartet during the run around the bend, shifted a couple of paths wider in the lane, failed to
claim the top and weakened. TEQUILA SUNDAY parked out four wide arguing as the outermost of a quartet on the turn, angled out six wide once in the
stretch, had no offering and backed away. PEACHES AND SPICE launched no bids while undergoing a ground-saving journey. FIRST FOREVER took up
the chase two wide, got set down by the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and gave way.

CREED five then four wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive rallying to issue a challenge to the top dueling pair, collared them in tandem seventy yards from home and went on by to inch away safely in
front to the finish. MISTER WINSTON four then three wide in aim of the leader, got set down spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling
through the stretch with LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE to his inside taking narrow command a furlong from home, got caught seventy yards from the finish and
battled on to secure the place honors. LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the
turn and came under increased pressure from a pair to the outside, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in knocking heads with the aforementioned foe
getting narrowly displaced a furlong from home, fought on to the finish to safely secure the show honors. EDGE OF FIRE chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch offering up a mild bid, then weakened in the final furlong. VILLAINOUS five paths off
the inside early on, tucked to the two path five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and
improved position by tired foes. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE stumbled at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered
two to three wide for home, weakened in the stretch, then was in some distress after the finish, got cooled off and was subsequently vanned off. LIFE
CHANGER prompted the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tired. LIAM'S FIRE chased
two to three wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under urging seven-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired, and
was eased through to the finish, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
COMPLEXITY lunged out as the field was sent off and running, cemented itself into a prominent position, got set up in the four path, sat perched as the
outermost of four front runners on near even terms with other from the top of the bend until its end, got cued up challenging for the lead after settling onto
the head of the stretch, quickly took over, left the eighth pole with a fairly healthy lead, kept it, hand driven for the last seventy yards. WIN WIN WIN saw the
pilot take hold after getting pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, alternated between the inside route and the two path afterwards stalking the pace
before choosing the latter as the one to take on the turn, waited behind some rivals as three-quarters was being completed, tipped towards path three
spinning into the lane, prevented from going wider due to being hemmed in by another, got pinched leaving the three-sixteenths marker, steadied and
altered course to the outside a short distance past the eighth pole, eventually winding up approximately six wide, kicked in when finally clear, finishing with
willingness to procure the place. NICODEMUS underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, got fanned out about six wide from upper to midlane, mustered up
enough of a response in the last eighth to grab the show. BACKSIDEOFTHEMOON took the inside route, clawed its way into contention during the first half
of the stretch run, flattened out. SNIPER SHOT disputed the pace from the two path, going about the task from between rivals on the turn, weakened in the
final furlong. NO DOZING gently pinched at the start, rushed up when put to some hand urging, contended for the top three wide from between rivals on the
turn, kept at it until the furlong grounds before faltering. SPINOFF reserved three wide while observing the quartet a short distance up ahead, went wider
and wider in the stretch, ended up in the neighborhood of path seven, made no headway. DISCREET LOVER argued for the top from the rail, fighting
against as many as three to his outside on the turn, finished off six furlongs and folded.

Footnotes
FIFTY FIVE tracked the pace two to three wide from near the rear of the compact field, remained patiently handled until set down angled five to six wide into
upper stretch, offered up a good kick coming in to look her rivals in the eye inside the eighth pole, dueled through the final sixteenth with the runner up in
game fashion and just got the nod on the wire. CLASSIC LADY tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket behind the cover of the leader patiently
handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch into daylight, rallied up the rail to take command a furlong from home, dug in under challenge and
dueled gamely inside the aforementioned foe through the final sixteenth and just lost the bob by a sliver on the line. WAR CANOE tracked the pace
forwardly placed just off the inside in the clear, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish to
secure the show honors while unable to match the top pair in the late stages. MUNCHKIN MONEY bobbled at the break, recovered to settle three wide at
the tail of the field down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, saved ground through the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch in behind
rivals, took to the inside near the eighth pole and followed CLASSIC LADY up the inside keeping on to the wire but was outkicked. KREESIE three to four
wide in pursuit from mid pack albeit in range of the leader, floated five to six paths off the inside five furlongs from home, tucked three wide at the half mile
pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FETCHING established the front and
showed the way under a rating hold along the inside through sensible splits, remained patient awaiting a challenge through to the five-sixteenths when
engaged by a pair to the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, yielded nearing the eighth pole and weakened through the
final furlong.

Footnotes
APOLLO'S ABRAXAS away without apparent mishap, established the front end prior to leaving the homestretch, was well rated along the inside setting split
after split, settled onto the top of the lane before being turned loose, kicked away to her largest lead during the rest of the way to the eighth pole, held on
well fending off the solo stretch threat.. CAINUDOTHETWIST took up position in midpack after the start, was unhurried two wide until the half mile pole,
slithered to the outside springing from that station becoming four wide in short order, got set down about as wide for the drive home, narrowed in, shied out
twice between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, in each instance reacting from some stick work, continued to chip away at the deficit but had to
settle for second. MIZZEN THE MARK gathered after breaking to the outside, raced three wide on each bend, swung into the lane a little wider then rallied
well enough to be along for the show. MOLLY'S NIGHTHAWK remained stationed along the rail, checked early on the backstretch after coming up into
close proximity to the heels of the top one, recovered and began to rate again, only sitting a much deeper pocket then prior, had GEN Z get guided over to
the rail after entering the far turn, seemingly sought passage to the outside and was allowed to ease back,now forced to draft behind a weakening foe, finally
slipped to the outside after three-quarters had been reeled off, angled five wide for the drive home, lost the show. PEERLESS pursued the pace primarily
from the two path, was tipped three to four wide coming into upper stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. HERWAZE rode the rail until the conclusion of the
backstretch, travelled from path two on turn two, stepped into the lane then went on to mainly improve position. CENTRAL CAPITAL strung out three wide
on the clubhouse bend, prompted the winner one path closer to the rail and from between rivals on the subsequent one, arrived into the lane and gave way.
GEN Z chased APOLLO'S ABRAXAS from the two path, cut over to the rail at the half mile pole, went on to save ground and faltered. PAINITE underwent a
three wide journey, was through after going six furlongs. HERE COMES BUBBLES three wide early, found refuge on the inside by the half mile pole, saved
ground to the head of the stretch, never made its presence felt.
