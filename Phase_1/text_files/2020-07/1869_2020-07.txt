Footnotes
GRIT AND GLORY tracked the pace along the inside forwardly placed, lost position as rivals advanced outside down the backstretch, tipped to the two path
half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to get up in the final
jumps and prevail. JEROME AVENUE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide into the first turn and was briefly in tight between rivals easing off to chase
three wide through that opening bend, settled in pursuit three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing near the seven-sixteenths and advanced to
challenge through the far turn taking command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole
but under growing lone threat to the outside and was nailed in the very last strides to the wire. GUY CABALLERO three to four wide in pursuit from the tail of
the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced, swung three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. SARGEANT
DRIVE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to
go, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. RUCKSACK four wide into the first turn, tucked three wide through that bend before
chasing two to three wide, backed away through the far turn and lost ground, swung three wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish, then
walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
PRICE TALK was taken under some restraint early then settled on the inside, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner under a strong
hand ride into the stretch then was put to a left-handed whip, angled out and bumped MAGIC MOJO hard inside the three-sixteenths, rallied outside under a
hand ride into the final furlong, closed fast under confident handling to take the advantage into the final sixteenth then moved clear under a hand ride.
ETERNAL SUMMER strolled to the front then was placed under tight restraint on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside under a
snug hold, responded well when asked coming to the quarter-pole, was put to a right-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip into the
final furlong, led until the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to get the place. SCANNO broke out at the start, was taken under a tight hold early,
went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, battled
under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to hold the show. MAGIC MOJO was taken under restraint early, went around the first turn
in the two path, was rated in third position, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path while asked outside the five-sixteenths, shifted three
wide into the stretch under a drive, was bumped hard by the winner and forced out into another foe inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final
furlong and lacked the needed kick. LEADING WEST dropped back along the rail while under coaxing early, saved ground on the first turn, moved off the
rail on the backstretch, went three wide early on the far turn then was roused while shifting four wide near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under
the whip, was bumped inside the three-sixteenths and steadied while forced out and lacked the needed response. THIS ILL DEFEND was taken under a
tight hold, lugged out a bit into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while three wide early on the far
turn, was guided around the late part of that bend under some extra left-rein pressure, came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to rally. FIXATION
went two to three wide on the first turn, was reserved at the rear, moved in nearing the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn in the two path and faltered..
Following a stewards' inquiry into the stretch run, PRICE TALK was disqualified from first and placed fifth for interference in upper stretch. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
PALACE AVENGER side by side during the initial stages disputing the pace to the inside of PALOMITA,dropped back when put to a hold as the first fraction
was being finalized, was a little rough on the bit tipping into the two path right afterwards, applied pressure on the aforementioned rival during the run around
the bend, got cued up challenging in earnest as they spun into the stretch, fought onward with vigour after claiming the front end, edged away well inside the
sixteenth pole then held on late to preserve the decision. CARRIZO remained along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, assumed
the pocket and closed the gap after the top one had abandoned the rail at the top of the turn, pulling on the bit, got steadied when temporarily in close
proximity to the front runners in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, fell back slightly as a result but also lost some of its earlier-displayed keenness,
angled three wide entering the stretch, kicked into her best stride with under a furlong to go, flashed belated foot, came up short. PALOMITA argued for
control matched up with the winner, from path two on the backstretch and then along the right rim of the inside route on the turn, got roused being put to the
test coming into the stretch, relinquished reluctantly, did battle until the final sixteenth before weakening. GLASS CEILING left the post parade early then
proceeded to brush with PALOMITA after losing her footing springing from the gate, cut over to the inside, tracked the pace from just off the rail, swung four
wide into the stretch, becoming the widest of all, went one path wider after some left side pressure, made no headway. FIGURE OF SPEECH two to three
wide on the turn, was more the latter during the stretch run, had no offering.

ESCAPE FUND coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coaxed along, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take
command a sixteenth from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. DIAL ME UP dueled from the two path with PALACE DUCHESS to her outside,
tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat, got collared a
sixteenth out and kept on to secure the place honors. THRILL coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. YES TO MISCHIEF three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths,
continued three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. PALACE DUCHESS broke out at the start trading a pair of bumps
with VALLETTA who broke inwards, dueled three to four paths off the inside with DIAL ME UP to her inside, tucked to the two path through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. VALLETTA broke in at the start trading two bumps with the
aforementioned foe, chased four paths off the inside until placed to coaxing tucked to the rail half a mile from home, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. GRAN CHEMIN chased five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and tired.

BIG ENGINE settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, quickened stride late on that bend, rallied while cutting the corner into the stretch
then came under the whip, made an inside bid at the three-sixteenths, took the lead just inside the furlong marker then shook clear, was given one final
crack of the whip inside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under a hand ride to the wire. THE CARETAKER settled on the far outside, was urged along
while five wide on the turn then driven into upper stretch, brushed with a foe at the furlong marker and finished willingly to get the place. LEAKY CUP
chased then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path for most of the turn then moved to the four path, took a short lead into the stretch,
drifted in under a right-handed whip around the three-sixteenths then was switched to a left-handed whip, went back to a right-handed whip after losing the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked while able to get the show. THORNY TALE chased the pace from third, went around the turn in the
four path, turned into the stretch under a drive, brushed with a foe while dropping back into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. KAZMANIA settled
towards the rear of the field, went three wide on the turn, paused behind a rival outside the quarter-pole then swung seven wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. STEAM ENGINE was hustled to the lead, set the pace under some pressure to the outside, vied in the two path while inside of an opponent on the
turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the lead inside that pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and gave way. DARK MONEY settled off
the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally. NUEVA YORK settled at the rear of the field, saved
ground under urging on the turn and was no factor.

PROPENSITY took up position in midpack after the field had been sent off and running, departed the backstretch from the two path and drafted behind
cover, tipped one path farther off the rail at the five-sixteenths pole and crept up to the front runners under his own power, came into the stretch and after
settling in was fed its cue, emerged as the leader by the end of the furlong grounds, edged away, then held well late to stay sufficiently in the clear.
KNOCKOUT PUNCH pursued the pace three wide on the turn, swung out five wide entering the stretch, finished with willingness down the center of the
course to procure the place. SIR CHUBBY tracked the pace from just off the inside, got maneuvered into the four path leaving the five-sixteenths pole,
shifted a bit inward shortly afterwards and rallied for the show. MR EVERYTHING sat within range from along the inside route, went into the two path and
issued a bid at the head of the stretch, wasn't up to the task at hand and flattened out. NO BAD DAYS sent over to the rail at the top of the turn, fanned out
into path six during the first stages of the stretch run, becoming the widest of all, closed in after mustering a mild response. POINT OF HUMOR quickly
spotted along the rail, was under encouragement going two wide into the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. TIZ ENVY gathered after breaking to the
outside with his first step, saved ground for most of the journey leading up to the quarter pole, was worked into the three path heading for the eighth pole,
made no impact. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER sparred for control from the two path, cleared the nemesis at the five-sixteenths pole and got guided over to the
inside in time to cut the corner into the stretch, felt the presence of the winner soon afterwards, succumbed and backed away. SPITBALL raced within
striking distance from the two path, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. ONTHEWINGSOFLOU away a length the tardiest after striking the
left side of the gate, made it int the two path by the conclusion of the backstretch, shifted into path four early in the stretch, failed to menace. BAYERN'S
MIRAGE along the rail arguing for the advantage until the dive-sixteenths pole, faltered.

challenge through the final furlong steadily gaining and was up in the very last jump to the finish. ASTORIA KITTEN established the front and showed the
way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under
threat to the outside and was nailed in the very last stride to the wire. SUMMER AT THE SPA three wide in pursuit, tucked inside three furlongs from home,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. GIACOSA brushed the near side stall at the
start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. AVA K'S GIRL

DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE broke in and bumped with a rival, stalked the pace on the outside from third, went three wide while in dead aim of the leader on
the turn, was asked after having the rider take a peak over each shoulder at the quarter-pole then quickly took the advantage, shook clear under a
right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths then was switched to a left-handed whip, widened under a drive until the sixteenth-pole then was eased up
while much the best. MAKE MISCHIEF was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near
the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch, lost touch with that foe outside the furlong marker and proved no match while able to
get the place. HOPEFUL PRINCESS was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while able to get the show. HARA pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths,
dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. QUEEN ARELLA was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while pinched back, settled at the rear
of the field, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to rally. QUINOA TIFAH bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, was urged along off the
pace, went two to three wide under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to respond. BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES stumbled outward at the start then
bumped with a rival, settled under some restraint, moved closer with a half-mile to run, saved ground on the turn, was taken out of the race while traveling
uncomfortably late on that bend then dropped to the rear of the field and was pulled up but walked off.

COUNTRY GRAMMER away in good order, got set up in the pocket before leaving the homestretch, rated well keeping an eye on the front runners
contending for the top a short distance up ahead, inched up after three-quarters had been reeled, gained usable passage along the inside corridor past the
five-sixteenths pole, availed for the opportunity provided, moving up and then cutting the corner into the lane with good momentum, whittled away at the
deficit during the ensuing furlong, enough so as to begin the last eighth on near terns with CARACARO, raced directly abreast of that opponent thereafter,
assumed the slimmest of leads when the twosome made contact with under a sixteenth remaining, then stayed on well enough long enough to cross the
wire first. CARACARO gently pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, powered his way forward, proceeded along the two path on the first turn, was
swung out three wide entering the backstretch, left the half mile pole from the same one, made his presence felt around the far turn, arrived into the stretch
and challenged in earnest, emerged at the furlong marker in front, albeit barely, went at it eye to eye with the winner from that juncture onward, fell back by
a sliver after bumping with the top one in deep stretch, ventured onward, but had to settle for second. MYSTIC GUIDE brushed at the start, sat reserved two
wide for over three-quarters, fanned out into path four from upper to midlane, rallied for the show. CELTIC STRIKER attained a forward position after
bobbling at the start, attended the pacesetter two to three wide, got asked for more after going six furlongs, stepped into the lane approximately two wide,
backed away. MODERNIST saved ground until the quarter pole, was urged into the two path for entrance into the stretch, made no impact.
CHESTERTOWN pinched at the start, took up the chase two wide in midpack, commenced the stretch one path wider, gave way. CANDY TYCOON
stumbled in an awkward manner after springing from the gate, tucked along the rail and went on to save ground to no avail. MO HAWK argued for control
from along the inside, well rated in the early stages, drifted a bit towards the two path in the first stages of a retreat in the general area of the five-sixteenths
pole, made it to the head of the stretch appearing to have little left and faded. KATZARELLI brushed at the start, raced three wide on both turns and folded.

Footnotes
SECURE CONNECTION saved ground at the tail of the field, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, angled in to the two path near the eighth
pole, tipped out slightly offering up a good finish to split foes inside the sixteenth marker and was up late to prevail. AUNT NADINE just off the inside just off
the pace, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, offered up a good energy to close in and was up for the place honors in the
last jumps. GRUDGE dueled three wide down the backstretch with SIENA'S TICKET to her inside, shook off that rival into the turn shaking away to a
comfortable margin, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole but under growing threat from a pair and got
collared by both in the final strides to the finish. ALLEY TO CALVARY chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ROUSEY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. TRADEABLE chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and passed tired rivals. QUASAR two to three wide in pursuit, came
under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and made no headway. DOLL coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and weakened. SIENA'S TICKET coaxed from the start, dueled briefly from the inside with
GRUDGE to her outside, got shaken off into the turn and chased along the rail, spun just off the inside for home and faltered.
