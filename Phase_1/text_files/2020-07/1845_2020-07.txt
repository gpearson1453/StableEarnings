Footnotes
CAMPAIGN SPY, off a bit slowly, was settled between foes in second flight racing to the turn, came through close quarters splitting rivals just of the inside
racing into upper stretch and took over in late stages under firm handling. CLASSY PAPA, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the outset on a
narrow advantage racing into the turn, edged forward in upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. NEVERBLINK, forwardly placed
three deep prompting the pace racing into the turn, continued to press the issue into upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. L' CRISTABAL tracked
off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, shifted four wide midway through the bend making some brief progress but lacked the needed final kick.
HOMELAND MESSA, urged between foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, gave way entering upper stretch while being steadied out of tight quarters.
SMELLIN CANDY tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch but proved empty in the closing stages. THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

CLICKBAIT tracked just off the first flight six wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards entering the turn advancing on the leaders four wide into upper
stretch, then wrested the advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. GRAND PRIZE, urged between foes disputing the pace, dueled along the
inside leaving the turn to upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner but lasted narrowly for second. MIZZEN AIR tracked off the first flight in the five path
early, conceded some position racing into the turn, swung five wide entering the lane and continued with interest while just outkicked for second. SANDY
SANGRIA, urged outside rivals in the first flight pressing the pace four wide early, then three wide between foes to upper stretch, gave way in late stages.
BRIGHT BLING, urged inside rivals prompting the pace, gave way early. FORTY NINE MODEL urged three wide between foes prompting the pace, was
through after a half. WILD MUNNY settled last racing off the inside, angled five wide racing through the turn but offered no rally.

Footnotes
ASK BAILEY, settled last along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside foes nearing the far turn, steadily advanced four wide into upper stretch to
challenge for command nearing the furlong marker, drifted in markedly once gaining the advantage under some left handed pressure, came under some
correction leaving the sixteenth marker and widened to the end while finishing on her own courage. URBAN FAIRYTALE tracked the pacesetter inside rivals
as part of the second flight, shifted out three wide racing into the far turn and continued in that path to late stages to prove best of the others. DELIA
O'HARA, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to bid between foes nearing midstretch but had no late kick while
edging a rival for a share. DEFEND THE ROSE sprinted to the lead along the inside, opened a comfortable advantage after a half, held sway to upper
stretch but gave out once headed by the winner late. SMART N WICKED angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved
ground
to
upper
stretch
gaining
position
inside
foes
but
lost
some
momentum
when
racing
in
tight
quarters
through
the
final
furlong.
LILFEATHEREDINDIAN tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but was through after a half. MACHOS VISION was
a brief factor three wide in second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

TUT'S REVENGE broke readily to gain a forward placing along the rail,conceded the lead to stalk just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, switched
outside the leader on the far turn advancing readily to challenge, took over racing into upper stretch to gain a clear advantage, then gamely held rivals in a
brisk drive while drifting out making light contact with TEMPLE nearing the wire. GIANT PAYDAY was rated along the inside tracking the leaders from just
out of striking distance, came through close quarters splitting rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch to bid inside the pacesetter late and just failed
to edge that rival. TEMPLE was rated outside GIANT PAYDAY tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted
to advance while shifting out three wide entering the lane then continued willingly to the end while just outfinished by the top pair and exchanging light
contact nearing the wire. PRIMO TOUCH, urged to a clear advantage while angling inside, set the pace to the far turn and gave out racing into upper
stretch. BROKEN KEY settled last along the inside to the backstretch and never gained contention.

Footnotes
SUMMER ASSAULT was rated just off the pacesetter while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, continued under patient handling into the far turn,
came through when presented an opening to challenge for command inside rivals in upper stretch then edged forward late under firm handling and some
right handed pressure. ANGELUS WARRIOR was rated between foes in second flight tracking the leaders into the backstretch, shifted out three deep
entering the far turn advancing on the leaders, moved to challenge for command while drifting out in upper stretch and contested the issue to late stages
while just failing to match the winner. CREATIVE PLAN, in touch from the outset attending a rival's pace under light reserve racing to the backstretch,
pressed the issue between foes on the far turn into the lane and grudgingly resisted the top pair while being just outkicked. BAYOU PROSPECTOR settled
along the inside tracking off the second flight, angled out nearing the lane to race five wide through the stretch and made some mild progress late. PLANE
TALK, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside rivals into the far turn and
gave way between foes leaving midstretch. HONDO LANE tracked off the second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the stretch. WILD
TONIGHT, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, gave way nearing the far turn.

CENTRAL PARK broke readily to gain terms with the pacesetter between foes attending that rival's tempo under light rating racing to the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the far turn to gain a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and maintained the advantage under firm encouragement. GO AWAY,
reserved off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily drew into contention on the far turn, shifted out to split foes just off the inside
to challenge inside the winner but couldn't gain terms with that rival while prevailing for the place honors. MOMMA'S BABY BOY, caught four wide racing to
the first turn, tracked just off the second flight three deep through the backstretch, was prompted to advance in that path entering the far turn, was fanned
four wide nearing upper stretch but continued with interest while just outkicked by the top pair. PROFESSIONAL broke inwards bumping CLEAR THE MINE,
was quickly righted, then angled inside to track just off the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn to bid three deep between foes
but lacked the needed final kick. CLEAR THE MINE, bumped at the start, was reserved between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, swung out five
wide racing into the lane while being urged to advance but made no impact. JERRYS PRIDENJOY, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the first
flight, gave way racing into the far turn. MR. BENZ settled outside foes in the last flight and never gained contention. ALL UNDER CONTROL, urged to the
lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn and gave way.

STREAK OF LUCK broke readily to gain the advantage while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then maintained the
advantage through the lane under firm encouragement. WINNING ENVELOPE settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, split rivals
three deep racing past midstretch and narrowly prevailed for second while moving to close the gap. AIFE angled inside early tracking just off the second
flight, shifted out three deep on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide entering the lane and continued with interest while just
outkicked by the top pair. BEACH FLOWER switched outside foes early tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, conceded some position racing into
the far turn, was fanned six wide into the lane and made some mild progress late. FIRSTMATE tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight to the
backstretch, was urged to advance along the inside racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. AUNT HATTIE (IRE), reserved inside foes in the
last flight, saved ground through the far turn, was prompted to advance in close quarters nearest the rail in late stages but lacked the needed final kick.
FOOL'S PARADISE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting rivals while angling out five wide
racing into upper stretch but had no rally. BEACH GETAWAY, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter, prompted the leader to the far turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
WELLABLED broke sharply, was urged to the lead while angling inwards racing into the turn, dictated the pace to upper stretch and maintained the
advantage under firm handling to set a new course record. CHIEF CICATRIZ, forwardly placed three wide in the opening stages, continued with a steady
bid in that path racing into the lane but proved only second best. LEAGUE OF SHADOWS tracked the pacesetter along the rail into the turn and continued
willingly the inside top pair while just outkicked. SUPERIOR'S BOY tracked off the second flight in early stages, angled four wide racing into the lane but
made no impact. LAWTON tracked the pace between foes in second flight and faded into upper stretch. FIREMAN OSCAR settled last while angling inside
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ALITTLE BIT TECHIE ducked out at the start, tracked the leaders outside foes just off the second flight, advanced five wide through the turn to upper stretch
and narrowly prevailed in time under brisk handling. BISCOTTINI tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, then found some late momentum
to split foes three deep in late stages to just miss. POLARCENTS, urged between foes in second flight, steadily gained between foes to gain the advantage
midstretch but was just collared at the wire. OKIE LOGIC, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command inside foes into
upper stretch but yielded late. POKEGAMA broke sharply, prompted the pace three wide to the lane and gave way late. ESTHER tracked off the second
flight inside foes but never gained contention. ANGIEMEANSBUSINESS raced three wide between foes and offered no rally. MARLEY BE GOOD proved
no factor. MISS AGGIE BLING urged four wide pursuing the leaders into the turn, gave way nearing the lane.
