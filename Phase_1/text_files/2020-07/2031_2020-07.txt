Footnotes
UP AGAINST IT saved ground stalking the pace, angled outside leaving the far turn, gained the lead outside TAUBER in mid stretch and drove clear. TOE
CURLIN' KISS lacked speed, saved ground around the far turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and flattened out. TAUBER , right to the front, set the
pace near the rail, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and gave way the final furlong. SLEEPLESSDREAMMORE circled the far turn three wide and failed to
sustain his move. REAL FACTOR hit the outside of his starting gate stall when bearing out at the break causing his rider to briefly lose his right stirrup.
REAL FACTOR then rushed up three wide entering the first turn, chased the pace for six furlongs then tired. SAMUI SUNSET , no factor, lost ground on
both turns. MISTER FRANK'S WAY retreated along the rail through the stretch.

Footnotes
BAMBINO settled three deep early, took closer order under urging past the half mile marker, moved to the front near the three sixteenths and pulled away
under a drive. ELUSIVE MOTION had speed outside rivals then was rated back to stalk, bid three wide to command around the turn, briefly moved clear into
the stretch, drifted in while overtaken past the quarter pole, faded through the final furlong but managed to save the place. NIC NIC BOOM , in hand while
saving ground off the early pace, eased out and moved up a bit while between horses mid turn, dropped back in for the drive and continued with effort.
NICKY BEAR showed speed between rivals leaving the chute, dropped to the rail entering the far turn, bid under a drive mid turn, came back out for the
stretch run but lacked a solid finish. OVERPOWER , four wide early, was fanned six wide into the stretch but lacked a solid response. CATTY LAD ,
between foes early on, angled five wide making a mild run nearing the stretch then faded. SPANISH SKIES , off the pace, raced four wide in upper stretch
but failed to menace. CECIL THE LION gave early chase while saving ground and weakened. ALEPH took command leaving the chute, set the pace two
wide, took pressure leaving the far turn, battled between runners mid turn then succumbed with a quarter to go.

Footnotes
NOTTOWAY , keen to go two wide outside JOVIS, moved clear of that rival nearing the half mile pole, dictated around the turn, responded to some left
handed asking near mid stretch then held firm while under a solid hand ride the final sixteenth. CERULEAN SPRINGS settled off the pace, came under
pressure while saving ground into the lane, leveled off to his best stride leaving mid stretch and was clear for the place. DIVINE INTERVENTIO , in the clear
early on while stalking the leaders, edged up saving ground into the far turn, shifted out four wide for the drive but lacked a solid kick. JOVIS prompted the
winner while saving ground, angled out after that one cleared, chased three wide into the stretch and faded. BALLIVOR broke slowly, angled in early, came
back out approaching the turn, circled five wide into the lane but came up empty. WHIRLIN CURLIN , three wide into the turn, failed to respond.

Footnotes
SPLASHERSTOWN set the pace along the rail, was pressed around the turn then pulled away under urging in the drive. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , jostled
between NOW OR EVER and SWEEP THE BOARD soon after the start, circled the turn four wide and offered a mild rally. SUZZETTE STAR stalked the
pace three wide around the turn and lacked the necessary rally. LOOKIN FOR CANDY prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened late. MABEL'S
FABLE , wide around the turn, failed to menace. ENYO saved ground on the turn and weakened. CARROT CAKE trailed to the stretch, was well wide
turning for home, drifted in near the eighth pole and passed tired foes. NOW OR EVER bumped with DIXIE'S FASCINATOR soon after the break and was
outrun. BANKIN ON AN ANGEL was no factor. SWEEP THE BOARD bumped with DIXIE'S FASCINATOR soon after the break and retreated through the
stretch.

STRIVE FOR A CURE came away well and was patiently handled inside while in range, eased out leaving the far turn, quick bid in hand to take command
mid turn, spurted clear approaching the lane, opened up after being put to a stout right handed drive in upper stretch then maintained a comfortable margin
while steadily hand ridden to the wire. IRISHTOWN dropped off the pace while saving ground, gained momentum two wide into the lane, swung out and
finished well to gain. WICKED SON had speed and stalked three wide, came under pressure mid turn but lacked the needed stretch kick. TO THE FRONT ,
taken to rate off the pace, circled six wide into the lane but failed to generate a legitimate run. BAYANO settled in the clear, raced five wide past the quarter
pole and failed to respond. NATION U S A was outrun. PAID HOLIDAY rushed up between rivals and went clear after a sixteenth, set the pace towards the
rail, was overtaken mid turn and tired approaching the furlong grounds. ALLTHEWRONGREASONS , well back, was eased through the lane then walked
off.

Footnotes
CAROLINA ICE , patiently rated outside horses around the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch, closed steadily, led late and drove clear. ONE FAT
KAT bore out leaving the starting gate, sped to a three wide lead leaving the backstretch, remained well off the rail and weakened late. GRAND SKYLARK
stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide and flattened out. MISSIMARD , bumped by ONE FAT KAT soon after the break, raced three wide on the turn
and rallied mildly. ROMAN CITY was outrun. LITTLE SKIFF , two wide on the turn, chased the pace and faltered. CAN THE QUEEN showed speed along
the inner rail, steadied entering the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
ARTHUR'S HOPE cleared after a furlong, set the pace towards the rail, was under strong handling through the final furlong, remained on his left lead and
prevailed. LAKI , away alertly, rated forwardly while saving ground, briefly steadied mid turn,angled out for room near the quarter pole, straightened away
and ranged up to have aim in mid stretch, kept on grinding but wasn't good enough. THREES OVER DEUCES broke inward and bumped with a rival,
corrected and settled off the pace while about two wide, moved up between runners near mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on. CLUBMAN broke a bit
slowly, saved ground off the pace, moved up towards the rail in mid stretch then flattened out late. CORDMAKER was sent up between rivals heading
towards the half mile marker, stalked three to four wide, was under pressure into the lane and faded. NO DOZING , bumped at the break, dropped off the
pace into the turn while about four wide, swung very wide in upper stretch but failed to make an impact. ONEMOREGREATTIME rated five wide outside
rivals, remained wide past the three eighths, came under some pressure nearing the lane and faded. FACTOR IT IN , bumped at the start, stalked three
wide between runners early, failed to go on past the five sixteenths and weakened.
