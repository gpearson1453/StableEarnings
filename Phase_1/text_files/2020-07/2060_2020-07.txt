Footnotes
HE'S MUNNIE showed the best early speed and was able to get to the inside but was just off the rail until the run up the backstretch was able to hold off all
challengers to win in a game effort. BUBBAS DIXIE made a run at the leader in the two path through the stretch but could not go by that one while clearly
second best. BOB'S ALL IN raced four wide on the second turn to get into contention but could not make up the needed ground. HESABULLY showed good
early speed in the two path but tired turning for home. SQUIDWARD raced in the two path for much of the mile and had no rally. ET TU BRUTAE was up
close along the inside while getting into tight quarters going into the backstretch dropped back after that and was never a factor. TEDDY TIME trailed for
much of the mil and caught a tired foe late while never a serious factor. DREAM BABY DREAM raced three wide for much of the mile and tired in the
stretch.

BULL was along the inside but angled out behind the eventual winner at the top of the stretch was inching closer in the final yards but had to settle for
second. COLOR ME BEHOLD made a bid four wide on the turn to get into contention but could not sustain the rally and held third. LUCKY KID raced along

the inside. TRE raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. RACQUETMAN was up close in the two path and faded in the stretch. FULL OF GOLD
