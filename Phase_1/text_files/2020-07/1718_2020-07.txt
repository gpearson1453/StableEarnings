Footnotes
HOWARD OF LUCK away alertly pressed a narrow lead through the turn dueling abreast rival down the lane clearing late in the two path. PERFECTLY
PLAIN pressed on the inside dueling to upper stretch battling from the rail there ceding late. SWEEPINGTHENATION went evenly off the pace losing
ground to upper stretch giving a mild rally six wide there. LET ME ASK BOB raced mid pack traveling evenly through the lane in the seven path. KEY TO
THE NILE off slowly lagged through the turn, passed tired ones down the lane. WILD ROAD gave hard pursuit through the turn wearing out the final eighth.
GRAN TOGOSHI was never involved. SIXTY FORTY was always outrun. TOMS CHUCHU chased through the turn then wilted in upper stretch. LETS
DANCE JACK pressured the pace through the turn giving way in upper stretch.
