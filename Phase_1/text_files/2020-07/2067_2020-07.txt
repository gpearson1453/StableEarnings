Footnotes
HARD WHISKEY was sent to soon gain a clear lead, shook free of JAXONS POINT'S challenge leaving the bend, was challenged again from both sides
midstretch, all out and held on. EUGENE waited for room behind rivals on the backstrech, moved to the outside on the turn, came five wide into the lane,
angled in upper stretch, moved beside HARD WHISKEY inside the last furlong, fought gamely but did not have enough left. STOSH prominent between
horses, moved to the rail on the turn, vied for the lead in the stretch but also failed to have the needed late kick. SQUIRRELY MIKE in contention along the
rail, waited for room on the bend, got through three wide at the head of the lane, began to yield inside the last eighth, lost his path to EUGENE, altered out
with a sixteenth left and bore out nearing the wire. DROOP'S M D B was prominent toward the outside on the backstretch but faded in tight quarters three
wide leaving the turn. JAXONS POINT advanced from outside to threaten on the turn but gave way between rivals the last two furlongs. STRATUS STORM
raced in the second flight between horses on the backstretch but gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
MARCO'S DREAM shared the early lead from outside, angled in some entering the end, moved clear, was under steady handling in the lane and held on.
KAPCORI ROAD without early speed, progressed along the rail on the turn, angled out some for a clear path into the stretch, moved back to the rail with a
furlong left, was all out, came up short but proved clearly second best. BIG BAD DOC well back early, stayed just off the inside taking the bend, floated out
some entering the lane and passed between rivals deep stretch. W W CRUSADER in midpack early, gradually progressed just off the inside on the turn,
fanned four wide for the stretch run and flattened out in the late going. IWANT SGT RECKLESS chased from outside, came into the lane from path four then
passed between tired ones. MONFORD chased while toward the outside and faded three wide on the bend. GEM CITY JEWEL failed to menace racing
widest. EL PRINCIPE I B displayed early speed between rivals, was squeezed back into the bend, altered out some, drifted out into the stretch and
continued to fade. CHEYENNE VIHO disputed the pace from inside, did not stay with MARCO'S DREAM on the turn and gave way along the rail through
the stretch.

ARCH FLYER prominent from the beginning, moved outside RED JERSEY midway on the backstretch, went for the lead on the bend, moved clear inside
the last furlong, weaved out then back in deep stretch but held on. MISS LEARJET in midpack early from outside, began to close the gap three wide on the
turn, rallied belatedly between horses the last eighth but was easily second best. RED JERSEY vied for the early lead from outside, was just off the rail on
the bend, floated out some into the stretch and gradually lugged in as she wore down inside the final furlong. FOO FOO GIRL raced in contention just off the
inside but flattened out the final furlong. LITTLE MOLITTA trailed from inside, progressed on the turn, angled out four wide for a clear path upper stretch,
progressed to the last eighth then leveled off. DANCING WELL chased from between horses, was two then three wide taking the turn then improved
position between rivals in the stretch without threatening. POSITIONEDTODANCE was squeezed back at the break and failed to menace in a wide trip.
JUST CHARLIE chased in midpack, angled out on the bend then failed to have a stretch bid. ON THE MONEY displayed early speed from inside but began
to tire before finishing a half mile. MUCH TO DO steadily faded from between rivals.

Footnotes
KALISPELL was bumped and forced into ALMAFUERTE at the start, vied for the early lead from just off the inside, had the rail on the bend, floated out to
path three for the stretch run then edged ahead under a drive the final sixteenth. LIL BIT TIPSEY disputed the pace outside KALISPELL from the early
going, fought gamely in the lane but did not have enough left late. WELL MAID was kept close from outside, advanced just off the rail on the bend, swung
outside LIL BIT TIPSEY for the stretch run and found best stride too late. ALMAFUERTE bumped at the break, was well placed from inside, did not keep up
on the turn and also rallied belatedly the last furlong. JUKEBOX MONEY in contention on the backstretch, faded after three furlongs.

BEEMIE AWARD shared the early lead between horses, moved ahead two wide on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch, drew clear, gradually
drifted out the final furlong but held on. JUST RUN broke a step slow and outward, advanced from inside on the turn, angled out six wide for a clear path at
the top of the lane, closed well, was too late but caught W W CANDY for second. W W CANDY pressed while toward the outside, was four then five wide
taking the bend, edged ahead for second deep stretch but was outfinished. STALLONE prominent between rivals, was four wide into the stretch then
gradually yielded. DEANO disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, came again upper stretch but flattened out the last
eighth. OMAR ATTACK chased from off the rail and was not a factor. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP pressed the pace from outside on the backstretch but gave way
before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
PRECIOUS KOWGIRL soon progressed to share the early lead from outside, moved ahead two wide leaving the bend, was under a steady drive the last
furlong and held sway. SEE GRACE FLY BY forwardly placed from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, took over second inside the final eighth,
lacked the extra needed but was clearly second best. RUBY LEES SONG reluctant to load, broke alertly once the race began, disputed the pace from inside
but flattened out for the drive. NO TANKS was well back early, picked up her pace from outside on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved
position without threatening. CAROL'S A CASE well placed inside on the backstretch, retreated after three furlongs, angled out with a quarter mile left and
only improved position between horses deep stretch. DANCING HIGH trailed, saved ground taking the turn, advanced upper stretch then leveled off. ICE
ATTACK was a contender toward the outside on the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail on the bend, angled out four wide upper stretch and had little
to offer. LUCKY STIFF displayed brief speed outside RUBY LEES SONG, gave way before finishing three furlongs, was eased the last eighth and walked
off.
