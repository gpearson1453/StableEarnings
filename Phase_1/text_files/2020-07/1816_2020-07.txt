allowed to settled while inside, made a bid in the stretch but was no menace in the end. MISS ORATORY was settled then rallied three wide on the
backstretch making a bid then flattened out in the drive. SUMMER COMMOTION was unhurried early then made a mild rally and was no threat. BIG FUN
was unhurried early then made a mild rally on the far turn and was no threat. KICKEROO chased the early pace while inside, was used up then gave way.
