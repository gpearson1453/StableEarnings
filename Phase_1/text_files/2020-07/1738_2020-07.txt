Footnotes
ABACO DREAM was unhurried inside early, came out into the three path entering the turn while rallying, took over just before five furlongs then drew out
under mild urging through the final sixteenth. LIGHT MY PATH was content to lag following a slow break, swung out leaving the turn and finished with good
energy. PRINCESS BRIE was unhurried early then made a belated run along the inside. BALHARBOUR MISS ducked out sharply early on the backstretch,
bumped MISTRESS AT SEA twice, stayed close to the inside while chasing the early leader, gave her best between rivals into the final furlong then
flattened out. DISCREET TATTOO was fractious in the gate, raced the three path and lacked a closing response. MISTRESS AT SEA was soundly bumped
twice early on the backstretch, moved clear before a quarter, stayed just out from the inside while showing the way for less then five furlongs then stopped.
ANNA MAY OUR QUEEN stopped and was eased up through the stretch.

HAYNESFIELD BEST was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail around the turn and drifted badly through late stretch. MR.
SKITTLES broke slowly, was roused early, angled out through the lane and finished with good energy. IREDELL angled to the inside while chasing on the
backstretch then weakened in the lane. CUMBERLAND GAP stayed inside in an even effort. GAMBLIN wasn't far back in the three path for about a half
then stopped. GORGEOUS CHARLI stopped two wide.
