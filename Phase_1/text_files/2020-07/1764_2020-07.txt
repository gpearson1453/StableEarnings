Footnotes
EDGEMONT ROAD dueled for the lead outside of MY MAN FLINSTONE, drew clear from that foe into the turn, and widened his margin through the lane
while being ridden out to the wire. MY MAN FLINTSTONE dueled for the lead inside of EDGEMONT ROAD, but proved no match for that foe into the turn,
and proved second best while well clear of show. TONKA FLOWER took the turn in the three to four path while off of the pace, then improved past a tired
rival for a minor reward without threatening the leaders. CRYPTO saved ground from midpack, but failed to produce a bid and weakened. BIZZEE
CHANNEL was reluctant to load, then trailed the field in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. LOVER BOY stalked the leading duelers in the
three path, but weakened turning for home. DAYLIGHT raced far off of the pace along the inside and never got involved.

Footnotes
STAND TALL pressed the pace setter from the two path, failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, but kept on through the late stages as that foe
tired, rebid between horses inside the sixteenth pole, and got up at the wire. FORTUNA set a tepid pace along the inside while well in hand, drew clear from
her pressing rival in upper stretch, but tired inside the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire. SURSUM CORDA trailed the field around both turns, swung
to the five path turning for home, commenced a rally outside of rivals with a good kick, but her charge was belated. U S S LEXINGTON settled off of the
pace two wide around the first turn, shifted from the three to the four path at the five sixteenths pole to attempt a bid outside of the leaders, but lacked a kick,
then failed to menace between horses through the lane. TAKE CHARGE PATTI saved ground while rating off of the pace, shifted to the three path at the
five sixteenths pole, came into the lane between horses, but lacked a strong kick while splitting them, and got outfinished by outer rivals. MORE GOOD
TIMES was forwardly placed three wide, held striking position outside of the leaders around the far turn, but failed to produce a bid and weakened between
horses at the furlong pole. FASHION MO stalked the pace setter from along the inside, saved ground around both turns, but failed to produce a bid before
weakening passing the three sixteents pole.

Footnotes
ALFIE SOLOMONS dueled for the lead outside of HIDDEN RULER, drew clear from that foe approaching the quarter pole, opened up on the field in upper
stretch, swapped leads after drifting out from encouragement inside the furlong pole, and held safely under driving pressure. BREAKING NEWS tracked
from midpack outside of foes, came under a drive into the turn before taking the bend in the four path, sustained a rally through the lane outside of WILD
POPIT, and just nosed out that rival for place. WILD POPIT reacted awkwardly when brushed by a foe at the start, was urged along while far off of the pace
and along the inside down the backstretch, sustained a rally and split foes three wide through tight quarters at the furlong pole, forged place inside the
sixteenth pole, but was nailed on the wire by an outer foe for that position. HIDDEN RULER dueled for the lead inside of ALFIE SOLOMONS, but failed to
keep pace with that foe turning for home, held place to the furlong pole, but weakened at the sixteenth pole. HEROS REWARD stalked the leading duelers
from the three path, inched closer turning for home to produce a place bid in upper stretch while the leader kicked away, but shied from an inner drifting foe
while between horses at the furlong pole, altered course to the inside, but failed to menace thereafter. LUNA'S IN CHARGE shifted off of the inside to the
three path while midpack around the turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. SOLOMONIC was always outrun. GOZILLA broke inwards,
recovered and rushed inside of rivals to chase the dueling leaders from the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and subsequently stopped
through the lane.

Footnotes
YOGURT saved ground while midpack around the turn, waited for racing room turning for home before tipping to the three path in upper stretch, then
sustained a left lead rally through the final furlong to get up approaching the wire. ONE FAST ORB vied three wide early on before forging a lead at the
seven sixteenths pole, shifted down to the two path into the turn, drew clear from her prompting foes in upper stretch, built a loose lead approaching the
furlong pole, but was worn down approaching the wire. GUANA CAY vied for the lead between horses early on, but took back to stalk rivals into the turn,
tracked from the three path around the bend before turning for home in the four path, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole,
then kept on through the late stages to secure show. LOLLYGAG saved ground far off of the pace before swinging to the five path turning for home, offered
a mild kick in upper stretch, then sustained that rally through the late stages to pass tired horses for a mild reward. SILVER MAPLE settled off of the pace in
the two path, shifted to the three path turning for home while behind the leading group, and produced a mild rally between horses through the lane, but failed
to threaten. SOME NIGHTS was reluctant to load, then was forwardly placed five wide before inching forward to make a three wide bid for the lead into the
turn, vied around the bend, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, then weakened late. LUCKY SHORE was off a step slowly, took the turn
far off of the pace in the three path before swinging to the six path turning for home, then passed tired rivals. GOLDEN VOICE tracked from midpack in the
two path, shifted to the three to four path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to make a bid and weakened at the sixteenth pole. MISS MAGDALENA showed
early speed, vied along the inside early on, but took back to stalk the pace from the inside into the turn, but weakened at the furlong pole. GIGI'S GIFT was
off slowly, trailed around the turn and was no factor. LOLAS CREED was forwardly placed in the four path, but weakened into the turn, and stopped through
the lane.

Footnotes
TITLE READY saved ground around the first turn while rating off of the pace, shifted to the three path into the far turn, commenced a rally in the four path
passing the five sixteenths pole to produce a bid for the lead in upper stretch outside of ROYAL MESA, dueled through the lane with that inner game foe,
and just got up approaching the wire. ROYAL MESA pressed the pace two wide, inched forward around the far turn to bid for the lead turning for home,
forged an advantage and held it between horses in upper stretch, dueled gamely through the lane inside of TITLE READY, but was nailed approaching the
wire. SCARS ARE COOL was off a step slowly and trailed early on, raced far off of the pace in the two path around the far turn before tipping to the five path
in upper stretch, rallied on his left lead through midstretch, then changed leads in the late stages to secure show. BOURBON RESOLUTION stalked two
wide early on, but came under a drive into the far turn, came into the lane behind the leaders while still in range, but was outfinished by an outer foe for
show. GUEST SUITE saved ground while far off of the pace around the first turn, took the far turn in the two to three path, then stayed on, but failed to
menace. TREASURE TROVE set the pace early on, tugged to a clear lead into the backstretch, held his advantage around the far turn, but was headed
turning for home, and weakened. THIRSTFORLIFE stalked along the inside, but came under a drive into the far turn, got outmoved by outer rivals turning
for home, then weakened through the lane. TROUBLING MOON was far off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, but retreated down the
backstretch to trail into the far turn, and failed to menace thereafter.

nearing the eighth pole and drew away in the final stages under a steady drive. CANDY CORNELL stalked the pace early on, moved up into contention
along the turn, made a bid from between horses near the quarter pole, was in the three path into the lane but was no match for the winner in the stretch run
and held place in the final stages. RUBUS chased the pace early, moved up into contention along the turn, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole, was
in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. ALMITHMAAR trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up
in the stretch run. COMPLEXIFIER vied for the lead along the inside, stayed on the rail into the lane and leveled off in the stretch drive. TRAVELLING
