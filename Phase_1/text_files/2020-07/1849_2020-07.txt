Footnotes
BOURBON BLUES dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate up front through the turn, edged away in upper stretch and maintained that
advantage to the wire under steady handling. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE broke sharp, set or forced the pace in the two path, fell back off the winner in upper
stretch, but held stubbornly to the wire to prevail for the place. PRIORITIZING in the second group while racing outside, three wide into the stretch, staged a
mild rally to be gaining for the place. CUSTOM GULCH last to leave, continued well back for three furlongs, moved out to be widest for the drive, finished
willingly while too late out in the middle of the course. NOON'S BABYGIRL in the second flight while racing off the inside, came up empty when called on for
the drive. SLINGSHOTSLEW also in the second flight, saved some ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive and was also found lacking.
VENUS IN FURS went one paced along the inside. HALF DIALED chased the top two in the three path early and began to fade before three furlongs.
UNDENIABLY DEVINE remained back throughout in failing to make an impact. IN DISGUISE also never menaced. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
CHEERS TO BERTI broke with the field, brushed in some traffic, allowed the pace to go early, advanced into a challenging position while three wide late in
the turn, took over entering the stretch, quickly kicked clear and was not threatened the final furlong while being kept to task. MADELYN'S WILD MAX
brushed start, raced back, tilted out three wide turning into the stretch, finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. MINI
CHUNK void of early foot, saved some ground while still back in the turn, shifted out for the drive, displayed some late interest to be up time for the show,
not a threat to the top two. BAYOU BODE chased the early leader, began to weaken after a half. SPARKY SPARKLES sprinted well clear soon after the
start, showed the way through the turn along the inside, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. SUNSET SEVEN jostled at the start,
trailed for four furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. PAPA'S BIG BOY tired while racing four wide through the turn.
RISKY STEPS steadily faded.

Footnotes
CARBONATED bothered at the start to race back, continued to lack speed onto the backstretch, advanced four wide through the turn turn, challenged
exiting that bend, shook clear when straightened for home, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. HE'S AN HONEST MAN settled off the early
pace, moved closer toward the inside middle half, traffic, rank, altered course to be five wide into the lane, advanced and chased the winner past the furlong
marker, could not get to that one late, held the place. RESILIENT RICK last away, void of any early foot, improved inside of rivals turning for home,
continued close to the inside and managed some mild late gain on the top two. TIZONA forwardly placed through the first turn, advanced on the leader early
backstretch, dueled through the far turn, weakened in the drive. FREEDOM FACTOR also within striking distance early, moved to challenge onto the
backstretch three wide, dueled in the two path into and through the final turn and also weakened when the real running began at the head of the straight.
CROCODILE JACQUES pushed out, bothered at the start, chased the early leader, continued forwardly for a half and began to fade. HOT TEN broke out
but alertly to bother outer rivals, quickly sprinted clear, began a steady retreat before a half when headed. RICKY DALE finished early, fell far back, jogged
in.

Footnotes
RUBY SIOUX unhurried in the early going just off the inside, advanced after a half to be closest to the leader into the lane, engaged that foe and wore her
down to be clear under steady handling. MARYWOOD took control past the wire the first time, opened a large advantage up the backstretch, responded
when the winner came alongside entering the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms past the furlong marker then could not keep up, remained comfortably
clear for the place. VALENTINES DAY void of early foot, four wide through the first turn, remained outside, rallied four wide into the stretch, rallied to be
clear for the show. THAI CHILI SUE settled off the pace, improved slightly while not posing a serious threat. SUNDEREYA lacked speed, remained back
after six furlongs, improved positions out in the course with some modest late interest. MIA O MAYA forwardly placed early, fell back after a half to race in
mid pack, continued evenly in the drive. ROYAL ALEXANDRA void of speed, raced in some traffic into and through upper stretch, improved slightly when
clear late. LIZZ A BEE settled in mid pack for a half, tired. WHISPER SOFTLY chased the runner up for four furlongs and gave way.

Footnotes
ELLA'S LIL STAR broke on top, showed the way out of the chute and up the backstretch, turned back a rival turning for home, opened up and was not
threatened to the wire while being kept to task. ANY OLE THING broke back, lacked speed, improved while saving ground into the stretch, proved no match
for the winner, clearly seclnd best. JOLIE GEE raced in the second flight along the inside, finished up best of the rest. KHALEESI'S GIFT in the main body
while racing outside, came four out to five wide into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a serious late kick. PALMETTOVOWMENOT prompted the
winner up the backstretch off the inside, tried that rival from the outside late in the turn, gave way in the drive. COOL DEAL broke back and failed to
menace. LIL' SISTER LOU forwardly placed up the backstretch, began a steady retreat early in the turn. MY MALLORY'S ON off a step slow, was never
involved. ZARB'S WINNIE remained always back. LADY DATE gave way while four wide out of the turn.

POWER SONG away well, set the pace up the backstretch toward the inside, shook clear early in the turn, continued to show the way by daylight into the
stretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. FRONT DOOR never far back, came three wide when called on for some run exiting the turn, finished
willingly to be getting to the winner late, clearly second best. ALEX'S TURN within striking distance off the inside, two path into the lane, lacked a closing
kick to finish up best of the rest. EXTON void of speed, five wide into the far turn, improved position continuing outside through the turn, failed to sustain that
advance through the stretch. LIP SERVICE well back off the early pace, came four wide into the stretch,improved then also saw that progress stall in the
final furlong. WABASH CANNONBALL fell back off the pace toward the inside, moved out to be three wide through the turn, also failed to muster a
meaningful closing kick. CAJUN DUDE four wide into the turn, went one paced throughout. HOOK mid pack early, fell back early turn, steered out for the
drive, not a threat. HALO REDDING last to leave, raced far back in trailing, angled out five wide late in the turn, passed some tiring rivals to improve
position. SLAMMIN' MIKE lacked speed, moved up a bit early in the turn then tired in the drive. RAZORBACK RED in mid pack off the inside, faded.
GUITARZAN pressured the winner early from the outside and stopped midway on the turn.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE BOY settled back off the pace while four wide into the first turn, began a steady advance just before a half, challenged three wide second turn,
drove well clear through the stretch while kept to pressue. JACK'S KISS broke on top, pressured the leader off the inside, challenged between rivals and
inside the winner in the final turn, proved no match for that one in the drive, clearly second best. WHISKEY FACTOR in a bit tight at the start, raced back off
the pace, went evenly throughout to finish up best of the rest. BIG HEADED BABY away well, narrowly showed the way early, got clear before a half,
showed the way into the far turn, gave way late in that bend when headed by the top two. AND YET ANOTHER settled behind the leaders, continued one
paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. CORVETTE SPIRIT last to leave, trailed early, improved position without posing a serious threat. LITTLE WISE
GUY in the second flight through the first turn, fell back before a half and never threatened. WHATAFIND brushed at the start, also failed to menace.
BETTIN ON BRYAN jostled at the start, trailed most of the way to be always outrun.

Footnotes
AMEERAH B with the pace up the backstretch, continued to vie three wide into the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home and drove
well clear. TEXAS PROMO GIRL outrun for three furlongs in the two path, moved out for the drive, finished willingly for the place. BEAUTIFUL BELLA
settled in the second flight, proved no match for the top two in the drive, finished clear of the others. MISS JAMIE with the pace closest to the inside,
continued to vie turn, weakened in the drive. KEEP AMERICA GREAT off a step slow, raced back, moved outside, four wide into the lane, mild amount of
late interest to improve slightly. RUN LAUGHING with the pace while inside the winner and between horses, faltered in the drive. G KATE in the second
flight off the inside, failed to muster a response in the drive. EXECUTIVE COUNCIL was finished early. GLEN GARRY ROSE reluctant to load, fell well back
after the start, trailed.
