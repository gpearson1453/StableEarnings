Footnotes
ROMBAUER off a bit slow, settled inside, angled three wide into the stretch, surged late from the outside and nailed foe in the closing moments. DYN O
MITE stalked outside the leader, bid outside around the far turn, gained command and dueled into the stretch, bumped by inside rival at the three-sixteenths
marker, cleared in the lane, drifted out late and caught by the winner. FLINT STROLL off a bit slow, tracked three wide, floated out by the runner-up in deep
stretch and finished well. CAISSON raced two to three wide into the first turn, tracked off the rail, swung four wide into the lane, lugged out past the eighth
pole and finished with a good late effort. INGEST sped to the front, angled to the inside, set the pace to the far turn, dueled with DYN O MITE around the
bend, drifted out and bumped that foe into the stretch, then weakened in the late stages. GONE ROGUE chased between rivals, two wide and outside a
rival on the final turn, roused in the drive but offered no response. BIG TALKER off a bit slow to begin, traveled off the inside, four wide into the lane and
failed to threaten. FALCONS FURY stalked inside to the stretch and never responded to urging.

Footnotes
DARK VADER stalked outside the leader, applied pressure at the five-sixteenths, collared rival around the bend, went three wide into the lane, took a short
lead upper stretch, battled with POTANTICO through the final furlong and held gamely. POTANTICO in range of the pacesetter from off the rail, raced four
wide into final turn, came in a bit then back out into the four path, bid three deep entering the lane, challenged through the drive but could not get by the
winner. KERSHAW stalked inside, asked at the three-sixteenths marker and finished well inside the top pair for a game third. UNBROKEN STAR unhurried
in the early going, traveled off the rail, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, went five wide into the drive, drifted in then back out mid-stretch and bested
the rest. BOLD ENDEAVOR went three wide into the first turn, tracked off the rail, raced wide into the far turn, came out into the stretch and passed tired
foes. LAMBEAU stumbled leaving the gate but recovered quickly, sped to the front, set the pace a bit off the rail, dueled two wide around the far turn and
into the stretch, then wilted in the late stages. PEPE TONO raced a bit off the rail then moved out further, traveled three wide then angled in on the last turn
and proved no menace.

Footnotes
SECRET KEEPER stalked the top pair then bid three deep near the seven-sixteenths, dueled outside into the stretch, took control and drew clear from
MERNEITH in the final sixteenth. MERNEITH dueled for command from the inside then vied with outside pair, dueled two wide into the lane, fought back
inside the winner but was outkicked in the final furlong. PROVOCATION chased outside a rival, three to four wide into the lane and bested the rest. TIME
FOR EBBY tracked off the pace, raced three wide then came in a bit before moving angling back out into the lane and further out in upper stretch, asked but
lacked the needed rally. HIGH ON GIN raced mid-pack and wide up the backstretch, continued wide to the lane and had little left. AUNT LUBIE trailed the
field from the inside, angled out leaving the turn, drifted back inward in upper stretch and never threatened. AFFIANCED dueled outside a rival then vied
between, lost ground nearing the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
PRETTY POINT unhurried early on and angled to the inside, kept inside to the last turn, came out and swung four wide into the stretch, rallied and
overhauled rivals under urging. SUTRO between rivals early then a bit off the rail, two wide into the far turn, angled out, bid between in the lane and got
outkicked by the winner. IMPERIAL CREED reserved a bit off the inside, raced outside a rival, three wide around the final turn, drifted out under left-handed
urging in the stretch and was gaining late. NEVER BE ENOUGH (GB) raced two wide, outside a rival on the backstretch, three wide then bid four deep into
the final turn, led into the stretch and edged for third late. QUINNIE well placed behind the top pair a bit off the rail, tucked inside on the clubhouse turn, bid
three deep and between rivals into the last bend, took a short lead but lost command into the lane and faltered in the final furlong. WOODFIN steadied into
the first turn, settled inside, awaited room nearing the quarter pole, angled out into the drive and lacked a rally. KOOKIE GAL chased inside, saved ground
to the stretch and flattened. UNICORN set the pace with company to the outside, dueled with that foe then vied inside into the final turn, fought back along
the rail then faded in the drive. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE attended the pace from the outside, moved up to challenge at the half-mile marker, dueled
outside rival then between into the far turn and tired in the late stages.

ZIMBA WARRIOR three deep early, advanced around the turn, angled five wide, brushed with inside rival at the top of the lane, drove to the front and
cleared late. DRIPPIN SAUCE stalked outside, bid alongside rival near the five-sixteenths, collared rival at the quarter pole, led upper stretch and yielded to
the winner. PROMISE NOTHING tracked off the rail, angled four wide around the turn, brushed with the winner at the top of the lane and kept on to earn the
show. HANDSOME CAT raced along the inside, put to right-handed urging early, went outside a rival on the turn, a bit off the rail into the lane, then finished
willingly along the inside. OCTOPUS dueled for command from the outside, put away inside rival then met the challenger from the outside on the turn,
fought back to the sixteenth pole then weakened late. HIDDEN PROMISE traveled near the back of the field, went three wide through the turn and flattened
in the drive. FINAL FINAL between rivals into the turn, three to four wide around the bend and was never a factor. ITSTHATTIME dueled from the inside,
lost contact midway around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
MAXIMUM SECURITY away quickly and led into the first turn, dueled with MIDCOURT briefly then dropped back to stalk that rival, angled out off the rail
and stalked up the backstretch, crept closer around the far turn, drifted out into the drive, collared the leader nearing the eighth pole, dueled through the lane
stages and gamely prevailed. MIDCOURT chased early then moved up to duel outside, moved clear, pressured to the outside before moving clear once
again, inched away on the backstretch, led two wide leaving the turn, battled with MAXIMUM SECURITY down to the wire and just missed. HIGHER
POWER chased inside, moved outside and pressed early on the backstretch, chased the winner to the far turn, saved ground into the lane and held the
show. AX MAN traveled two wide then off the rail, came five wide into the stretch and never produced a bid. COMBATANT hopped at the start, traveled
along the inside, two to three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
SASSYSERB in range just off the rail, angled three wide into the stretch, challenged four deep in the drive, drifted in then back out late and proved best.
NICE ICE raced inside saving ground, awaited room into stretch, found an opening and rallied along the fence and edged MAGNIFICENT Q T for the place.
MAGNIFICENT Q T stalked from the outside to the far turn, bid alongside the leader and dueled into the stretch, vied between runners in the lane, floated
inward near the sixteenth pole and lost the place. SMILING ROSE pulled early, raced between rivals, two wide into the stretch and finished well. KRISTI'S
TIGER traveled outside a rival, three deep into the far turn, four wide into the lane and summoned a mild late bid. PEACE PIPE sped to the front and angled
inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, responded when challenged from the outside, resisted through the lane, steadied briefly when rival came in a bit
near the sixteenth pole and weakened after. WARRIOR'S MOON traveled along the inside, angled out then back in on the backstretch, chased two wide,
came out near the eighth pole and improved position. OH PRETTY WOMAN settled mid-pack along the inside, saved ground into the lane and never
produced a bid. CHARMINGSLEW also mid-pack and raced three deep, outside a rival into the far turn, exited the bend three wide and weakened.
NOCHERYLIKEMYCHERY two wide into the first turn, moved inside, saved ground to the lane and never threatened.
