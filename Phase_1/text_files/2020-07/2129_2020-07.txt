NO BOUNDARIES stalked the early pace while racing along the inside, moved up three wide into the lane to challenge the leader, was forced very wide
through the stretch and got up late under strong handling. BEST YOU EVER SEEN showed good early speed while racing two wide, drifted very wide
through the stretch and finished gamely while racing near the eighth path. BOURBON TAN pressed the pace from the outside and weakened while racing
three deep. TORNADO BOY was off slowly, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. TUFF ATTACK stalked the early pace, raced towards
the inside around the far turn into the stretch and had no response. IHADADREAM was off slowly and never was a factor. DARK WOOD (IRE) raced far
back and never threatened.

MALIGATOR was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide at the quarter pole to make a strong move and was well in the stretch under steady handling.
STANDFORTHEANTHEM stalked the early pace along the inside, moved up five wide through the lane to improve his position but was no match for the
winner. AL TAWEEL was unhurried early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had not enough in the drive. ALPHA BOY settled off the early going, raced
towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. COLOMBARD pressed the pace and gave way while racing two wide.
CHARLES T failed to sustain a bid. VALID STORM set all the pace along the inside and faded. HIDE THE EVIDENCE was slow early and never threatened.

Footnotes
TEMPTATION EYES stalked the early pace, moved up three wide at the eighth pole and drove clear late. RISKY RISKY RISKY was allowed to settle early,
moved up four wide at the eighth pole and got up for the place position in the latter stages. HOOK HER UP settled off the early pace, raced three wide
through the lane while racing between rivals and showed good late interest. ME TOO MO set all the pace from the outside and gave way. TALK NICE
tracked the leader while racing along the inside and tired. MELISSANI raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. RANGOON ATTACK
was reluctant to load, raced towards the inside and never threatened.
