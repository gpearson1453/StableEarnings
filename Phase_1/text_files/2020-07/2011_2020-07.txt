Footnotes
BARB'S VALENTINE bumped at the start, dueled inside of rival on the backside, continued to duel entering the turn along the rail, started to drift out at the
three sixteenths pole and continued to entering the lane and floating out SHE BE FIRE N ICE into the six path in the stretch, gamely responded to urging
and narrowly holding on for the win. SHE BE FIRE N ICE dueled outside of rival on the backside, stayed in the prolonged duel entering the turn, floated out
by rival at the three sixteenths pole and into the stretch ending up in the six path, responded to urging and just losing a head bob for the win. FOR MY
BROTHER bumped at the start, stayed along the rail stalking the dueling leaders, stayed inside through the turn, entered stretch along the inside and mildly
rallied along the inside. IN IT FOR LIFE stalked dueling rivals outside of rival on the backside, stayed two wide throughout the turn, lacked needed response
in the stretch and made up little ground late. STEWARDS INQUIRY there was a steward inquiry in the race involving BARB'S VALENTINE and SHE B FIRE
N ICE, the stewards ruled that BARB'S VALENTINE interfered with SHE B FIRE N ICE by drifting out five lanes in the turn and floating out SHE B FIRE N
ICE, due to the close finish they had no choice but to disqualify BARB'S VALENTINE and place her second behind SHE B FIRE N ICE

Footnotes
EARLE GRAY chased leader two wide on the backside, entered turn two wide and angled in to the rail when leader drifted out, took command approaching
the eighth pole, responded strongly to urging and drew off from rivals. KING OF LEON (ARG) stalked leaders along the rail, stayed on the rail through the
turn and responded ok to urging rallying along the inside for second. PAPA SPLASH stalked pace setters outside of rival, stayed two wide into the turn,
attempted to go outside of rival but rival drifted out 4 paths forcing PAPA SPLASH to go five wide, entered stretch in the six path and responded willingly to
urging finishing well. MOUNTAIN VIEW hustled for speed out of the gates, took command along the rail on the backside, held the lead entering the turn,
started to drift out midway through the turn ending up five wide and in the five path in the stretch, lacked any response to urging finishing a tired fourth.
ULTIMATE SHILO settled at the back of the pack on the backside, entered turn two wide and into the stretch in the two path, lacked response when urged
and did not make an impact late.
