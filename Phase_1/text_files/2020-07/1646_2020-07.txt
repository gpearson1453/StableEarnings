rated in good position along the rail, swung out for room entering the stretch, vied outside the winner through the final sixteenth but wasn't enough. SMART
TWO A T bobbled while breaking sharply, opened a clear lead before going a quarter, stayed out from the inside while in control into the stretch, faded and
was eased up late. INDOMINUS REX wasn't far back outside into the far turn then tired.

PUCA PENNY advanced inside into the far turn, remained along the clear rail into the stretch, angled to the outside, vied into the final furlong, took over
before going a mile and prevailed. MOON CHANT was well rated on a clear lead in the two path into the stretch, responded when challenged and gave way
late. WITCH came out into the two path entering the stretch while chasing the early leader then weakened. PENITENCE wasn't far back early between
rivals, came out three wide with a run into the far turn then weakened in the drive. GOLDMAKESMESMILE lagged early, stayed inside around the final turn
and passed tired ones. NEARLY MISSED settled outside, came out four wide with a mild run into the far turn then flattened out. GOLDEN CHANCE pulled
up lame in early stretch and was vanned off.

QUEEN'S BIRD took command soon after the break, stayed out from the inside and drew away under brisk urging. GIO LUCKY raced the two path and
outfinished the others in an even effort. NONPLUSULTRA raced three wide between horses into the stretch and passed tired ones. SPIN LIGHTNING was
bumped soundly leaving the gate, raced two wide and failed to matter. THE LAST YANNUZZI passed tired ones while outrun. FOLES stayed inside and
was no factor. SPOT OF GOLD ducked out sharply while slow from the gate then was outrun. CURRENT ENERGY bobbled leaving the gate, came in,
bumped SPIN LIGHTNING, was sent to chase the winner and was used up after a half. SLY WILDCAT was eased up while far back.

COIN OPERATED began a rally along the rail into the turn, sharply angled out for room in midstretch and quickly ran clear through deep stretch. INSPIRED
GEM moved to a clear lead from the outside midway on the backstretch, stayed out from the inside while making the pace into deep stretch but was little
match. SHANGHAI MAGIC settled inside, came out between rivals while making a run into the stretch, was forced out late by the winner but couldn't match
that one. BUTTON CANDY was unhurried early, raced three wide around the turn, swung out for the drive and lacked a strong closing.
JOYOFTHIRTYSEVEN made the early pace along the inside then tired. INDEHERE stayed inside and lacked the needed significant closing. MY LION
EYES raced the three path in an even effort. SWITCHRATTLENROLL was wide and outrun. GLAD TO BE GIDGET was outrun after a slow break. LOVELY
O'PRADO broke in the air, raced wide and stopped.

Footnotes
BESS bumped with SUNNY HOLLY leaving the gate, gained position two wide, swung wide into the stretch, was clear before five furlongs then widened
under urging. SUNNY HOLLY bumped with the winner leaving the gate, raced inside that one early, made a two wide run into the stretch then flattened out.
GRACEYGAB stayed along the rail, moved a bit closer into the stretch then weakened. TWO FOR TEN raced the three path in an even effort. DOUBLE
CROSSED was outrun after a slow break. MERROW opened a clear lead soon after the break, angled sharply to the rail early on the backstretch and had
nothing left for the drive. KAY SYRAH SYRAH ducked into GOLDEN ACES early on the backstretch and failed to matter. GOLDEN ACES was bumped
soundly early on the backstretch then was outrun.
