Footnotes
VICTORY ELEMENT set the pace inside a pair of rivals around the turn, but drew clear from those foes passing the quarter pole, and widened under driving
pressure. TOWN DRUNK pressed the pace two wide and between horses, came under a drive into the turn, failed to keep pace with the leader in upper
stretch, but repelled his outer foe to proved second best. FEELING IT stalked three wide, inched closer at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with the
leader in upper stretch, then failed to keep pace with his other inner for place at the furlong pole. LUCKY LOOKIN trailed throughout and was never
involved.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP trailed the field to the far turn, circled the field with a five wide rally approaching the quarter pole, forged a lead turning for home, then was
kept to task to hold his margin through the lane. ORO DE TEJANO raced far off of the pace two wide through the first turn, advanced to midpack in the three
path into the far turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner while four wide at the quarter pole, then commenced a rally in upper stretch to reach place at
the wire. INCORRIGIBLE vied outside a pair of rivals to set a collapsing pace, put away both of his inner foes passing the quarter pole, but was immediately
engaged and headed by OLYMPIC ROMP turning for home, kept on gamely in midstretch, but gave way late and was nailed on the wire for place. HIGHER
AUTHORITY stalked the leading trio of duelers from the inside, but failed to leave the rail leaving the far turn and was blocked behind a tiring rival in upper
stretch, but got through along the inside approaching the furlong marker and finished willingly. TEMPLE BAR saved ground while off of the pace, waited for
racing room while others made wide bids around approaching the quarter pole, shifted to the four path turning for home while trailing, then failed to menace
while passing tired foes. LEA RIDGE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals causing a collapsing pace, then weakened passing the quarter pole. ARCH
ABILITY dueled for the lead two wide and between horses to set a collapsing pace, then weakened between horses passing the quarter pole.

SIRENIC set the pace while staying a few paths off of the rail, met JUST FLY's bid to his outside into the far turn, shifted out to float that rival wide turning
for home, then repelled that foe at the furlong pole under driving pressure. JUST FLY broke outwards, stalked the leader from the outside, inched forward to
make a bid at the three furlong pole, but was floated out turning for home, then was repelled at the furlong pole. SHILAH BABY stumbled badly at the start
costing her all chance, trailed her duo of rivals throughout, and was not persevered with late after failing to mount a rally.

Footnotes
NATIVE CHARM bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked two to three wide around the first turn, inched forward into the far turn to make a three wide
bid for the lead while in hand at the three furlong pole, forged a lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, met a challenge from LIGHT IN THE DARK
turning for home, repelled that foe in upper stretch, then was kept to task through deep stretch. LIGHT IN THE DARK stalked along the inside, shifted off of
the rail passing the five sixteenths pole to make a bid for the lead in the four path outside of NATIVE CHARM, but was repelled by that foe at the furlong
pole, and proved second best. CANDY BIZZNESS trailed through the first turn in the three path, advanced in the five path around the far turn, then
sustained a late kick through the lane, drifted in from right handed pressure at the sixteenth pole causing her to flop back to her left lead, but continued to
gain in the late stages. WISES LANDING saved ground while far off of the pace, shifted from the two to three path turning for home, then finished up mildly
between horses. NIVA broke sharp, allowed MY MISS AQUARIUS to clear off around the first turn, stalked that foe from the outside, inched forward and
made a bid for the lead between horses at the three furlong pole, but was no match for her outer foe at the quarter pole, then weakened through the lane.
MY MISS AQUARIUS bumped with an inner foe at the start, rushed three wide into the first turn to clear the field at the seven furlong pole, but was headed
by multiple foes approaching the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
LITTLE CODE chased the pace early, was in the seven path into the lane, drove past four wide down the lane and cleared in the final stages. BIG BLUE
MAGIC broke very awkward at the start and raced back early on, began a rally along the far turn, came into traffic nearing the lane, got through a wide open
whole once in the stretch, made a bid but hung in the final stages. HOLY COOKIE raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane, rallied in the
stretch with a late gain in the final stages. KATIE THE CUTIE dueled early on, was in the five path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. PEACE
LOVE BREAD tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane then bumped and bothered and flattened out in the stretch drive. MATT'S HONEY was
never a threat. KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked the pace early, was in the six path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the drive. QUEEN MAXINE
dueled early on, was off the rail into the lane and gave way down the lane. ESTRELA CADENTE was done early.
