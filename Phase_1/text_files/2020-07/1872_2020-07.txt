Footnotes
HEARTWOOD was bumped at the start, vied in the two path outside a rival, pulled to a clear lead mid turn, was headed by another foe entering the stretch,
but drew off to keep safe while under a drive. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT tracked to the turn, ranged up outside to challenge the winner at the quarter pole,
couldn't keep pace but chased hard under a drive, settling for place. ROYAL BLUE BOY was hustled away from the gate, dueled from the rail, dropped out
on the turn and re-rallied down the stretch while no threat to the top two in the end. YOU GO BOY broke in and bumped a foe, was bounced between
horses, chased inside, lacked room on the rail nearing the turn, and lacked a rally shortly after that.

Footnotes
FROSTED ICE broke inside and bumped a foe at the start, waited till the turn, made a middle move four wide on the turn to get closer, had the rider shake
the reins for more and drew away confidently in the final furlong. JAMMING CAMERON put under restraint early, pulled to the three path, dueled, led
nearing the stretch, was no match for the winner down the lane but held second under busy handling. MAJESTIC VALLEY was bumped at the start,
unhurried, moved up six wide on the turn and edged up to take the show. CALL WEST dueled between horses and flattened at the eighth pole with enough
left to hold fourth. CITY FRONT dueled inside to mid turn and faded gradually. DANCING WILLARD stalked, was put under whip urging on the turn and
faded.

DR. MARBOOZ was off slow, unhurried in last place, moved seven wide on the turn, came widest into the stretch and steadily gained to readily edge away
late for the win. MINE OWN STAR was running gapped off the pace, moved up six wide on the turn, led in upper stretch, continued on but was edged late
by the winner whille still running on. ROTTEN SCOUNDREL was involved in a three horse duel in the three path, led nearing the stretch, but flattened out at
the eighth pole while best of the rest. REAL MAN got closer on the turn, shifted out for room in the stretch, but evened out. MONKEY ZONE was up close
early, raced in the three path on the turn, and evened out. FATTERTHANME was bumped at the start, attended the pace in hand, vied for the lead from the
rail on the turn, but tired down the stretch. FINAL DELIVERY was bumped hard at the start, got close behind the duelers into the turn, but faded down the
stretch. TIZ DEJA BLUE broke sharply, was challenged inside and outside for the lead, and dropped out from between horses on the turn, tiring down the

win. NUTTIN' FASTER bore out at the start, raced wide in the second flight, was bumped entering the turn, came very wide into the stretch and steadily
gained for the place. CONJURING challenged the leader in the three path on the turn, lost the place spot late while best of the rest. SIR LEONIDAS was
unhurried off the rail. bore out and bumped a foe entering the turn, and improved position down the stretch while running even. MY PARDNER CAL chased
in the four path, contended to mid stretch and faltered. THIS MAN CAN contended off the rail, but gave way at the eighth pole. HENNY HEFNER bounced
between horses at the start, moved up the rail to the second flight, but faded on the turn.
