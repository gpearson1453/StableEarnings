turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. BARBSGRAY LION set the pace along the rail, drifted out in upper stretch and

Footnotes
TENDERNESS tracked four wide while well within herself, rolled up three deep to threaten mid turn, was roused clear soon into the lane and widened while
kept to task. AWESOME PAL prompted the pace while saving ground, was shuffled back a bit near the far turn, shifted out, worked between foes nearing
mid stretch and kept on willingly to be second best. RAN CHAR was sent up between rivals to take over after a furlong, dropped in setting the pace leaving
the far turn, took pressure past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. WHOA BLACK BETTY , sluggish from the gate, recovered and
edged up behind rivals nearing the turn, angled out, made a mild four wide run approaching the stretch, chased to mid stretch then faded. HOPE TAKES
OVER , away in good order, bid between rivals mid turn, pressed into the stretch then weakened. BECKINSALE , between rivals mid turn, gave way.

pole and drew off. LOVE YOU MUCH bobbled then bumped with DONTMESAWITHME leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace two wide around the turn,
angled out in upper stretch and rallied. TRICKS TO DOO , rated back leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn and offered a late move inside
horses. OLDIES BUT GOODIES showed speed outside the winner, was herded out by that one in mid stretch and gave way. CLEVER TRIAD , steadied
behind horses along the rail leaving the backstretch, swung wide in upper stretch and had a mild gain. STROLL SMOKIN circled the turn three wide and
gave way. JAMMER was outrun. DONTMESAWITHME bumped with LOVE YOU MUCH leaving the starting gate then trailed. An objection by the rider of

Footnotes
KEEPER IN SPITE vied outside SOPHIE RULES before pulling her way clear approaching the three eighths pole, was nursed on the front end while two to
three wide into the lane, opened up when put to some rousing in upper stretch, had her rider drop his whip inside the furlong grounds and clearly proved
best. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY , jostled at the break, regrouped and edged up three wide between rivals, stalked the leaders into the turn, lugged in while
giving closet pursuit past the three sixteenths, faded but managed to save the place. FOALSFILLYSPECIAL drifted in at the break, lost ground four wide
much of the way but churned on willingly to the wire. SOPHIE RULES vied inside the winner through the opening quarter mile, saw that one get away
shortly thereafter, angled three wide nearing the stretch, made a mild run past mid stretch then flattened out. MEET MICHELLE came out at the break
bumping THUNDERINTHEVALLEY, eased back between foes, saved ground around the turn and through the lane but failed to generate a solid kick.
STYLISH NINETYNINE , bumped and steadied at the break, dropped well off the early pace while three wide and failed to make a run. FREE FALLING
lacked speed while saving ground and never made an impact. PADRINA was used up inside chasing the early pace.

LAWN BOY (GB) , three wide leaving the turn, remained in the three path through the stretch, split horses late and got up. NAUTICAL NATURE saved
ground setting a pressured pace and finished willingly. DRAGON MOON circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path turning for home, had aim on the
lead in mid stretch and hung. RED CLAY ROAD lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch, angled in near the sixteenth pole and rallied mildly.
MR. EDGAR showed speed outside NAUTICAL NATURE and gave way in the drive. GEYSER , near the rail on the turn, swung out in upper stretch and
showed a mild gain. LIME HOUSE LOUIE was outrun. EL DULCE raced inside horses and weakened. ALPHASTEST , steadied in close quarters entering
the turn, raced along the inner rail, chased the pace, gave way and was eased late. OFFSHORE TRIP was outrun.

SI MAMACITA was nursed along on the lead outside CHEERS N APPLAUSE, moved clear under rating leaving the far turn, opened up under a drive in mid
stretch then prevailed while kept to task. GIRL NEXT DOOR bobbled at the break, recovered and advanced to a forward spot after a quarter mile, circled
four wide into the stretch, closed willingly and was getting to the winner. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ saved ground while in the clear, moved up nearing mid
stretch but failed to seriously sustain. CHEERS N APPLAUSE disputed the early pace to the inside of the winner, shifted out after that one cleared, pursued
three wide into the lane then weakened in the final furlong. PARCHED GHOST , three wide between rivals past the five eighths, dropped back mid turn and
came up empty. CONGRESS HALL , off the pace, saved ground under a ride mid turn but lacked a rally. PRISS lagged back and never got involved.
LAUREL LADY broke outward, gave some early chase four wide then faltered.

Footnotes
HAMMERS VISION vied inside rivals leaving the far turn, shook clear into the lane, wandered outward despite efforts with the right stick but held firm.
TAMBORA disputed the pace three wide between foes past the three eighths, dropped back a bit heading towards the quarter pole, found more between
runners leaving mid stretch and earned the place. HIGH ROLLER stalked the early pace three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch and came back on
late. TICKER TAPE PARADE dropped back soon after the break, was taken wide in the opening furlong, moved up four wide outside rivals nearing the turn,
bid mid turn, forced the issue into the lane then faded late. UMMU UMMU UMMU edged up early, saved ground with aim into the lane but came up empty.
ODDS ON had his head turned slightly as the gates sprung, pulled his way forward inside runners, steadied when keen near the half mile pole, dropped
back around the turn then lacked a stretch response.

Footnotes
INSTINCTIVE drifted out four wide when going to command outside rivals into the first turn, corrected and set a rated pace while handling inside pressure
from LOST SCROLL, shook clear inside the three sixteenths marker, kept on under strong handling and dug in tenaciously to narrowly fend off
SHEZALEMONDROPKID. SHEZALEMONDROPKID , bumped at the break, edged up then steadied briefly nearing the three quarter pole, regrouped to
settle in mid pack, took closer order past the five sixteenths, angled out, advanced four to five wide while between rivals in mid stretch, drew alongside the
winner in the final yards but just missed. BETHABARA , four wide into the first turn, settled outside rivals, circled rivals five to six wide making good progress
into the stretch, ranged up to loom a major threat inside the furlong grounds but wasn't quite good enough. DANCING CONTESSA broke a step slow, was
hustled up to contention and stalked the leaders past the half mile marker, bid three wide approaching the stretch but failed to seriously sustain in the final
furlong. TROIS PONTS lagged off the pace while saving some ground, angled off the inside nearing the quarter pole, shifted out very wide in the final
furlong and got rolling too late. VALLE LUNA came out at the break and bumped with the runner-up, straightened and moved into a stalking spot after a
quarter mile, tracked the battling leaders two wide but failed to solidly kick on through the drive. SEA CANDY rated off the pace while saving ground, angled
out leaving the far turn but lacked a rally. CHASING HELICITY was rated back soon after the break, raced wide past the five eighths and failed to menace.
LOST SCROLL , with the early pace between runners, dropped in and sparred to the inside of the winner from the five eighths to upper stretch, failed to
keep pace past the three sixteenths and gave way. DAWLISH vied inside a pair of rivals into the first turn, steadied out of a tight spot past the three quarter
pole, regrouped to stalk then gave way around the final turn.
