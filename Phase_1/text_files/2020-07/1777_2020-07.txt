FINE ONE WON stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to stalk the pace three wide in the clear, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, set the pace
in the two path around most the far turn, was headed by SLIME QUEEN near the quarter pole, battled on inside, dueled through the lane and regained
command in the final sixteenth. SLIME QUEEN was brushed at the start, settled off the pace inside around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far
turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, battled outside of the winner through the stretch and hung late. HOLLY'S
LADY chased the pace inside, lacked a bid and bested the rest. BELONGS TO BABE was brushed at the start and failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. LIKE N' EAGLE set a clear pace in the two path and retreated around the far turn.

four wide between foes and finished willingly to be clearly second best. TREASURE SEEKER was bumped at the start, set the pace two wide between foes
and weakened a bit in the lane. PRIME COAT was reluctant to load, raced off the pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals.

backstretch, steadied midway around the turn and came up empty in the lane. LAZY MICHELLE hesitated at the start, raced well back outside early, lugged
in around the turn and again in the lane and lacked a bid. KENS LADY chased the pace five wide and faded. MY GIRL CHARLY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
DUNBAR ROAD stalked the pace inside, tipped out near the three-eighths pole, still waited for room behind three rivals, found a seam three wide near the
five-sixteenths marker, surged clear when roused turning for home and widened while ridden out through the final furlong. SARACOSA stalked the pace four
wide, bid outside of the winner near the quarter pole, turned for home on near even terms but was no match in the lane while finishing willingly to be a clear
second. BELLERA set a rated pace in the two path, was collared near the three-eighths pole, dropped back under urging, angled out in upper stretch,
angled back in near the sixteenth pole and re-rallied to gain the show inside of foes in the final strides. OVER THINKING saved ground off the pace, swung
out in upper stretch and was one-paced in the lane. WICKED AWESOME stalked the pace two wide between foes, checked near the three-eighths pole,
angled four wide soon after and lacked a rally. LUCKY MOVE pressed the pace in the three path, took a brief lead near the three-eighths pole but weakened
soon after.

ASPECT settled off the pace along the inside, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed outside and was up near the sixteenth pole and cleared
under confident handling. TAXABLE GOODS stalked the pace three wide, bid four deep midway around the turn, vied outside of ABIDING STAR to
midstretch, had the lead inside the eighth pole but could not resist the winner late. ABIDING STAR set the pace in the two path, dug in inside when
confronted nearing the lane, vied to midstretch then weakened. THE LAST ZIP stalked the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. TWO EMMYS pressed the
pace three wide, bid between foes near the three-eighths pole then faded in the lane. DO WITH PRIDE played no factor while racing four wide. BROTH was
outrun while racing three and four wide.

SKOL FACTOR set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. CYRIL'S BOY tracked the pace two wide, advanced between foes into the far
turn and moved into a clear second then mildly gained on the stablemate in the lane. BABY BOOMER bobbled at the break, stalked the pace three wide,
lacked a rally and held clear for third. BOJINGLE went evenly while racing two wide. GET SET failed to menace while racing three wide. GUITAR TRIBUTE
played no factor while racing five wide. LUCY'S JOURNEY was bumped after the start, clipped heels early and was never involved. ONWARD bobbled at
the break, had speed three wide and faded around the turn. HAPPINESS came out and bumped a foe after the start then had only brief speed inside.
