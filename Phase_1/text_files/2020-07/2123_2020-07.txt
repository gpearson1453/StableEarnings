Footnotes
OUR BALDY B was quickly clear, raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane with an extended advantage, widened to the eighth pole and
was kept to the task. JUSTICE IN VEGAS was in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path and rallied for the place spot. D'ARK FLATTER
in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and finished evenly while losing the place spot late. RUH ROH RAGGY was
in the two path through the turn, stayed in the two path and benefited when others swung wide, moved closest to the winner with an eighth to travel and
could not sustain the effort while losing placings late. BRIGHTWORTHY chased the pace from the four path through the turn then faded. CHIEF RED BULL
was never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn. LITTLE MASON chased the pace into the turn while in the two path and was empty
turning into the lane. STEPHEN'S TALE was hard ridden early while after the winner then was done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
CANDY STORE was unhurried while in the three path, gained momentum in late turn, came into the lane from the four or five path, surged past the leader
outside the eighth pole, quickly cleared and widened to the wire. WITCH DOCTOR chased the two rival duel into the far turn, took first run at that pair, led in
to the lane, cleared nearing the three-sixteenths pole then was no match for the fast closing winner while keeping on to be second best. MARTIAL EAGLE
trailed for half while in the two path, continued near the inside into the lane then moved up for the distant show. FELIPE was well back while in the three
path through the turn and improved position while not a threat. AQUALITYINDIVIDUAL was never a factor while along the inside. ROAD GAME dueled for
the lead while setting a fast pace into the far turn then wilted after the three-eighths pole. CABOT TRAIL chased the pace from the three to two path through
the turn and was empty entering the lane. FIREHORN dueled with another setting a fast pace, continued in close proximity into the far turn then was
suddenly done, eased to the wire and walked off. THE HALF-MILE (1/2) TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED BEAST set the pace on a clear lead into the backstretch, was put under pressure approaching the far turn, continued under pressure through
the turn and into the lane, asked for more when straightening, re-cleared and continued to slowly inch away to the wire. PRINTER JAM pressed the winner
while two wide into the far turn, continued a serious factor into the lane, could not keep up with the winner. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL chased the
pacesetters through the turn while racing in the two or three path, moved up to duel for the place spot through the final eighth and lost the nod. SPOTLIGHT
JUSTICE was in the four path through the far turn and moved up while not a threat. TWISTED MIRACLE moved three wide into the far turn when gaining
momentum, continued well off the inside into the lane and tired. THE STORY BEGINS chased the pace along the inside and was empty entering the lane.
GLITTER CAT was in the four path through the turns and was empty into the lane. THE HALF-MILE (1/2) TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
UNCLE MOMO pressed the pacesetter while two wide through the turn, launched a long drive through the lane to edge to the front late then was all out to
the wire to last. WOLOWITZ chased the pace from the three path into the turn, appeared beaten with an eighth to go and floundering, continued under
strong right-handed urging inside the sixteenth pole and surged late to just miss. GOLDENPENCE set the pace into the lane while under pressure, dug in to
duel with the winner through the final eighth then gave ground grudgingly. G J BUSTER was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the
four path and finished evenly. GET ALONG chased the pace from the two path into the lane then weakened. DENVER SKY was outrun while in the two or
three path through the turn. BOO REID was never a factor while in the two path.

CUSTERS LAST STAND was jostled between rivals at the start, raced in the three or four path through the turn, angled into the ten path into the lane,
gained momentum once straightened and finished with good energy to be clear at the wire. OSCAR P Q was unhurried while in the three path through the
turn, came into the lane from the six path, angled sharply into the three path, was closing in when put in tight, bumped and was just up for the place spot.
ALL STAR JUSTICE was in the two path through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive, was moving to the lead when passed by the winner and just
lost the place spot at the wire. UNBRIDLED VICTOR was near the inside through the turn, angled into the nine path for the drive and was gaining from
outside of mid-track. G AS IN GEORGE chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the two or three path, had aim on the
winner when straightened then weakened. AMAZING TIZCAT was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and lacked a
closing response. HANDFUL OF HALOS saved ground through the turn and improved position. TALK FAST set the pace through the turn while under
pressure, cleared into the lane, opened his largest advantage with an eighth to go then faltered. COMPLEX JUSTICE was in the three path through the turn,
raced in mid-track through the lane and tired. BRAVO EXPRESS chased the pace along the inside into the lane then was empty. LITTLE JOHN COLONY
was outrun while near the rail. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY pressed the pace two wide through the turn then was suddenly done.
