Footnotes
STEELFORCE sat in striking position in the three path, moved up closer along the rail in to the final turn, shifted out into the lane, lugged in through the
stretch then won driving under steady handling. MARIA'S MAGIC showed the way into the backstretch, contended the pace inside of GUNN WITH THE
WIND in the far turn, responded mildly to challenge from STEELFORCE and was worn down late. IMPERIAL WOOD trailed the field early, gained closer
order leaving the backstretch, came under a ride angled towards the rail into the lane, loomed boldly mid stretch but was unable to get by and settled for
show. ARCTIC REIGN raced four to five wide into the opening turn, tracked outside then was asked to chased from the three eighths pole and had no
closing response through the stretch. GUNN WITH THE WIND raced wide in the opening turn, moved up to contest the pace at the five eighths marker, was
unable to move on with the rival in the far turn and tired. MISS EASTER last away, saved ground inside and lacked a bid. HE'S SMOAKIN raced four to five
wide in the opening stages and was done early.

Footnotes
THE LADY CHABLIS contended the early pace, drew away approaching the stretch and was kept to task under light handling. ASTARTOBE sat in range
between rivals, loomed boldly at the top of the lane, chased into the stretch while drifting out but was no match for winner. AMY JEAN angled quickly to rail
at the back of the pack, rallied belatedly to getting by late for show. PIPERS JOY tracked inside, lost ground into the turn, lodged a bid into the stretch and
was edged out late. MOONLIGHT CRUSH raced five wide in the opening stages, was asked to quicken in the final turn and lacked a closing response.
RUBORIS sent for outside speed, pressed the pace into the turn then was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and tired. SUPREME RUSH raced
wide early and was outrun.

TRADER LYNN lagged early, raced four wide through the backstretch, advanced in the final turn, swung out at the three sixteenth pole and won driving.
DEVILS COMMAND raced four to five entering the backstretch then settled in range, cut the corner into the lane then took over the lead at the head of the
stretch and was out kicked. ZBIG pressed the pace from the two path, gained advantage into the far turn, responded to challenge from ROLL THE STONE
at the quarter pole and weakened. ROLL THE STONE broke alertly to contest the pace, prompted four wide leaving the backstretch, moved up alongside
ZBIG to challenge the lead leaving the final turn and flattened out at the top of the stretch. NO COLLUSION lacked early speed and failed to menace.
TOMAHAWK EXPLORER set a pressured pace from between rivals, was unable to move on with rivals at the five sixteenth pole and faltered.

CAN'T TOUCH THIS quickly sped to the front, contended the pace inside, inherited the lead in the final turn and widened under a drive. SAPRAE CREEK
away slow but quickly gained closer order leaving the backstretch, saved ground inside then shifted out into the lane and closed well but was no match for
winner. DURA'S HALO sat outside in range, angled in entering the lane, rallied inside and held show. LADY RORSCHACH settled outside early, took closer
order from the two path and bid belatedly. FIT FOR ROYALTY contested the early pace, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and gave way.
MARYAM stalked inside and was done early.

through the stretch, was along for second honors. GEM OF INCEPTION stalked inside, shifted out into the stretch and rallied late for show. PIPER ROSE

OUT FRONT vied four wide, gained an advantage over TROOPER JENNY at the five sixteenth pole, dueled into the stretch then drew away under a mild
drive, wrapped up under a late closing CALCULATING. CALCULATING unhurried away, advanced along the rail leaving the final turn, closed determinedly
and missed. TROOPER JENNY vied inside just off the rail, responded to challenge from OUT FRONT in the far turn, rallied into the stretch and weakened
late. VICTORY SHADOW vied between rivals in the early stages, dropped back leaving the backstretch and stayed on evenly through the stretch.
CHRISSY'S CHROME settled inside then swung out into the lane and failed to menace. OOPS BUSTED angled in to the four path and lacked a bid and
was eased. IT'S THEATRE TIME attended the early pace, dropped back, drifted in at the top of the lane then yielded, was eased just before the wire and
walked off. FIRST SAMARIA broke slow and never reached contention then was eased.

Footnotes
PATRICK trailed the field, advanced steadily along the rail in the far turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted inward, closed steadily under handling and
was along in time outside. AWESOME HIT sat just off the pace inside, went in pursuit of VISION QUEST in the final turn, moved up alongside rival then
drifted in under right handed urging, inched clear of the fore mentioned mid stretch and was run down late. VISION QUEST was quickest to the turn,
showed the way through the backstretch, drew clear in the far turn then was challenged by AWESOME HIT into the lane and lacked the rally needed.
PARIS IN PLAY settled at the back of the pack inside, circled into the lane and offered a late mild bid. SMALL TOWN DUDE raced five wide into the
opening turn, settled inside, angled out leaving the backstretch and had no response when asked. BARLEY BOY raced four wide early, tracked outside and
chased to no avail. HUERFANO G. drifted out in the opening turn, raced from the three path through the backstretch and failed to produce a bid. RUNAWAY
LIGHTNING settled off the pace inside, lodged a mild bid and gave way. DUDLEY DO was wide into the opening turn, was outrun throughout and eased.
