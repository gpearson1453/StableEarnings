Footnotes
ASEM stalked dueling pair outside of rival on the backside, entered turn three wide, came out of the turn four wide, ended up in the five path and responded
well with strong rally under solid urging. BELLIGERENT stalked leaders on the inside of rival, stayed along the rail entering turn, took advantage of drifting
out rival and came through along the rail to get the lead, caught late under steady urging. SHEZA KATHY dueled outside of rival on the backside, stayed
head and head entering the turn, took turn three wide, bumped at the eighth pole by rival on the hind end, entered stretch in the four path, asked and
responded but outkicked and finished third best. CLEAN LIVING dueled inside of rival on backside, entered turn two wide, started to drift out late in the turn
and bumped rival at the eighth pole, lacked needed rally in the stretch finishing a tiring fourth. MADAME JEANETTE lacked speed along the backstretch,
stayed along the rail throughout and made up ground late under mild urging along the rail.
