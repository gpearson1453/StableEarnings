Footnotes
PEACE LOVE BREAD pressed the early pace outside of LORAN HOLIDAY, settled back to track behind that foe through the first turn, continued to track
the leading pair as NORTHERN ALLIANCE made her bid on the backstretch, continued patiently in the two to three path on the far turn, was taken to the
outside into the lane and put to a drive, came rolling in the final furlong and took the lead in the final fifty yards. NORTHERN ALLIANCE broke inward
bumping LAUNCH AWAY in the opening strides, chased the leading pair while racing keenly through the first turn, began to advance two wide past the
eleven sixteenths, engaged outside of LOREN HOLIDAY approaching the half mile mark, disputed the pace outside that foe through the far turn, cleared
past the quarter pole, tried to stay on under a drive in the final furlong but could not stave off PEACE LOVE BREAD late. LAUNCH AWAY was sandwiched
between NORTHERN ALLIANCE and ORIENTAL LADY in the opening strides, settled at the rear of the main pack, made a two wide bid past the three
eighths, came into the lane in range but proved no match for NORTHERN ALLIANCE, and chased on to the wire. LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG) set the pace
while keen under a hold early, was confronted by NORTHERN ALLIANCE to her outside approaching the half mile mark, disputed the pace inside her
through the far turn, but emptied out past the quarter pole. ORIENTAL LADY broke inward and bumped LAUNCH AWAY in the opening strides, hopped
after bumping that foe, took back and was difficult to settle, trailed in the two path through the clubhouse turn, continued to trail in the two to three path
through the far turn and never mounted a bid.

Footnotes
COOLER SCHEDULE raced inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued up the backstretch between horses, swung out to the four path to
navigate the turn, entered the stretch wide, gained ground on the outside through the stretch and pulled clear in the final strides. LAVERNS LASS was
pinched back leaving the gate, settled in to trail the field early, began to move up approaching the half mile pole, raced in the three path in traffic around the
turn, improved position on the rail in the stretch, ran into tight quarters at the eighth pole and found room to just get up for the place. BE AUTHENTIC raced
outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path, began her bid nearing the quarter pole, improved position on the outside down the lane
and was caught late. LADY MAGNA dueled for the lead on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to settle in behind the leader for
the remainder of the backstretch, raced between horses in the three path around the turn, moved up to challenge again at the quarter pole, took over the
lead entering the stretch and folded late. RARE ACTION ATTACK raced inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and made no bid in the stretch. DETOUR dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, forged ahead to lead outright headed into the turn, raced in
the two path from there and tired badly entering the stretch. TEMPLESIS raced outside near the back of the pack up the backstretch, began to drop back
from the three path around the turn and was not a factor from there.

Footnotes
HAMMERED was sent for speed up the inside, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, and held clear under a drive in the lane. BOURBON REBELLION
was bumped in the opening strides, settled in second last, pulled when in tight between JUDY'S WAY and the rail near the three eighths, settled shortly
thereafter, rallied along the inside when driven into the lane, continued to pursue HAMMERED under a drive but could not reel her all the way in. POINT
STREAK stalked inside of MEEKA down the backstretch, made a bid outside of HAMMERED past the three eighths, proved no match for that foe into the
lane, chased while proving no match for HAMMERED or BOURBON REBELLION in the lane, and held third. EYE ON THE FINISH settled at the rear,
continued patiently in the four path on the turn, and passed tiring foes in the lane. MEEKA came in and bumped BOURBON REBELLION in the opening
strides, stalked the pace outside of POINT STREAK, raced two wide in the four path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, and lacked the needed
rally. TIZ HOPPIN came away well but was outsprinted to the lead, chased midpack outside of JUDY'S WAY, continued in the five path on the turn, and had
no bid near the center of the track in the lane. JUDY'S WAY chased inside of TIZ HOPPIN early, continued midfield in the two path on the turn, was urged
past the three eighths, offered no response and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
AMERICAN BIZ stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, swung out entering the stretch to find room and
gained ground on the outside, pulling clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. GET NONE chased the frontrunners on the outside up the backstretch, began a
bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole, veered out slightly in upper stretch, and could not go with the winner in late stretch but was the best
of the rest. THIRSTY COWGIRL raced outside near the back of the pack in the early going, came around the turn in the four path, launched a bid near the
three sixteenths pole and gained ground late in the stretch. MORA VALLEY dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the turn, entered the stretch between horses and weakened in the final furlong. MY WIFE IS BOSS dueled for the lead on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. ENCHILADA trailed the field up the backstretch and around the
turn, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in late stretch while never really being a factor. ANNIE TIME GIRL raced inside off the
pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and offered no bid. SAMIS CAR settled off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, raced
between horses in the two path around the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
MONGOL BULL was sent for speed, soon led on the outside, saved ground while dictating terms through the turn, was pushed along into the lane,
responded when put to a drive approaching the furlong mark, and kept on clear to the finish. DUMBMARK tracked the pace down the backstretch and two
wide on the turn, kept on two wide under a drive in the lane, and could not get to the pacesetter while all out. ROMEO O ROMEO was sent for speed early
but outsprinted to the lead by MONGOL BULL, took back to track the pace inside of DUMBMARK on the turn, saved ground around the bend, continued to
chase inside of DUMBMARK into the lane but could not match the top two in the final furlong. HE'S DANN GOOD chased early, took closer order in the
three to four path on the turn, and had no kick under a drive in the lane. BOOM BOX was fractious at the start and reared in the gate, hit the gate while
breaking inward, proved hard to settle at the inside of the rear pair, raced in the three path on the turn, and made no bid under a drive in the lane. TRUE
LOYALTY settled two wide in the rear pair, was pushed along in the six path on the turn, was driven into the lane but offered no rally.

Footnotes
TURFMEISTER raced off the pace while saving ground around the first turn, continued to save ground around the first turn, and made a bold surge between
horses in late stretch to get up for the win. FOGGY ALBION raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack, saved ground around the far turn, took the lead passing the sixteenth pole and was caught in the final strides. BE AN INSPIRATION raced at the back
of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around far turn in the two path, improved position on the outside in the
stretch and just missed the place. BEE HAPPY ATTACK bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn,
settled in behind the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path approaching the quarter pole and gained ground in the stretch while getting
outfinished late. FAST ONE dueled for the lead on the outside around the first turn, was a tad rank up the backstretch, continued to duel from the two path
around the far turn and into the stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. KING RICHIE bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to
duel for the lead on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the final furlong. NARRATION
trailed the field from the two path the entire way around the oval, made up some ground in the stretch but was never a factor.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME tracked the leading pair, raced in the two path on the turn, rallied two wide in upper stretch, drove to the lead between horses with a
sixteenth of a mile remaining, kept on while drifting out and prevailed gamely. CAN'T SAY NO chased two wide, was shaken up past the seven sixteenths,
advanced in the three path on the turn, went to a drive three wide in upper stretch, rallied, continued gamely under a drive while being carried out by ONE
WAY HOME, and narrowly missed. STORMIN EL PRADO pressed the early pace outside of GRAY MENSCH, dueled outside that foe through the turn, led
into the lane, kept on under a drive, but was caught with a sixteenth of a mile remaining and flattened late. B SALTY chased midfield inside horses early,
continued near the rear in the two path on the turn, and rallied mildly in the lane. GRAY MENSCH soon led, dueled inside of STORMIN EL PRADO around
the turn, proved no match for that foe past the quarter mile mark and flattened inside. CHRISTMAS COOKIE raced between horses midpack early, chased
in the four path on the turn and lacked the needed rally in the lane. FORGOT TO FORGET settled at the rear, trailed in the two to three path on the turn,
and made no bid. KEEP ATTACKING chased three wide early, lost ground from the seven sixteenths in the five path, and was empty for the drive.

Footnotes
FATE FACTOR raced in the middle of the pack from the four path through the opening half mile, began a bid between horses around the far turn, entered
the stretch from the four path and made a bold rally in midstretch to pull clear in the final furlong. AUNT DOROTHY pressed the pace from the three path
around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to vie for the lead from the two path around the far turn and into the stretch, could not go with the
winner in the final furlong, but chased that one home willingly. ENGLISH raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the frontrunners on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily on the outside down the
stretch. BETTER ANGELS saved ground around the first turn, settled just behind the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the far turn, ran into traffic at the quarter pole, found room entering the stretch, and was outkicked late. LIGHT IN THE DARK raced into traffic from
the three path headed into the first turn, was steadied slightly by her rider, recovered to run in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the three path and improved position mildly from the rail in the stretch. AIMARA raced in the two path around the first turn,
continued up the backstretch on the inside towards the back of the back, navigated the far turn from the three path and gained ground slightly on the outside
down the stretch while never really threatening. LEMON POPPER broke slowly, saved ground around the first turn, settled in the back of the pack up the
backstretch, swung out to the four path around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. COLOROFACLOUD raced in the two path just behind the
leader around the first turn, moved up to challenge entering the backstretch, dueled on the outside for the next half mile, entered the stretch in the lead from
the four path and weakened in the final furlong. FOREVERNOA raced in the five path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, stayed wide while making a bid midway around the far turn, entered the stretch from the five path and faded in the final eighth of a mile.
GOLDEN STAR LADY led the field from the two path around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn and tired in the stretch. MUFFINS REVENGE broke slowly, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch far
behind the field, took a bad step at the half mile pole, lost her rider and was euthanized on the track.
