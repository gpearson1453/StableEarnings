TIA FLOR away alertly set the pace widening into upper stretch drawing away under a hand ride in the three path. FLAT OUT SMOKIN went evenly racing
inside to upper stretch rallying in the two path saving place. PREFER DIAMONDS raced mid pack angling five wide to upper stretch finishing evenly at mid
track. DEVILISH MAGIC pressed then chased through the turn before weakening in the three path upper stretch. STEALING SUNSHINE was never
involved. BROOK'S ON FIRE hustled along through the turn would wilt in upper stretch. SOPHIA REGINA had brief speed then gave way abruptly on the
