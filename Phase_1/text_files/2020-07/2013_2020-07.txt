outside just before going a mile. WAR TWEET hit the outside of the gate while breaking awkwardly, was unhurried two wide, circled into the stretch and
finished with good energy outside. L. A. HOUSE stayed close to the rail while making the pace to midstretch then weakened. MISS AJA BROWN angled to
the rail on the backstretch while chasing the early leader and tired in the lane. MUSIC MAKER angled to the inside nearing the first turn while unhurried,
improved position into the far turn then flattened out. LIGHT MY PATH stayed inside while slow early and failed to menace. GLAMOROUS THUNDER raced
the three path and tired. HURRICANE PATRICIA pressed outside the early leader for about five furlongs, stopped and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
ESKENFORTIME was unhurried inside, steadied in tight entering the far turn, steadied again nearing the stretch, remained along the rail into the stretch,
angled out nearing the final sixteenth, closed between horses and was up late. PENDRELL MOON was slow early, swung wide into the stretch and finished
fast outside the winner to just miss. FEDERAL DOMINANCE chased the early leader in the two path, moved to a short lived lead after a mile but was little
match in the final yards. VEYA wasn't far back along the rail throughout but lacked the needed closing response. CANDYCREET steadied in tight between
horses entering and midway on the first turn, raced the three path around the final turn and continued evenly. MY OWN LANE stayed inside and couldn't
gain. HEIKO stayed out from the inside while making the pace for about a mile then gave way. BENEVOLENT PRINCE advanced outside on the
backstretch, edged closer into the far turn then tired. FREIGHT TRAIN couldn't keep up.

WARCRAFT pressed outside the early leader, moved two wide to a short lead into the turn, ran out entering the stretch, drifted out through late stretch
despite right hand whip and held. MY TRAIN advanced in hand to vie three wide before a half, was carried out into the lane, appeared to be struck in the
head by the winner's whip in late stretch and was carried out to the end to miss. An objection by Gonzalez against the winner was not allowed. TEN HUT
was slow early, raced out from the rail around the turn then gained inside late. WOLFINBARGER stayed well out from the rail around the turn and gained
mildly. AGAINST THE ODDS lagged early, swung wide into the stretch while moving, ducked out in midstretch and was eased up. TRUSTING FRIEND was
no factor. WILDWOOD DANCER made the pace along the rail into the turn and was finished after a half.

dueled inside from the outset, regained command after five furlongs but was little match late. GREAT AGAIN showed speed outside from the start, fell back
before a quarter, angled to the rail nearing the turn, offered a mild bid past midstretch but hung. MARTINKELLY set or forced the pace two wide for over five
furlongs then tired. QUEEN'S BIRD raced with the early pace into the turn, stayed in the three path to the stretch and weakened. METHODICAL broke
slowly then couldn't catch up.

Footnotes
RAPSTOREROCKS began a run along the rail into the far turn, angled out in midstretch, closed between horses and was up in time. JUST KITTEN YOU
pressed outside the early leader, fell back on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the final turn then finished gamely outside the winner.
FOURTEEN CARROT moved to the front from the inside early on the first turn, widened in hand around the final turn, remained clear into late stretch but
couldn't last. THE HONEST TOUN was slow early, rallied two wide around the final turn, swung out entering the stretch and gained too late.
GOTTOASKCHARLIE was slow early then passed tired ones. THE LAST YANNUZZI stopped. OMENED BY was no factor. FOLES raced three wide with
the pace for less than a half then stopped and was eased up.
