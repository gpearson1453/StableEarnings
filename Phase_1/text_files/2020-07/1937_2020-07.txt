Footnotes
SPRING STEEN, urged to gain a forward placing inside foes from the outset, switched out while being prompted to maintain striking distance racing to the
turn, continued with a steady bid racing into upper stretch to wrest the advantage leaving midstretch, shifted inwards despite some left handed pressure but
steadily edged forward. BEST KEPT SECRET was urged clear from the break, angled to the rail to set the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn,
resisted the winner's challenge past midstretch but came up second best. TEE EM EYE, held up momentarily avoiding close quarters leaving the gate,
tracked off the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking distance racing to the turn and continued evenly to late stages. JANET'S MAE, off slowly,
angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn but lacked the needed late response. SIMRAN altered course
avoiding close quarters start while shifting out four deep, appeared to take an awkward step, was immediately pulled up, then was vanned off the course.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SIMRAN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF BEST KEPT SECRET ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE AT THE BREAK WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
EL TIZAR broke readily, dictated the pace along the rail on a comfortable margin to the far turn and gamely held the challenge of STITZY through the
stretch in a protracted skirmish. The latter broke out, was righted to stalk just off the pacesetter along the inside under firm rating, came out entering the lane
to challenge for command while continuing under confident handling and was just outfinished. ZOE'S DELIGHT, reserved last racing to the backstretch,
steadily gained contention along the inside racing through the far turn, shifted three wide momentarily, then angled in to bid between foes nearing midstretch
but was outkicked while lacking a clear path from which to challenge. OVERLY LUCKY tracked the leaders from just out of striking distance a bit off the
inside racing to the second bend, shifted four deep racing into the lane and made a mild bid. TRI SPOT tracked the leaders outside a rival in the opening
half, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
BIG SPORT tracked just off the leaders five wide in early stages, advanced four wide racing through the turn to challenge for command in upper stretch and
was roused clear. HERBIE, urged to dispute the pace inside foes while exchanging some light contact with PEACOCK COWBOY on the backstretch, set the
pace on the turn to upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. FAYETTE WARRIOR tracked the pace three wide between foes
racing to the turn and continued evenly to late stages. MASTERFUL STRIDE, off slowly, angled to the inside while being prompted to gain position nearing
the lane but had no final kick. PEACOCK COWBOY, urged between prompting the pace, shifted inwards exchanging brushes with HERBIE near the half
mile marker and gave way into the lane. SINK THE BISMARCK was a brief factor four wide between foes but dropped out early.

Footnotes
DAME PLATA angled inside tracking off the first flight, bid along the rail entering the stretch and narrowly prevailed under firm handling. GREAT BLAKE
tracked off the first flight between foes to the second bend, bid three deep between foes and was just outkicked. MISTER BANJOMAN, forwardly placed in
the three path prompting the pacesetter, pressed the issue into the lane and weakened late. NORTHCUT settled outside foes in early stages, advanced four
wide on the far turn to upper stretch and made a mild gain. BLUE DANCER tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid
nearing upper stretch but had no late kick. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN, off slowly, was settled between foes off the second flight but never gained contention.
UNCLE GOYLE, urged along the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled into the lane and gave way midstretch. GO GOLD
settled along the inside early and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MOLLY'S ANGEL, urged along the rail disputing the pace, kicked clear nearing upper stretch, then steadily widened while being kept to the task.
MINNESOTA NICE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted three wide entering the lane and continued with interest to prevail for
the place honors. OWEN'S PLEASURE settled last along the inside racing into the turn, angled out four wide entering the lane and displayed some late
interest. THAT WOULD BE NICE broke readily, prompted the pacesetter to the turn and gave way. DANIELLE'S DEAL, a bit slow into stride, proved no
threat. ICYWILBURNYEH angled inside tracking off the first flight but gave way early.

Footnotes
WHERE'D THE DAY GO broke readily, pulled against firm restraint along the inside tracking just off the first flight, shifted three wide racing into the far turn,
was prompted to take over racing through upper stretch and kicked clear under firm encouragement. BUBBA BOB, urged to dictate the pace along the
inside, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch but proved no match late. CARAMEL ANGEL broke readily, prompted the pace between foes
to the far turn and gave way in the drive. SILVER DASH angled inside tracking off the second flight, steadily gained position along the inside to upper stretch
but lacked the needed late kick. MACHO RAPIDO tracked off the first flight between foes to the far turn and faded into the stretch. STAYCATION, forwardly
placed three wide, tracked off the first flight to the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. MR. D'S LEGEND settled off the second flight and failed to
menace. DEVIL VISION settled along the inside, saved ground to the lane and proved no threat while gathered up late. MUSKYMAN settled into stride off
the inside and dropped out early. MINNEAPOLISMIRACLE trailed.

Footnotes
DEVIL LADY tracked just off the first flight while angling inside racing into the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch, was bumped, then forced out by
DIAMOND DIVA entering upper stretch while shifting out four wide, but rallied between foes under brisk left handed pressure to prevail in time. DUSTY
PRINCESS settled outside foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide leaving the turn, was forced to alter course to the five path
entering the lane and continued to make steady progress to the end to just miss. WESTERN ATTIRE, urged between foes pressing the pace racing to the
turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch while shifting inwards impeding DIAMOND DIVA, was roused to resist challengers to the end but
was collared nearing the wire. TRIPLE MALT, forwardly placed three deep stalking just off the leaders, shifted out entering the lane while being roused to
challenge but weakened between foes late. MS COMEDY TIME broke readily and steadily faded between foes early. OAKLIE GAL angled to the inside
early, saved ground to the lane, came through inside foes entering the stretch but had no late kick. DIAMOND DIVA, urged to dispute the pace along the rail
into the turn, lost the advantage nearing upper stretch, was shut off entering the lane, then abruptly checked while making contact with the winner and
emptied out. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE TRAINER OF DUSTY PRINCESS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

IMMINENT THREAT settled off the second flight outside rivals racing to the backstretch, angled out five wide racing through the lane and prevailed in time
under firm handling. MS KELA TIME settled off the second flight along the inside, came around a tiring foe nearing upper stretch, shifted to the rail and
advanced inside foes to challenge for command while just outkicked. STYLIN N PROFILIN sprinted to the lead, set the pace on a narrow margin to the
second bend, held sway into upper stretch but faltered late. NOTE PAD tracked off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, came through inside rivals
to challenge inside the pacesetter in upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. ROSES FOR DOUG tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the
second flight, shifted out to bid four wide in upper stretch but had no late kick while finishing on her own courage. LEFT OF CENTER settled outside foes,
angled six wide in the stretch but made no impact. SPEEDING PASSION settled midpack while angling inside, shifted out entering the lane but had no
closing response while gathered up late. TIMEINTHETAVERN, forwardly placed three wide, lodged a brief bid nearing the lane but proved empty late while
finishing in hand. SWEET ECLIPSE in touch prompting pacesetter to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane.
