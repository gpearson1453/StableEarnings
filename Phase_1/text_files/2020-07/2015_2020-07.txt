KNIGHT DISRUPTOR gained the early lead, edged clear into the stretch, responded to brisk right-handed pressure and was all out to hold DISCREET
INVASION safe The latter raced in striking position while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and finished willingly. EDGE OF ACKWORTH
chased the pacesetter and lacked a rally. WILD DRIVE was outpaced while four wide and proved no factor. LOOKIE LOO was void of speed and did not
menace. AMERIPOINT showed little.

MINECRAFT MANIAC settled while four wide, advanced on the far turn, rallied while three wide and held well in the stretch. KAUAI stalked early, moved to
the front on the far turn, proved no match and stayed on. IRISH WIND reserved behind the pacesetters, was outpaced on the far turn and kept on while
three wide in the stretch to secure a minor share. NET GAIN was void of speed and displayed some mild late interest. IOWA NATIVE hopped at the start,
led early, was headed on the far turn and gave way. DOMIKATE was always outrun.
