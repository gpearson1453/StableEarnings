Footnotes
COMMAND THE CAT quickly sprinted clear, set the pace along the rail, widened under a drive in upper stretch and continued to widen while in hand the
final sixteenth. TWOBITSARIDE was outsprinted early, raced four wide around the turn and was along for the place. MAKANA chased the pace three wide,
lacked a closing bid and held for the show. REDOUBTABLE chased the pace two wide between foes and came up empty in the lane. MINI BOLT was
bumped hard at the start, clipped heels soon after, dropped far back, saved ground and never threatened. SALERNO lacked early speed, steadied nearing
the three-sixteenths pole give the loose horse room to maneuver then had no response when put to a drive soon after. KEY WEST KID broke a step slow,
advanced inside to chase the winner from the rail and retreated nearing the lane. KING DEREK broke out and bumped MINI BOLT at the start, stumbled
and lost the rider a few strides later when his heels were clipped by MINI BOLT, stayed on his feet and galloped along competitively and walked off. The
Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and ruled that KING DEREK caused his own trouble.

Footnotes
RAVIN' MAVEN stalked the pace three wide, took the lead between rivals near the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive.
THREE CHOPT PUNCH was unprepared for the start, was bumped near the five-eighths pole, made good progress three wide around the first turn, bid
outside of the winner entering the far turn but was turned back in upper stretch and settled for second. MR. SNAP set a clear pace along the rail, was
collared near the quarter pole, offered little resistance to the top two but stayed on well enough to preserve the show. MASTER YOO broke awkwardly,
raced well back inside for a half, tipped out midway around the turn to advance two wide then was one-paced in the lane. KING OF BLUES was reluctant to
load, bumped with THREE CHOPT PUNCH near the five-eighths pole, raced two and three wide and never threatened. MODERN COWPOKE stalked the
pace two wide, bid between rivals nearing the five-sixteenths pole then faded around the far turn. FORKS OF IVY failed to menace while racing two wide.

Footnotes
FRATHOUSE MUSIC set a clear pace along the rail, was under a drive on the backstretch and held firm in the lane. WOODBURN HALL broke a step slow,
angled three wide entering the stretch the first time, made progress four wide around the clubhouse turn, continued to gain outside down the backstretch,
bid three wide into the far turn and was slowly gaining through the lane. WISPER FREEDOM settled off the pace along the inside, went three wide around
the far turn and was up for a share of third. JUST A LIL LUKEY was off slow, lagged well back inside, angled out nearing the lane and rallied belatedly.
CASTLEFINN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. GREAT QUEST raced closest to the winner two wide and tired in the lane. WHAT A
STORY played no factor while racing three and four wide. KOPP CAT chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
MOTI settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around both turns, closed determinedly and was up in deep stretch. CHARITABLE SPENNY set a clear
pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and led until deep stretch. STEP OUT DANCING stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace
around the far turn but continued on willingly enough to gain the show. CAVALLOTTO saved ground and never threatened. PORT MORE stalked the pace
two wide and came up empty in the lane. ACCESS TO DENIS broke a step slow and played no factor while racing four wide. BATTLE READY saved
ground and was through after a half.

Footnotes
CANTAKEITANYMORE settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first two turns, made progress outside down the backstretch, circled five wide
around the far turn, had aim at the top of the stretch and slowly wore down his foe. THE WAYNE FACTOR prompted the pace in the three path, took the
lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear around the far turn, drifted out turning for home and led until deep stretch. A TRUE GENTLEMAN raced in
range three wide early, bid four wide between rivals around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. ROYAL BLUE stalked the pace from the rail, tipped
out to bid two wide between foes entering the far turn, chased two wide around that bend and came up empty in the lane. SET'EM UP JOE settled off the
early pace while racing two wide, advanced down the backstretch, bid three wide between foes nearing the far turn then faded around the bend. EMBLEM'S
ESTATE played no factor while racing two wide. CATONSVILLE set the pace in the two path and tired around the far turn. KATMAN QUICK saved ground
in midpack, angled three wide down the backstretch had no response. WHISKEY CREEK was outrun inside. HOWYAFORMONEY trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
J J WEDGIT MAN saved ground off the pace, advanced inside around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up and clear late.
ALL ABOUT TAP settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide into the far turn, moved into second leaving the three-sixteenths pole,
angled into the two path, inherited the lead when RIVERCROSROAD RVF bolted nearing the lane, led to deep stretch but was no match in the final yards.
ATRANI was bumped at the start, raced three wide around the turns and rallied. THORN OF ROSE HILL lagged well back inside, went four wide around the
far turn and rallied widest. GHOST MINE was rank at the start, raced well back two wide then rallied belatedly between rivals. OFFICER UNBRIDLED was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide early, made a rail bid nearing the lane then weakened in the drive. DOCTOR MCCOY set the pace along
the rail, angled out when a rival cleared early on the backstretch, chased two wide from there and came up empty in the lane. FONEY was outrun inside.
THERE THERE was reluctant to load, hesitated at the start and made little impact while mostly saving ground. RIVER CROSROAD RVF advanced two
wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared and angled in early on the backstretch run, drew off around the far turn, enjoyed a substantial lead when bolted
nearing the lane and ran off toward the barn area into the catch pen, was pulled up and walked off. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident
nearing the lane and took no action.

Footnotes
Q'S SONG stalked the pace three wide, bid four wide nearing the lane, seized a narrow lead in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane,
dueled three wide through the stretch, edged ahead of that pack in deep stretch and just withstood a late surge from the runner-up. THISLILLIMEOFMINE
settled off the duel while racing two and three wide, swung five wide in upper stretch, closed strongly widest and just missed. DISTORTED SPLENDOR
dueled outside of COLLEGE KID down the backstretch, bumped that foe entering the turn, briefly drew clear, dug in inside of two challengers nearing the
lane, bumped with THREE BOPS in upper stretch, battled on inside of foes through the lane and was narrowly outfinished. THREE BOPS was off a bit slow,
advanced inside down the backstretch, angled out to bid three wide between rivals around the far turn, was bumped in upper stretch, vied between foes and
was outkicked. DIAMOND TRAIN lacked early speed, raced two wide around most of the turn, swung six wide near the eighth pole and rallied belatedly.
COLLEGE KID dueled along the rail down the backstretch, was bumped entering the turn, dropped back inside, re-bid in upper stretch then weakened.
MADDY MACHEN played no factor while racing three wide. DEVELIN' ROSE was outrun inside.
