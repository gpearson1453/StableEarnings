Footnotes
DESERT DUDE was well placed off the dueling leaders, was caught out four then five wide to the stretch, rallied once clear and closed steadily to be along
in time. TRUMP UM dueled for the lead from the three wide to the stretch, put away DANGERSMYMIDDLENAME and edged away to mid stretch then did
not switch leads and was tagged late. KNOWN was outsprinted to the turn, came five then six wide to the stretch and closed some ground late.
DANGERSMYMIDDLNAME contested the pace inside TRUMP UM, was two wide to the stretch but was outkicked in upper stretch and tired. TIZ EMMA
had no speed, chased two wide to the stretch then came up empty. CAJUN BETTOR had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
HAMMY TIME was on the pace from the outset, saved ground on the turn then eased off the rail into the stretch, rallied to edge away to mid stretch and was
under vigorous handling to hold. WICKED SUNSET attended the pace three wide, was pushed out further into the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but
kept to task and was closing late. REGAL LADY chased the leaders to the turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but was
gaining in the late stages. SUGARSEEKER had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch and also made up ground belatedly. RED SHELBY hustled to
duel between rivals and two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. JUPITER S. had no speed and was never a threat. C I M
SWEET bobbled at the start then trailed throughout.

MAGGIE'S MAGIC broke alertly and went right to the front, set the pace two then three wide to the stretch then responded determinedly to hold. THE
LATTE FACTOR chased the winner to the turn, had to circle four then five wide to the stretch but finished in a good rally. SILK ROAD SALLY hesitated and
broke a bit slow, hustled up to stalk the winner from the rail to the stretch, rallied to loom a threat to mid stretch then finished evenly. SHANGHAI SUNRISE
also was stalking the winner three then four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty in the drive. SHE'S EXPENSIVE had no
speed, raced in the three path to the stretch but could not threaten in the drive. REINA DE REYES was chasing to the turn, shifted off the rail nearing the
quarter pole but weakened in the final furlong. CLARE'S IRISH EYES was always outrun.

MOTHER OF DRAGONS had good speed, dueled to the turn while well off the rail, was three then four wide but drifted out into the stretch, responded when
straightened for the drive and dug in gamely to hold the nod. BIDDY DUKE pressed the winner to the turn, was carried out to the six path into the stretch,
responded through the drive and just missed. PRINCESS VIVIAN had no speed, was off the rail to the stretch then pushed up to loom boldly in mid stretch,
battled on but was bested late. BLUE DIVA had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. LEFT ALONE (GB)
hustled along early to contest the pace, pressed the winner to the quarter pole then was pushed out to the five path into the stretch by that one and tired.
MISIRLOU tracked the pace to the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch then was inside rivals but tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON was on the pace while two wide to the stretch, responded when set down, edged clear to mid stretch and held determinedly.
FLICFLAC was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then closed steadily for the place. ECOLOGIST tracked the winner off the rail to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then lacked a closing response. WHENDUCKSFLY had good speed, dueled outside the winner and three wide to the
stretch then could not keep up to mid stretch and weakened. ALBANY FRONT was chasing to the turn but was forced out to the five path to the stretch and
did not threaten. SATANTA also was tracking the leaders to the turn, tried to respond while four wide to the stretch but finished evenly in the final furlong.
SIERRA MELODY hopped at the start, lost about four lengths to the field and was not a factor. INQUISITION was always outrun.
