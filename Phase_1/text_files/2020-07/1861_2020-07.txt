Footnotes
SEBASTIAN'S BOY was hustled up the rail in the opening stages to gain terms with the first flight disputing the issue, kicked clear nearing upper stretch and
was kept to firm encouragement while widening. MIS YA LOTS broke sharply, prompted the pace four wide to the turn, lost some ground to the leader on
the bend, was fanned five wide racing into upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER, urged
between foes disputing the pace from the outset, lost ground to the eventual winner nearing the lane, altered course avoiding a stricken rival and weakened
in late stages. MEDALLA MATCH vied for command three wide between foes racing into the turn and gave way into the lane. TWICE SMITTEN tracked off
the first flight along the inside but offered no rally. SUCCESSFUL, a step slow into stride, never gained contention. VEZMEREYES broke awkwardly, was
righted to make steady progress angling to the inside racing into the turn, switched outside the pacesetter racing into upper stretch, was taken up after
taking an awkward step and was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
PLENTY OF MUNNY, caught six wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a forward placing, shifted in nearing the backstretch to track off the
first flight between foes to the second bend, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch to bid for command in the closing stages and prevailed in time under
firm handling. DO YOU BILEVE, urged three wide prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path into upper stretch, edged
forward to gain the lead between calls but was collared nearing the wire. GOLDEN LILY, reserved last along the inside racing to the first turn, saved ground
through the far turn, angled out six wide in late stages and made some belated progress. BRAHMS IS WHO, a bit restless in the post parade, tracked off the
second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes nearing the lane, drifted to the seven path in the closing stages
but continued to gain some position late. SKIPTEASE angled to the inside early to track off the second flight into the backstretch, shifted out in the closing
stages to split foes three wide but finished evenly. MUSTANG MOLLY, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, gave
way into upper stretch. LAURA N LUKAS, caught five wide between foes racing into the first turn, shifted inwards a bit to track outside foes as part of the
second flight but had no closing response. FAIRY SURPRISE, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and
gave out late. BAILDON settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch and proved no threat. TURQUOISE TRAIL, urged to terms with the
first flight four wide between foes into the first turn, angled to the inside entering the backstretch to track off the first flight, saved ground to the lane, was
prompted to advance nearest the rail but lost all momentum when caught in tight quarters late.

FLAN broke readily, prompted the pace three wide racing through the backstretch into the turn, forged clear leaving the midway point of the turn and held
sway under firm left handed pressure. VEGAN GOES BEST tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out splitting rivals
on the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others. MEMORABLE ANGEL, off slowly, settled last racing to the turn, swung out
nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position four wide between foes in the closing stages. JUST SPLENDID, urged between foes
disputing the pace from the outset, angled inside entering the turn and gave way. MUCHO SUPER GIRL hesitated at the start, then was caught five wide in
the opening stages tracking off the first flight, continued to make progress three deep nearing upper stretch but came up empty entering the lane. FASHION
ROSE, urged inside foes disputing the pace in the opening stages, gave way early. HALEYS HEIST dropped out early.

Footnotes
SCATTERED CASH was rated off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted out four wide nearing the lane advancing on the leader and
continued with a steady late response to prevail in time between foes under firm handling. OUTRUN THE POSSE, pulled his way to the lead along the
inside leaving the chute, dueled for command inside a rival racing into the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch and just missed. BUYMEABOND settled
along the inside in the opening half, swung out five wide entering the lane and finished willingly to challenge for command nearing the wire. REAL LUTE
settled outside foes from out of striking distance to the backstretch, was fanned six wide gathering momentum racing past midstretch and gained position to
the end. FORMIDABLE FORCE angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight, saved ground on the far turn into upper stretch and continued
evenly inside foes late. BORN FORCE, caught in close quarters at the start, was settled last along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing
into the lane and displayed some belated interest between foes. NORCO tracked off the second flight, outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out
three deep to bid between foes nearing the lane but had no closing kick. KELA BREW tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to
the far turn and came up empty into the stretch. MAMBOCELLO settled along the inside early and offered no rally. CYCLONE DAN settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. MY DISCRETION, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace leaving the chute, pressed the issue into
the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
FAIRLY HONEST angled to the inside gaining a position stalking just off the first flight racing into the turn, switched out three deep racing into upper stretch
while readily advancing on the pacesetter, drifted out under left handed pressure but prevailed in time. DIVA DE KELA, forwardly placed three deep tracking
just off the pacesetter, advanced on that foe on the turn to wrest command, held sway into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid but was collared late.
SNOWTRICK, shuffled out of close quarters in early stages, tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, angled five wide nearing upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to gain a share late. AQUINA'S ADVICE angled to the inside early racing off the second flight, shifted out to race four
wide between foes nearing the lane and continued evenly. PARTY LIGHTS, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, set the pace on a
narrow margin into the turn, then gave way once headed nearing the lane. HUSHED tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight but gave way early.
PENNY FOR LUCK, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter from the outset into the turn, gave way midway through the bend, then was taken up in the
closing stages. PRICELESS MIRACLE swerved out at the start losing position to the field and trailed throughout.

COME ON SWEET PEA angled inwards while being prompted to a contending position between foes racing to the first turn, tracked off the second flight
outside a rival to the far turn, steadily advanced three, then four wide racing into upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure but prevailed in time under
firm handling. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN, prompted to a forward placing three deep in early stages, tracked just outside the pacesetter as part of the second
flight, was prompted to challenge for command nearing the lane, moved to gain the advantage leaving midstretch, resisted the winner's challenge but came
up second best. TANTIMA angled to the inside early to track off the second flight, shifted out gaining position between foes nearing the lane, angled inside
foes while being urged to challenge inside foes near midstretch but was outkicked. FOR SARAS SAKE settled between foes racing to the backstretch,
swung out four wide racing into the lane and made some mild progress late. FLASH FLOOD was rated outside a rival racing midpack to the backstretch,
gained position between foes entering upper stretch but lost some momentum when caught in tight quarters nearing the sixteenth marker. DROP O'
CHOCOLATE sprinted to the lead outside foes racing to the first turn, angled to the inside, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, gave way once
headed while drifting out markedly in the closing stages. ARRESTING was rated off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn but came up
empty nearing upper stretch. MY MISS MARILYN settled into stride off the inside and offered no rally. TEMPLES MON CHERI, held up avoiding close
quarters at the start, settled in the last flight to the backstretch, angled five wide entering the stretch but made no impact. PEYTONS SKY DANCER settled
outside foes in the opening stages and failed to menace thereafter. ADDY PADDY settled along the inside as part of the last flight and proved no threat.
ADDED DIAMONDS angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance entering
the far turn but gave way nearing the lane.

MOST AMUSING was urged three deep between foes prompting a rival's pace in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival into the turn, took
over nearing the lane and drove clear. MARSHALL HILL, bumped at the start, was settled into stride dropping well off the leaders, split foes on the turn
gathering momentum, angled four wide entering the stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. STARRING JOHN WAIN tracked off the second flight
near the inside, shifted out to split foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. FRONT OFFICE tracked off the first
flight three wide racing to the turn, continued in pursuit to upper stretch and gave way. HARRY THE HITMAN settled between foes and displayed some
belated interest three deep between foes. POVERTY FLATS broke outwards bumping MARSHALL HILL, tracked off the first flight four wide to the turn,
continued five wide nearing the lane and steadily faded. BEERMASTER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn and faded into
upper stretch. HOLD THAT THOUGHT proved no factor. SLEEPY TURTLE was urged disputing the pace while angling to the inside racing through the
backstretch, dueled into the bend and gave way abruptly into the lane. THE FIRST HERO, caught six wide in early stages, soon dropped out.

TASHIARA, in touch with the first flight between rivals in the opening stages, conceded some position to the leaders while angling to the rail racing into the
turn, was prompted to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch, shifted out midstretch while being briskly roused to turn back the challenge of SMOKIN
HOT MOMMA and held that rival to the end. The latter, held up off the first flight in the opening stages while angling to the inside, swung outside foes on the
turn to advance four wide racing into upper stretch, moved to challenge for command midstretch but was outkicked. ROSIE BEAR, off last, was rated off the
first flight while angling inwards a bit racing into the turn, shifted to the inside entering the lane and continued with an effort to improve position.
FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, shifted off the rail racing into the turn and gave way between foes
entering the lane. SULLYVIN'S G G joined the pace three deep in the opening stages, pressed the issue between foes in that path to upper stretch and
gave way. SOME SAY SO AND THERIGHTTOBEARARMS WERE ORDERED SCRATCHED AT THE GATE BY ORDER OF THE STEWARDS ON THE
ADVICE OF THE TRACK VETERINARIAN.

RUN AWAY FLASH raced unhurried along the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and made
steady progress to wrest command and go clear under firm handling. J J'S WILDCAT broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside rivals racing
into the bend, gained a clear advantage while shifting to the rail in upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. FIERCE HE BE
settled last in early stages, gained position between foes, then shifted outside the top pair entering the lane while continuing with interest to improve
position. CLASSY MAGIC, urged along the inside in pursuit of the leaders, altered course avoiding tight quarters to race three wide into the turn, lodged a
brief bid in that path nearing the lane but soon flattened out. MATT AND CHEESE settled between foes in early stages and never gained contention. SAM'S
PALACE, was prompted between foes disputing the pace, angled to the rail dueling for command into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. EMMETT
CAT switched outside foes in early stages but failed to menace.
