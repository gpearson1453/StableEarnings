THE TRAIN dueled two wide from the outset, moved clear in midstretch and was kept to task. PRATT took turns on the front while inside the winner then
weakened in the drive. EMBRACE THE GRIND was rated not far back outside, brushed a few times with ADMIRATION on the backstretch, edged closer
three wide into the far turn then flattened out. ADMIRATION was bumped into FLUSHED while between horses before going a furlong, brushed with
EMBRACE THE GRIND down the backstretch, raced two wide around the final turn and lacked the needed closing. POSITIVE IMPACT took out sharply
from tight quarters, bumped LITTLE TOWN BLUES before going a furlong, was caught in tight along the rail midway on the final turn, then gained mildly.
FLUSHED raced outside and failed to menace. DUE GEMELLI bore out into ADMIRATION before going a furlong, steadied along the rail entering the first
turn, stayed inside and stopped. LITTLE TOWN BLUES was bumped and forced out before going a furlong then was outrun.

rally into the final furlong, sharply angled to the outside then was second best. CONQUEST HARLEQUIN bumped with FED FEVER while three wide
between horses around the first turn, steadied in tight between horses early on the backstretch, moved to vie outside in the three path on the final turn,
lugged in under right hand whip, bumped SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR leaving the furlong grounds then weakened. FED FEVER bumped with CONQUEST
HARLEQUIN while four wide with the pace around the first turn, angled in while taking command early on the backstretch, put rivals in tight, stayed out from
the rail around the final turn, ran out into the stretch, bore out under left hand whip, bumped SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR leaving the furlong grounds then tired.

WHOSE BABY IS THAT moved in hand between horses to gain command midway on the backstretch, stayed out from the rail around the turn, drew out
entering the stretch then held while bearing out late. ROGUE PATRIOT had early position in the four path outside horses in the first flight, fell back entering
the stretch then closed a gap late while drifting. RUN AWAY was slow early, stayed out from the rail around the turn then made a late run. MAJESTIC
CALLING was slow early, swung wide into the stretch and gained too late. OVERLEVERAGED broke sharply, made the early pace inside then weakened.
MR. SKITTLES was no factor. SARGENT SUDS was prominent in the three path between horses to the stretch, bore out through the lane and was eased
up.

leaving the gate, was bumped soon after, stayed out from the rail and failed to menace. CHITOWN raced the four path around the turn and lacked a closing.

and again entering the turn then stopped. HER ZEALOUS broke in the air, ducked out sharply leaving the gate, moved quickly to press the early leader,
stopped suddenly on the turn and was eased through the lane.

OLDFASHIONED CLUB stalked outside the early leader in the three path, took over early on the far turn, moved clear nearing the quarter pole and was put
to strong urging. MIDNIGHT ACT settled, rallied three wide into the stretch and gained to the end. CLOUD CHASER lagged early, made a strong run along
the rail around the final turn and had nothing left for the drive. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN saved ground to little avail. BUSTIN THE BANK made the pace in the two
path to the far turn then stopped in the lane. CANDY ASSET was outrun. MANAHAWKIN stopped.
