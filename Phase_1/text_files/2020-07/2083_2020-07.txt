NORTH DAKOTA settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed outside, seized command with about seventy yards
to go and drew clear under left-handed urging. BIG AGENDA was firmly rated while contesting the pace two wide, edged away from the pace rival in
midstretch but was no match for the winner late. CHANGI disputed the pace while rated inside and was out finished late. ZUMURUDEE stalked the pace
three wide around the first turn, saved some ground around the far turn and lacked a rally. ACCOUNTABLE made little impact inside and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TUNSTALL stalked the pace three wide, was floated out turning for home, closed outside, was up inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. HICKORY
MADE set a pressured pace inside, drew clear cutting the corner into the lane when the pace rival drifted out, held past the sixteenth pole and was no match
for the winner late. SPEAK ENGLISH lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn and was along for the show. TAR HEEL PALACE pressed the
pace two wide, drifted out turning for home and weakened. MY BLONDE MARY chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. TINY TURBO failed
to menace while racing three wide. OLD LINE MAGIC was outrun while racing two wide. MNEMOSYNE played no factor while racing three wide.

MONEY saved ground, gave chase in the stretch, was no match for winner but finished in good strides. SISTER OTOOLE rated, was fanned four wide on
the final turn, ridden earnestly but unable to gain. CALL ON CLARA was under a snug hold from the start, saved ground, unable to keep up in stretch
finishing one paced. MOMENTS TO SAVER was under a hold from the break, pulled to second on the backstretch, then tired. Final time hand timed and
internal fractions omitted pending review.

RIVER TRAPPE set the pace along the rail, drew off around the turn, widened under a drive to the sixteenth pole then was taken in hand late. MACHITA
saved ground off the pace and rallied along the rail to gain the place. PAVLA'S MISSION chased the winner inside, tipped two wide nearing the lane and
was outfinished for the place. TENERIFE MOON broke several lengths slow, advanced five wide around the turn and improved position. MAIDU failed to
menace while racing four wide. INDEHERE raced off the pace two wide, steadied along when boxed in around the turn and lacked a rally. BRAHMA
MOMMA played no factor while racing four wide. LANGLEY GIRL steadied early, chased the pace three wide and was done after a half. SHIRBEL was
fractious in the post parade then had only brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
BOWSPRIT saved ground in range, raced between foes down the backstretch, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, sized command nearing the
eighth pole and drove clear. FRONT LINE PAIGE raced well back two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied between foes to gain the
place in deep stretch. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY set the early pace along the rail, rated back inside down the backstretch, re-rallied inside into the far turn,
angled four wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead and finished willingly to gain a share of third. GRAY DUDE saved ground off the pace
around the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and rallied outside. UHWARRIE SKY disputed the pace two wide, dueled inside around the far turn,
drew clear in upper stretch, led to the eighth pole and weakened. STREET CODE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. I AIN'T NEVER was
outrun inside. DREAMING OF FRANK hopped at the start, steadied between rivals around both turns and never threatened. REAL ESTATE MOGUL
prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, dueled outside down the backstretch, vied two wide around the far turn and tired in the drive. COUNTY
COURT lacked early speed inside, went five wide around the far turn and made little impact. OFFICER'S OATH was outrun inside. STOCK chased the pace
four wide, bid four deep midway around the far turn and faded through the lane. JIFFY JOSH rushed up outside to dispute the pace two wide, and tired after
a half.
