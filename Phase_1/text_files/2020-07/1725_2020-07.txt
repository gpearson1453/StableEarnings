Footnotes
SHADES OF VICTORY, off a step behind the leaders, was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, shook clear racing through the far
turn and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. BOXER BOY tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, came under pressure after a half,
angled inside nearing the lane, then found his best response in late stages to gain second between rivals while moving to the close the gap on the winner.
OUT OF PATIENCE raced four wide to the first turn just off the second flight, continued four wide into the stretch to gain some position late but was
outkicked for second. SWEEPING EDGE tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing through the lane but had
no late kick. SPIRIT MISSION, urged to the lead along the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, dueled for command into the far
turn and gave way. SLICK AS ICE dropped out last racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. I'M AN EIGHT switched out three wide early to track the
leaders as part of the second flight but faded into the stretch

Footnotes
CAVE RUN, unhurried in the opening stages tracking off the first flight between foes, was prompted to maintain striking distance racing into the turn, shifted
out three wide entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm encouragement. MINES MADE UP, forwardly placed
along the rail in the opening quarter, conceded some ground racing into the turn tracking just off the pacesetter, was urged to challenge inside that foe
racing into upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage late but just failed to contain the winner. RAY'S ANGEL, urged prompting the pace outside a rival, then
between foes nearing the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into the turn but faltered late. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN dropped off the second
flight in early stages, swung out four wide racing into the lane and gained some position in an even effort. ROCKNROLL ROCKET tracked just off the first
flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded nearing upper stretch. EXECUTIVE DECREE, urged four wide, then three wide prompting the pacesetter
into the turn, gave way racing into upper stretch.

SHEHE showed quickly in front, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the turn and held sway to the end racing a bit off the rail under firm left handed
pressure to prove best. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK tracked just off the second flight near the inside racing into the turn, then found his best stride along the
rail nearing midstretch to gain the place honors late. BLACKS FERRY ROAD tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, continued to gain position to
upper stretch but had no closing bid. RAHAAL settled last in early stages, swung out four wide racing into the lane and gained some position while making
no impression. DAZZLING REUNION, urged in pursuit of the pacesetter racing into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. FURZY tracked the leaders outside

ACCORDING TO ASPEN tracked the leaders unhurried between foes from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, switched out three wide
racing into the stretch and rallied to the front to go clear late under firm left handed encouragement. FROSTY FLIRT went readily to the fore along the rail,
dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn, turned back that foe racing into upper stretch to
gain a clear advantage but proved no match for the winner in late stages. AWESOME SUNSET angled to the inside early tracking just off the first flight,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to edge a rival for a share on the wire. KIMBERLY FRANCES, reserved last while angling to the
inside racing to the backstretch, shifted outside foes racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid while being outkicked for a share. CSILLA, in
touch with the pacesetter prompting that foe in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way. STARFEST was urged to
gain a forward placing three deep racing just off the first flight to the backstretch but gave way on the far turn. THE INTERIOR SPLITS WERE NOT
AVAILABLE PENDING FURTHER REVIEW. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ALL NATIVE was urged to a clear advantage racing well off the rail in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the turn to duel for command between
foes through the bend to upper stretch but kicked away in the stretch under firm encouragement. KENNEDY'S DAY, prompted to a forward placing while
angling inside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, moved to press the issue inside that foe racing into the turn to upper stretch but proved no
match late. GOLDEN GOPHER tracked the pacesetter five wide in early stages, advanced racing into the turn to briefly loom three deep nearing upper
stretch, then bore out racing past the furlong marker while losing all momentum. MY AWARD, unhurried between foes in early stages, dropped out last
racing into the turn, swung four wide on the bend, was fanned five wide into the stretch but continued with an effort to gain some position. TOP SHELF
SARA tracked the pace outside foes from out of striking distance racing to the turn, angled four wide nearing upper stretch but lacked a closing response.
TIMBER LADY settled along the rail in early stages, saved ground to the lane but never gained contention. RIVER SWAN settled between foes in the last
flight and never seriously menaced.

MY HEART SINGS was rated outside foes in the three path racing to the first turn, shifted out nearing the far turn to advance on the leaders five wide racing
through the far turn, continued to make steady progress in that path racing through the stretch and narrowly prevailed in time under firm handling. IRISH
HALO, reserved in last to the first turn, switched outside foes to advance four wide after a half, steadily gained on the pacesetter between foes in that path
into upper stretch and moved to challenge for command nearing the wire while just outkicked. AVIE'S PARADISE, urged to the lead between foes racing to
the first turn, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage, held sway to upper stretch but was collared late. SHE'S FIRE AND ICE, forwardly placed
three deep in early stages, angled in to track off the first flight between foes, briefly awaited an opening in close quarters racing into upper stretch, then
shifted out in the closing stages to gain some position late. JOLLYVILLE settled off the second flight along the inside, saved ground through the far turn,
came through close quarters racing into the lane and continued along the inside to gain some position. AND ISLES was guided to the inside racing into the
last flight early, shifted out to race between foes on the backstretch, awaited an opening between foes nearing the lane, then swung out six wide in late
stages while making no real impression. JAKEALINA, forwardly placed four wide, then three deep tracking just off the leaders, angled to the rail on the
backstretch tracking just off the leaders, was prompted to lodge a brief bid along the inside nearing the lane but came up empty entering the lane. SPITFIRE
SUZIE tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, advanced on the far turn to lodge a brief, three wide bid nearing upper stretch but proved empty in
the drive. LAURA N LUKAS, forwardly placed along the inside racing to the first turn, switched outside the leader on the backstretch, was prompted to lodge
a brief bid between foes on the far turn but gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
CITY GONE COUNTRY broke readily to gain a forward placing along the rail, conceded some ground to the pacesetter racing through the backstretch,
switched out on the far turn steadily advancing on the pacesetter, took over racing into upper stretch and just held VICTIM under pressure. The latter was
rated off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn, split foes entering the lane, then shifted out three widewhile
steadily closing the gap on the winner to the end. GREATEST GAL tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing
into the far turn and continued with interest inside foes to prevail for a share. SUMMER LOVIN reared at the start, switched outside rivals racing into the
backstretch, raced four wide through the far turn to the lane and had no rally. WHO'S FOOLING WHO, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the
pacesetter to the backstretch, faded into the stretch. CHICLE SPARKS, rank under restraint while prompted between foes disputing the pace into the
backstretch, moved away to a brief lead nearing the far turn but gave way once headed by the winner. DRANE FAME dropped out early.

Footnotes
WHATA PERFECT DAY, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled in racing into the first turn to track off the first flight between foes to the backstretch,
was prompted to split foes nearing the lane, shifted out three wide and continued with a steady late bid to wrest the advantage under firm handling. MARK
IN GREELEY, in touch from the outset prompting the pacesetter between foes, pressed the issue into the lane to gain a narrow advantage between calls
late, resisted the winner's challenge but came up second best. CINTAROSA RANCH, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin to the second bend, dueled for command on the far turn into the lane but yielded to the top pair late. SEMI CHARMED DAY, caught four wide racing
to the first turn, was rated outside foes tracking the leaders in second flight racing three deep to the second bend and continued evenly between foes late.
THEMANLOOK, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace, lodged a brief bid in that path racing into the far turn but soon flattened out. TRADIN UP
angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, was steadied avoiding tight quarters entering the first turn, continued along the inside but never
gained contention. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY angled to the inside in early stages to stalk just off the first flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded into the
stretch. WILD TONIGHT settled last in the opening stages, was taken up avoiding traffic racing into the first turn and never menaced thereafter.
