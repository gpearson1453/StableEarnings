Footnotes
FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN dueled from the inside early, gained a clear margin through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and held sway. SAY
WHEN stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when asked but could not reach the winner. CRYPTOZONIC
forced the early pace inside, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. NOT FADE AWAY pressed the early pace inside but came up empty in
the drive. CHARMING BULLET was no factor. RICH ICON dueled from the outside and tired. POCHO'S DREAM was never close. DONNA'S COUNCIL
showed little.
