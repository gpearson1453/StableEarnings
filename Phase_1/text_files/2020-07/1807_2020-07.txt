NOVELLA was unhurried for a half mile, rallied four wide on the second turn, pushed away to mid stretch and held driving. MOON ROCKET set the pace to
the half, dueled inside two others on the second turn then was outrun to mid stretch but held the place. SENORITA COMETA was outsprinted early, settled
on the backstretch, came three wide to the stretch but could not impact the top two. MOONSHINE ANNIE pressed the pace to the half, bid three wide
between rivals on the second turn to loom a threat but was outrun to mid stretch and tired. IT'S BIG AINE was never a threat.

Footnotes
TUSCAN WARRIOR chased the pace to the turn in the four path, was forced out seven wide by ROB'S GOT GAME into the stretch, rallied when set down
and closed resolutely to win going away. ROMAN ROCKET had no speed, settled to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch then got outfinished for the win
but caught SIERRA DANCE for second. SIERRA DANCE was also chasing to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, edged to the front in mid stretch but was
tiring in the late stages. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE pressed the pace three wide, drifted five wide on the turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty.
SURE PROOF had no speed and was not a factor. ROB'S GOT GAME had the best speed, set the pace in the four path to the turn but lugged out six wide
carrying the winner out with him into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

JASMINE CHIEFTAIN had good speed, set the pace in the three path to the stretch then kicked away to mid stretch under one swat with the whip and
cruised home. LAWYER PROOF pressed the winner four wide to the stretch, could not keep up to mid stretch but saved the place. ALWAYS FOR MONEY
had no speed then circled five wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. NOVA STAR broke a bit slow, trailed to the turn, was four wide to
the stretch then came up empty. BIG WISH was chasing the winner to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch but also did not rally. SERENITY
NOW had speed inside rivals to the turn then was outrun on the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MURALIST was bumped by TUNE TO WIN at the start then pinballed back into that one, pressed the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch,
got on terms with BRONZE WARRIOR in mid stretch, dug in determinedly and finally shook loose in the final hundred yards. BRONZE WARRIOR broke in,
knocked into TUNE TO WIN then was bumped by that one on the rebound, pushed to the front, set the pace to the second turn, responded when hooked
into the stretch, battled gamely to deep stretch but finally gave in late. CIMPL MAN tracked the leader to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch then
got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. UNLAWFUL ACT stalked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide but was outkicked to mid stretch and
weakened late. MR. MAGICO had no speed, trailed while four wide on the second turn and did not rally. TUNE TO WIN was knocked hard by BRONZE
WARRIOR into MURALIST then bumped on the rebound by that one into BRONZE WARRIOR, took up and had no speed, settled to the second turn, was
two wide to the stretch then gave way in the final furlong. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but although they did concede some
bumping, it was determined that the incident did not cost TUNE TO WIN a better placing.
