Footnotes
OLE WATASHI broke in front, set all the pace along the inside and finished full of run under strong handling to win going away. MACADOOOO KID stalked
the pace three wide, drifted in near the seven sixteenths pole bumping MOBIL MAGIC repeatedly, chased the winner the balance of the trip and just held on
for second. MOBIL MAGIC pressed the early pace two wide, was bumped repeatedly by the runner up approaching the turn causing his rider to check,
dropped back on the turn then came on again late in the five path to just miss getting up for second. SOMETHING SACRED vied for the lead near the
inside, lacked room nearing the turn then went evenly. BELTON AVE bumped at the start, trailed for a half then found his best stride late.
BRILLIANTBENNY was fractious in the gate prior to the start, bumped and checked leaving the gate and failed to menace. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN had speed
into the turn then gave way. B WHYOH B broke outward bumping BRILLIANTBENNY then was outrun. KISS ME COWGIRL also fractious in the gate, was
through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED MACADOOOO KID FOR INTERFERENCE
AGAINST MOBIL MAGIC ENTERING THE TURN AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

IT'S YOUR CALL chased the pace two wide down the backstretch, inherited the lead two wide before a half, shook clear under right handed urging through
the stretch and won in hand. TAPAWAY never far back, rallied in the four path through deep stretch and finished clear for second. TAPSHOT hopped at the
start, was outrun early and finished with food courage in the five path. IT'S A MANS WORLD chased the pace three wide into the stretch then faded GIFT

outrun. TROMBONE EASTON broke slowly and was through early.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO away alertly, dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, shook clear, shied inward near the furlong marker and won under brisk
handling. ROLLIN WAY OVER unhurried early, rallied late in the five path and finished second best while lugging in. ROYAL'D hopped at the start, was
never far back, loomed boldly three wide mid turn then failed to sustain that bid. CHARLEE'S MAGIC well placed, went evenly. BLACKTIEANDTUX failed to
menace. LUNAR HEAT broke in front, battled with the winner two wide into the turn then faded. COINCIDENTALLY trailed.

slow early, closed with a burst of speed in the five path through the stretch. ARCHIPELAGO dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch and faded late.
LABYRINTH slow early, found his best stride late near mid track. PIAZZA DEL CAMPO bumped at the start then failed to menace. NANTAN had speed into
the turn then faded. SKYTOWN CAT was through early. EXCLUSIVE DONALD was hustled up the inside to duel for the lead into the turn then used up.

Footnotes
DIVA POWER pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead before the quarter pole in hand, set the balance of the pace and won going away
under mild urging. NORTHERN JOURNEY was bumped at the start, moved up three wide into the stretch and finished second best. ENDURING LOVE
allowed to settle, finished with good courage in the five path through the stretch. LEXY ANNA broke in front, set the pace along the inside past mid rturn
then was outfinished. SO GO MY LUCEILLE passed tiring rivals. CATABOUT was no factor. A FABULOUS KISS settled mid pack then lacked the needed
response. REAL FANCY stalked the pace from the inside into the turn then weakened. PINK HALDER reluctant to load, was outrun. STAR OF PRIDE was
no factor. PEGASUS CROSS stumbled outward bumping NORTHERN JOURNEY at the start then trailed.

Footnotes
BOW TIES N BOURBON dueled for the lead outside in the four path, drifted to the six path while making the lead past the furlong marker and shook clear
late under brisk handling. LITTLE BITA SMOKE with the second flight, rallied in the eight path through deep stretch and got up for second. JUST CHESTER
dueled with the winner along the inside and was outfinished in the final stages. DOUGS MORNING PICK was fractious in the gate then went evenly.
BLISTERING PAKSHI close up inside, faded. PATH OF GLORY passed tiring rivals. HE'S A MOMMA'S BOY was no threat. MA MOO POWER was no
factor. BOLD CHASE was through early.
