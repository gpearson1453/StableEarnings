Footnotes
TWOBITSARIDE engaged in close chase through the backstretch and dueled for the lead nearing the quarter pole, drifted a bit in the upper stretch but dug
in under steady handling to hold on well. BARN YARD BRAT chased the pace outside, raced four wide on the turn and dug in through the stretch to take the
nod for second at the wire. HENRY STANDINGBEAR chased the pace off the rail but was boxed in toward the quarter pole, angled slightly out on the turn
and dug in down the lane but gave up the nod for second under the wire. REDOUBTABLE set a pressured pace but was caught nearing the quarter pole,
continued close through the turn and upper stretch then weakened the final sixteenth. SALERNO pressured the pace then steadied lightly nearing the
quarter pole, angled to the six path on the turn, though, showed little more. KING DEREK dropped well back.

Footnotes
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE raced well off the early pace about the four path then started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, improved four wide on the far
turn, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in to take the lead later yards. BUSTED HALO stalked the early pace off the rail then closed to the lead leaving the
three eighths pole, was pressured for more toward the quarter, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but gave up the lead later yards and dug in to
retain second. MELDON rated off the pace in the three path, bid past the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn three wide, then outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. WINNING SCHOLAR raced off the pace about the three path then gave chase from the three eighths pole and finished evenly.
ALLEN JR. saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly. WHERE'S THE LIME raced
well off the pace and was never a factor. SUAVE JUAN tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole but was
caught past the pole and faded readily at the rail rounding the far turn.

out on the far turn and briefly ceded the edge to Oracle Of Omaha, however, dug in when straightened away to recover the lead mid-stretch and was
drawing off later yards. START FROM SCRATCH saved ground off the pace the opening turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, exchanged contact
with Oracle Of Omaha mid-stretch then dueled clear of that one in the final yards. ORACLE OF OMAHA angled to the inside and rated a slim lead but was
met at even terms past the nine sixteenths pole, ceded the edge to the winner past the five sixteenths then exchanged contact with Start From Scratch
mid-stretch and yielded to that one as well. SAMADI BLUE raced well back from early contention then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn in the four and five paths but showed little more. DANZ A REBEL settled off the early pace in the three and four paths then picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail then weakened. BRILLIANT BOLT was not a factor. BURREN ROCKS saved ground off the
pace then gave way after a half mile.

SCOTTISH MAN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter,
widened through the far turn and was steadily handled to later yards before relaxing a bit. JUST A LIL LUKEY raced well off the pace in the two and three
paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, though had to settle for second. FRATHOUSE MUSIC stalked the early pace from the three path then took the
lead approaching the three quarter pole, widened into the backstretch, came under pressure at the three eighths pole but was caught toward the quarter and
faded on the far turn. CASTLEFINN saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch then bid only mildly and came through the far turn about the four
path. WISPER FREEDOM rated the early pace inside but was caught nearing the three quarter pole, gave chase from there then faded on the far turn.
CAPITAL ASSET stalked the early pace four wide, showed little response through the backstretch and faded on the far turn. WOODBURN HALL stalked the
earlier pace off the rail but dropped back into the second turn and showed little more. JOEY GOTCHA saved ground.

Footnotes
SCOTTISH DENIS stalked the pace inside but lacked room at the rail most of the backstretch, came through the far turn still at the rail, dug in for the lead in
later yards and was inching ahead approaching the wire. VINTAGE GIN rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was
steadily encouraged leaving the turn, reluctantly ceded to the winner in later yards then just lasted for place. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW stalked the early
pace off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole, was closing late and just missed second. MO CUISHLE rated close in the three and four paths,
bid toward the three eighths pole and came through the far turn three wide then finished evenly. IM A TRICKY ONE raced off the early pace in the three
path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished evenly.
UAINTSEENMECRAZYET raced well back early on then showed only mild response down the backstretch. CHARITABLE ROSE settled off the pace in the
three and four paths then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little more. LADY'S CORK
rounded the opening turn about the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole but flattened stride on the far turn.

Footnotes
A FOOLISH SMILE raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole
and improved in the three path of the far turn, dueled for the lead mid-stretch and was drawing away through later yards. MAN OF CHROME moved to the
inside with the early lead but let Prospect Toy take over toward the nine sixteenths pole, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and recovered
control two deep midway on the far turn, but, was caught mid-stretch and had to settle for second best. UNBELIEVABLE STORY saved ground off the early
pace then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn then dueled for third mid-stretch. VILLAGE PRINCE raced just off the
early pace in the three and four paths then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and relented
third mid-stretch. OULOG raced well off the pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. IN AWE AGAIN settled off the
pace in the five path the first turn then bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn at the rail, though, flattened stride leaving the turn.
PROSPECT TOY stalked the early pace off the rail then took the lead toward the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure nearing the three eighths but
was caught at the rail midway on the far turn and gave way into the lane. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY became a bit edgy in the gate then settled just off the
pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded toward the far turn. LIAR steadied attempting to bear out into the first turn
then raced inside through the turn, showed no response from the half mile pole, was pulled up toward the five sixteenths and walked off.
