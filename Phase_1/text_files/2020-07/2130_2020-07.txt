Footnotes
BIG LEMON ran on the rail right off the leader, got by in upper stretch and continued to hold another game foe at bay while swerving a bit down the stretch.
GIOVANTE tracked to the far turn, was urged to catch the leader on the far turn from the three path, was rebuffed by the winner but gave game chase to the
wire while continuing to pose a threat. CIRCLE AWAY trailed at the rail early, was urged on in the four path on the turn, got closer to the leaders but couldn't
keep up down the stretch while keeping show safe. STAR DOG was bumped at the start, unhurried to the far turr, urged for more and improved position
late. EMPEROR'S GOLD was bumped at the start, led off the rail after clearing the field on the first turn, raced between horses on the far turn and leveled
out in upper stretch. PLAIN TALES went in the four path on the first turn, raced reserved, had some rally on the far turn, but not enough while drifting out
widest in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRES EQUIS waited near the rear, made a quick middle move on the far turn, got by the leaders mid stretch and drew away. OVERZEALOUS was a
reserved fourth up the backstretch off the raIl, angled in on the rail down the stretch and gained the place. BOLD PROPHET had a rail lead, was pushed for
more on the far turn, lost the lead but dug in to hold third. JERRID brushed a horse at the start, tracked from tihrd, came widest in the stretch and lost the
show spot late. MACHA'S REWARD raced well back, took the rail on the far turn and lacked the needed rally late. MARK MY WAY brushed a horse at the
start, chased from second, but faltered at the eighth pole. ACCOUSTICAL was at the rear, raced a bit erratic on the backstretch and was no real threat.

evenly. CRYPTO'S TWIN MILL was always back but gained position in the stretch. SHES MIGHTY FINE dueled for the lead from inside and tired at the

CACKI chased the leader on the turn, moved by readily, and widened under a hand ride. MYSTIC MAGIC broke awkwardly, swerved, and was bothered by
a horse at the start, ran unhurried toward the back, then gamely passed horses on the turn and down the stretch to wind up second best. CARIBBEAN SKY
raced mid pack and improved position down the stretch. ALEXIS ROAD WEST tracked from off the lead and lost position in the stretch. LOVE YOU
GOODBYE rushed up to lead inside and tired in the lane. ATLANTIS ROSE was never close up and galloped past the wire. BROADWAY MEDLEY was
bumped at the start and no threat.

Footnotes
MY PINK BABY BIRD was bumped at the start, chased a very clear leader, cut into the margin on the turn and ran down that foe who was shortening strides
late. COUNTRY MOON sprinted to a large lead, shortened stride nearing the wire and was run down late to lose the win. PAIG'S SONG raced widest on the
backstretch, took the four path on the turn and passed faders in the stretch. FLEETWOOD GRADUATE chased a big lead inside on the turn, then tired in
the stretch. MERRIE GOGO chased a large lead in the three path and tired in the stretch. MADICHASINGDREAMS made no impact. GETAWAY'S GIFT
was bumped at the start, saved ground on the turn and tired in the stretch.
