Footnotes
SPOTTED BULL set a clear pace along the rail, held clear past the eighth pole, drifted out left-handed urging and bumped WARLOCK DOC in late stretch
and just lasted. WARLOCK DOC advanced outside down the backstretch, stalked the pace two wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane,
slowly gained through the stretch, was bumped late and just missed. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY lacked early speed despite urging from the gate, raced three
wide around the turn and rallied for the show. REBEL POSSE was shut off at the start, dropped well back, raced three wide around the turn and passed
tiring rivals. TEXAN BOY chased the early pace two and three wide between foes and faded. LUCKY RED PEPPER was bumped at the start then saved
ground to no avail. RESOLVE NOW saved ground off the pace, lacked room near the eighth pole and lacked a rally once clear. NAUTICAL MOON was
pinched back at the start, raced well back two wide and never threatened. PARTY OF FIFTEEN played no factor while racing four wide. SON OF
PREACHERMAN was outrun inside. TWO STATE broke outwardly, had early speed two wide then retreated inside. RED LIAISON veered in at the start,
raced four wide and was outrun. Following an objection from the rider of WARLOCK DOC, SPOTTED BULL disqualified from first and place second for
interference in deep stretch.

XINGFU settled off the early pace inside, advanced inside around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, closed two wide, seized command near the
sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive. INGLENOOK settled in midpack while racing two wide, went three wide around the far turn, rallied outside and
was up for the place in deep stretch. BATTLESHIP MARY set the pace along the rail, kicked clear around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole and lost
second in the final strides. LINDA DIANE was reluctant to load, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, angled to rail midway down the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and rallied belatedly inside of foes. MY MONEY HONEY was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace,
steadied midway down the backstretch, continued to save ground rounding the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and had a mild rally outside. FIKA
stalked the pace two wide and came up empty. FUNNY FLOWERS was bumped at the start, steadied early, raced two wide and never threatened.
SENORITA TAPIT hit the starting gate, raced three and four wide and played no factor. WICKED CONNECTION was off slow and outrun while racing three
wide.

was along for the show. WITH THE BAND was in tight at the start, saved ground and improved position in the lane. IMA REAL DEAL failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. PAW'S SALTY PEPPER dueled two wide to upper stretch and weakened. MY TEXAS CHROME vied inside early and tired.
WHERE'S RUFUS played no factor while racing two wide. THRIFT SHOP was outrun while racing four wide.

TRUE CASTLE stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch, advanced three wide around the turn, seized command nearing the lane, drew clear in
upper stretch and held sway under a drive. WISHFUL QUALITY tracked the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide near the quarter pole and
finished willingly to narrow the gap. ELUSIVE ROSE lacked early speed, raced four and five wide and rallied widest to gain the show late. RIZZI'S HONORS
stalked the pace three wide between foes and lacked a closing bid. SHAHARAZAD never treated while racing two and three wide. KASSERINE PASS
played no factor while racing three and four wide. MISS KITTY MAE set the pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. IT'S MY MONEY chased the
pace inside and tired in the drive.

ZAMZAM settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up on the wire. AMANDREA stalked the duel three
wide, bid between foes near the quarter pole, took the lead in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and just missed in a game try. LOVE ON TIDES
stalked the pace from the rail, got through smoothly inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, bid in midstretch, dueled inside of foes, led late and lost the
bob twice. CYPRESS POINT dueled along the rail to upper stretch, drifted out a bit turning for home, battled on between foes to the sixteenth pole, was
losing ground to multiple rivals when put in tight and forced to check in very deep stretch. OKIE QUEEN was off slow, settled off the pace two wide, bid four
wide nearing the lane then flattened out. QUINN MURPHY was outrun inside. LEATHER AND LACE played no factor while racing three wide. HAWAIIAN
TYPHOON dueled two wide and tired in the lane. There was an inquiry and an objection from the rider of CYPRESS POINT against AMANDREA for alleged
interference in deep stretch but the Stewards allowed the original order of finish to stand.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE WOMAN was away alertly, set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging in the lane and held sway. SWEET LINDA
broke awkwardly, advanced outside down the backstretch, stalked two wide around the turn, was late to switch leads in the lane, kept plugging away but
was unable to seriously gain on the winner. GIDGET chased the pace inside and was one-paced in the lane. GEH MYTHICALQUEEN chased the pace two
wide and lacked a rally. WANNA BE IRISH was off very slow, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. DAVID'S DREAM GIRL never threatened while racing
two wide. WIMBLEDON'S GOLD had early speed between foes, steadied while appearing to try to get out nearing the turn and retreated four wide. LOST
GIFT was outrun inside. VELVET CHAINS trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
THREE EYED RAVEN broke a bit slowly, advanced outside down the backstretch, continued to gain three and four wide around the far turn, slowly gained
outside of the pacesetter through the stretch and was up on the wire. CROW MOUNTAIN quickly sped clear, set the pace along the rail, continued on the
left lead through the lane, drifted out a bit late and led until the final stride. HECOULDGOALLTHEWAY stalked the pace two wide, bid between rivals
nearing the lane but was outfinished. MIDNIGHT REVOLT tracked the pace from the rail and was one-paced in the lane. BEAU GOSSE failed to menace
while racing three wide. DELIRIUM had early speed three wide and faded around the turn. SHAKE IT clipped heels soon after the start, lagged well back
inside, tipped out in upper stretch and never threatened. PAINTINTHELINES was outrun inside. AMIRITE came out early had his heels clipped behind,
raced three wide and never factored.
