Footnotes
TIZ THE TIME dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear advantage at the eighth pole and
steadily drew clear. CHERRY TWIST up close early from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but was no match for the winner while
clearly second best. EMMA'S GIFT chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, responded along the rail entering the drive and
rallied late for the show. OUR DIAMOND outrun early, advanced outside, made a bid but was too late. UNTETHERED SOUL was no real factor.
ROCKIN'ROUXS BEST was never a threat. DIXIELAND FLASH dueled from the outside and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
BLANCO BRONCO stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded when asked to duel through the drive
and was just up the final strides. RACIN ROCKS unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded entering the drive,
dueled with the winner through the drive, drifted out mid stretch bothering CHARMING BULLET and was outfinished for the win. After a Stewards' Inquiry
and Jockey's Objection RACIN ROCKS was disqualified for interference in the strertch. CHARMING BULLET chased the early pace from the inside, inched
closer entering the second turn, altered outside for the drive, responded, was bothered mid stretch when RACIN ROCKS drifted out then was outfinished for
the place. TROPHY DADDY was off slow and could only improve position. ZYZACK dueled from the inside and faded. RICH ICON dueled from between
foes and tired. CHROMED HEART dueled from the outside and gave way. One mile split time unavailable duel to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN CHARLIE broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole
and was much the best while under steady urging. SENT'S GALAXY chased the early pace from the outside, remained forward for the drive but was no
match while clearly second best. LUCKY STREAKER pressed the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the turn and rallied late for the show.
ZOLTAR forced the early pace from the outside but came up empty in the drive. KISS YOUR BRIDE was never a factor. SUDDENLY hopped at the start,
stumbled to his knees and was outrun.
