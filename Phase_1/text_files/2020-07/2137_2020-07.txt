GIANT MARK had the best speed and was in front three wide to the backstretch, eased over and saved ground to the stretch then dug in stubbornly to hold
THORN HILL CAT safe. THORN HILL CAT pressed the winner throughout, was two then three wide to the stretch, drifted out to mid stretch and was
outfinished. KID ARCADE had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but was not a threat to the top two. THE REF was
outsprinted to the backstretch while four wide, settled to the second turn then saved ground but was not a factor. TYPHOON HARRY stalked the top two
three wide to the stretch then weakened. IF I HAD A NICKEL was settled to the half, raced off the rail to the stretch then tired.

Footnotes
T BONES TRICK pressed the pace to the backstretch then pushed up to engage for the lead, dueled two wide to the stretch then responded determinedly
and held. OASIS was chasing to the second turn, raced off the rail to the stretch then could not impact the winner while besting the others. HULA KING
pressed the pace three wide, drifted to the four path into the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. WORLD O LUCK had no speed,
settled for a half mile, shifted off the rail and was two wide into the stretch but could only pick off rivals in the drive. LUCK IS MY NAME was allowed to
settle, raced two then three wide on the second turn, swung out widest for the drive but did not rally. SOUTH RIM settled mid pack to the second turn, came
three wide to the stretch but also lacked a closing response. IRISH OUTLAW was a pace factor for six furlongs from the rail but tired in the stretch.
MULZOFF had no speed, was four wide throughout and never a factor.

Footnotes
NOVA STAR never far away to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then responded when set down, took over leaving mid stretch and held HOUSE OF
TARGARYEN safe. HOUSE OF TARGARYEN had no speed, was two wide to the stretch then shifted out and was closing steadily but too late. BIG WISH
was chasing the leaders to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied to loom a threat inside rivals then was outfinished. SNOOZY SUZY set the pace
and eased over, was two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch but was tiring in the late stages. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA pressed the leader from the
rail to the stretch then gave way. SCARLET IRIS had no speed and was not a factor. THE HENRIETTA gave a dull effort.

Footnotes
GABO'S MACONDO never far back to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, got to terms in mid stretch then edged clear driving. UPO pressed
the pace to the second turn, rallied to get on terms two wide to the stretch, battled to mid stretch then was outkicked but saved second. TOUGH IT OUT
settled mid pack to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) set the pace from the
rail to the second turn then was overtaken in mid stretch and weakened. UBER STAR was outrun to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then
could not make an impact in the drive. NOWHERE MAN was also void of speed, was three wide to the stretch and also did not rally.

Footnotes
BREAKING THE CODE was outrun to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, collared BEE EINSTEIN leaving mid stretch and held
driving. TIBBY GEE had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch, swung out widest for the drive and closed steadily. BEE EINSTEIN chased the
leaders to the turn, bid three wide to get to terms into the stretch, led to mid stretch then was overtaken and missed second. SENORITA ESTRELLA
attended the pace two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was outsprinted early, saved ground on the
turn then closed a minor gap in the final furlong. FINAL DEMAND broke a bit slow then was hurried along inside rivals to contest the pace, dueled from the
rail to the stretch then tired. WINE PROOF chased the leaders two wide to the stretch then weakened. BLUEGRASS RUN was very green, trailed to the
stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
AIGLE checked when crowded by MAGIC RATE in the early stages, settled to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied to engage the leaders
in mid stretch and drove clear. ARCH ANTHEM was also allowed to settle for a half mile, raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly without
menacing the winner to gamely get the place. ALLEYCAT also was unhurried to the half, saved ground on the second turn then was picking off rivals in the
drive and tied MAD AT MONEY for the show. MAD AT MONEY had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then got outkicked by
the winner but finished willingly late to deadheat for third. MAGIC RATE tracked the pace to the half, was three wide and rallied to get on terms into the
stretch, dueled to mid stretch then finished evenly and was passed by rivals late. FORT MCHENRY hustled to the front, set the pace from the rail for six
furlongs, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. WAR WATCH pressed the leader to the second turn, made his best bid two wide to the stretch but also tired in
the drive. STONE GROOVE checked inside rivals on the first turn, tracked the pace from the rail for a half mile then saved ground to the stretch but gave
way.
