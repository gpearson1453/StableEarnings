Footnotes
BLUE RIDGE HEAT broke alertly, dueled out of the chute closest to the inside, shook off that foe after a quarter, well clear turn, continued to draw out
through the lane while being kept to task. CAJUN SHOTS lacked early foot, improved through traffic in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive,
edging away for the place. TOSHITA FOREVER back off the pace well out in the strip, raced four wide when improving along with the runner up outside that
one late in the turn, long drive for the second spot, outfinished for that position, clear of the others. NONCHALANTLY settled in mid pack early off the pace,
continued one paced in lacking a closing response. FLASH MEDIA last away, continued back, came five wide out of the turn, improved slightly while never a
serious threat. MY GIRL EM moved after the start, chased the two leaders through the turn, had little left for the drive. QUEEZER unruly prior to the start,
away in good order, raced closest to the winner for five furlongs and gave way. HONEST ROAD finished early, far back.

Footnotes
MISS NEKO away in good order, raced unhurried early, moved closer in some traffic second turn, split foes into the lane, took over when straightened for
home, drew well clear under steady handling. DUEPEG settled in mid pack off the inside, came four wide while being asked turning for home, up late for the
place, no threat to the winner. GUEST APPEARANCE lacked early foot, saved some ground, asked along in the second turn, closest to the winner late,
nipped in the final strides for the place. CASUAL COOL broke back, moved up to duel into the first turn, cleared onto the backstretch, showed the way into
and through the final turn, began to weaken when headed by the winner in upper straight. OLIVIA'S DUCHESS dueled early, chased the middle half mile off
the inside, had little left for the stretch run. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER forwardly placed for a half just off the inside, began to fade after a half. BLONDIE LOX
BABE fell back to trail after the start, showed little.

Footnotes
ABLE CATCH broke with the leaders, allowed speed to go out of the chute, moved out slightly and collared that rival into the turn, clear by late in the bend,
held the runner up comfortably at bay through the stretch while under steady handling. STREETTALKINHOTTIE forwardly placed off the inside, moved
closer to the winner on the outside turning for home, could not get to that one late, clearly second best. FLASH ANNIE raced back off the pace, improved a
bit in the two path turning for home, finished up best of the rest. BREEZIN BYE YOU moved out to be in the three path up the backstretch, continued three
wide through the turn, went one paced through the stretch in lacking a closing punch. TOGAROCK settled off the pace, also came up empty for the drive.
AUNT JANA broke toward the front, fell back afterward, was four wide through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals through the stretch while not
posing a serious threat. PARTY TWIST remained always back. SHADESOFGRAYMISS broke sharp, showed the way out of the chute, continued to show
the way up the backstretch, stopped when headed by the winner early in the turn.

Footnotes
HALF AGAIN broke well, narrowly set the pace along the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire while being kept to
pressure. PICKETT track the lead pack while off the inside, three wide into the turn, dropped toward the inside for the drive, followed the winner to the wire,
clearly second best. SHARP WITTED with the pace in the two path and between rivals, fell back a bit late in the turn, could do little with the top two through
the stretch,s aved the show. GRACIDA last away, completely devoid of any early foot, swung out to be six wide when beginning to advance exiting the turn,
showed some belated interest while remaining well out in the strip. BUCKETS broke with the field, pressed the issue while four wide up the backstretch, vied
four wide through the turn, faltered in the drive. FLASH ME BACK lacked early foot, failed to produce a response when called on for the drive. MR
MAKEITHAPPEN remained back while four wide late in the turn. AW ITE with the pace while three wide and between horses until turning for home, gave
way in the drive.

Footnotes
PILLAGE DA VILLAGE broke well to race close from the start off the inside, pressed the issue from the outside through the turn, took command when
straightened for home, shook well clear under a firm hand ride. GOLDEN V C off bit slow, outrun early along the inside, asked along far turn, steered out
three wide exiting the turn, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no match for the winner. LUCKY BIG DADDY lacked early foot, came four wide into the
straight, improved position through traffic, nod for the show. DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE raced in mid pack early off the inside, carried extremely wide by a foe
who was bearing out midway on the turn, was six wide in recovering entering the straight, improved while left with too much to do. FLASHBURN went one
paced throughout while racing toward the inside, lacked closing kick. DESIARD chased the issue up front for three furlongs then weakened in the drive.
NINE SHOTS broke well, sprinted clear soon after, vied through the turn inside the winner, gave way when headed by that one in upper straight. BLACK
HILLS BANDIT fell back quickly after the start, remained sluggish throughout and was never close. THE ROCKS CRY OUT forwardly placed early while just
off the inside, bore out through the turn, outside rail into the stretch, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
SKEETER void of speed for six furlongs, asked along off the inside late in the final turn, shifted out to be widest past the furlong marker, finished with good
energy to win going away while remaining far out in the strip. MISS KATNISS broke on top, shook clear after a half, gained a larger advantage into the
stretch after shaking off a foe, proved no match for the winner when confronted by that one inside the furlong grounds, remained well clear of the sothers.
LIL ALLIE DANCER in mid pack early off the inside, moved closer with a middle move after a half, lodged brief bid turning for home, flattened out in the
drive, enough left to last for the show. GLORIETA pressed the runnerup early off the inside, chased in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, had
little left for the stretch run. LA REINA ISABEL within striking distance early, fell back before a half, went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing response.
STUMBERG broke back, lacked speed, was five wide out of the final turn, failed to muster a rally. PRINCESS ARWEN broke slowly and was never a factor.
YANKEE'S FANNY finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MOM SAID YES in a bit tight just after the start, lacked early foot while racing off the inside, continued back the middle half, roused and moved out five wide
turning for home, rallied well out in the course, late bid, just up. BOLD THIRST four wide through the first turn when off the pace, moved closer while again
four wide in the second turn, bid approaching midstretch, led late, just failed to contain the winner, clear of the others. OH MY ACHING ARCH within striking
distance just off the inside, advanced and challenged between rivals past the furlong marker, outkicked by the top two late while racing inside that pair at the
wire. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE settled in the second flight out in the course, stalked three wide in the run up the backstretch, advanced and challenged into
the stretch, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker but could not last. HE'S A LUCKY MAN last early foot, improved position slightly while not
posing a serious threat. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE chased the early leader, moved up to duel before a half, weakened in the drive. ATTA BOUY last away,
remained always back. JAZZ IT UP broke on top, got clear early, dueled the middle part closet to the inside then stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN BEAUTY broke with the leaders, headed up the second flight in the three path up the backstretch and into the turn, asked along and advanced
on the leaders turning for home, steadily drew clear under a brisk hand ride. MATT'S PRIDE broke out, brushed, settled off the pace and the inside,
emerged from between foes exiting the turn, finished willingly to be in time for the place, no threat to the winner. STORIED TRIP broke in, bumped foe,
trailed much of the way, passed tiring rivals without posing a serious threat. LUCKY ARTIE alternated up front in the run up the backstretch and through the
turn, weakened in the drive. SWEET PRAYERS broke on top, dueled up front off the inside for just over three furlongs and also faltered when the real
running began at the head of the lane. RACIN PRAYER in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire. ORETTA
made little impact to be never a threat. IRISH PRIORITY pinched back at the start, remained back in lacking a closing response. MISS LOVEINSKY raced in
the second flight for three furlongs then backed up. GABY'S PROMISE broke back and was well beaten throughout.

Footnotes
LION RAMPANT with the pace from the start, dueled through the turn in the two path, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, enough left
to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. CHIMNEYVILLE off slowly, raced well back early as a result, swung out to be six wide when rallying into the
lane, closed well to be getting to the winner late. JAZZ MUSIC moved up just after the start to duel inside, continued to alternate for the advantage into and
through the turn, could not match the top two in the drive, saved the show. FLAT OUT LOVE in the second flight early, moved closer in the three path late in
the turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive to finish up evenly. DISTINCT QUALITY back off the early pace and the inside, ranged up closer five wide
late in the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive to finish up one paced. FLASH DANCERLUCK vied early while between horses, fell back early in the turn,
went evenly to the wire while saving ground the rest of the way. WHISTLING WIND in the main body off the in side, in some traffic through the turn, finished
up evenly in lacking a serious closing kick. I'LL RAISE YOU broke in, bothered foe, lacked speed, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, waited while
four wide into the lane, displayed some mild late interest when clear late. MAJESTIC HERO within striking distance early outside, four wide through the turn,
came up empty for the drive. HALOS PRAYER toward the front while racing along the inside, steadied, shuffled back in traffic into the turn, did not recover.
ICE CRUSH pinched back at the start, remained back in failing to threaten. LITTLE RED KID broke out, bumped foe, was finished early, trailed home.
