stretch hitting traffic a sixteenth out angling down to the rail late. PURE SUGAR stalked the pace getting a trip through the far turn angling six wide in upper
stretch going outside of rivals late needing a burst. PEGGY N JUDY slow early saved ground to upper stretch responding to finish well along the rail.

GREAT PLAN well rated saved ground advancing from the quarter pole surging clear along the rail in upper stretch holding firm late. LOYALTY SPIRIT
gave a prompted middle move chasing through the far turn being overpowered from the inside in upper stretch holding well in the four path to salvage place.
STARLING'S LAW sent clear set the pace holding to daylight through the far turn, ceded in upper stretch weakening under a drive in the three path.
JOYEUX slow early gave a mild rally on the far turn racing evenly from the two path down the lane. BLACK CIRCLE lagged through the far turn circling to
mid track in upper stretch picking up tired ones there. THORNADO slow early angled six wide in upper stretch posing no menace. FIVE GREEN STARS
was bumped and steadied at the break. UNCLE DAVE raced mid pack tiring to upper stretch. PLEASANT OUTLOOK stalked the early pace giving way on
the far turn. Due to a timer malfunction the mile split was unavailable.

SHARPIN away alertly set the pace through the turn widening in upper stretch angling out to win going away. BLUEGRASS CANDY chased the pace to
upper stretch proving no match there angling in from the four path late a clear second best. COLLEENS STORM slow early mustered a mild rally in the four
path down the lane to best the others. FUNNY SLAM faded on the turn. ROMAN AROUND gave hard pursuit through the turn then folded in upper stretch.
HERETOPLAY flashed early speed then gave way on the turn. LOW TIRE fractious pre start would break late hitting the side of the gate on the way out.

Footnotes
EVERGLIDE DRIVE pressed the pace chasing through the turn into upper stretch rallying up late in the three path. ROUXHERE pressed the pace edging
clear on the turn cutting the corner to widen in upper stretch faltering late along the rail. I'M MACHEN TOO bobbled then bumped at the break, rushed
outside on the turn came four wide in upper stretch bidding gamely late. ZEEKA hustled off the pace raced evenly to upper stretch gaining and holding
position there. LIL HABANERO chased through the turn extending three wide in upper stretch weakening late. HANDSOME SWEDE slow early played no
factor. MAGIC SPARKLE chased early then faded from the quarter pole. RED ANGRY BIRD bobbled then bumped at the break, rushed early would give
way on the turn.
