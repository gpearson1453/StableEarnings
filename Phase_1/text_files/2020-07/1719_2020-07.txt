Footnotes
CHRISATUDE pursued between foes, bid on the turn and drew away through the stretch under moderate pressure. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE hustled to the
front inside, was collared at the quarter pole and proved no match for the winner. TIZANOXBOW chased three wide throughout and flattened out in the
stretch. ACERE saved ground off the pace and began retreating on the turn. ANOTHER SMARTY raced wide and weakened steadily. KING VICTORIA
dropped back after a sluggish start and trailed all the way.

Footnotes
SWEET BLAME saved ground, gained the lead on the far turn, regained the lead leaving furlong grounds while drifting out and got the nod. MIJA BELLA,
four wide and just off the pace, stuck her head in front near furlong grounds, also drifted out and gave way grudgingly. DISCREET CATHY stalked three
wide, was between rivals after a half and then faded. DEREYA, fractious in the gate, steadied rounding the first turn and again entering the backstretch,
eased out wide then tired. DRIVEN BY SPEED set the early pace in the three path and dropped back. ROSE OF DUBLIN stumbled leaving the gate, raced
wide and was no factor. IRON LILLY, between rivals early, angled wide and tired.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF SCHMOOZE quickly took control, widened in hand on the turn and was never threatened under mild coaxing. BON HEIR lacked speed,
advanced near the inside on the turn and was no match for her entrymate. TO THE FLAG raced along the inside to the stretch, angled out and continued
willingly. DANCIN DEBBIE chased three wide throughout and raced evenly through the lane. I'M THIRSTY hustled close up four wide early and weakened
on the turn. LUNA AZTECA dropped back between foes in the opening quarter, moved very wide in the stretch. ENIGMATICA pursued the winner to the
quarter pole and faltered. DESERTED chased outside and was never a factor. ROCHELA dropped back early and was never in contention. MRS. CREWS
was always outrun.

Footnotes
QUICK LEARNER, two wide chasing, took the lead in early stretch, drifted out through stretch and edged away. RUNS FOR LUCK, always well placed, split
rivals on turn and through stretch and held place. FIRE MISSION broke slowly, saved ground early, split rivals on the turn, swung out and finished well.
SMART ROYAL T set the pace just off the rail before tiring. VERY COLORFUL, racing just off the rail and just off the pace, eased out and faded. DENNIS'
DIAMOND, racing in the four path, failed to menace. SMART AND TOUGH, between foes, never threatened. TEMPESTUOUS ANGEL raced wide and
tired. REFUNDED, very wide, failed to menace. IRONBOUND, just off the rail, showed little.

Footnotes
TRUE UPGRADE saved ground throughout, bid to front near mid-stretch and held nicely following a long drive. MORISSETTE settled off the pace outside,
moved very wide into the stretch rallying. SKOOKIE stalked the pacesetter in the two path and continued well to the finish. ATLANTIC AVENUE dropped far
behind early then offered some energy too late. BAAQEYA saved ground on the turn, awaited room briefly at the quarter pole and flattened out late. LITTLE
NECK raced just off the leaders three wide and lacked a rally. NOT IN THE MOOD lagged far behind throughout. ELISSAS SECRET lacked speed and was
never a factor. WOMAN FLYER sprinted clear angling to the rail, led to the stretch and stopped. TWITTER STORM trailed throughout.

MY BEST FRIEND took the lead at once, set the pace just off rail, drifted out under left handed pressure, right switched to right handed urging and she drew
clear. COME AND GET IT prompted the pace outside winner but was no match. WILL TAKE OVER didn't break sharply, saved ground, split foes in stretch
but was no threat. UP JUST IN TIME raced wide while just off the pace then tired. SHATTER ME saved ground and dropped back steadily. ALLEGRETTO
broke slowest then saved ground. GRACE AND PEACE ducked out leaving the gate then was very wide. REVOLVING LOVE showed nothing.

outside with a mild stretch bid. DOUBLE DOINK vied between rivals then moved clear inside, was collared on the turn and faded. SOLID GOLD DANCER
broke sluggishly, rushed up inside and was finished after half a mile. START OF ROYALTY raced far behind throughout. QUIET PLEASE dueled between
rivals down the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ARENI saved ground disputing the pace, fell back slightly near stretch, remained inside and moved through a large opening into stretch and
gamely got the nod. TAPETE CLAIRE broke slowly, was hustled up between foes, challenged two wide near stretch, took the lead and gave way grudgingly.
FIDUCIARY VALUES saved ground just off the pace, eased out and lacked a rally. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR set the pace two wide, remained off the rail
allowing winner to rally inside and weakened. HASHTAG SELFIE raced wide while just off the pace and weakened. HER DIVINENESS also raced wide and
dropped back. RISQUE EXPRESS broke slowly then trailed. As per ruling 20145 from the Pa. Racing Commission, SHE'SMYRISENSTAR was dq'ed and
placed last for a positive test.

Footnotes
MILL AND GLORIA set a measured pace, repelled repeated challenges and pulled away under an energetic hand ride. SWEET MAGGIE MAE settled far
behind, advanced inside on the final turn, angled out rallying in the stretch. SHEMAKESMEHAPPY prompted the winner for three quarters and weakened.
DONNA'S DUNKIRK was urged close up for half a mile and gave way. LORDEN'S LOVE saved ground off the leaders, offered a brief bid on the final turn
and faded. IZZADORA BELLA chased within striking range early and stopped abruptly. FRIDAY MASS lacked speed, moved inside on the final turn and
was no factor.

LONG MAY YOU RUN pursued the pacesetter outside, dropped back on the turn then came again inside pacesetter to get up in time. DANCING BULL
quickly sprinted clear, widened on the turn, bore out in the stretch, drifted back in while tiring and was caught late. APPEALING FUTURE chased off the
pace inside and made a gradual late gain. JUMPMASTER was urged just off the leaders three wide and remained outside running willingly. GUNS OF
STEEL dropped back after the start and failed to rally. WONDERFULLY TUNED broke sluggishly, dropped behind and was never in contention.

Footnotes
WORD OF TRUTH pursued the loose pacesetter wide, edged to the front nearing the eighth pole and pulled away under urging. KING'S HOUSE quickly
sprinted clear, shortened stride into the stretch but continued willingly. THESE BLUES lacked speed, advanced inside on the turn and closed well. MACH
TRIAL dropped back early, moved very wide into the stretch closing gap. ASK CHUCK saved ground down the backstretch and failed to threaten. SUNRISE
SATURDAY lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. MY PIRATE chased near the inside and weakened steadily. R JOLLEY DREAMER dropped far
behind and was never a factor. GITIDONE raced well behind throughout. LUNAR ROVER lacked speed and gave way readily. KETOS showed good speed
in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.
