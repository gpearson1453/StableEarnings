Footnotes
BONMONT cleared quickly on the backside, stayed off the rail in the three path, cut corner entering the turn, took turn two wide, entered the stretch in the
three path, gamely just held under strong urging. VERYNSKY chased pacesetter on the rail on the backstretch, stayed along the rail entering the turn,
entered stretch along the rail and just missed under strong urging. HARPER'S GEM bumped at the start, chased outside of rivals on the backstretch,
entered turn three wide and stayed three wide throughout the turn, entered stretch in the four path and did not have enough late to make an impact at the
wire under steady urging. DUTT BART stalked pace along the rail early on the backside, entered turn in the two path, came out midway through the turn
going four wide late in the turn, entering stretch in the five path and finished willingly. P TOWN TITAN bumped at the start, lost ground early settling at the
back of the pack, entered and stayed in the two path throughout the turn, and passed tired foe in the lane along the inside. TIME N MONEY broke through
the gate prior to the start of the race, broke out and bumped foe at the start, hustled to chase the pace in between, started to tire on the turn and continued
to weaken in the stretch.
