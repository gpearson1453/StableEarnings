EVEN PANDURA ducked out at the start, was prompted to make steady progress three deep on the turn and continued in that path to wrest the advantage
and go clear in time under firm handling. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER was urged forcing the pace outside a rival racing into the bend, gained a brief
advantage racing into upper stretch but was collared in the drive. MIS YA LOTS, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing into the turn, gave way nearing
midstretch. ONLY LONELY, off slowly, tracked the leaders along the inside but made no impression. COLONEL GRAY dropped out early.

PAPA MAMBO, forwardly placed along the rail in the opening stages, pressed the issue inside the pacesetter racing into the lane and kicked clear under
firm right handed pressure. DISTINCT APPROVAL, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail to the turn, dueled outside a rival
into the stretch but proved no match. SPELL WINDER was rated off the second flight along the inside, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and
finished evenly late. CRITTER tracked off the first flight racing to the turn, angled out nearing the lane but had no late response. DIM SUM made brief
pursuit of the leaders four wide on the backstretch but dropped out entering the turn. LETS TANGO proved no factor.

ROYAL PRIVACY broke readily, dictated the pace on a clear margin into the turn and held sway through the lane under strong handling. CORRANA EN
LIMEN tracked the pacesetter along the inside into the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and bested the others. ASTONISHING TWEET, off a step
behind the leaders when caught in close quarters at the start, switched out early and continued with a steady effort three deep to improve position. LANGS
LEGEND, urged along pursuing the pacesetter from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. ELUSIVE FORCE, held up last in early stages,
never gained contention. LONDON LEGACY was prompted between foes, then was pulled up after taking a few awkward steps racing into the turn and was
vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
LILFEATHEREDINDIAN broke sharply, dictated the pace outside rivals on a narrow advantage racing into the bend, was headed nearing upper stretch but
produced a second effort to wrest the advantage in time under pressure. CYNICAL GIRL tracked off the first flight four wide racing into the bend and made
steady progress to edge a rival for second. BLUE LIZZY, bumped at the start, angled in tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, bid along the rail
entering upper stretch but was outkicked. LETS PARDI MARTI broke out bumping BLUE LIZZY, was righted, then urged inside rivals disputing the pace into
the bend, gained a brief advantage racing into upper stretch but faltered late. MARGARITA MUNNDY broke inwards bumping INTHEMISTYMOONLITE,
was righted to track off the first flight between foes, was checked out of tight quarters entering the turn, but recovered in the closing stages to improve
position between foes late. DIXIE NATION settled along the inside early, saved ground throughout but had no closing bid. MS SASSY ATITUDE settled
three wide between foes racing into the turn and lacked a rally. TURQUOISE TRAIL urged between prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages, gave
way into the turn. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE, bumped at the start, switched out five wide while making brief progress racing into the turn but came up empty
late.

Footnotes
CANDY PRINCE exchanged bumps at the start, was righted, then hustled to the lead along the rail to open a comfortable advantage entering the turn, met
the challenge of AND HE'S LOOSE racing into upper stretch turned back that rival under firm handling to regain a clear advantage under pressure. The
latter exchanged bumps at the start, tracked the leader along the inside racing into the bend, closed the gap nearing upper stretch to bid for command
between entering the lane but proved no match late. BANDURRIA, urged three deep pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, closed the gap between foes
nearing upper stretch but had no late kick. BOBBY BOOTS tracked the leaders three wide between foes in early stages, swung out four wide on the turn
while gaining terms with the first flight but flattened out entering the lane. MR. D'S LEGEND, urged to a forward placing between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter, faded into the stretch. BUBBA BOB tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and made no impression. RUN AWAY FLASH
proved no threat. MUSKYMAN dropped out early.

DARE FELIX broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin near the inside racing into the turn and held ZOE'S DELIGHT on a safe advantage under
firm handling. The latter tracked off the second flight three wide in the opening stages, made steady progress to close the gap racing into the lane but came
up second best. WARRIOR BOSS tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight and continued evenly into the stretch. FINN COUNTRY tracked the
pacesetter inside a rival in second flight, faded into the stretch. DERBYS MONEYMAKER settled near the inside early, saved ground to gain some position
but made no impression. GOPHER GOLD tracked off the second flight early, swung outside foes racing into the turn but lacked a rally. DIXIE BLUES
dropped back early. BIG MONEY MAX flashed brief pace between foes but retreated early.

VERY BOISTEROUS, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the pacesetter nearing the lane to challenge for command, contested the issue in
a prolonged drive but prevailed in time under right handed pressure. MUCHO SUPER GIRL broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly to late stages but came up second best. FASHION ROSE broke awkwardly, settled last racing to the turn,
swung five wide entering the lane and continued to improve position to the end. JUST SPLENDID tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight racing
to the turn and faded into the stretch. DEVIL LADY settled near the inside early, saved ground to the lane and passed inside a tiring rival while making no
impression. DISTINCT FLIRT flashed brief pace between foes but gave way early.

Footnotes
RUN AWAY BETT vied inside foes from the outset into the turn, pressed the issue into the lane and shook clear late under firm encouragement.
CAMPAIGN SPY tracked the leaders along inside, saved ground on the bend, then shifted a bit off the inside to edge a rival for the place honors late.
SMELLIN CANDY tracked just off the first flight under light rating, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and was just outkicked for second. HARRY THE
HITMAN was rated outside foes from out of striking distance to the turn, raced five wide into the stretch and gained some position but made no impact.
COOL EDGE, urged between foes disputing the pace to the turn, pressed the winner to upper stretch and gave way in late stages. MARSHALL HILL, held
up last in the opening stages, failed to menace. COASTLINE SERMON, urged three wide pressing the pace to the turn, gave way nearing the lane.
