WITH ME WITHOUT ME trailed early, circled her field on the final turn, split foes rallying late and moved clear. FLORENCIA moved closer inside on the final
turn, awaited room then rallied but was outfinished. DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF prompted the pace outside, drew clear on the final turn, shortened stride in
mid-stretch and couldn't last. TIZ A TRIBUTE hustled to the lead inside for half a mile and faltered. TAYLOR'S BELLE was bumped in tight into the first turn,
dropped back then passed fading rivals. LA VENEZOLANA (VEN) broke sluggishly and was always outrun. OUR CLAIRE BEAR raced close up and gave
way readily. MADELYN'S DANCER was bumped into the first turn then was finished after half a mile.

Footnotes
OUR FLIRTATION came in slightly leaving the gate, raced three wide in second flight, brushed on the far turn, took the lead near quarter pole and gamely
held on. NEON CITY fanned out leaving the gate, raced between second flight, was bumped on the far turn, fought gamely to the wire and was just nipped.
YOURINDENIAL saved ground and lacked a strong finish. AFRICAN SONG saved ground early, eased off the rail on the backstretch, was forced out and
stumbled when in tight on the far turn. WROTE TO A DIVA, bumped around leaving the gate, failed to menace. PATTY'S TEMPLE came out leaving the
gate then was forced out soon after, saved ground and failed to menace. SOPHIA KATE, two wide, failed to menace. WONDER CHARM came out leaving
the gate, saved ground, came out twice near the end of the backstretch causing crowd then stopped. CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF AFRICAN
SONG AGAINST BOTH NEON CITY AND OUR FLIRTATION FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN WERE BOTH DISMISSED. THE STEWARDS
ALSO LITE THE INQUIRY SIGN CONCERNING THE CROWDING ON THE FAR TURN BUT THEY DID NOT ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
DUE TO THE RAIL AT 22 FEET, FRACTIONS WERE HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PRINCESS took control inside, widened on the final turn and remained well clear under moderate pressure. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT angled
outside the winner early, prompted the pace but proved no match. LIVIN A DREAM saved ground, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out.
SPECIAL RISK chased three wide in the second flight and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT BOUNTY dropped far behind and was never in contention. JUMPIN
JETT lagged along the inside and gave way readily. HOLA PRINCESS was urged just off the leaders inside and stopped.

Footnotes
HAZ A NOTION two wide and just off the pace, was left with the rail, rallied to the lead, leaving the furlong grounds and drew off. GOOD SOLUTION stalked
the pace inside, took the lead on the backstretch, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and was no match late. TRAFFIC TROUBLE, three wide and just off
the pace, came in slightly and bumped with DEVILRY near the quarter pole and faded. DRAMATIZED raced outside while never far back, faded late. THE
FAIRLEE BOYS saved ground and failed to menace. CITY GUY, wide, was never a serious threat. TRI TRY COLORS, in the four path while outrun, never
threatened. DEVILRY dueled for command between, drifted out slightly on the final turn, contributing to the bumping with TRAFFIC TROUBLE, took up and
fell back. SILVERZAR saved ground and tired. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN was never a factor. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF DEVILRY AGAINST
TRAFFIC TROUBLE FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE WAS DISMISSED. WITH THE RAIL SET AT 22 FEET, FRACTIONAL TIMES
WERE HAND TIMED.

VERO SUN saved ground throughout, slipped through at the top of the lane, challenged and edged ahead in a long drive. GALLINIPPER set a pressured
pace inside, was collared in mid-stretch but held on gamely. WARRANT OFFICER stalked the leader outside to the eighth pole then came up empty. ROAN
MOUNTAIN lagged far behind then offered some late energy. EASTPORT settled three wide off the pace, bid closer after the half then faltered. BRAVE
DEACON raced wide off the leaders and lacked a rally. CAPE MAY STYLE dropped back along the inside and was never a factor. PARTNER'S POWER
was fanned very wide on the first turn and gave way readily. MOUNTAIN TREE prompted the leader outside then steadied tiring on the final turn.

QUALITY CHOICE was unhurried early while just off the rail, split rivals on the final turn then angled out into stretch, closed determinedly and was just up.
SILVER DAGGER was forced in at the start as the field left the starting gate eighteen minuets past scheduled post time, went three wide and challenged
near stretch, took over and was clear mid stretch but just failed. STORMY JUSTIN, just off the rail and just off pace, split rivals on the final turn and lacked a
strong closing kick. IMMUNITY clipped heels in tight after the start, was outrun early racing inside, eased out through stretch but was too late.
STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE was extremely wide while outrun and passed faders. KID MAC COOL saved ground dueling for the early lead then tired.
TRILOGY came in leaving the gate causing crowding, raced two wide bying for the lead then tired. AMERICAN COUGAR was steadied repeatedly
throughout. TU EXAGERES raced wide and showed little. COUNTY CORRECTIONS, two wide in second flight, tired.

Footnotes
NIENTE broke alertly and led inside, bore out from the eighth pole to the wire and was just up in a very tight photo. VEQUIST raced close up from the start
and continued gamely inside the winner in the final furlong just missing. BEAUTIFUL GRACE urged close up from the outset then proved empty in the
stretch. AEGEAN SEA chased inside and finished well without menacing. TIC TIC TIC BOOM broke a bit slowly and steadied along the rail in the stretch.
SPRITE'S LADY dropped back after the start and was never in contention. CATTI LA BELLE broke sluggishly, raced wide and was no factor. MAGICAL
MESA raced off the leaders and weakened steadily. AURNIA bumped at the start, raced wide and was no factor. LADY PROGURT ducked out and bumped
at the start, raced greenly and gave way.
