Footnotes
REMEMBERTOBREATHE raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive, was up in the
closing yards to be going away. CEDAR RAPIDS showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive, could not
match strides with the winner late but finished with good energy to gain the place. DRIZZY was never far back while racing from the inside, moved up to
engage CANDI'S MARTINI nearing the half, vied with that rival and gave way to the winner late. CANDY'S MARTINI sprinted clear soon after the start,
responded when challenged by DRIZZY nearing the half, vied with that rival into mid-stretch and gave way. ATYPIQUE was away in good order to chase
the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way gradually. HURRICANE FORCE raced four-wide through the first turn, showed brief speed, raced five-wide
through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LA UNA hesitated at the start, raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch, wore down CAMDEN HIGH in
the closing yards and was going away late. CAMDEN HIGH was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, reached the fore nearing the
sixteenth pole but could not resist the winner late. TIME FOR GOLD pressed the pace while racing three-wide, lugged out through the turn and stayed on
well in the drive. SUNSHINE BEACH steadied from between foes nearing the three-eighths pole, angled in, gained command nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, opened a clear margin and gave way through the final furlong. ZIPPIN SEVENZ was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and
weakened in the drive. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN hopped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
STELLACZAR lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
ON PURPOSE was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew
off through the lane with complete authority. MISS VANJIE NATION broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, could not match
strides with that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. FULL SPEED AHEAD lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, could not gain on the
winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid. TAP THAT SPOT was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
closing response. SIGRID'S GOLD settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. FINE ELEMENT bobbled at the break,
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
