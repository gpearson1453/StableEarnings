MONTANA JACK was a bit slow into stride but saved the inside was close to the lead early dropped back a bit on the turn but came through again along the
rail and edged clear for the win. MR CHARLIE KING showed good speed while three wide took a big lead on the turn and gave way grudgingly through the
stretch while clearly second best. CAPITAL REEF came five wide on the turn but flattened out and could not sustain the bid. PAPA SUGAR was up close
going up the backstretch but was in tight quarters and forced to check and could not recover from that. JOJOGOTTAGO after breaking alertly quickly went
to the back and passed tired foes in the stretch while not a serious factor. MY MILAGRO broke about five lengths behind the field was hustled along the
inside but never got into contention. BLAZIN CELEBRATION showed a brief flurry of speed along the inside but was through after the first quarter.

Footnotes
LOVE SOLUTION showed the best early speed in the two path opened a good lead inside the sixteenth pole and had enough left to hold off the late charge
of favored Quiet No More for the win. QUIET NO MORE was well off the early pace and trailed to almost the top of the stretch came five wide and was
passing horses but ran out of ground and had to settle for second. FRANKI D ORO raced three wide on the turn and could not make up ground. AMOUR
was pinched back after the break and several lengths behind the field early made a wide run and was finishing well. EPSOM IMP showed good early speed
on the inside but had nothing left for the drive. FIVE B C raced along the inside and had no rally in the stretch. PEARL OFTHE HARBOR raced three wide
on the turn and could not make up ground. SLEIGH RIDE was well back then tried to get out entering the stretch while ten wide and could not make up
ground. JONI B TRUE showed good speed along the inside while chasing the speed but stopped in the final eighth. WARRENS GOLDNUGGET raced mid
pack and tired in the stretch while not a serious factor.

Footnotes
SOPHIE T came in the two path on the turn to engage for the lead took the lead at the eighth pole and extended the margin to the wire. FRIGID lacked early
speed came six wide entering the stretch and was closing best of all but ran out of ground. APRIL'S LADY DI raced in the two path on the turn and could not
make up ground in the stretch. RATE THE REPUBLIC was well off the pace came through in the stretch along the inside and was finishing with interest.
AMERICAN RAISA showed good early speed in the two path but tired in the stretch. SMART RACHEL showed the best early speed along the inside but
had nothing left in the stretch. SNICKER JO raced in the three path and never mounted a rally. LINDAS BLACK COMET was well back throughout and not a
factor in the outcome.

FAVORABLE OUTCOME showed the best early speed but stayed off the rail going into the turn giving rivals a chance to come through along the inside
found more at the top of the lane when challenged and drew clear again in the lane. COLLUSIONIST was closer than usual along the inside came through
when the leader went a bit wide entering the stretch but did not have the needed stretch run while holding second. BLACK OPS was in the two path entering

in the two path but could not make up the needed ground in the stretch. RAAGHEB raced along the rail but lacked a rally in the stretch. PASAMONTE MAN
was well off the early pace on the inside and never mounted a serious rally. DOBY raced four wide in the early stages while just off the pace and faded in

Footnotes
TIZ YOUR WAY stalked the pace while three wide on the turn came into contention at the top of the stretch and drew clear to win handily. ELIZABETH'S
MUSIC after a sluggish break showed good early speed and saved the rail and was all out to hold second at the wire. FRAN'S EMPIRE was up close in the
two path and never mounted a winning rally and was third best. ALY J came through on the inside with a mild bid in the stretch. FRIED ONIONS showed no
early speed and was well off the pace came through mid track in the stretch and showed some late run. TIP TAP TIME came five wide entering the stretch
and did not make up any ground. BEHOLD DE DANCER made a move three wide going into the turn to get into contention but tired through the stretch.
TIENE TUMBAO was up close for the first quarter then got into tight quarters and dropped back /quickly losing all chance. HAY BELLES was well back
throughout and never a serious factor in the outcome.
