Footnotes
NOW THAT'S A BENNY set the pace while a path off of the inner rail, then dug in through the lane to hold her advantage from PROUDLY FOUGHT off of
her outer flank. PROUDLY FOUGHT chased the pace setter from the three path, produced a bid through the lane, but was fended off. MAUK'S TUFF
shifted to the five path turning for home, and produced a mild rally for show. OLIVE U rated in midpack in the two path into the turn before shifting to the four
path at the five sixteenths pole to attempt to produce a three wide bid, but lacked a kick to do so, then stayed on to pass a tiring rival while getting
outfinished by an outer foe. HEADFIRST stalked along the inside, but failed to kick through a rail opening in upper stretch, then weakened late and got
outfinished for minor rewards. ELLE FACTOR was outrun.

Footnotes
FREE set the pace two wide before clearing her inner foe into the backstretch, stayed in the two path and was confronted by ACTRESS ON BOARD along
the inside passing the five furlong pole, dueled outside of that foe and then between horses into the far turn as wider foes made bids, held an advantage
and dug in to meet WISES LANDING's bid at the five sixteenths pole, repelled that foe approaching the furlong pole, then flopped to her left lead inside the
final sixteenth, but still held safely. WISES LANDING raced off of the pace in the six path, commenced a six to five wide rally into the turn to produce a bid
for the lead outside of foes at the five sixteenths pole, sustained her bid and vied into upper stretch, but was repelled by the leader approaching the furlong
pole, then kept on. ACTRESS ON BOARD trailed through the first turn, rushed along the rail down the backstretch to bid for the lead at the nine sixteenths
pole inside of rivals, dueled into the turn, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. SKYKAT settled off of the pace four wide, but was outmoved by a
wider foe into the far turn, then kept on to pass a tired foe in the lane, but failed to factor. EYE HAVE CANDY vied along the inside early on, took back to
stalk and shifted to the three path into the backstretch, held striking position into the far turn, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole.
ATALANTA BELLE chased the pace three to five wide, but weakened into the far turn, and was eased thereafter.

Footnotes
ELLE Z set the pace along the inside, drew clear of bidding foes in upper stretch, drifted out to the three path while clear at the furlong pole, then lasted in
the late stages. LEA'S PRINCESS settled off of the pace in the two path, split foes two wide to be behind the leaders at the quarter pole, shifted four wide
turning for home to be outside of those foes in upper stretch, produced a rally and made a bid in the late stages, but missed on the wire. BABY KARATS
was forwardly placed three wide and between horses, then stayed on in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch the leader, and got outfinished by
an outer foe. MORAVIA (GB) stalked along the inside, attempted to shift two wide in upper stretch, but altered back to the rail approaching the furlong pole
as the leader drifted out, but lacked a kick to produce a rail bid, then got outfinished in the late stages. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) pressed the pace setter two
wide and between horses, but weakened in the late stages. UNFADING BEAUTY trailed by a distance around the turn, then passed a tired foe in the lane
without factoring. TWO SIXTYONE was forwardly placed four wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

DREAM QUIST brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, bid two wide and between horses at the half mile pole as ZEBRA CAKE forced her
hand, vied two wide around the far turn before forging a lead passing the quarter pole, widened under mild pressure in upper stretch, and was wrapped up
approaching the wire. BAHAMA MISCHIEF brushed with an outer foe at the start, settled off of the pace two wide, shifted from the three to four path with
many lengths to find at the five sixteenths pole, then stayed on through the lane to achieve place, but was no match for the clear leader. CUZZYWUZZY
settled off of the pace along the inside, advanced by saving ground around the far turn before shifting to the three path turning for home, passed a tiring
inner foe for place inside the furlong pole, but was outfinished by an outer foe for that position in the final sixteenth. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED cleared the
field and angled to the rail around the first turn, dueled inside of foes into the far turn, but was headed by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, and
weakened. ZEBRA CAKE lunged inwards at the start, raced in midpack four wide, advanced down the backstretch to make a three wide bid for the lead at
the half mile pole, but weakened at the three furlong pole. PRETTY IN PINK stalked the pace two wide early on, but weakened at the nine sixteenths pole,
and was done early.

Footnotes
SUGOI set the pace along the inside, dueled for the lead inside of a trio of foes around the far turn, drew clear passing the furlong pole and shifted a few
paths out, then held sway through deep stretch. KAZIRANGA advanced four wide into the far turn to produce a four wide bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leader approaching the furlong pole, was herded a path or two outwards passing that marker, but kept on
and prevailed for place approaching the wire. BY YOUR SIDE stalked along the inside around the first turn, shifted three wide and tracked close to the
leader's into the far turn, but was outmoved by a wider oncharging foe at the five sixteenths pole, shifted inwards a path turning for home, which caused him
to be blocked behind AFLEET ASCENT, was held up behind traffic to the furlong pole, then offered late foot between horses, but missed place. LIMNERY
saved ground from midpack, came into the lane just behind the leaders, but lacked a kick along the inside after the leader drifted out at the furlong pole,
then got outfinished by outer foes in the final sixteenth. AFLEET ASCENT pressed the pace setter two wide, vied between horses around the far turn and
through upper stretch, but was herded outwards by the leader passing the furlong pole, then got outfinished for minor rewards. HONOVI saved ground while
trailing early on, attempted a rail rally through the lane, but was not allowed sufficient racing room along the rail, was blocked through the entirety of the
lane, and failed to menace. JUNGLE WARFARE tracked from midpack in the two to three path around the turns, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
C ISLANDSURPRISE set the pace inside of a rival while staying a path off of the inner rail, was headed by that foe at the five sixteenths pole, but dug in and
reclaimed the lead approaching the three sixteenths pole, dug in gamely as MOLLY'S GAME produced a bid at the furlong pole, fended off that foe through
the late stages, then came out into her path approaching the wire, herded her counterpart outwards, and held on. MOLLY'S GAME tracked from midpack in
the two to three path before shifting four wide turning for home, bumped NORTHERN CONNECT to her outside in the process, but produced a rally to bid at
the furlong pole, dueled with her inner game rival through deep stretch, but failed to gain even terms before being herded outwards approaching the wire.
NORTHERN CONNECT trailed the field to the far turn, rallied in the four path around that bend to striking position, but was bumped to the fie path turning
for home, then flattened out passing the furlong pole. LUCKY BE A LADY stalked along the inside, shifted to the two then three path around the far turn, but
failed to keep pace with the inner leaders turning for home, then got outfinished for minor rewards. MUSABAQA prompted the pace two wide and in the
three path, bid into the far turn, forged a lead at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened approaching the furlong pole. ESTRELA CADENTE raced off of the
pace two wide, and failed to factor. GRATS ROAD saved ground while off of the pace, but to no avail.

BEAUTIFUL STAR set the pace along the inside while keen through the first turn, dug in inside of ILL MAKE IT COACH at the five sixteenths pole, kicked
clear again in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire. WENDY'S FINE WINE steadied early on when crowded between horses, saved ground off of the
pace, rallied along the inside turning for home, forged show at the furlong pole, but veered out to the five path at the sixteenth pole to be outside of the
leaders, interfered with a pair of foes in the process, then sustained her rally to just get up for place at the wire. I'LL MAKE IT COACH dueled for the lead
two wide around the first turn, took back to stalk into the backstretch, rebid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with her inner
counterpart in upper stretch, then got nailed on the wire for place. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT had a slow start and raced far off of the pace along the inside,
shifted off of the rail approaching the five sixteenths pole, then to the five path turning for home,split foes in upper stretch to commence a rally, but was
interfered by inner foes at the sixteenth pole, then kept on to achieve fourth. FORTUNA ADIUVAT saved ground while stalking the pace around the turns,
shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with the leaders, then was cut off by WENDY'S FINE WINE at the sixteenth pole, causing
her to interfere OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT, then got outfinished by that foe at the wire. SEAWARD stalked the leaders from the three path, inched closer into
the far turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. MARY OF BETHANY trailed early on, rallied four wide into and around the far turn, but flattened out in upper
stretch, and weakened. SHE'S FOREVER raced far off of the pace two to three wide, but was floated to the five path turning for home, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTELY AIDEN dueled for the lead two wide, held an advantage between horses around the turn before kicking clear in upper stretch, then held off
his chasing foes under driving pressure through the late stages. HOME BASE prompted the pace three wide between horses, vied three wide around the
turn, kept on after the leader kicked away in upper stretch, sustained his bid between horses in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch the leader.
MANNY WAH tracked from midpack inside of foes while in the two path, shifted four wide and split foes to make a bid at the quarter pole, sustained his
grind through deep stretch after the leader kicked away, but failed to catch that foe or HOME BASE for place in the final sixteenth. MUCHO raced off of the
pace three wide and between horses, forged fourth turning for home, but finished up evenly and failed to menace the leaders. SEVEN TRUMPETS raced off
of the pace four wide, shifted to the six path turning for home, but failed to make an impact. SMART TIME stalked four wide, was floated five wide turning for
home, but weakened in upper stretch. NIFTY had a slow start, saved ground while trailing through the turns, then split tiring foes at the sixteenth pole. HE
HATE ME raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to factor. GRAY ATTEMPT dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner,
steadied while weakening turning for home, then wilted through the lane. KEEPIN IT CLASSY was never involved.
