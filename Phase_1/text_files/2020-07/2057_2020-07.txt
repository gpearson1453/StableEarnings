Footnotes
MORE LIKE IT got worked into the two path prior to departing the backstretch, drafted behind the pacesetter during the run around the bend, was under a
ride angling three wide onto the head of the stretch, kicked into his best by the end of the furlong grounds, clawed its way towards the one to catch, began
to, vie as the outermost of a threesome leaving the sixteenth pole, gamely got the job done in the shadow of the wire. SILVER TOKEN remained forwardly
placed after out-breaking the field by a narrow margin, cut over to the inside, saw SMITE accelerate to the front end coming up to the half mile pole, went on
to prompt that foe from the top of the turn to its end, got cued up for the drive home, altered off the heels of the earlier-mentioned opponent past the eighth
pole by going into the path two, lost some momentum for the next two to three jumps before recovering, inched up, argued bertween rivals for much of the
final sixteenth, fought with determination, but fell short. SMITE in slightly springing from the gate, got set up in the two path, quickened to grab the
advantage approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, carved out the pace, feeling the presence of the second place finisher all the while, got roused
heading onto the top of the lane, was forced to fend off the top twosome from the outside with approximately a sixteenth to go, released the lead with a few
strides to spare before the finish line. ADVANCED STRATEGY pursued the pace three to four wide, was more the latter at the commencement of the
stretch run, finished willingly down the center of the course for the last major check. NEURO rode the rail, got asked for more for the drive, shifted out three
wide in the general area of the sixteenth pole, rallied mildly. SHANDIAN pocketed, moved out into the two path at the top of the lane, had no offering.
SARATOGA PAL unsettled while in and amongst rivals early on the backstretch, got lightly steadied, departed the backstretch towards the two path, got
tipped into the three path afterwards, getting there by the midway point, ventured onward in between foes, swung out four wide entering the stretch, lacked
the necessary response. OTTER gathered after coming out at the start, tucked into the two path by the top of the turn, brought up the back of the pack, got
sent out five wide form upper to midstretch, never made his presence felt.

Footnotes
EFFINITY broke in a step at the start bumping ARROWHEART, raced three wide in aim of the leader, advanced on that rival three wide through the turn to
stack outside the top pair five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, drew clear under a
drive kept to task. WORK OUT brushed the near side stall at the start and broke on top despite it, showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under
increasing pressure through the turn under a firm left grip appearing to want to float outwards as rivals flanked him issuing a pair of challenges, got shown
an off sided stick just past the three-eighths now between foes and was headed for command at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in
under a drive no match for the top one while fighting on to secure the place honors. JUDGE N JURY stumbled just after the start losing footing both in front
and in behind before settling into stride in pursuit just off the inside just off the pace, tucked inside into the turn and advanced on the rail to issue a challenge
at the three-eighths and take command near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under threat from a pair, got displaced straightened away,
dug in battling on to the finish no match for the winner and was ultimately bested at the end for the place honors while well clear of the rest. ARROWHEART
got bumped at the start by EFFINITY who broke in a step then got bumped by BELLAMY DOLCE, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. BELLAMY DOLCE broke out a step at the start bumping ARROWHEART just after that rival got
bumped by EFFINITY, chased four wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

path on that bend, was rated in the second flight, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in
upper stretch, chased the top three in the drive and lacked the needed kick. RECKLESS SPIRIT bumped with a rival at the start, checked while boring out
into the first turn, went five wide on that bend, settled more kindly while outside on the backstretch, was roused while five then four wide on the far turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. FOTIS went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while four
wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. CHANTRY FLATS broke out and bumped with
a rival, raced under tight restraint while off heels into and early on the first turn, was reserved near the back, came under strong urging in the two path on the
far turn then was put to the whip at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. PROQUESTOR went three wide on the first turn, settled near the back on the
outside, was urged along while five wide on the far turn then came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. FLEET ADMIRAL angled in at the rear of the
field, rounded the first turn in the two path under a strong hold, was reserved at the rear, went three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch,
drifted in badly outside the sixteenth-pole and showed little. MAGICAL TALE was rated just off the pace on the inside, came up empty along the rail on the
far turn and retreated. ONESHOTATFOREVER bumped with a foe at the start, went two to three wide on the first turn, contested the pace on the outside,
dropped back leaving the backstretch and stopped then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
THE GREAT DANSKY disputed the pace two to three wide on the backstretch, was more in path two than before sparring for command on the turn, necked
the nemesis approaching the quarter pole, settled in at the head of the stretch and was turned loose, built up a comfortable advantage by the beginning of
the final furlong, extended it, kept to some urging to the end. CRYPTOGRAPHER thrashed his way through the starting gate, remained well-held by the
assistant and didn't run off, was examined by the veterinarian stationed behind the gate before being re-loaded, proceeded to break without apparent
mishap, took up the chase from the three path on the turn, fanned out one wider from upper to midstretch, proved no match rallying for the place. LIAM'S
FIRE took up position in the two path after bobbling at the start, was under urging swinging slightly wider into the stretch, lugged in after being fed some
right side stick work, bumped into a maneuvering VICTORY BOULEVARD in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, got corrected by being placed into path
three right afterwards, was one of three fighting for place honors late, came up short. VICTORY BOULEVARD made it over to the rail in short order, tracked
the pace towards the rear, got put to a ride angling to the outside just beyond the quarter pole, bumped with the wayward LIAM'S FIRE, gained clear
passage along the two path a few strides later, vied with two others for second late, got denied. DOUBLE SHOT two wide onto the turn, was sent out into
path five exiting it, lacked the necessary stretch response. JUSTIN FRONT powered up to the front end under his own power, was along the inside route
arguing with the winner for the advantage for the opening half, stepped into the lane and readily backed away.

OUTADORE tracked the pace two to three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn patiently handled until set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away under a drive and was geared down near the finish. MAD MADDY
established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in
under threat and was headed a furlong out, ran on safe for the place honors. RIVER TIBER three to four wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the
three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors while clear of the rest. THORN chased just off the
inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and improved position in the stretch. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN veered out
at the start under hustling forcing HILLIARD and FULCO to be steadied at the break, chased three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and tired. PITAMAN coaxed from the start, chased along the inside, advanced mildly near the half mile
pole, came under a ride five-sixteenths from home, took the inside path into upper stretch and tired. FULCO got forced to steady as AMERICAN
GENTLEMAN veered out in front and conceded three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside from near the rear under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HILLIARD got steadied at the start as AMERICAN GENTLEMAN
veered inwards directly in front and conceded three lengths to the leader before able to get into stride, chased along the inside near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route at the top of the stretch and tired.

WITEZ was antsy in the gate then taken back early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably off the pace, started the far turn in the two
path, shifted four wide while moving closer later on that bend then was roused, rallied outside into upper stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths then
was put to a left-handed whip, turned back the challenge of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. EYE OF A SOLDIER was
taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the back on the outside, went around most of the far turn in the two path,
was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch, came under a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, swapped back to his inside lead when
switched to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker, went back to the proper lead at the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place.
JAZZIQUE (IRE) settled on the inside, moved closer on the far turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole, was asked once straightened for the drive
while between and behind horses, moved out under a left-handed whip while in good striking range at the furlong marker but flattened out while just able to
get the show. LOGIC N REASON showed speed on the inside of three foes, steadied briefly and dropped back along the rail into the turn, moved to the two
path midway through that bend, was rated in the second flight, ranged up two to three wide on the far turn, made a bid between horses at the five-sixteenths
then took the lead at the quarter-pole, was put to the whip after losing the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and was out-kicked then just
missed the show. TARANTA (IRE) was pinched back between horses early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged
along late on the backstretch, moved closer while rounding the far turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch then angled out and lacked the
needed kick. CRYSTAL GLACIER showed speed between horses, bumped with a rival into the first turn, moved from the three path to the rail on that bend,
contested the pace on the inside of a foe, dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, was roused around the five-sixteenths, chased
into upper stretch and tired. COST BENEFIT (GB) showed speed on the outside of three opponents, went four then three wide on the first turn, disputed the
pace on the outside of a rival, shook off that foe into the far turn, dropped from the two path to the rail on that bend, gave up the lead without fight at the
quarter-pole and gave way. GINGER KITTY was antsy in the gate, showed speed between horses, bumped with a rival into the first turn then steadied, went
two then three wide on that bend, settled outside in the second flight, ranged up three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE SAINT settled along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, got set down after crossing midpoint on the turn, cut the
corner into the lane, launched himself into contention with a rail rally from upper stretch to the furlong grounds, tipped to the outside and shoe-horned itself
between rivals in midstretch, would remain wedged between its fellow in-the-money finishers thereafter, battled hard, as did the other two, traded leans with
each of them, especially in the final seventy yards, gamely got up. CRYOGENIC remained forwardly after being one of the quickest out of the starting gate,
got moved inward, was directly abreast of FAST GETAWAY arguing for control from the two path, gradually shifted into path three as their spat spilled over
into the stretch, inadvertently providing a window of opportunity for the eventual winner, found himself vying with vigour for the top from around the eighth
pole onward as then outermost of a trio, exchanged light contact with COMPETITIVE SAINT several times in deep stretch, got denied. FAST GETAWAY
secured a narrow advantage during the early going, got guided over to the inside, was spotted into a snugger fit along the rail once on the turn after being
slightly wider prior, raced as a team with CRYOGENIC during the run around the bend, went into the lane and was asked for more, saw the top one draft
behind for much of the ensuing furlong, found itself locked in a three-way tussle by midstretch, ventured on with good determintion, had a series of light
bumps and/or leans occur inside the sixteenth pole, would up on the shortest end of the win photo. JAKE ROCKS pursued the front runners from the two
path, came into the stretch, tipped out a bit wider, rallied belatedly for the final significant slice of the purse. AMERICAN MANDATE took up chase two to
three wide on the turn, angled out four wide for the drive, mustered up a mild response. MORNING BREEZ forwardly placed eyeing the on-going pace
dispute a short distance up ahead, got roused a short distance from the quarter pole, spun into the lane and gave way. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD tracked the
front runners while stationed along the inside route, was asked to pick it up by the five-sixteenths pole, was under a strong drive going three wide into the
lane, had no rally. FROSTED ROSE off a length the tardiest, cut over to the rail in short order, took it until the end of the bend, fanned out into path five from
upper to midstretch becoming the widest of all, wound up trailing throughout.

Footnotes
HAPPY SAVER forwardly placed along the inside from the gate, was taken hold of when put in a bit tight into the first turn by HIGH AMPLITUDE, tracked
along the rail through the opening bend and down the backstretch patiently handled, remained along the fence through the far turn until placed to coaxing
and angled off the inside five-sixteenths from home, went six wide into upper stretch put to a drive, rallied to collar the leader a furlong from home, then drew
clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. BEAU LUMINARIE three wide through the first turn, raced four wide in pursuit from
mid pack albeit in striking range of the front, began an advance on the leader in tandem with HIGH AMPLITUDE to his inside at the seven-sixteenths coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, stacked outside the top pair, cornered four wide for home, took over the front straightened away, dug in under
threat and was displaced just inside the eighth pole, kept on to secure the place honors clear of the rest while no match for the top one through the final
furlong. HIGH AMPLITUDE tucked briefly to the two path putting HAPPY SAVER in a bit tight briefly into the first turn before tipping three wide through the
rest of the bend, raced three to four paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader advancing to latch on that rival five furlongs from home, remained three
wide through the far turn and issued a challenge to the front between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the final eighth while along for the show honors. AMANI'S EAGLE brushed the near side stall at the start and established the front
shortly after, showed the way in hand just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch safely in front until engaged with some pressure at
the five-eighths as the aforementioned foe latched on to the outside, remained just off the inside through the far turn and came under threat from a pair three
furlongs out, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home heads apart for command, yielded the front straightened away
and tired. BASQUIAT just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing three to four wide at the
three-eighths, angled in to cut the corner into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. FAMILY BIZ saved ground in the early stages, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and got out four to five wide through the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SUMMER KID
three wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path and was loosely between foes facing some kickback and pulled on the bit unsettled under a firm hold by
the rider, remained rating unkindly down the backstretch two to three wide while kept behind cover of rivals, began to get shaken off midway on the far turn
when put to urging while three wide, offered no response and went four wide for home and was eased through the stretch while being periodically flashed
the stick to the off side.

SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN strolled to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace, controlled
the action through the far turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under a right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, fought off a
bevy of challengers in the final furlong and held under strong urging. MR DUMAS went around the first turn in the two path, was rated on the outside, came
under urging leaving the backstretch, chased three wide on the far turn, pursued the winner while outside in the drive and finished willingly to get the place.
GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) came out in front then was taken back under tight restraint, saved ground while rated just off the pace under a hold, drafted
inside on the far turn, waited while lacking room from the quarter-pole to the eighth-pole, was asked with a small gap in front at that point then drifted in a
touch back behind the leader, chased that foe into the final sixteenth and finished willingly to just get the show. HALLADAY brushed the outside of the gate
at the start, conceded the lead to the winner early, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came under coaxing in the two path on
the far turn, was roused while on near even terms for the lead at the quarter-pole, battled under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, switched to a
left-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked then just missed the show. OLYMPICO (FR) dropped back on the initial straightaway, saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved while last but one, raced inside on the far turn, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch, gained under a
drive into the final furlong, continued to gain gradually to the wire but missed the trifecta. SEISMIC WAVE was last to commence then dropped back, went
around the first turn in the two path under a strong hold, was reserved at the rear, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths,
came five wide into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. (Rail at 9 Feet)

TURN OF EVENTS taken hold after coming in slightly at the start, attained a prominent position, prompted the pacesetter from the two path and would
continue to do so all the way to the quarter pole, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and got asked for more, sparking off a duel with BOLD GEM, put that
foe away with approximately a sixteenth remaining then dug in well in the final stages to preserve the decision. GLYNN COUNTY pinched at the start,
stepped onto the clubhouse bend from the three path, advanced into midpack, departed the backstretch one path nearer the rail, swung back into the three
path for the drive home, chipped away at the deficit in a steadfast manner, got held off. BOLD GEM off to an alert getaway, retained the advantage, cut over
to the inside route, was rated along carving out the pace, accompanied by an equally-rated TURN OF EVENTS to the outside, turned into the lane with the
aforementioned foe still latched on, was in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole when set down, as was the top one, saw that one cement itself to
the front end over the next furlong, weakened into the show slot. PRINCE OF CAPS strung out three wide on the first turn, got worked into the pocket by the
far turn, cut the corner into the lane, remained a prominent factor to midstretch before backing away a bit. FEELING DANGEROUS quickly spotted along the
rail, rode it until the end of the second bend, was under a ride spinning three wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response. COLLOQUIST a bit rank
proceeding around the first turn, underwent a two wide pursuit, commenced the stretch slightly wider, flattened out. FAZE sneaked onto the inside route
early on the opening bend, failed to make an impact off the ground-saving journey that followed. POWER BOSS was moved over to the rail leaving the
homestretch, brought up the back of the pack during the opening phases, tipped into the three path at the half mile pole, went four wide for the drive home,
lacked the needed response. SEIZE THE DAY unprepared tossing his head just before the field was to be released, struck the left side of the gate after
breaking in the air, moved wider and got going, was briefly floated three to four wide onto the first turn by a rank DREAMONMYBABY, settled into two path
soon afterwards, went about three wide into the stretch, never made his presence felt. ECONOMIC POLICY out a bit at the start, travelled two wide early,
tucked along the rail at the half mile pole, was still stationed along it entering the stretch, gave way. DREAMONMEBABY rank early, made it over to the rail
shortly after leaving the homestretch, abandoned it for path two at the top of the far turn, stepped into the lane, had no offering. LORD OF THE NILE
forwardly placed three wide for three-quarters, was displaying no speed drifting seven to eight wide into the lane, with the pilot applying pressure on the left
side, got eased en route for the last minor slice of the pot and was subsequently vanned off.
