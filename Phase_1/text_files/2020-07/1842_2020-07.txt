Footnotes
MY PAL popped the gate and had a length and a half advantage going into the turn while off the rail relinquished the lead briefly to Papa Case and those
two battled head and head to the sixteenth pole when My Pal began to edge clear under mild urging. PAPA CASE was able to move to the lead on the
inside on the turn then battled gamely to the sixteenth pole with the winner and gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth under a strong ride. E'S
BIRTHDAY BOY raced in the two path on the turn came wide into the stretch and was up for third. MACHO SANCHO was away well dropped back along
the inside and raced evenly through the stretch. STREET BULL raced in the three path on the turn came five wide entering the stretch and dropped back.
OTHER THAN THAT raced three wide on the turn moved to the inside at the top of the stretch and tired.

JUST REMEMBER away in good order, was able to get the lead and the rail and lead throughout in a solid debut. QUE TEE was three wide on the turn and
drifted out while racing a bit green yet was still able to close for second. MISS SKYLER was away a step slow raced three wide on the turn and was finishing
well. FLY DONNA FLY chased the pace and tired through the stretch along the inside. MAIUSHCA dropped back shortly after the start and was not a
serious factor. KAYLA C raced along the rail and never mounted a rally. CHOCOLATE GUM DROP was off a step slow and trailed throughout.

NON DISCLOSURE was away best and settled into an early three horse speed duel was just a head behind the frontrunner until the had of the stretch and
then steadily drew clear for the win. OOPSY DAISY came five wide entering the stretch and was finishing well for second while not a threat to the winner.
DIVINE BLESSING was four wide entering the stretch to get into contention but was outfinished for second. SIZZLING GRACE was five to six wide the
entire race and tired in the lane. HOT LIL MESS came wide entering the stretch and could not make up the needed ground. LIL JESSIE showed good early
speed while three wide and tired in the stretch. GRADIOACTIVE showed good early speed on the inside but dropped back going into the turn. PATRIOTIC
GIRL raced wide while well behind the pace and was not a factor. RUNNIN PAINT trailed from the outset and was not a factor.

INDY'S OUTLAW made a move three wide on the turn for home opened a good lead in the stretch and was able to hold on. JIMBO'S BIZ was devoid of
early speed and trailed for much of the race came five wide on the turn and was picking up horses in the stretch but ran out of ground. WAR EAGLE'S
RETURN was well off the pace came through on the inside and was closing well. FINE WITH ME was able to show the best early speed and get to the rail
in a three horse speed duel but tired in the stretch. DORCHEAT ZARB raced inside and lacked a rally. TETON raced along the inside behind the three
horse speed duel and tired. CLIFF'S PLACE raced midpack and never mounted a rally. REVERSALOFFORTUNE dropped well back just after the start and
was never a serious threat. COLLEGE PARTY was in the two path in the three horse speed duel and gave way in the stretch. HOW ABOUT HIM raced mid
division for the first quarter and then faded. MIGHTY OAKS MAGIC was the outside horse in the three horse speed duel and tired. THIS RACE WAS HAND

EMPEROR'S CHOICE went right to the front and opened an easy lead drew clear on the second turn and had plenty left at the finish in an easy win. BIG
LARRY had a two path trip chasing the winner while never a threat to that one he was clearly second best today. ROLL OUT inside trip up for third. S S
TANK raced in the three path and never mounted a serious rally. BAILEYS IRISH raced four wide and had nothing left for the stretch run. KEEN JAMES
was away in good order then settled in the back came a bit wide turning for home and ducked out twice in the lane. PAUL'S DIVA was always well back and
never a serious threat. VONSTER was three wide for much of the race and tired in the stretch.
