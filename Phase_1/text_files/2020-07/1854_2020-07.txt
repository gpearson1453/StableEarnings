NO WAY NEVER (IRE) stalked the pace angling out to upper stretch bidding from the five and four paths edging up abreast foes. MR. GRANITE pressured
the pace racing inside to upper stretch battling gamely to the end near the rail. ALASAAL pressed the pace dueling to upper stretch extending between
horses late being out finished. R PAPER CHASER went evenly through the turn edging up to pose a threat in the two path upper stretch lacking a finishing
move. BOMBONERO was bumped between horses at the break. BADABOOM was checked off heels in run to the turn. CAPTIVATED was always outrun.

early was no factor. SHESAROCKSTARTOO had brief speed then faded on the turn. DUCHESS OF DUBLIN pressured the pace through the turn then
