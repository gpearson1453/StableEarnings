MOUNTAIN VIEW took command of the the pace quickly, opened up on back stretch and widen margin through the turn and coasted in the stretch for a
convincing victory. LOST THE MINISTER stalked pacesetter in between rivals on the back stretch, entered turn two wide off the rail, continued on that path
into the stretch and outfinished rivals to be second best. SOUND CHECKERS settled towards back of the pack early on the back stretch, asked for run three
wide entering the turn, came out of the turn widest and in the seven path finishing well. SKY GLORY broke out bumped rival at the start, stalked pace three
wide on the backstretch, took the turn three wide and entered the stretch in the six path, lacked needed response to improve position but bested rest of the
field. SIERRA ECHO chased lead on the back stretch, maintained rail position on turn, drifted out in to the three path in the stretch, drifted in late and
weakened. HE LIKES CURVES lacked speed early settling at the rear of the field, entered turn two wide, stayed on path throughout and passed tired rivals
under mild urging. ZINZAN stalked pace early on the inside, started losing ground on the turn, stayed on rail and continued to weaken, entered stretch not
asked and finished at the back of the pack. RUNAWAY INDY lacked speed and settled on the inside on the backstretch, entered turn on rail and continued
on rail lacking any response in the stretch while tiring.
