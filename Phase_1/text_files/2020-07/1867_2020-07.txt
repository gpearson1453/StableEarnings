Footnotes
HOPPER FILL vied for the lead while between rivals into the turn, continued to duel with the runner-up while moving closest to the rail, continued along the
inside and on near even terms through the lane then inched up near the wire. TIME HEIST brushed at the start, vied three to two wide throughout, was on
near even terms with a sixteenth to go then yielded to the top one late and settled for second best. APPROVED was close up early an into the turn while in
the two or three path, continued to chase the dueling leaders through the lane, could not gain on those two and settled for best of the rest. HIGH SCORE
stepped out at the start and brushed outside rival, raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and never was a
serious threat. THE MAIN FACTOR was along the inside throughout and never was a factor. SINGER MCGEE vied for the lead along the inside into the
turn, lost momentum after mid-turn and was found to have bled. LUCKY OLE SUN was always last while in the three path through the turn.

Footnotes
PALVERA chased the pacesetter while in the two path, bid near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared into the lane, opened a comfortable advantage
before the eighth pole and was kept to the task until late. NAUGHTY ALFRED chased the pace from the two path through the turn, was no match for the
winner and was kept to the task to be well clear of the next rival. AGGRESSIVITY was in the two to the four path through the turn then moved up for the
minor share while not a threat. ALLGRIT raced in the three path through the turn and never was a serious factor. SOUL SONG set the pace on a clear lead
into the turn, was put under pressure in late turn then gave way to all.

Footnotes
MY AGAPE stalked the pace from the two path through late turn, moved to the lead with minimal encouragement, widened to the eighth pole then was put
under a drive inside the eighth pole to continue to extend the advantage to the wire. CRAFTY JUSTICE was unhurried while in the three to the two path
through the turn, asked for more entering the lane and moved up to be clear for the place spot. ROYAL CHEYANNE saved ground through the turn, was in
the two path through the lane and improved position. REAL BELLA chased the pacesetters while in the two path through the turn, was asked for more near
the five-sixteenths pole then weakened through the lane. CUBBIE BEAR was fractious in the gate and needed to be removed, examined and reloaded,
broke awkwardly, raced near the back and was never a factor while widest through the lane. SPRING WAGER was never a factor while saving ground
through the turn. PREMIUM PASSION set the pace along the inside into mid-turn then faded along the rail. CAMBIO chased the pace while along the inside
and was empty entering the lane.

LOVE THAT SURPRISE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, dropped closer to the inside when straightening in the lane,
dueled with the pacesetter through the final eighth and inched up late. MATERS N TATERS set the pace along the inside into the turn, was put under
pressure by mid-turn, joined by the winner into the lane, dueled with that one while near the inside then could not keep up with the top one while clearly
second best. SHADOW OF JUSTICE was in the two path through the turn then moved up for the minor share while not a threat. PRINTER JAM was near
the rail through the turn then improved along the rail. TWISTED MIRACLE was never a serious threat while in the two or three path through the turn. PASS
THE BISCUITS chased the pacesetter through the turn and into the lane then faded through the lane. ORIENT MAGIC chased the pace near the rail
through the turn then was empty.

Footnotes
GOOD SUGAR vied three wide, bid at the eighth pole and was clear under confident handling. SON OF BATMAN hopped at the start, stalked in the four
path, rallied at the three-eighths pole but couldn't get to the winner. OSCAR P Q raced in the three path with a mild late bid. LUCKY B vied between foes to
the stretch. EMPIRE'S SCORE hit the gate, then improved position late between foes. SWEET TONIC bore out at the start, bumping a foe. UNBRIDLED
VICTOR was bumped hard at the start. COUGARTOWN BLUES was not a factor. CHUY saved ground before fading. TALK FAST led inside, then gave
way in the stretch.
