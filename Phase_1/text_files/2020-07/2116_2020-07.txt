foes to strike the front but was just outkicked. STAR OF THE NORTH broke sharply, set the pace on a clear margin along the rail racing into thje turn, but
weakened in late stages. FIREMAN'S LIL SIS settled into stride outside foes dropping out of striking distance and continued evenly into the stretch. SHE'S
EXALTED, off slowly, angled to the inside early and faded racing into the turn. ICYWILBURNYEH flashed brief pace between foes but gave way early. ME

CAVE RUN, unhurried in the opening stages, was prompted to gain terms with the pacesetter between foes approaching the turn, pressed the issue through
the bend, then edged forward under firm right handed encouragement. RAY'S ANGEL broke readily, was urged forcing the pace three deep racing into the
turn but proved no match for the winner late. AWESOME EMMIT, urged inside rivals disputing the pace, gave way into upper stretch. ROCKNROLL
ROCKET, off last, was settled outside foes, was fanned four wide into the lane but had no closing bid. EXECUTIVE DECREE was rated between foes
tracking just off the first flight, angled to the inside entering the turn and emptied out into the lane. WORD TO THE WISE tracked the leaders four wide early
and steadily faded nearing the lane.

COLLEGE QUEEN, urged inside rivals pressing the pace in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the turn, opened a comfortable advantage racing
into upper stretch and just held LUCKY LORRETTA under pressure. The latter was settled outside foes dropping out last in the opening quarter, was
prompted to advance four wide racing through the turn to upper stretch and was getting to the winner late. JOY IN THE JOURNEY, urged between foes
disputing the pace to the turn, couldn't match the winner and gave way into the lane. BRIGHT BLING, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages,
faded into the turn. BONNET tracked off the first flight between foes but had no closing response. KISS MY GRITS, bumped soundly at the start, angled to
the inside early while being urged in brief pursuit of the leaders but emptied out racing into the turn. CHICLE SPARKS broke inwards bumping KISS MY
GRITS, was quickly righted to join the pace three wide between foes in the opening stages but emptied out early.

ROW THE BOAT, reserved last in hand racing through the backstretch, switched outside foes entering the turn gathering momentum, advanced four, then
five wide into upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement. DERBYS
MONEYMAKER, bumped at the start, was held up off the second flight, switched out four wide on the backstretch while prompted to terms with the second
flight, shifted inwards on the turn pressing the issue outside the leader, gained the advantage between calls late but was collared nearing the wire. CIRCLE
ME BERT sped to the lead while angling inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail, dueled for command into the lane remaining a bit off
the rail but weakened late. PURPLE MONSTER broke inwards bumping DERBY'S MONEYMAKER, was righted to track off the first flight between foes
racing into the turn, angled inwards nearing the lane and faded in late stages. PHANTOM THREEONINE was settled off the second flight along the inside
early, shifted outside WINTERS RUN nearing upper stretch, then split foes just off the inside entering the stretch while making no real impression.
WINTERS RUN tracked the leaders inside foes in second flight, checked out of tight quarters nearest the rail racing past the quarter mile marker, then
swerved out sharply in the closing stages while failing to seriously menace. SIOUX VALLEY, urged three deep between foes tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the turn, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
VIVA FOREVER, in touch with the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders while angling to the inside on the backstretch,
tracked just off the leaders to the second bend, briefly awaited an opening leaving the midway point of the far turn, split foes just off the inside entering
upper stretch to bid for command nearest the rail and narrowly prevailed on the wire under brisk handling. KEENA tracked just off the first flight outside a
rival racing to the backstretch, advanced three deep on the far turn to bid for command racing into upper stretch, drifted out in late stages and just missed.
SHE MIGHT TELL was settled last to the backstretch, gradually drew into contention on the far turn, split foes racing into upper stretch, then was forced to
alter course four wide in the closing stages while finishing willingly to just miss. FAIRLY HONEST settled off the second flight while a bit wide racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four, then five wide into the lane but lacked the needed late kick. SANDY SANGRIA, urged to dispute the pace inside
foes racing to the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way. FLATOUTCOUNTRY, in touch with the first flight three deep attending
the pace in early stages, shifted in to press the issue between foes on the far turn and gave out into the lane. CITY GONE COUNTRY tracked off the first
flight along the inside to the backstretch but never gained contention.

Footnotes
DUSTY PRINCESS was settled last to the backstretch, continued under reserve to the second bend, gathered momentum splitting rivals nearing upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response to rally to the front three deep to go clear in time under firm right handed pressure. TAKE ALETTER
MARIA, forwardly placed attending a rival's pace in the opening half, was urged to press the issue outside that foe through the far turn into upper stretch but
proved no match for the winner late. WESTERN ATTIRE sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch,
dueled for command inside a rival on the far turn into the lane but yielded to the top pair late. STARFEST was rated along the inside as part of the second
flight, switched outside a rival racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane but had no rally. CATERINA IANO tracked off the first flight just
outside a rival to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn and steadily faded.

DOUBLETURBO broke readily to gain terms with a rival prompting the pace leaving the chute, took over leaving the midway point of the turn and drove
clear. DROP THE GLOVES exchanged bumps with ASTONISHING TWEET at the start, was righted to track off the first flight along the inside, switched
outside a tiring foe racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the place honors. MERANGO TANGO settled last in early
stages, swung out four wide nearing the lane, then angled in to gain a share three deep between foes late. ASTONISHING TWEET exchanged with DROP
THE GLOVES at the start, was urged to gain a narrow advantage while angling to the rail racing leaving the chute, dueled for command into the turn and
gave way after a half. FIVE STAR CREEK tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, continued three, then four wide into the lane faded nearing

Footnotes
MINNESOTA MIRACLE sped to the fore along the inside racing to the first turn, conceded the lead midway through the backstretch to track the pacesetter
under light reserve along the inside, switched outside that foe racing into upper stretch while moving to reengage for command and narrowly prevailed under
firm handling. EXPROMPT (FR) tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance nearing the backstretch,
took over midway through the backstretch to briefly gain a clear advantage, set the pace into the lane, shifted out resisting the winner to late stages but
came up second best. WHERE'S JORDAN was settled while angling inside early, swung out five wide nearing the lane and continued with a steady late
response to improve position. IRISH MAJOR angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, swung out four wide entering the far turn
while being prompted to advance but had no final kick. BUCKYS PICK, caught four wide racing through the first turn as part of the second flight, tracked the
leaders outside foes to the second bend and faded between foes into the lane. ASTOUNDING, caught wide racing into the first turn, settled out of striking
distance while angling to the inside, saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed final kick. MR. SHOOK, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off
the pacesetter, emptied out racing into the far turn. TWO CHANCE broke awkwardly, then was steadied after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GONE CRUISING was rated between rivals, then along the inside tracking just off the leaders in the opening half, was prompted to advance inside foes
nearing the far turn while exchanging bumps with RAISIN CANDY BAR entering the second bend, switched out while making steady progress to reel in the
pacesetter racing into upper stretch, then took over and went clear under firm handling. RAISIN CANDY BAR was rated off the first flight between rivals to
the backstretch, was caught in close quarters while exchanging contact with the eventual winner racing into the second bend, continued in pursuit of the
pacesetter three deep into the lane but couldn't match the winner's kick. TWISTED MAGIC, off a step slowly, was hustled to the lead outside foes racing into
the first turn, went well clear along the inside racing into the far turn, held sway into upper stretch but faltered nearing midstretch. BIG NORWEGIAN, altered
course avoiding some traffic racing into the first turn while prompted to forward placing three wide, continued in pursuit for a half and gave way into the far
turn. EMMETT CAT settled last early and failed to menace. MINNEAPOLISMIRACLE, urged through close quarters along the rail racing into the first turn,
switched outside the pacesetter nearing the backstretch to prompt the leader between foes for a half, was caught in close quarters nearing the second bend
and quickly emptied out.
