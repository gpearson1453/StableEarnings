Footnotes
HARVEST MOON went four deep into the first turn, settled off the pace, advanced outside, bid three deep approaching the quarter pole, cleared in the
stretch and drew away under mild urging. VELVET QUEEN controlled the pace from the inside, led clear to the quarter pole, vied with outside rivals two
wide into the lane and yielded to the winner. SHANGHAI TRUFFLES chased outside a rival then angled in on the clubhouse turn, inched forward from the
inside, angled out and bid between foes around the far turn and into the lane but proved no match for the top pair. MONGOLIAN WINDOW between foes
early then a bit off the rail, went between runners on the backstretch, ridden along at the three-eighths pole, lost ground three wide on the final turn and
weakened in the lane. TIZ WONDERFULLY went four wide into the first turn then angled in a path, raced off the rail to the far turn then angled to the rail,
saved ground into the stretch and lacked further response. GREAT RETURN stumbled slightly at the start, three deep into the first turn, stalked outside pair
on the backstretch, started to weaken and drifted out leaving the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLYING BUSINESS chased the top pair then went up to challenge inside, vied for the lead around the bend, moved clear near the quarter pole and
powered away under right-handed urging and steady handling late. SHERILINDA off alertly, pressed the pace inside the leader, vied between rivals around
the turn, could not match the winner into the lane and held the place. AWESOME AMANDA reserved in the early stages, went between rivals, crept closer
into the turn, ridden along around the bend, angled four wide and bested the others. REAL GOOD DEAL tracked off the inside, four wide into the turn then
three wide exiting the bend and showed a mild response in the drive. THUNDER WOMAN broke through the gate prior to the start, went four wide through
the turn and never rallied. MUSICALLY chased inside then a bit off the rail into the lane and had little left for the stretch. LA CROIX sped to the front, set the
pace with pressure to the inside, vied three deep on the turn and gave way. SINDY'S REVENGE went five wide through the turn and was never a factor.
BOOLICIOUS refused to the leave the gate at the start and walked off following the race. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF BOOLICIOUS
AND RULED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS BY REFUSING AT THE START AND IS DECLARED A STARTER.

Footnotes
DOMINANT SOUL dueled outside a rival for the lead, cleared around the clubhouse turn, led along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, urged
right-handed and held safely under hand urging late. NO SLO MO settled a bit off the rail, angled four wide around the far turn, closed fast but could not
reach the winner. COMRADERY (IRE) stalked a bit off the inside, went three deep on the backstretch, inched forward nearing the far turn, outside a rival on
the bend, came with a mild bid in upper stretch but flattened in the final furlong. COSMO broke out and bumped rival, stalked inside, tipped out and showed
a mild response. CAPITAL CALL put in tight quarters and steadied leaving the chute, traveled three deep into the far turn, four wide into the lane, came in
stretch and finished with late effort. RIO OCHO (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, traveled three wide into the first turn, stayed off the rail up the backstretch,
went three wide into the lane and improved position. POWER SOURCE (IRE) dueled inside then let the leader go around the first turn, stalked the winner to
the lane and weakened. OCULUS saved ground to the stretch and never threatened. NEWELL tracked along the inside, moved off the rail, went three
deeep into the stretch and was never a factor. INCH tracked between runners then outside a rival, three wide leaving the turn and faded. MUNNINGS'
PILOT tight and steadied leaving the chute, raced between then outside a rival, between foes into the far turn and into the stretch and failed to response
when asked.

Footnotes
NEGOTIATOR two wide and between rivals into the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, angled out four wide on the second turn, closed outside the leader,
cleared foe and won going away. MOST SANDISFACTORY had good early speed and angled to the inside, set the pace a bit off the rail, pressured into the
far turn, kicked clear again around the bend, challenged by the winner and could not contain NEGOTIATOR in the drive. WORLD AFFAIRS four deep into
the first turn, three deep up the backstretch, moved closer into the second turn, raced four wide then five wide into the stretch and finished willingly.
KAZANSKY chased off the rail, came with a mild bid at the three-eighths pole, went four to five wide around the turn and gave way. HAPI HAPI bumped
leaving the gate, stalked inside, pulled from the three-quarter marker to the around the eleven-sixteenths pole, bid inside past the half-mile marker, dropped
back on the turn and tired. ULTIMATE MYSTERY settled off the pace, raced four wide then three wide and lacked a rally. DRINK TO THAT knocked into
rival leaving the gate, traveled two wide, came out into the backstretch, four wide into the second turn and lacked further response. ZIYANAIR two wide into
the far turn, came out into the stretch and failed to rally. TWIRLING DERBY stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, tracked inside, saved ground into the
lane and was never a factor. MY SUNSHINE unhurried in the early going, dropped back on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and had little left.

Footnotes
LI'L GRAZEN in range early from the inside, angled out on the turn, bid outside the leader and gained command a furlong out and inched away to the wire.
A MELIS set the pace between rivals, cleared in the two path near the quarter pole, challenged again from the outside but could not contain the winner in
the late stages while clearly second best. WARM SUMMER steadied off heels early, raced off the rail, lacked room and steadied from the half-mile pole to
the seven-sixteenths, raced two wide then came out on the turn and four wide into the stretch, kept on and bested the rest. STORMIN RANGER up close
three deep, lost ground while four wide, shifted in at the eighth pole and weakened in the lane. ANNA FANTASTIC pressed inside to the quarter pole and
weakened in the lane. GIVE ME A HINT stumbled leaving the gate, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked rally. HOT ON THE TRAIL attended the
pace four deep, chased five wide around the turn and weakened. SILK FROM HEAVEN raced wide then angled in some, went three wide into the turn, four
wide leaving the bend, drifted to the inside in the stretch and never responded to urging. CLEARLY GONE four wide nearing the turn, angled into the two
path and never threatened.
