Footnotes
PRINCESS ROSIE stalked the duel around the turn, eased outside in mid stretch, took the lead and drove clear. ENYO saved ground around the turn,
swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. SUZZETTE STAR showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace and weakened the final furlong. OLD LINE
MAGIC lacked speed, was in the six path in upper stretch, passed tired rivals and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. HAIRSPRAY lacked speed, worked
between horses in the stretch and showed a late rally. BROADWAY TROUPER lacked speed, raced wide and failed to rally. AIM FOR THE STARS , three
wide on the turn, weakened. RYE STREET hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor. BEST MOON EVER bumped with TRINITY GIRL leaving
the starting gate, disputed the pace and faltered. TRINITY GIRL bumped with BEST MOON EVER leaving the starting gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , urged along while saving ground and in range of the dueling leaders, went through and inviting opening along the rail near mid
stretch, forged clear under right handed rousing near the sixteenth marker, kept on under pressure and held firm. NO MORE TALK , three wide nearing the
half mile marker, angled five wide into the lane, drifted out badly through the final furlong but was still able to close steadily and earn the place. KINGSTON
PIKE , off the pace two wide, angled four wide for the drive and rallied. LA MAQUINA GRIS , under urging from the gate, dropped well back in the opening
furlong, angled five wide for the drive and had belated interest. LION LORD sped to the front, set a pressured pace in the two path, had the winner threaten
from his inside in mid stretch then faded through the final sixteenth. ODDS ON forced the early pace three wide, failed to keep up mid turn and faded.
OUTPLAY , four wide stalking the early pace, bid three wide outside LION LORD near the three eighths, sparred with that one to mid stretch then gave way.

FAIR CATCH showed speed along the rail, sprinted clear in mid stretch and lasted under brisk urging. SHELLY ISLAND , in close quarters leaving the
starting gate, circled the turn, floated to the seven path near the eighth pole and rallied. CONFUSION BABY BOY , never far back off the rail, finished
evenly. ABSALOM , steadied leaving the backstretch, worked between horses in the stretch, had aim on the leader in mid stretch and flattened out.
KATHAK prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened. THE COTSWOLD WASP (GB) , shuffled back soon after the break, steadied in traffic
leaving the backstretch and was not a factor. STRIVE FOR A CURE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, floated to the six path in mid stretch,
weakened and his rider lost his whip late. TASKINAS was not a factor. WICKED SON , steadied in close quarters along the rail entering the turn, retreated
after that. FIVE CARD DRAW was no factor. INDIAN GHOST was outrun.

nearing the lane, emerged in a duel to the inside of CLOSER LOOK past the three sixteenths, wrested command a sixteenth out, nearly edged clear late
and held firm. SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN checked off heels near the three quarter pole, quickly recovered and stalked the pace, edged up between horses
near the half mile marker, sat patient past the five sixteenths, swung out in upper stretch and finished with good energy. CLOSER LOOK broke a bit slow,
dropped in soon after and settled, came off the inside leaving the five eighths marker, pulled his way forward five wide into the far turn, bid four deep
approaching the stretch, moved to a slim lead in upper stretch, dueled outside the winner past the furlong grounds then faded very late. SEVILLE BARBER
rated inside, eased out for run near the far turn, split rivals mid way on the final turn, shifted out past the three sixteenths but could only muster up a mild
response. DHARMASTER prompted the pace while saving ground, dropped back mid way on the final turn, shifted out in upper stretch but needed more
between foes. COLONEL MOORHEAD , three to four wide, was under pressure around the final turn then went evenly in the drive. CABINET PIK pulled
three wide to contention, bid outside the leader near the half mile pole. dueled between rivals nearing the stretch, stayed on to the three sixteenths then
gave way. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD drew clear early, set the pace two wide, took pressure past the half, dueled inside runners past the five sixteenths

LUCK MONEY rated forwardly while between rivals, dropped in and tracked to the inside of GOOD ON PAPER past the five sixteenths, awaited room into
the stretch, eased out and responded when a seam opened past the three sixteenths, forged through under strong handling, took over near the sixteenth
marker and was edging away. GOOD ON PAPER , taken in hand off the inside, edged up four wide past the five eighths, tracked leaving the far turn, bid
three deep under a ride into the lane, was floated out a path while dueling on near even terms in mid stretch, kept on gamely and was clear for the place.
SAILINGINTOTHEWIND prompted the pace three wide, went after the pace setter leaving the five sixteenths, dueled on a slim lead then drifted a bit
heading to the eighth pole, kept on battling inside the sixteenth marker then faded. DECIDING VOTE , rated off the pace while saving ground, was stalled
leaving the far turn, found room and angled out approaching the stretch, straightened and finished full of run. JUNE ANN (IRE) dueled outside a rival past
the three quarter pole, shook clear early backstretch, dropped in to set the pace, was joined by a SAILINGINTOTHEWIND past the five sixteenths, fought on
to mid stretch then gave way. WITTY BANTER , unhurried early while saving some ground, eased out into the lane, split foes near mid stretch and finished
with interest. DARLING'S CURE stalked to the inside, angled out around the final turn and weakened. ONE WAY PASSAGE steadied out of tight spot along
the rail soon into the backstretch, rated outside a runner into the far turn, swung six wide for the drive and offered a slight kick. DANCING TIL DUSK , five
wide into the first turn, was not a factor. CELEBRE (IRE) , between foes nearing the half mile marker, was under pressure past the three eighths and gave
way. COLERAINE dueled early on a short lead to the inside of JUNE ANN (IRE), rated back off that one then stalked, remained a presence to the far turn
then weakened. ALL'S FAIR rated back soon after the break, angled out and lost ground, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faded.

YLIKEDIS , nicely rated along the inner rail for six furlongs, eased outside in upper stretch, swept to command outside horses late and drove clear. SHIFRA
MAGICIAN lacked speed, rushed up five deep leaving the backstretch, challenged for the lead mid way around the turn, fought it out in the stretch and
faded late. SECURE CONNECTION , well placed down the backstretch, was three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed rally. FED UP FIRED UP ,
between horses leaving the backstretch, raced in the five path in the stretch and showed a mild rally outside rivals. FIONNBHARR , no factor, passed tired
foes. KITTEN'S FINEST , along the rail to the stretch, angled out and failed to be a factor. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD set a slow pace along the rail and gave
way the final furlong. OUR LITTLE JEWEL broke slowly, was rank on the first turn and leaving the backstretch. SUNRISEBERNSTEINI chased the pace two
wide and faltered.

widened his advantage under urging past the three sixteenths, wandered outward in the final seventy yards and held sway. BENINTENDI settled off the
pace while about four wide, angled wider into the lane, came under a solid ride near the three sixteenths and finished with decent energy. AIR ON FIRE ,
bumped at the break, settled off the pace three wide, angled seven to eight wide into the stretch, drifted out despite efforts with the right stick and rallied.
CAREY TIMES came in at the break and caused some bumping, raced under a snug hold stalking outside a rival, was under pressure chasing in upper
stretch but went evenly in the final yards. CROUCHELLI lacked speed, saved ground most of the trip and had belated action. SPARTY , bumped at the
start, raced between foes near the half mile marker, dropped in some around the turn, eased out and kept trying between rivals. OFF THE RECORD ,
bumped at the start, stalked to the inside and faded. COUSIN JIMMY , fractious in the gate, raced off the pace and outside near the half mile pole, angled
out late and failed to menace. LORDHAVEMERCY , bumped at the break, saved some ground leaving the three eighths, angled out four wide for the drive
and gave way.

Footnotes
RISING PERRY , four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three wide leaving the far turn, took the lead approaching the
eighth pole then drew off. TEAM EFFORT chased the pace outside NOBLE LION, gained a short lead in upper stretch, weakened but held the place. REAL
FACTOR , four wide the first turn, circled the far turn, was four deep entering the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and showed a nice late bid. UP
AGAINST IT worked between horses in the stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole then steadied when lugging in near the sixteenth pole. SKYJACKED ,
pinched back leaving the starting gate, had a late rally inside horses. BAYTOWN JIMBO , between horses in the stretch, steadied behind UP AGAINST IT in
mid stretch. BOLD TREK , just off the rail on the far turn, swung very wide in upper stretch and had a late gain. DETERMINED PURSUIT , four wide the far
turn, weakened. NOBLE LION set the pace along the rail and faltered the final furlong. ONCE IN A LIFETIME was not a factor. IRISH CROSSING , steadied
at the break, was outrun. HAZ A NOTION unseated his rider near the five eighths pole. An objection by the rider of BAYTOWN JIMBO against UP AGAINST
IT for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiyr concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.

THREES OVER DEUCES , patiently rated off the pace while saving ground, responded past the three sixteenths, forged through to the inside of the leader
leaving mid stretch, poked a head in front near the sixteenth marker and prevailed under a stiff drive. ONEMOREGREATTIME broke on top, set a rated
pace while handling outside pressure, shook clear two wide into the lane, widened heading towards the eighth, ducked out briefly from left handed asking a
sixteenth out, corrected and battled back gamely to just miss. TACO SUPREAM stalked outside a rival, eased out and took closer order four wide past the
quarter pole, brushed with COMPLETED PASS soon into the lane, gave hard pursuit with aim leaving the furlong marker but failed to seriously kick on.
LEWISFIELD rated two wide behind the leaders, came under pressure into the stretch, failed to go on near mid stretch and faded. COMPLETED PASS
prompted the pace outside ONEMOREGREATTIME, drifted out some entering the lane and brushed with TACO SUPREAM, straightened to chase past the
furlong pole then weakened. BALLIVOR broke a bit slow, raced off the pace and off the inside, was under a ride mid turn but failed to respond.

Footnotes
CRAZY KATER stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, took the lead in upper stretch, was challenged by CARK in mid stretch then dug in
tenaciously to prevail. CARK , unhurried early, raced outside foes down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, bid for the lead near the eighth pole
then hung. SEVILLE ROW , angled in early, saved ground on the turns, eased off the rail turning for home, bumped with BOB'S GLORY in upper stretch
and rallied between horses. STRIKING IT LUCKY lacked speed, raced outside horses in the stretch and rallied mildly. LIFESPAN set the pace along the
inner rail and weakened in the drive. STORM TOWER hugged the inner rail stalking the pace and weakened. MY MOONSHINE , reluctant to load into the
starting gate, lacked speed and encountered traffic leaving the backstretch. BOB'S GLORY , a forward factor outside the pace setter, weakened into the
lane and bumped with SEVILLE ROW in upper stretch.
