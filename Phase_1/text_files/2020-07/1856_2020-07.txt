DEVOTION IN MOTION moved to a clear lead midway on the backstretch, stayed inside around the turn and was under brisk urging through the lane.
CRAIGGER chased the winner, ran out some entering the turn then continued evenly to the end while clearly second best. LUNAR CYCLE was slow early,
steadied in tight along the rail midway on the turn and outfinished the others while no threat. THE TRAIN was slow early, swung out leaving the turn and
gained mildly. LUPI was close to the front into the turn then tired. LORRI'S CANDY wasn't far back in the three path into the turn and stopped in the lane.
LEGENDARY BID stopped three wide.

STRAIGHT MADNESS was prominent early between rivals, raced the two path around the turn, angled to the inside entering the stretch, bore out under left
hand whip, bumped JERSEY LIFE in midstretch and was best after a stiff drive. JERSEY LIFE raced four wide with the pace into the turn, dueled two wide
into the stretch, was bumped in midstretch and gave way. TIME IMMEMORIAL steadied in tight two wide between rivals entering the turn, remained two
wide into the stretch, edged out and finished willingly. GETWITHIT was slow early, raced the three path around the turn, edged out in the drive and gained
late. SOBEIT SYLVIA was slow early, stayed well out from the rail around the turn and closed willingly outside. HURRICANE PATRICIA was close up early
along the rail, steadied in tight entering the turn and regained ground through the lane. TAPPING THE KITTY raced three wide around the turn and lacked a
significant closing. PARANOIA came out from the rail on the turn in an even effort. GIVEN ACHANCE moved through rivals to gain command nearing the
seven-sixteenths pole, angled to the rail on the turn and had nothing left for the drive. BAYANNE raced far back after a slow break.

LYDIA SWEETIE moved to command from between rivals before a half, drew out on the final turn and widened under brisk urging. ZANDORA came out
from the inside once clear near the five-eighths pole, made a run three wide around the final turn then flattened out in the lane. FOLK MAGIC steadied
between rivals nearing the five-eights pole, raced three wide around the final turn and lacked a strong closing. An objection by Chiappe against the second
finisher was not allowed. MISS FORESTER was slow to find best stride and failed to threaten. GIA ALEXA was no factor. ELAN stopped and was eased up.
CHAPEL OF CHIMES stopped and was eased up. PATTY MAC'S GIRL dueled for about a half, stopped and was eased up. HIJINKS advanced readily
outside on the backstretch, stopped after five furlongs and was eased up. SHACKLE ME GOOD was caught wide around the first turn, stopped early and

HOCKEY PUCK was rated two wide outside the early leader, was sent after that one into the far turn, was carried wide into the stretch and was narrowly
best after a long drive. SHANGHAISCHOOL stayed just out from the inside with the early lead, ran out into the stretch and continued with good courage
once displaced. YES IT'S ROO settled early, came out into the five path on the final turn, circled into the stretch and was clear of the others while unable to
gain on the top two. KNOWN QUANTITY was slow to settle then came between tired ones through the lane. JONATHANTOQUICK was slow to settle then
made a belated run outside. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA tired inside. GIACOMO'S THIEF wasn't far back three wide, gave his best on the final turn then

LORD OF HOPE was prominent between horses, raced two wide around the turn and surged to the front late. BAGWELL settled in the two path and was
going fastest of all at the end. INHONOROFTHEMOON broke slowly, was hustled inside to duel then gave way late. RICO CHARGES was slow early,
stayed along the rail, closed late then was vanned off after the finish. WHERE'S THE BEN'S was slow early then made a strong late run along the rail.
RIVER FLYINRED RVF raced the three path in an even effort. FEEL THE THUNDER was no factor. A T M AWESOME raced with the pace into the turn
and was finished after a half. BLUEGRASS BANDIT was reluctant to load then showed little.
