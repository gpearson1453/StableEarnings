Footnotes
ZIPPED CODE angled outside before the half, bid wide into the stretch and gamely prevailed following a long drive. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY was in tight
along the rail into the far turn, split foes rallying into the stretch, led but was outfinished. SUNSHINE WILD forced the pace outside, edged to the front
midway on the final turn but weakened. WIRELESS FUTURE trailed for half a mile, moved wide on the final turn then flattened out. LUNAR ROVER earned
a narrow lead inside for five furlongs then gave way. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE was fanned wide into the first turn, remained wide and stopped.

ROSE OF DUBLIN saved ground, fell back on the far turn, eased out and rallied again, took the lead and was clear with a furlong to run then lasted. MIJA
BELLA saved ground while outrun, swung out into stretch and closed well. JANELLE DREAMS, racing just off the rail, rallied after a half but then flattened
out. DISCREET CATHY, between rivals early, shook loose to be clear on the final turn then faded. NOT IN THE MOOD steadied into the first turn, saved
ground and was no threat. HEART BEAT AWAY, very wide into and rounding the first turn, remained wide and tired. DRIVEN BY SPEED was outside early,
split rivals on the backstretch then tired. TWITTER STORM, in the four path, had only brief speed.

STAY SPECIAL settled inside, commenced her rally before the half, bid outside, led in mid-stretch and lasted while drifting out through the final furlong.
SWEET BLAME advanced behind the winner on the final turn, split foes, angled inside the winner and just missed. PECAN PATTIE stalked the pacesetter
outside, led near the quarter pole but weakened. SILVER EXCESS broke alertly and led inside, was collared on the final turn and weakened. CARAMEL
CREAM dropped back early, moved wide on the final turn and lacked a rally. CHEVY TO THE LEVY saved ground within striking range and was finished
after half a mile. CAT GIUMARELLO urged close up three wide briefly then gave way readily.

SAIL AT SUNRISE saved ground to the stretch under a rating hold, angled very wide to secure room into the stretch then surged late with energy in reserve.
STASH MY MONEY lacked speed, moved near the inside in the stretch, altered course outside and closed strongly. BARINGER SPRING bid closer wide
into the far turn, led in the stretch then yielded. ESOR allowed to settle early, showed some late energy while no threat. MANOLITO sprinted clear early,
was engaged by pair on the final turn and weakened. REPEATED PROMISE fanned wide on the first turn, rushed to contention then faded. AMERICAN
QUALITY pursued the loose pacesetter then proved empty in the stretch. SCORPION DYNASTY bid three wide into the far turn then lacked a further
response. BRILLIANT WORTH lagged far behind throughout. BREW DOG trailed badly from the outset. Due to the rail behind moved 22 feet out fractional
times were unavailable.

Footnotes
THE ROBERT was reserved inside, rallied on the final turn, eased out into stretch then drifted out wider and was taken in hand late. TERRY'S CHARM
raced off the rail and then angled in after a half mile, took the lead on the final turn, also drifted out through stretch and was no match. LOST IRON set the
pace in the three and four path, allowed rival to rally to the lead near stretch, drifted out badly stretch and gave way. LUVINMEISEASY stalked the pace two
wide and tired. O'KRAM, three wide vying for the lead, tired. As per ruling 20138pp from the Pa Racing Commission, The Robert was dq'ed for a positive
test.

Footnotes
ZIPPY allowed to settle inside, moved out on the final turn, was carried very wide into the stretch but surged late to get up in time. ATTA KID trailed early,
advanced inside, swung out into the stretch and continued gamely. WINE AT THE BEACH controlled the pace inside, widened in the stretch then weakened
in the final furlong. PAUL THE WAITER lacked speed inside, bid into the stretch but was outfinished. KOAN chased wide off the leaders, rallied on the final
turn then faded. SEVILLE BARBER saved ground close up awaiting room, secured space on the final turn but flattened out. HIGH FLYING GUY dropped
back early and was always outrun. SENSATIONAL ZIP pressed the pace outside for five furlongs then stopped abruptly.

LOAN ME YOUR EAR, between rivals early, eased out racing into stretch, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and edge away. RULES set the pace just
off the rail, drifted out through stretch and lasted for place. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE, wide and just off the pace, battled gamely but had no late gain. JOHNNY
WISHBONE split rivals into stretch and finished well. SILVERZAR came out leaving the gate bumping rival, stalked between foes and then tired. LOUIE'S
WISH, bumped leaving the gate, failed to menace. ANOTHER SMARTY, between rivals early, moved out wider and was no factor. VAL'S MY GAL, wide
and just off the early pace, tired. SNOOPY'S BID broke slowly, saved ground and tired.
