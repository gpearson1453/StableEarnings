a narrow lead on the turn and was worn down late. FASHION FACT chased while four wide, dueled on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. HER
WAY OR NO WAY led early, lacked room on the turn, was checked at the five-sixteenths marker as a result and could not recover the lost ground.
DREAMINGNDIAMONDS forced the pace between rivals and weakened. SCIOTO'S SHOES took no part. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS

COLONEL TALBOT stalked, responded leaving the far turn and was all out under stiff pressure. FUDGE TOUGH led early, was headed leaving the far turn
and stayed on gamely. QUINN ELLA saved ground and went evenly. R V T THUNDER ROAD reserved, advanced on the far turn and came up empty in the
stretch. WATCH ME SOAR chased along the inside and weakened. YAK was always outrun. YORK ROAD did not factor.
