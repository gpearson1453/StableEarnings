ALWAYS A TIZ set a well handled pace from the start, drew off and was kept to task in the end. SISTER SHIRLEY chased the early pace while two wide,
made a bid but was no match for the winner in the end. GODDESS OF WONDER stalked the pace while inside on the turn but was no menace in the
stretch. CATS DIAMOND swung out to be four wide in upper stretch and was no threat. GOSPEL JOSY JAN was unhurried early then raced inside in the
stretch and was no threat. MY PASSWORD was used up and gave way.
