Footnotes
DREAMING OF CURLIN broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained a clear early margin, remained clear through the tun, was challenged by
MANDOLINE STAR upper stretch, dueled with that one through the drive, responded and inched away late. MANDOLINE STAR forced the early pace from
the inside, inched closer entering the turn, dueled with the winner but could not match strides. GLITTER TIME chased the early pace from the inside,
remained forward for the drive but was no match for the top two. LOUISIANA SPECIAL chased the early pace inside but had nothing for the drive. TWN
PALMYSDESTINY was never a factor. SOUTHERN GALAXY went evenly. BET ON DEE trailed throughout.

eighth pole and was just up the final stride in a well handled effort. SWIFTY CAT stalked the early pace from the inside, advanced through the second turn,
responded to duel through the drive, gained a short margin deep stretch but was caught the final strides. OURGOLDSHALAYLEE pressed the early pace
from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, dueled through the drive but could only last for the show. MILA'S GOLD stalked the early pace from
the outside, steadily advanced through the second turn, responded but just missed the show. SAGE'S EPIPHANY could only improve position. ZYANARA
was no factor. MISS BILLIE K dueled from the outside then tired in the drive. THE LUMBER GAL forced the early pace and faded. DRAMA SPECIALIST

Footnotes
BRAVE DAISEY broke sharp from the inside, quickly gained a clear early margin, dueled through the turn, remained engaged entering the drive, responded
and inched clear late. KARATE HOTTIE forced the early pace from the outside, dueled with the winner through the turn, remained engaged with that one
but could not keep pace while just lasting for the place. FORT POLK pressed the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but
just missed the show. MISS PERDIDO KEY chased the early pace inside but had nothing for the drive. YONNA SHE GOES showed little.
