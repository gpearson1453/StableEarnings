Footnotes
TALES OF WAR moved up from between rivals to share the lead from outside on the backstretch, took over with a half mile left, moved clear of the rest into
the second bend, was roused leaving the quarter pole and proved much the best while kept to a drive the last furlong. CUT TO ORDER kept close from
outside, commenced his bid on the second turn, drew clear for second leaving that bend, was no match for TALES OF WAR when set down for the drive but
was unchallenged for second. AMERICAN SUCCESS steadied along the rail on the first turn, did not keep up from inside on the second bend, came off the
rail some for the stretch run and passed between tiring rivals to pull away for the show. LEFT COAST DREAMS trailed from outside, was just off the rail
taking the second turn, fanned outside AMERICAN SUCCESS into the lane and failed to have a significant response. K STREET was hustled to vie for the
early lead between rivals, gained the inside on the backstretch then began to tire after a half mile. JAGUAR RIDGE contested the pace between horses, did
not stay with TALES OF WAR after a half mile, took the rail into the second bend and steadily faded the last two furlongs. Due to a timer malfunction, the
race was hand timed.

Footnotes
RANGOON ATTACK settled back from crowding at the break, was put to a drive along the rail on the turn, got through inside the tiring JAM UP inside the
last furlong and edged ahead of MEETMEINSTLOUIE the final fifty yards. MEETMEINSTLOUIE shared the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the
bend, angled outside JAM UP leaving the turn, took the lead inside the final eighth but lacked the extra needed through the waning yards. COUNTRY JO in
contention between horses on the backstretch, angled out on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, closed well, was too late but clearly best of the
others. JAM UP shared the early lead from between rivals, moved clear and stayed just off the inside taking the turn then began to tire upper stretch. ELIZ'S
HOPE was prominent from outside on the backstretch, in path four on the bend and began to tire before finishing a half mile. SOUTHERN ATTACK in
contention from inside on the backstretch, began to give way with three furlongs to go. BARBIELLO was an outside factor early but faded on the turn. GO
PADDY JO broke slowly and outward and showed little staying well off the inside. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
PARA VIVIR kept close from inside, took the advantage along the rail nearing the quarter pole, lengthened command when roused upper stretch and
continued to open up while kept to task in the late going. MY FOUROONE KPLAN pressed from between horses, went for the lead three wide on the turn,
was no match for PARA VIVIR when set down for the drive but steadily pulled away for second. B N A NATIVE GIRL made her move four wide on the bend
to loom a threat with two furlongs to go but drifted out several times the last eighth. BOOHOO SUE in contention early between rivals, faded two wide on the
turn. ELIZABETH'S FEVER well placed from inside, did not stay close on the turn, fanned out for the stretch run and had no late bid. ARCTIC MUSIC broke
in stride and sprinted clear, was challenged from both sides nearing the turn and gave way two wide before finishing a half mile. BANG showed little. Due to
a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
LESLEY'S SONG broke on top and set a pressured pace well off the rail but inside rivals, moved clear and stayed just off the inside on the bend, floated out
some entering the lane and lengthened command under a drive. CHROME ATTACK well back early, picked up her pace after two furlongs, had the rail on
the bend, swung out widest for the drive, angled in midstretch, moved clear for second soon after then drifted out in the late going. TRIPLE SCOUT pressed
the pacesetter from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up leaving the turn and gradually wore down the last furlong. SISTER RULER displayed early
speed between horses, also did not stay with LESLEY'S SONG on the bend, moved to the rail nearing the quarter pole then gradually faded. ANGEL'S RUN
unruly in the gate, showed little. Due to a timer malfunction, the final time of the race was hand timed.

Footnotes
EADS BRIDGE was hustled to the early lead, was challenged from outside on the turn, roused with a quarter mile left, moved clear upper stretch and held
sway under steady handling. SIMPLY FAST prominent from outside, went for the lead on the turn, loomed a threat leaving the bend, did not have enough in
the stretch but proved easily second best. G CITY WARRIOR advanced from inside to reach contention and gain third on the turn, angled outside SIMPLY
FAST entering the stretch then could only pull away from the rest. SWIFTY CAUSE chased from off the inside, took the rail into the lane, progressed to
midstretch then leveled off. AMSALOR was soon well back, stayed off the rail and only improved position between horses the last furlong. BELLA MY ELLA
pressed EADS BRIDGE from just outside but gave way after three furlongs. GLORY BEYOND REACH dwelt in the gate at the start, made a small leap from
the gate when she left and showed little. WARY CARRIE well placed inside, retreated with three furlongs to go, angled outside midway on the bend and
continued to fade.

Footnotes
THE ROUGE DIESEL settled off the inside for a half mile, picked up his pace after that, was widest taking the second turn, rallied from the middle of the
track upper stretch, altered inside for a clear path with a sixteenth left and got up in time. KHOZAN'S VALENTINE pressed COUSIN DARIO from just
outside, did not keep up on the second turn, bore out midstretch, was straightened, took the advantage with a sixteenth left but was outfinished. COUSIN
DARIO broke alertly, showed the way from inside, was let out some on the second bend and lengthened his lead then steadily drifted out the final furlong as
he began to wear down. BEHIND ENEMY LINES broke a step slow and outward, was settled the first half mile, commenced his bid two wide on the second
turn and gradually closed the gap between rivals through the stretch. DAVKA chased while toward the outside, moved to the rail on the second turn,
advanced to midstretch then leveled off. GOLDEN DRILLER pressed COUSIN DARIO from outside to the second bend then began to tire. ITALIAN CHARM
failed to menace in a wide trip.

Footnotes
WILDCAT LITE rated on the front end from outside, was let out three wide leaving the turn then gradually opened up under mild urging the last eighth.
GREAT GRET vied for the early lead just inside WILDCAT LITE, could not stay with that one in the lane, slowly wore down but lasted for the place. BAD
MOON settled at the back, picked up his pace just off the rail on the turn and found best stride too late from inside through the stretch. BARNYARD
FIDDLER chased from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, altered out five wide upper stretch for a clear path and was closing the gap the last
eighth. CITY POSITION jostled with EL CAMINANTE as that one came up in tight quarters nearing the five-furlong marker, was checked behind the latter
midway on the backstretch, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, still had a striking position with a furlong left but leveled
off instead. YABA DABA DOO prominent just off the rail, also jostled with EL CAMINANTE when that one rushed up in tight quarters approaching the
five-furlong pole, came off the rail some on the turn, was three wide entering the lane, still threatened with an eighth to go but could not sustain his bid.
STEALIN' SUMMER failed to menace in a wide trip. AFFIRMATIF SONG in contention early, faded four wide on the bend. EL CAMINANTE hesitated at the
break, rushed up to be caught in tight quarters between YABA DABA DOO and CITY POSITION approaching the five-eighths pole, was squeezed and
jostled briefly, broke through to vie for the lead inside GREAT GRET but gave way after three furlongs.
