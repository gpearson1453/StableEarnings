Footnotes
GRAZEN VALOR sprinted clear going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by JADED TIGER nearing the quarter
and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. FULL SPEED AHEAD was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and
was up for the place. TAP THAT SPOT was bumped at the start, pressed the pace from the inside, checked nearing the half mile marker, angled out into the
lane and finished willingly. MISS VANJIE NATION was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked
the needed late response. I WANT ONE broke out to bump rival, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run
and did not offer a bid. JADED TIGER was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
STANLEY RYDER lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. BLEU MUSKET
settled off the leaders early, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with late energy. MAGIC MAHOGANY raced four-wide through the first turn,
settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished willingly. BIG HEATER stalked the
leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained a brief lead and gave way in the drive. MY FIRST TRIP was
away alertly to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. WARM LAKE DUDE disputed the pace with MY FIRST TRIP for a
half and weakened. HIGH POINT was off slow, lugged out through the first turn and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
DREAMCATCHER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached MR BINGLEY with a furlong to run, vied with that rival
and proved best in a stiff drive. MR BINGLEY disputed the pace while racing three-wide, was engage by the winner in mid-stretch, vied with that foe and
gave way grudgingly late. SOLAR HEAT lagged early, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with late energy. ATTERCOP lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and was not a factor. LAST ONE STANDING pressed the pace while racing
four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. JACKSON TELLER showed brief speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and weakened. LIL' CHIEFTAIN was away alertly to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.

TIME FOR GOLD was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and was ridden out to be kept to task.
MANAGINGBRIANNA settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly held the place.
LA PANZANELLA was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late
energy. IN THE VAULT was bumped at the start then forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. LETS
DECLARE PEACE was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further with a furlong to run and finished
evenly. SWEET KATIE O raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY broke sharply to
press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

Footnotes
LOLO PANIOLO lagged early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady handling and was up in the closing yards.
IGOTTABOOBOO was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by the winner late but could not resist
that rival in the final yards. LANSKY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. HARD TO DENY disputed
the pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. TIZ MANNY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually weakened.
HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL was forwardly placed from off the rail, angled out into the stretch and weakened. MY GRANDPA lacked early foot, raced six-wide
through the turn, bumped with his stable-mate in mid-stretch and was not a factor. RAISE THE WOOF was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
turn, bumped with MY GRANDPA with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid.

sway to the wire. NATIONAL HEROINE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly. SIGRID'S GOLD was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn, came out to bump CALESE in mid-stretch and finished
evenly. WHY ARE U SO SWEET broke awkwardly then was allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn, angled in and out in mid-stretch and finished
well when clear. DAZZLING DEBBI raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. EXCESSIVE BELIEF broke
inward, raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. JADEY AT THE BAR showed no early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. CALESE pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, was not urged after going a half, was bumped in
