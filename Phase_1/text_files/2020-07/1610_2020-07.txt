Footnotes
BACANO settled in the middle of the field early, shifted out four wide near the quarter-pole, kicked in through deep stretch and was up outside HARD
COUNT in time. HARD COUNT broke in bothering SIR HOSKI, pressed the pace outside GRAND MORELAND, challenged turning for home, drew clear
entering the final furlong but was overhauled at the wire. BAHAMIAN PARK broke out and was slow to begin, tracked three wide outside the leaders, and
lacked a solid bid with an even finish. HERO UP raced forwardly inside to the stretch, and had no rally. GRAND MORELAND set the pace inside, and
yielded in upper stretch. BARBIE'S KING was no threat through an even effort in the second flight. SIR HOSKI got shut off at the start and was far back for
six furlongs, and made no impact. RHYTHM WITH SOUL was never a factor. NORTHBROOK was outrun inside. RUSSIAN WINE was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
SOCIAL EXCLUSION broke to the lead and moved inside, shook off GEM THIEF on the turn, and widened under a strong hand drive through mid stretch.
KAY'S PROJECT was bumped between horses at the start, hugged the rail throughout and finished well to best the others. GEM THIEF bumped with
BEACH CHICK at the start, pressed SOCIAL EXCLUSION from outside, was put to a drive outside the quarter-pole, made no impression and weakened.
UYUNI broke out and bumped I GET IT at the start, raced three wide and was no threat through an even effort. I GET IT got bumped by UYUNI at the start,
raced four wide and lacked a bid. BEACH CHICK bumped with GEM THIEF at the start and was off slowly, came five wide off the turn and improved past
tired horses. TEQUA raced four to five wide on the turn, and never reached contention. CRYSTAL COAST broke in bumping KAY'S PROJECT and was off
slow, and never got close. ABUELA CORI retired early. DANCING IN FIRE bumped with KAY'S PROJECT at the start, and dropped far back nearing the
stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR waited behind the leaders into the turn, shot through on the rail to seize command five-sixteenths out, quickly opened daylight on the
field and was kept driving to 70 yards out. WORTH AVENUE forced the pace between horses in the three-path on the turn, and was just up for the place.
PECAN PATTIE stutter-stepped out of the gate and got bumped by SHE TAKES HEART, cut the corner following in the wake of TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR
turning for home, and was nipped inside WORTH AVENUE for second. SWEETLY MAID grabbed the lead with a sharp start, left the rail open and was
quickly overtaken soon after going a half-mile, and gave way. SHE TAKES HEART bumped with PECAN PATTIE at the start, pressed the pace in the
four-path, and was through at the top of the lane. NYMUE'S TREASURE trailed and dropped far back after a half.

FUDDLED (IRE) broke in and grabbed the lead inside, shook clear around the turn, and widened through the stretch under a drive. AVUNCULAR bobbled
at the start and recovered bumping into MADDOX, had the rider lose the whip midway on the turn, chased the winner home the rest of the way and was
best of the rest. MADDOX got bumped by AVUNCULAR at the start, raced three wide into the lane, lacked a solid response and was up for the show.
EFFIEMEISTER was hemmed in along the inside entering the turn, stayed on the rail with room through the lane, and finished one-paced. DA MOOSE IS
LOOSE was finished early. CROSS TEA steadied behind FUDDLED at the start, and was always outrun. PERTINENT showed brief speed three wide, and
tired before reaching the stretch.

SANDYS BLAZE vied outside NIMBLE BEAST while going the better of the two around the turn, gained the upper hand under a mild drive through the
furlong grounds and widened under confident handling. SEMPER FI was sent up inside early and followed behind the leaders, moved out for the drive and
was up for the place. NIMBLE BEAST contested the pace inside SANDYS BLAZE to the stretch, was no match past the eighth-pole and lost the place late.
GREENMOUNTAINMAN chased outside the leaders three wide, and faded in the stretch. MY COUSIN JOE dropped back in the two-path early on the turn.
ROJO GRANDE hit the right side of the gate and was off slowly, dropped back four wide after a half-mile, and was eased up in the stretch.

OVERDELIVER vied outside SQUEEZADIOS from the start, finally got the best of that one in deep stretch, and staved off an outside bid from I'M A G SIX to
take a hard-fought decision. I'M A G SIX raced between horses on the turn, had aim outside the battling leaders through the stretch, and just missed.
SQUEEZADIOS contested the pace inside OVERDELIVER from the start to deep stretch, and yielded on the rail through the closing yards. OUTSHINE
prompted the pace three wide for six furlongs, and weakened. GLORY OF FLORIDA stayed close inside for nearly six furlongs, and tired.

KOZY DREAMS ranged up four wide to join the leaders five-sixteenths out, kicked clear after a half-mile and was kept busy widening through the stretch.
SENSE A MILLION raced in the two-path much of the way, could not menace the winner but finished well to clearly best the others. NAPA RULES was
bumped by FAST VENEZUELA at the start, pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, and faded. MARCHING IN broke out bumping FAST VENEZUELA
into NAPA RULES, lodged a mild bid along the rail late on the turn, but flattened out through mid stretch. AMELIA MADELYN lunged at the break and was
off slowly, raced wide and was always outrun. FAST VENEZUELA got bumped into NAPA RULES by MARCHING IN at the start, set a pressured early pace
in the two-path, and folded up approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
HOPONTHEBUSGUS moved out unhurried entering the backstretch, rallied up four wide to join the leaders late on the far turn, battled outside rivals
through the lane and edged clear late. YAKO prompted the pace outside SWEET BLOSSOM, bid for command midway on the turn, fought between horses
through the lane and yielded late. TRILBY was reserved for six furlongs, loomed along the rail turning for home, but was outkicked. VALLEY DATE raced
three wide around the turns, finished evenly and could not pick up the leaders. COLONELS DAUGHTER saved ground far back for six furlongs, moved out
to the three-path in the stretch and found her best stride too late. SWEET BLOSSOM established an easy pace inside, and yielded readily at the top of the
stretch. OUR CLOSURE was never involved. BAHAMA KITTEN stayed close three wide to the end of the far turn, and tired. SPICY NELLY was always
outrun. ADMIRAL'S WIN was far back throughout.

Footnotes
MASERATI MAN stayed in range four wide for a half-mile, lugged in slightly while rallying up to join the leaders from outside in upper stretch, caught GEMO
with a furlong remaining and moved away under pressure. GEMO contested the early pace outside GRAN CASIQUE, cleared and moved inside past the
three-eighths, fended off a challenge from BEYOND GONE turning for home, could not deny the winner but held well for the place. BEYOND GONE tracked
the leaders three wide, lodged a mild bid outside GEMO after a half-mile, but flattened out through the furlong grounds. KHOZY MY BOY saved ground
early, moved out approaching the stretch, and made no headway staying on his left lead. GRAN CASIQUE vied inside GEMO early, gave way on the turn,
and dropped far back. AIN'T WASTING TIME showed little.

Footnotes
UNCLE CURLY was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace outside JEEKER JOE for six furlongs, wrested command in mid stretch, and edged
clear on his left lead. RED FOG moved in under a firm hold going to the first turn, waited in traffic around the far turn in the two-path, and finished well
between horses to get up for second. GOOD TIMING MAN got taken up sharply on the rail as RED FOG came over into the first turn, swung out four wide
approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly outside. JEEKER JOE was three wide moving to the lead around the first turn, cleared off and moved inside,
battled inside UNCLE CURLY turning for home, and weakened through the late stages. VINCITORE had the three-path on the turns, and gained mildly late
between horses. SPINNING KITTEN bumped with VINCITORE at the break, then brushed with PLEASE SIT DOWN, trailed early inside, moved out five
wide nearing the stretch, and rallied belatedly on the far outside. SON OF GREATNESS went along under a firm hold two wide for six furlongs, and lacked
the needed late response. PLEASE SIT DOWN brushed with SPINNING KITTEN at the start, moved out five wide late on the far turn, and made no impact.
STREET LEGACY raced in the second flight mostly three wide to the stretch, and could not reach contention. MR TITO'S hit the left side of the gate and
was off slowly, moved inside leaving the far turn and made no headway. TIZ LUNA advanced three wide midway on the far turn, but weakened after six
furlongs. GATOR FIFTY TWO relinquished the lead to JEEKER JOE after a quarter-mile, stayed close to the end of the backstretch, and retreated around
the far turn inside.
