drive. DIXIE DRAWL , three deep around the turn, chased the winner and finished evenly. KICKSTARTER showed speed between horses, was rated back
leaving the backstretch, swung wide in upper stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and failed to menace. COURT SKY prompted the pace outside the

Footnotes
WALK AWAY JOE rated off of a contested early pace, edged up towards the rail near the far turn, angled out mid turn, bid four wide to command into the
lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch and proved much the best while kept to task. COLONEL MOORHEAD stalked four wide outside rivals, took
closer order under pressure into the turn, was fanned seven wide into the lane, straightened and churned on willingly to earn the place. THE WALK rated
close up three wide, raced four wide past the three eighths, was floated out a bit wider into the lane, gave willingly pursuit past mid stretch but came up
empty late. GREEK PRINCE advanced inside rivals leaving the chute to take command, took outside pressure, dueled from the far turn to the head of the
lane, kept on with interest past the furlong grounds then faded. RUMSON RALLY lagged far back for six furlongs, saved some ground past the quarter pole,
eased out under asking and had belated action. TAPPAHANNOCK disputed the pace outside GREEK PRINCE, wandered outward approaching the stretch,
failed to keep pace past the quarter pole then faltered through the final three sixteenths. An objection by the rider of COLONEL MOORHEAD against the
winner for alleged interference entering the stretch was not allowed.

GIGGLING grabbed command early and set the pace off the inside, spurted away under coaxing after a quarter mile, widened the advantage mid turn,
wandered out to about the five path entering the lane, was corrected with right handed rousing and remained well clear while kept alert. PURRAGEOUS
DYNA dropped well off the early pace, came three wide for the drive, leveled off to her best stride through the final furlong and gained the place in the final
yards. CRUISE AND DANZE broke a step slow, quickly recovered and prompted the issue to the inside of the winner, saw that one get away mid way on
the turn, came back under urging near mid stretch but flattened out in the final sixteenth. LIMITED VIEW stalked well off the rail, was under urging mid turn,
circled seven wide into the lane and faded.

CAR LADY , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside RYE STREET in upper stretch and drew away while kept to her business.
RYE STREET sprinted clear early, saved ground around the turn, failed to match strides with the winner while clearly best of the others. WHY NOT YOU
lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained near the rail through the stretch and passed tired foes. MOLLY BOLTS , pinched back leaving the
starting gate, circled the turn, was five deep near the quarter pole, drifted out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. I AM AINE bore in leaving the starting
gate, was taken to the inner rail on the turn and gave way through the stretch. LA RUBIA bobbled slightly at the break, chased the pace three wide around
the turn and gave way. FREE FALLING came out leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn and was no factor. PADRINA dropped back in
upper stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
HALFINTHEWRAPPER broke alertly, set a rated pace two wide while handling some outside pressure, moved clear and came out a bit further out into the
lane, straightened and responded to stout left handed asking past mid stretch then dug in to stave off JUDI BLUE EYES. JUDI BLUE EYES rated behind
rivals early on, edged up between runners mid turn, angled out soon into the lane, kept on grinding in game fashion but just could not get up in time.
RAPIDASHQUEEN moved up three wide outside the winner and forced the pace, failed to match strides with that one entering the lane but kept giving
willing effort to the line. RAGTIME SUZY rated in range while saving grounds, was under coaxing past the quarter pole but lacked a legitimate response. MY
LILA dropped back after an alert beginning, raced well off the pace leaving the far turn, angled wide and had some late interest. PINS AND NEEDLES ,
reluctant to load, pursued four wide and faded. MERRY MAID gave early chase between runners and faltered.

Footnotes
EARNED IT stalked off the rail, was under heavy pressure past the three eighths, bid between rivals near the three sixteenths, kept on under strong
handling, inherited the lead to the inside of THREETHEHARDWAY with about forty yards remaining and held firm. THREETHEHARDWAY settled inside
early on, eased out advancing past the half mile pole, circled six wide into the lane, ranged up outside rivals to take command approaching the furlong
grounds, drifted in briefly before being straightened, remained in front under some hand encouragement with a sixteenth to go, had his rider let up for
several strides allowing EARNED IT to take over then was unable to recover in the final yards. SAPPHIRE SHILLING broke a step slow, was hustled up
between foes soon after and gained a stalking spot, saved ground mid turn while giving hard pursuit, raced inside rivals into the lane but lacked a solid
finish. BONDURANT tracked the pace four wide, was fanned a bit wider into the lane, drew on near even terms while between runners past the three
sixteenths, failed to sustain past the eighth pole and faded. POSTERITY lost ground five wide and came up empty. BELTWAY BOB , unhurried early, swung
five to six wide and lacked a solid finish. COSITA RICA cleared early, set the pace three wide into the lane, was taken on from both sides leaving the quarter
pole and tired.

Footnotes
M. J.'S LADY , in hand waiting for room leaving the turn, turned for home in the two path, challenged for the lead inside SKI BUNNY near the eighth pole
and proved best. SKI BUNNY , forwardly placed outside horses, circled the turn four wide, challenged for the lead at the head of the stretch and hung.
TONAL VERSE lacked speed, raced between horses in the drive and passed tired ones. SING ALONG SUZY chased the pace three wide around the turn
and gave way. AIN'T NONE LUCKY showed speed two to three wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. PEACHY BETWEEN US
showed speed along the rail and weakened.
