Footnotes
BERNIE SPECIAL broke sharp from along the inside, dueled through the turn, shook off that foe entering the stretch to be well clear, kept to task while
steadily increasing advantage to the wire. EXTRAPOLATOR broke in but in good order, closest to the dueling leaders through the turn, chased the winner
home to prove no match, clearly second best. JOE DIVER last away, raced back and off the inside, rallied from between rivals turning for home, along for
the show, no threat to the top two. VISIONS OF GOLD settled in mid pack early, improved slightly into the lane, flattened out the final furlong to lose the
show. BEAUX VICTORY broke back, raced outside and off the pace into the turn, began to fade soon after while racing wide. SAINT SCOTTY fell back after
the start to trail, continued sluggish around the turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest after the issue had been decided. CRUSADER EXPRESS
moved up to duel outside the winner through the turn, stopped in the drive, lugged midstretch, well back.

Footnotes
RELENTLESS DANCER pressed the leader off the inside, challenged between rivals far turn, floated the runner up out late in that bend, drifted out a bit
through the lane, fully extended. SYDSTER forwardly placed well off the inside, continued to stalk in the three path up the backstretch and into the far turn,
challenged outside the winner soon after, floated out by that rival turning into the stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the wire, far clear of the others. JAX
MAN settled off the pace and the inside, in the two path through the final turn, no match for the top two in the drive. FREEDOMFI void of speed, four wide
into the lane, made little impact. UNWANTED INTRUDER last to leave, moved up to narrowly show the way first turn, continued to set the pace the middle
half, gave way in the final turn when headed by the top pair.

Footnotes
MIRABEAU with the early pace between horses, saved some ground while narrowly showing the way into the lane, shook clear through the lane under
steady handling. BEYOND D'ORO asked to keep up early while three wide, continued to vie while between horses and outside the winner turn, could not
keep up with that through the stretch, remained well clear for the place. PLATINUM QUEEN with the early pace while widest, brushed when four wide into
the bend, lost some ground to the top two through the turn while continuing outside that pair, one paced through the lane to save the show.
KISSMELIKEUMISSME in the second flight while out in the strip, traversed the turn in the three path, proceeded to race evenly through the lane while slowly
gaining for the show. PERFECT PEACH behind the leaders while racing outside, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. MA CHER AMIO
forwardly paced early between rivals, brushed when in tight quarters entering the turn, steadied and fell back, did not recover. STREAMER void of
speed,raced back and was never a threat. SHELLEYS A WARRIOR off a bit slow, raced five wide through the turn and remained back. MISCHIEF GIRL
was finished early, trailed home.

NO QUARTER broke with the leaders, narrowly set the pace toward the inside, two path out of the turn and in the drive, led late, caught. ONE TOUGH
CHARLIE broke on top, forced the issue early while between horses and outside the runner up into the turn, fell back off that rival through the bend,
continued evenly in the drive, narrowly missed the show. CAJUN UP broke well to be with the early leaders, fell off that first flight before a furlong, went one
paced to the wire in lacking a closing response. PEPPER JACK reluctant to load, broke with the leaders, vied early three wide, gave way before three
furlongs. CHAD'S AUTUMN KING broke a step slow, raced off the early pace along the inside under restraint, was let out a notch and moved clear while
continuing to save ground late in the turn and into the stretch, lodged a brief bid inside the runner up along the rail past midstretch, failed to following
through with that attempt and narrowly saved the show. SPECIAL STORM broke back and failed to menace. SATURDAY'S GOLD forwardly placed in the
run up the backstretch well out in the course, fell back off the leaders while in the four path through the turn, set down for the drive, came again late while
remaining well wide to be up in time. FINEST SABER fell back after the start to trail throughout, never a threat.

MARIAH'S GALAXY within striking distance while three wide into the first turn, maintained contact with the first flight in the run up the back straight, ranged
up closer four wide turning for home, took over past the furlong marker, dug in late to narrowly prevail in determined fashion. NET A BEAR unhurried while
saving ground, continued back into the far turn inside, swung out widest exiting the final turn, closed the gap considerably with a sixteenth to run, saw that
progress on the winner stall a bit in the final strides to miss. IS TOO broke on top, prompted the pace with in the three path, took over on the outside of the
lead pack in the far turn, showed the way into the lane, could not repel the top two late, well clear of the others. YES GORGEOUS away well, rank while
showing the way past the wire the first time, contested the pace while between horses the middle half, gave way into the stretch. SMOK'N RITA moved up
inside the leader to take over before a quarter, narrowly set the pace most of the middle half mile and also faltered when the real running began turning for
home.

SNOWBALL outrun for three furlongs off the inside, three wide into the lane, steered out widest for the drive, found another gear late down the middle of the
strip to be up in time. SAINTS N MUSKETS also settled well off the early pace outside, four then five wide through the turn, set down for the drive, closed
with the winner on the leaders while inside that one, could not match strides with that same foe late, clear for the place. PLAY UNIFIED off a step slow,
raced well back just outside the winner, remained behind that rival into the lane in the four path, roused, finished willingly as well to pick up the show spot.
OUR LOST LOVE away in good order, narrowly set a lively pace along the inside, continued to show the way through upper stretch then began to falter to
lose several positions late. TENSAS THOUGHT within striking distance off the inside, crept a bit closer three wide turning for home, little left in the late
going. GALAXY THIRTYSIX second flight inside, moved out, lacked a closing response through the stretch. ECHOESOFTIME broke alertly, prompted the
issue off the inside, challenged between horses into the stretch, vied past the furlong marker then gave way. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS void of any early speed,
two path turn, lacked a rally. DR LIZ away in good order, pressed the issue early through those glib fractions then backed up in the drive. SUZIE'S DREAM
was finished after a half.

SHANG was allowed to settle behind the three leaders toward the inside, moved out and came four wide for the drive, set down, closed with good resolve to
be up in time while between horses at the wire. TREYS MIDNITE MOON cut off at the start, also settled behind the pace, moved closer behind the winner
into the far turn, followed that one into the straight, switched out when straightened for home, finished up willingly while widest of the first flight to narrowly
garner the place. TREVILION forwardly placed while three wide around the first bend, continued to prompt the issue in the run up the backstretch off the
inside, challenged and put a head in front upper stretch, held on gamely to the end and just missed the place while inside the top two at the wire. BUDRO
TALKING dropped to the inside past the wire the first time to save some ground, lacked speed, moved back to the outside entering the stretch, stagerd a
mile rally well out in the course to improve position. GRAND LUWEGEE pressed the issue in the two path, had little left when the real running began at the
head of the lane. IN THE NAVY broke out but alertly, was straightened to show the way into the first turn, continued to set the pace along the inside until
headed entering the stretch then gave way. REMEMBERMIS made little impact in remaining back. MAGEEZ was always outrun while racing off the inside.
PURIM KING trailed, showed little.

Footnotes
LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG never far back while racing outside, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, edged away through the lane under
steady handling. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK also forwardly placed from the outset, challenged and vied between rivals through the turn, gave ground
grudgingly to the winner through the lane inside that one, clear of the others. MONTE MAN broke back, moved up inside to a forward position before a
furlong, steadied along the rail a half mile out, fell back, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, got through and finished well to be clear of the others.
DOUBLE BARREL MAN off a step slow, void of early foot, three out to four wide turn, widest in the drive, improved position. RECKLESS RANSOM
forwardly placed early, fell back after a quarter, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late punch. MY WISE CAT lacked speed and was never dangerous.
BERTIE'S GALAXY off a bit slow, moved out and lodged a middle move to reach striking distance by late in the turn then faltered in the drive. A FLASH OF
COPPER broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace for just under three furlongs then gave way when headed by the runner up midway on the turn.

Footnotes
VACHERIE GIRL within striking distance off the inside and in hand, continued to stalk three wide up the backstretch, moved to challenge in the three path
turning for home, long drive, enough left late to hold the runner up at bay. SOUTHERN LIAISON also forward from the start, moved to engage the leader
from the outside after a quarter, helped set a soft set of fractions, responded when the winner came alongside in the second turn, proved stubborn to the
end to prevail for the place. QUIKFAST N AHURRY lacked early foot, moved closer in the second turn, angled out four wide exiting the final turn, finished
willingly to be slowly getting to the top two while outside that pair at the wire. SABER CUT broke on top, raced forward early, rated the middle half, saved
some ground in the second turn then came up empty for the drive. SEBS PRINCESS last away, raced in mid pack after moving outside, four wide into and
through the final turn, roused a quarter out, also found lacking through the stretch. GATOR PROUD broke well, narrowly showed the way off the inside first
turn, moved inside, soft set of fractions, gave way in the drive. JET SWEEP in some traffic while rank and under a hard pull into the first turn, fell back to
trail, no rally.

Footnotes
BALOOK broke back, lacked speed, in some traffic and between horses late in the turn, got through, challenged inside the furlong grounds and exploded
late to quickly draw well clear. ALL STAR ROCKET broke alertly, set the early pace, continued to be clear through the turn and upper stretch, briefly raced
on equal terms with the winner with less than a furlong remaining then proved no match late, narrowly saved the place. ROSE CROWN forwardly placed
along the inside, advanced to challenge inside the runner up turning for home, flattened out in the late going to be outkicked for the place. ICY CHARLIE
void of early foot while racing off the inside, moved out to be four wide for the drive, clear sailing outside, closed well while too late. EXPLOSIVELY HOT
void of early foot, inside, continued to save ground in the turn when moving closer, within striking distance a furlong out, flattened out late. LAWSUIT LUCY
lacked speed, raced four wide and between rivals through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. GUILTY CONFESSION away in good order,
prompted the issue off the inside for three furlongs then had little left for the drive. STORMY MERLOT broke with the field, raced in mid pack and between
horses, lacked a closing response. SPELLBINDING last to leave, raced back and outside, five out to six wide through the turn,improved only slightly in the
drive. MISS UNDERRATED in the main group while well wide, five path through the turn, tired in the drive. JO JO'S HALO fell back to trail after the start,
