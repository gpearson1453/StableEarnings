Footnotes
SOBER PEACE, urged to the lead along the inside while shifting a bit off the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the turn, angled back to the rail
midway through the turn and repelled a challenge from COWGIRL COURT racing into the stretch to go clear under firm handling. The latter broke sharply,
prompted the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch but proved only second best
in the drive. MARLEY BE GOOD, held up avoiding close quarters in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and continued with some interest
to improve position. LINDA ON MY MIND, urged to a forward position along the inside racing just off the pacesetter, was urged to advance along the rail
entering the turn, steadied out of close quarters midway through the bend while altering course three wide and had no closing response. BABY GORDITA
vied briefly pursuing the leaders four wide into the turn, was carried wide nearing the lane and gave way. HOT BRANDI, urged three wide between foes in
pursuit of the leaders, drifted out midway through the turn and quickly gave way. CLEVER CRIMINAL settled last and failed to menace. FOLLOWING THE
RACE THE RIDER OF LINDA ON MY MIND LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE BY THE WINNER MIDWAY THROUGH THE
TURN BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

BODENHEIMER broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin while angling to the rail, forged clear nearing upper stretch while shifting off the inside
and was kept to steady encouragement. DRIED PEPPER, urged along pursuing the pacesetter between foes into the turn, steadily lost position to the
winner nearing the lane but bested the others. LOYAL AND TRUE, urged three deep between foes pursuing the pacesetter to the turn, lost ground to the top
pair while angling inside on the turn, shifted out entering the lane and continued well enough to prevail for a share. COASTAL WATERS tracked the leaders
along the inside, saved ground to the lane and continued evenly. TUFFENOUGHTOSTART settled last and passed only tiring rivals. TWIRLING ROSES
broke slowly and proved no threat. ONLY LONELY made brief pursuit of the leader racing four wide to the turn and gave way early.

Footnotes
NORTHERN PLAYBOY angled to the inside racing through the backstretch tracking just off the leaders, shifted out nearing upper stretch, angled four wide
entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to just edge BANDURRIA on the wire under firm handling. The latter ducked out at the start,
quickly recovered to stalk just off the first flight three wide, moved to wrest command nearing upper stretch, took over entering the lane, then grudgingly
resisted the winner to the end but just missed. BOBBY BOOTS, urged prompting the pace between foes racing to the turn, gained a narrow advantage
nearing upper stretch but yielded late. WORN A BIT ducked inwards at the start, was righted, then urged along the rail disputing the pace on a narrow
advantage into the turn, but gave way into the lane. SLIM CHANCE, carried inwards a bit at the start, tracked the leaders from out of striking distance along
the inside but lacked a rally. SAN VALENTINO, steadied out of close quarters at the start, dropped out last and failed to menace. WALKERS MEMO
retreated early.

ALWAYS COOL was rated off the second flight to the backstretch, gained striking distance three deep between foes nearing upper stretch and continued
with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm hand urging. L' CRISTABAL tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, advanced to
press the issue outside foes nearing the far turn, gained a clear advantage racing past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF
settled well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out four wide on the far turn and continued to make mild progress
while gaining a share. GOLDEN SCEPTOR, urged along the rail contesting the pace to the backstretch, conceded the lead after a half to track the leaders
along the inside but had no late bid. TRI SPOT broke slowly, settled last to the backstretch, angled five wide entering the lane but made no impact. FRONT
OFFICE, urged prompting a rival's pace, dueled for command inside rivals into the far turn and gave way. PAINTED CANYON tracked the leaders inside a
rival in second flight, was pulled up nearing the half mile marker and was vanned off the course.

SWEET MEDICINE was rated along rail tracking the first flight from out of striking distance to the backstretch, steadily gained contention along the inside on
the far turn, switched outside DRAMA CHORUS nearing midstretch and wrested the advantage from that foe late under pressure. The latter pulled his way
along the inside prompting a rival's pace to the backstretch, went clear into upper stretch but was collared late. J P WARRIOR, reserved along the inside,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. MARK IN GREELEY tracked outside foes in second flight, angled out four
wide racing into upper stretch but had no late bid. BEE BRIDGE, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way into the
lane. SILVER MAKER settled outside foes, offered no rally. BRILLIANT BABY settled between foes and never seriously menaced. BLAME IT ON JR, urged
three deep prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
SLEWS HYMN broke inwards bumping BIG MAN BOB, angled to the inside in early stages, pulled his way between foes to gain a position just off the
pacesetter nearing the turn, continued with a steady bid to take over leaving midstretch and kicked clear under firm encouragement. WEEKEND RIDE was
urged to the lead while angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, shifted out resisting the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but
proved only second best. HARD TO PARK settled near the inside in early stages, shifted out to gain position between foes on the turn and continued well
enough to gain a share. SHIPMAN'S SONG tracked off the first flight while angling to the inside racing into the turn but had no closing bid. BIG MAN BOB,
bumped at the start, settled near the inside and failed to menace. PLEASANT MOON was a brief factor four wide in second flight but faded into the turn.
HURTS SO GOOD, forwardly placed three deep stalking the pacesetter, gave way midway through the turn.

Footnotes
OUTRUN THE POSSE, in touch attending a rival's pace under light rating in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch and edged
forward in time under firm handling. GREAT SKY tracked off the second flight along the inside, advanced along the rail nearing the lane, came through
inside foes midstretch to challenge inside the winner and just missed. SHADES OF VICTORY sped to the fore, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the
far turn, dueled between foes through the stretch grudgingly resisting the top pair but just missed. SPIRIT MISSION tracked just off the first flight along the
inside, drifted out despite correction nearing upper stretch and continued evenly between foes in the closing stages. HEAT FLASH tracked off the first flight
outside foes in early stages, was prompted to challenge three deep nearing the lane but soon flattened out. CLASSY INDIVIDUAL settled well off the
leaders racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. BUYMEABOND settled off the inside to the backstretch and never gained contention. MESA SKYLINE
trailed.

Footnotes
BRANDY CHASER broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival to the backstretch, edged forward racing into upper stretch and maintained the
advantage under pressure. RUN AWAY FLASH angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing the
lane to challenge the winner in late stages but proved only second best. BREEZE E PRADO, urged to dispute the pace inside the eventual winner from the
outset, dueled to upper stretch and weakened late while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share. GOTTA LIL CAPTAIN settled outside foes racing to
the first turn, angled to the inside on the far turn gaining some position, then switched out lane while finishing on even terms with a rival for a share but
lacking the needed closing bid. HANALEI SUN reared at the start while breaking very slowly, was hustled to a contending position along the inside, was held
up avoiding close quarters racing into the backstretch, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being urged to challenge but came up empty racing into
the lane. RAJA'S APPEAL, caught three, then four wide racing to the backstretch, soon retreated. YOU GOT THE LOOK switched out three wide while
prompted in pursuit of the leaders through the first turn and emptied out early.
