Footnotes
MY PROJECT GIRL chased pace comfortably in the three path on the backstretch, angled in early in turn, causing rival to steady, entered stretch along the
rail and rallied well for the win under steady urging. REAL KEEPER vied in between for the lead on the backstretch, held her position throughout the turn
entering stretch in the three path, faltered in deep stretch and just held second. MISS NAPPER TANDY chased pace along the rail on backstretch, held rail
position entering turn and steadied due to rival making it tight early into the turn, reengaged after and rallied gamely along the rail just missing second.
ANNITASHEAVEN settled behind pace three wide, stayed three wide entering the turn, went wider approaching the stretch ending up in the five path, and
responded to urging making up ground late. SIX EIGHTEEN vied for lead inside along the backstretch, maintained position throughout until drifting out
entering stretch into the two path, and lacked response when asked in the stretch. DIOSA vied for lead three deep on backstretch, stayed three wide on the
turn, entered stretch in four path and tired readily in the stretch. ASEM lacked speed and settled in the four path along the backstretch, stayed wide
throughout the turn, coming into the stretch seven wide and had no response in stretch.
