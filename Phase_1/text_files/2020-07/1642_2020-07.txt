Footnotes
YOUGOTTABEKITTEN sprinted clear soon after the break, set the pace along the rail, was challenged in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously to held sway.
MAYAN QUEEN hugged the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, eased out for the drive, challenged for the lead in mid
stretch and hung. MELISANDE saved ground around the far turn, remained inside horses through the stretch until angled outside near the sixteenth pole
and rallied nicely. KATE CARMACK , three wide the first turn, advanced four deep around the far turn and flattened out. I AM AINE chased the pace
between horses and weakened. SAY YES DI DI , wide turning for home, failed to rally. SISTER SEVILLE , pinched back leaving the starting gate, was three
wide the first turn, five deep the far turn and lacked a rally. THUNDERTURTLE was outrun. ROYALGLITZ , four wide entering the first turn, was outrun.
NOTROUBLEATALL , three wide the first turn, chased the pace and faltered.

Footnotes
HIZAAM stalked the dueling leaders, responded when given his cue mid turn, bid four wide outside foes approaching the stretch, battled outside GIRLS
LOVE ME leaving the three sixteenths, moved to a slim lead inside the furlong grounds and proved best after an extended drive. GIRLS LOVE ME gained a
short advantage early on, dropped in and set a pressured pace, ceded command leaving the far turn, dueled past the five sixteenths then regained the lead
into the lane, was headed just past the eighth pole but fought valiantly to the end. ALWAYS FORGIVEN hesitated at the break and spotted the field several
lengths, regrouped and edged up nearing the far turn, chased outside a rival mid turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and churned on to just nab the
show. MYSTERIO , towards the inside mid turn, eased out and kept giving effort to the wire. HERO'S RETURN attended the pace outside GIRLS LOVE
ME, moved to a short lead departing the far turn, could not shake free around the turn, ceded command into the lane, gave way in mid stretch and
wandered outward. BOAT OVER THE HILL lagged inside and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CAM'S CARTER dropped in to about the two path nearing the half mile marker and was taken to rate, edged up in hand past the five sixteenths, responded
when asked soon into the lane, rolled up outside rivals heading to the eighth pole, forged clear under left handed encouragement and steadily widened from
there. TAUBER eased out early and was taken under some rating, moved up two wide into the lane, chased past the furlong grounds and continued with
interest while nabbing the place at the wire. BOURBON STREET vied outside a rival before opening up a half mile out, dropped in and set the pace, was
joined soon past the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly. THATWOULDBEGRAND broke a step slow, lagged off the pace in about the two path,
eased out to split rivals in upper stretch and had belated interest. MOON WATCHER , towards the inside past the three eighths, angled out four wide
approaching the stretch and lacked a bid. DONTMESAWITHSISTER lacked speed, saved ground into the lane but failed to menace. TASTES LIKE PLAID ,
between foes leaving the far turn, angled out and lacked a kick. NO FOOLING DUDE had speed to the inside, rated back off the leader heading towards the
half mile marker, stayed towards the inside and dropped back past the five sixteenths. STREET PRAYER settled outside rivals, circled four to five wide into
the lane, failed to respond, faded and was eased late.

Footnotes
LAGOM stalked the pace down the backstretch, slipped through along the inner rail to take the lead mid way on the far turn, drew off and waskept to her
business in the drive. LASKA lacked speed, slowly moved up on the far turn, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. NOT MY MONEY , four deep on the
far turn, moved up in upper stretch and failed to sustain the bid. UNSTOPABULL BELLE , four deep the first turn, chased the pace, advanced in the three
path on the far turn and faded in the drive. BEYOND PRETTY failed to menace in an even effort. SOPHIE RULES set the pace, raced in the two path on the
far turn and faltered. GRAND ENTRADA was not a factor. THIRSTY AGAIN chased the pace and gave way. WHY NOT YOU was not a factor. DUCKY
hesitated at the break and was outrun. PADRINA , unruly behind the starting gate, raced three wide the first turn and faltered.

Footnotes
KICKSTARTER , in range and to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, angled out to advance between rivals into the lane, shifted further out past the
three sixteenths, closed determinedly under a drive and forged ahead in the final yards. ROYAL THUNDER had speed inside, eased back to stalk, crept up
to the inside of horses nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and closed between rivals to get the place in the last few strides. ROBBER BOB , three wide
outside the leader, seized command in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive in mid stretch, held grimly to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly.
CONFECTIONER , four wide outside rivals, ranged up to loom a solid presence in mid stretch but hung late. H R H JELLYBEAN sped to the front, set the
pace in about the two path, handled outside pressure around the turn, relinquished command soon into the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then gave
way. PARDON THE PUN , four to five wide, made a mild run with the winner nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on and faded in the final three
sixteenths. AUCHINCRUIVE , unruly pre race when unseating his rider, broke slowly, ducked in towards the gap, corrected to save ground while off the
pace, continued inside through the drive and had a slight response. SPANISH SKIES , off the pace, raced two wide into the lane and failed to menace.
FIRST FIGHTER , three to four wide, faltered in upper stretch and was eased in the final furlong. EAGLE KEEPER saved ground off the pace, angled out
mid turn and came up empty. NICKY BEAR circled four to five wide and gave way.

MORE OR LESS accelerated to the early lead, hugged the rail under confident handling, was set down near the eighth pole and prevailed under steady
pressure. BETHABARA saved ground around the turn, swung outside SUNDAY RED when that one drifted out near the eighth pole and rallied. GENNIE
HIGHWAY lacked speed, raced near the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. SUNDAY RED chased the winner, drifted out near the eighth pole and
weakened. JUDI BLUE EYES worked between horses in the stretch and was not a factor. PINS AND NEEDLES , outside horses turning for home,
weakened. IN CLASS , unhurried, was wide leaving the turn, steadied in tight quarters in mid stretch and offered some late action. MILLIE CHILD , no
factor, passed tired horses. TWIRLING WIND weakened. TOMA , bumped leaving the starting gate, was very wide leaving the turn. GOT BLUES (FR) ,
wide around the turn, gave way. ODDSEVERINURFAVOR , steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, raced wide on the turn and failed to be a factor.

HARPERS FIRST RIDE broke a bit slow but recovered and cruised up to the inside of rivals to entertain the pace, battled with ALWAYSMINING AND
CORDMAKER from the three quarter pole, was scrubbed along to maintain position past the three eighths, shook clear near the three sixteenths, widened
under a hearty drive in mid stretch then held firm late while kept to task. TYBALT , unhurried early as the leaders battled up front, swung six wide for the
drive and closed willingly. NAME CHANGER , just off the three pronged battle and to the inside of a rival, eased out four wide while under pressure into the
lane then churned on between runners. HONOR THE FLEET stalked the leaders four wide, was under a ride mid turn, angled wider and kept on with
interest. CORDMAKER vied between foes for a long way and weakened in the final furlong. TATTOOED settled off the pace, saved ground most of the trip
but lacked a solid response. ALWAYSMINING , with the pace three deep, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and faltered.

Footnotes
CANNON'S ROAR , lightly bumped by EPITOMIZE leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace outside BICKLEY, overtook that one entering the stretch and
was kept under urging. ARANSAS stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn four wide, raced on his left lead in the drive and
rallied. SPEED GAME stalked the pace racing near the inner rail, angled to the two path turning for home, advanced between horses to the eighth pole then
flattened out. BICKLEY , quickly clear, set the pace along the rail and weakened. EPITOMIZE lightly bumped the winner at the break, raced between horses
in the stretch and was no threat. TEN EYCK , two wide between horses on the far turn, failed to rally. J BERESFORD TIPTON , steadied behind horses
approaching the first turn, swung outside leaving the backstretch, raced very wide into the stretch and came up empty. CHATEAU DE VIZILLE was not a
factor. MISTER FRANK'S WAY , three wide the first turn, remained well off the rail and weakened after six furlongs.

Footnotes
LIMITED VIEW drifted out soon after the start, corrected and pulled her way clear, set the pace well off the inside and under rating, came five wide into the
lane, kept on under solid handling the final furlong and held sway. DEEP RED , taken to rate, saved some ground while off the pace, got through to the
inside of rivals in mid stretch and kept on willingly to earn the place. THREE HAWK , bumped and in close at the break, regrouped and settled off the pace,
circled five wide into the lane and rallied mildly. CRUISE AND DANZE broke a step slow then steadied when in tight, edged up off the inside heading to the
half mile marker, circled four wide into the stretch, moved up in mid stretch, kept trying but edged for the show. GRACE ISABELLA stumbled and bumped at
the break, saved ground, eased out past mid stretch but failed to threaten. FOXY MISCHIEF reared in the gate when fractious pre race, came away in good
order, stalked the winner, was under pressure between rivals into the lane and weakened. Objections by the riders of CRUISE AND DANZE and GRACE
ISABELLA against the winner for alleged interference leaving the gate were not allowed

Footnotes
BEANTOWN BABY stalked the pace, gained command in upper stretch and drew away while kept to her business. LITTLE SKIFF had a mild rally inside
horses. CAN THE QUEEN sprinted to the early lead, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail in the stretch and faded. CAROLINA ICE bobbled at the
break, saved ground on the turn and had a mild rally inside foes. MARY'S JEWEL failed to be a factor after checking in tight quarters near the five eighths
pole. MAGICAL LUNA was no factor. MERRY MAID , caught in tight quarters near the five eighths pole, angled in, saved ground on the turn and weakened.
JENN'S THE BOSS , steadied in traffic leaving the backstretch, circled the turn four wide.
