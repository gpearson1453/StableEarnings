Footnotes
SPARKY VILLE stalked from the inside, angled out in the drive, rallied outside the top pair and got up three deep at the line. BOMBARD set the pace inside
while under pressure, dueled into and down the lane, drifted out late and finished gamely to the wire. BAJA SUR pressed outside, moved closer and headed
rival rival near the quarter pole, took a short lead a furlong out, drifted out late and got outfinished between rivals in the final moments. BLITZKRIEG off a bit
slow, tracked outside a rival, three deep or four wide into the stretch and failed to respond when needed. CALEXMAN up close outside the top pair, went
three wide around the turn, between rivals in the lane and never produced a bid.

Footnotes
VODKA TWIST pressed the pace outside, dropped back a bit and chased up the backstretch, bid alongside the leader into the far turn, dueled and gained
the lead near the quarter pole, put away that rival to the inside then held the runner-up at bay. DEBT MONGER brushed leaving the gate, reserved in the
early stages, raced two wide, went between runners on the second turn, angled four wide leaving the bend, closed from the outside but was not enough to
best the winner. ALL I CAN SAY pulled early to around the half-mile marker, angled out into the stretch and summoned a late effort to earn the show.
SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE three wide into the first turn, tracked off the rail, five wide into the far turn, six wide exiting the bend, showed a mild response and
picked up a minor award. BODEGA three wide into the first turn, trailed off the inside, moved further out nearing the second turn, six wide into the bend and
seven wide into the stretch then passed tired rivals. GO FOR A RIDE broke out, sped to the front and set the pace off the inside, inched away on the
backstretch, dueled two wide around the second turn, relinquished the lead near the quarter pole and weakened in the final furlong. ROGALLO stalked
inside, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. LINFIELD bothered by GO FOR A RIDE leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival then off the rail, came
out on the turn and five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG CHEDDAR stalked from the outside, bid alongside the leader around the turn, led into the stretch, challenged by MOANA LUNA in the drive and held
well. MOANA LUNA tracked off the inside, bid four wide on the turn, pressured the winner in the drive but lacked the needed late punch in the final
sixteenth. HUDSON RIVER PARK settled early while widest up the backstretch, crept closer around the turn, came four wide into the lane, drifted in late and
held the show. SHARP SPEAKER chased from the inside, came out into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and finished willingly. FIGHT ME sped to the
front and crossed over, angled to the rail on the turn, lost command into the stretch and weakened. AIR JOCKEY stalked inside, angled out around rival and
came two wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. SANTIAGO'S TOWER between runners into and around the turn, exited the bend four wide and
weakened. BOBS BLUES MAN chased inside, saved ground around the turn and also weakened. PAPA LORENZO chased off the inside, went four wide
into the stretch and was never a factor. BOLD EFFORT settled early, dropped back on the turn and tired.

DESTINY'S JOURNEY set the pace near the inside, showed the way two wide into the stretch and remained clear. FIRST EMPRESS in range of the lead
fro the inside, moved a bit off the rail, chased two to three wide into the lane, could not threaten the winner but was clearly second best. MANRESA settled
off the inside, advance up the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn and bested the rest. INFO'S TREASURE settled inside, moved out on the
backstretch, split foes around the final turn, came three to four wide into the stretch and showed a mild rally. SAMANDAH stalked outside, lost ground
around the far turn, raced between rivals then three wide into the lane and weakened. MISS BENNET tracked off the rail, raced four wide and came up
empty in the drive. ESTABLISH JUSTICE two wide around the first turn, steadied past the three-quarter pole, tracked near the inside, two wide into the lane
and eased in the drive. TRUTH PREVAILS broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased between runners then took back briefly, continued between foes
on the backstretch then outside a rival on the far turn and was eased in the stretch. PASITO four wide into the first turn, three deep on the backstretch,
dropped back on the second turn and eased in the lane. BILLY K bumped leaving the gate, three wide into the clubhouse turn, pulled from the three-quarter
mark to around the five-eighthsh pole, kept inside to the stretch and was also eased.

Footnotes
SONGOFTHEDESERT pressed outside, moved up to duel with the leader, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear and drew away under a drive.
QUEENSBECCAANDJANE well placed behind the top pair, traveled in the two path then moved out to enter the stretch three wide, never poised a threat to
the winner and held the place. SMILING ANNIE stalked outside a rival, three deep then three wide into the lane, angled out and finished with a late bid to
earn the show honors. SHYLOCK EDDIE traveled along the inside, angled out and went between runners in the stretch and edged for the show. PLUM
WILD tracked between rivals then a bit off the rail, angled out in the stretch and went evenly through the final furlong. FLORENTINE DIAMOND stalked the
pace from the outside, bid three deep into the turn, drifted out around the bend, steered back in a few paths and flattened in the drive. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA
off the rail early, three wide then four wide leaving the bend, came out entering the stretch and never threatened MOMMY ROSE four wide into the turn, five
wide leaving the bend, steered inside upper stretch and proved no menace. DIM LIGHTS gained command early, angled to the inside, dueled into the
stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SWEET RIVER BAINES settled off the inside, went four wide into the turn, tipped out a path and came five wide into the stretch, rallied and drew clear
under a drive and hand urging late. LIONITE raced off the rail, went three deep into the turn, angled out and came six wide into the stretch, closed well and
proved second best. OH MARVELOUS ME bumped leaving the gate, traveled outside a rival, steered five wide into the stretch, showed late effort and
edged rival for the show. POSTERIZE set the pace under pressure to the inside, moved clear in upper stretch, lost command inside the eighth pole and got
nailed for third. PURE COMEDY bumped leaving the gate, tracked off the rail, two wide into the stretch, split foes in the drive and showed a mild response
to improve. I'M BUSY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, recovered quickly to prompt the pace inside, lost contact with the leader nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and weakened. MAKE IT A TRIPLE off a bit slow to begin, went three wide into the stretch, angled out and improved. JAN'S RESERVE chased a bit off
the inside, three wide leaving the bend and flattened. HOT SEAN bumped at the start, raced off the rail then angled to the inside, saved ground around the
turn and was never a factor. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH bumped leaving the gate, chased outside the top pair, raced three wide then four wide into the lane
and faded.

Footnotes
UNITED pressed the leader from the outside, roused near the three-sixteenths pole, headed rival a furlong out, dug in late under right then left-handed
urging and proved best. SHARP SAMURAI raced three deep and between rivals early, taken back nearing the clubhouse turn, settled off the rail, angled in
around the far turn, rallied along the fence and outkicked rival for the place. NEPTUNE'S STORM quickly took command, set the pace and angled to the
fence, showed the way with UNITED to the outside, responded when challenged in the lane, fought back through the final furlong and yielded grudgingly.
BOWIES HERO tracked the speed from the inside to the far turn, angled out entering the stretch and finished willingly in deep stretch. ORIGINAIRE (IRE)
tracked between rivals, came three wide into the lane, asked but needed to find more in the late stages. CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE four deep early, three
deep into the clubhouse turn and up the backstretch, went three to four wide around the far turn and weakened in the lane.

outside, bid into the second turn, gained command after the three-eighths pole, cleared, fought back to the sixteenth pole and lost the place. SOLO ANIMO

the three-eighths, exchanged bumps with outside rival on the turn and tired in the drive. HOLDEN THE LUTE went five wide into the first turn, raced outside

Footnotes
GALILEAN bumped with inside rival at the start, stalked inside, angled out upper stretch, split foes, cleared and held well. WHOOPING JAY tracked outside
a rival, went three deep up the backstretch, three wide around the far turn, tipped out at the three-sixteenths and finished well. BRANDOTHEBARTENDER
settled inside and saved ground, came out a bit and split foes in the stretch and rallied for the show. DESMOND DOSS traveled a bit off the rail, moved out
on the backstretch, went four wide into the stretch and produced a late rally. THREE AY EM outside a rival then between foes, angled out at the
three-sixteenths marker and brushed with rival, kept on willingly after to gain ground in the late stages. IRISH HEATWAVE settled off the rail then three
deep, advanced around the far turn off the rail, exited the final turn three wide, bid three deep in the lane but weakened in the final furlong. LOUD MOUTH
raced inside, three wide into the stretch and never rallied. ULTIMATE BANGO between rivals on the backstretch then chased two wide, angled out and
steadied off heels in upper stretch and lacked a rally. TAKE THE ONE O ONE three deep into the first turn, took over midway around that turn, led inside to
the stretch, lost the lead with a furlong to go and gave way. GRINNING TIGER showed speed then hard to ride in the early stages, rider took control of his
mount and pressed outside, chased the leader two wide into the stretch and faded. CAMINO DEL PARAISO chased inside, lacked room and steadied at the
three-eighths pole then again shortly after, angled out into the stretch, clipped heels and lost the rider soon after and walked away under his own power.
AFTER A REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT OF GRINNING TIGER CLIPPING HEELS AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
BECAUSE SEVERAL DIFFERENT HORSES CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
CANADIAN GINGER up close three deep, bid outside near the five-sixteenths, cleared four wide around the turn, drifted inward upper stretch and drew off.
BIG GAME PLAN mid-pack early, saved ground inside, rallied next to the fence in the drive and bested the rest. CAUGHT IN A TRAPPE broke in, settled a
bit off the rail, took the turn two wide, rallied late and gained the show. MISS MOZART bobbled at the start, bumped twice and checked in the early stages,
went two to three wide around the turn, angled out upper stretch and finished with a mild response. IT'S A RIDDLE came in and bumped foes early causing
two rivals to check, chased off the inside, exited the turn five wide, angled in entering the stretch and lacked the needed response late. SECOND AVENUE
had good early speed, dueled then vied inside on the turn, lost the lead around the bend and weakened in the drive. VANGOGO chased the speed then
moved up to duel from the outside, vied between rivals on the turn, outpaced leaving the bend and came three wide into the lane and faded. WINE AT
SUNSET bumped and checked early, outside a rival, put to a drive around the turn, came out into the lane then back inside in the stretch and failed to rally.
FOREHEAD KISSES bumped at the start, raced off the rail, two wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. MIRACLE MILER broke in, ridden along early,
chased inside and never threatened. COOL NIGHT stumbled, broke in and bumped rival at the start, came five wide into the lane and weakened.
SPRECKELS stalked four wide into the turn, five wide leaving the bend and faded. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED IT'S A RIDDLE
FROM FIFTH TO EIGHTH FOR COMING IN EARLY AND CAUSING MISS MOZART AND WINE AT SUNSET TO CHECK EARLY.
