Footnotes
CORRECT ANSWER in the second flight while well out in the strip, raced four out to five wide when advancing out of the turn, chased the leader past the
furlong marker then kicked that rival down late while remaining well out in the strip. VIKING VOYAGE with the pace from the start, vied three wide into and
through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, could not contain the winner late, remained well clear of the others. UNDENIABLY DEVINE
lacked early foot off the inside, continued to race just off the rail through the turn, rallied from between rivals past the furlong marker, clear for tghe show. MY
HONEY'S MONEY broke in tank, extremely rank, far back early, continued to late early in turn, moved to the outside for the drive and mounted a late run to
improve position. HALF DIALED raced in the second flight, bit closer late in the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. HAIRTRIGGER HEART with the
pace closest to the inside for three furlongs, gave way in the drive. BERNICE D'WILDCAT failed to menace. REMI'S ROSE vied up front while between
rivals for three furlongs, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
GO FOR MOONSHINE broke on top, pressed the issue early, moved up to duel after a quarter, put that rival away as the runner up was coming alongside
in the final turn, long, headed duel to the wire, proved narrowly best in a game effort. OUTLAW X. stalked the pace while racing three wide, advanced on the
leaders into the far turn, dueled into and through the length of the stretch, outkicked after an extended drive. APPLEWOOD fractious prior to the start, broke
with the field, lacked speed, advanced from between rivals midway on the far turn, finished up best of the rest while not a threat to the top pair. AFLEET
ROGER settled off the pace, lacked a closing response. RAISON MARTINI away in good order, got clear through the first turn, dueled the middle half
inside, gave way in the final turn and continued to back up in the drive.

DICTATOR broke a bit to the outside, forwardly placed, ranged up to challenge three wide far turn, dueled late in that turn, drew clear in the lane under an
initial firm hand ride then geared down late to win ridden out. DE BIRD IS DA WORD settled off the pace and the inside, roused three wide into the stretch,
proved no match for the winner, well clear of the others. PHAT AND FAST dueled up front while closest to the inside, fell back off the top two in the far turn,
came back for the show late while not a threat to the top two. HONOR MY SPEED broke on top, dueled up front in the two path, vied between horses into
the final turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner late in the bend then began to weaken. ZARTASTIC lacked speed, came five wide into the
stretch, went evenly to the wire. ODYSSEY EXPLORER last to leave, trailed for five furlongs, passed tiring rivals. DERECHO WARRIOR settled in mid
pack, faded. COSTA ALOT pulled while a bit rank early, fell far back, lost contact with the field and jogged in.

SEVEN JEWELS broke on top, soon got clear, set all the pace under confidant handling, not threatened in the drive to win ridden out. FLAT ROSE
unhurried for five furlongs, began a tepid advance midway on the final turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive. GO MY JULIET chased the winner
just off the inside, gave way after five furlongs.

Footnotes
SONOMA CRUSH in the second flight while between rivals, crept a bit closer late in the turn, steered out widest when straightened for home, finished with
good resolve to be up in time. MY PAL TORRES vied early while between rivals, dueled along the inside into the lane, shook clear inside the furlong marker,
could not contain the winner. KING BANDIT in the second group outside, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, hung late. BAYOU BODE
void of early foot, between horses into the lane, moved toward the inside and displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position. SPARKY
SPARKLES vied up front on the outside and three wide, continued to contest the issue early turn, dueled with the runner up into the stretch then began to
weaken. HOLLYWOOD SQUARE flashed brief early foot inside and gave way before three furlongs. FIDDLERS FAREWELL last away, trailed, showed
little.

Footnotes
COPPER FIDDLE within striking distance outside, ranged up three wide to challenge turning for home, edged clear under steady handling before holding
the runner up safe late. COWBOYS DREAM settled off the pace and the inside, raced three wide in the second turn when beginning to advance, set down
for the drive, continued with a late run to annex the place spot late. SILENT FORCE pressured the leader from the outside for five furlongs, advanced and
challenged three wide midway on the final turn, showed the way into the stretch, proved no match for the winner in the drive, caught late for the place.
PAYNT BATTLE settled in mid pack while saving ground, advanced while continuing to save ground in the second turn, dueled briefly with entrymate into
the stretch then faltered. SHAE'S DAY lacked early foot, moved out and came five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. J C'S IN TOWN sprinted
clear in the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, gave way from between rivals when confronted midway on the final turn. LES PAUL
finished early to be always outrun, well beaten.

Footnotes
HOSTILE AFLEET vied up front early along the inside, fell back off the leader in the turn, moved out, set down, staged a late surge to be up at the wire.
CARLOS PUNCH came in early when forwardly placed to bother inner rivals, vied outside into the turn, shook clear midway on the bend, continued to show
the way by daylight past the furlong marker, weakened late and failed to contain the winner. GRAND PRIORITY broke back, void of early foot, continued to
lag through the turn and upper stretch, picked up the tempo past the furlong marker and finished full of run to be up in time for the show while between
horses at the wire. GOODROCKINALVIN broke in mid pack, floated in by CARLOS PUNCH soon after, raced three wide and forwardly into the stretch,
came up empty the final furlong, nipped for the show. CHAD'S AUTUMN KING forwardly placed after breaking in good order, fell back a bit in the turn,
lacked a significant closing response to also narrowly miss the show. SPECIAL STORM in a bit tight at the start, again while between rivals entering the
turn, had little for the drive. BLACK SWORD unseated rider and ran off for four furlongs, raced back early, mid pack through the turn, had little left for the
stretch run. BITSY'S OTHER HALF last away, remained back. IN A BIND broke alertly, was racing behind the leaders when bothered and forced to take up
sharply when CARLOS PUNCH pushed in GOODROCKINALVIN into his path, fell back and did not recover. WILD STORM CAT four wide trip, steadily
faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF IN A BIND
AGAINST CARLOS PUNCH FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE EARLY GOING, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED NINTH.

Footnotes
MATT'S PRIDE broke well, chased the leader into the turn, continued to purse that one entering the stretch, challenged between horses when straightened
for home, dueled past the furlong marker, disposed of that rival a sixteenth out then had enough to hold off the runner up at the wire. ERICKA ROCKS void
of early foot, came six wide out of the turn, rallied willingly while steadily angling in to be getting to the winner late. RACIN PRAYER within striking distance
off the inside, advanced four wide into the stretch, dueled outside the winner past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going while saving the show.
BALOOK void of early foot, continued back through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, steered out in upper stretch and showed some mild, belated
interest to improve position. DECADENT DIAMOND in mid pack early, moved a bit closer late in turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. STAR
PRADO last away, raced back early, in some traffic, altered course toward the inside, displayed a mild amount of late interest while not a serious threat.
LUCKY ARTIE went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. FOURSWEETNIECES in the second flight early, three wide through the turn, had
little left in tiring in the drive. ALYS EPISODE was always outrun. SMOOTH FANTASY broke on top, quickly sprinted clear, showed the way for three
furlongs then stopped when headed entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SUSURRO in the second flight early off the inside, came three wide into the stretch, rallied willingly to collar the leader late and edge clear. SOUTHERN
GALAXY outrun early, steered out when beginning to advance late in the turn, encountered some traffic inside the furlong marker, finished up willingly to
narrowly be up for the place. ORTHODOX BEAT bothered and pushed out at the break, raced in the second group outside the winner early, advanced into a
striking position late in the turn, got out to be six wide into the stretch, flattened out in the late going to finish up evenly while drifting out again late.
EXECUTIVE COUNCIL forwardly placed from the start, vied three wide into the turn,dropped to the inside late in the bend when clear, extended that
advantage through midstretch before weakening and being caught, narrowly held the place. UNTUTTABLE SPEED vied up front along the inside for three
furlongs and weakened. MYLIE IDEL forwardly placed off the inside early, fell back after a quarter, had little for the drive. MISSBUDLITELIME prompted the
pace for three furlongs and gave way. CLOCKED IN TYME dwelt start, trailed early then picked off tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MARY'S
WISH broke out to set off a chain reaction of interference involving outer rivals, was straightened to race in the main body, was four wide through the turn
and tired. CARLENA bumped and bothered at the start, remained back and was also never involved. DOUBLE APPEAL bothered, in tight at the start,
remained always back.
