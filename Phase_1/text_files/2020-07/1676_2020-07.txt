Footnotes
QUINTERO sat just off the pacesetters in the four path, came three to four wide leaving the turn, closed outside under urging and won driving.
TIZTHUNDERINOW contested the early pace from between foes, matched strides inside of EVER TRUE through the turn, gained advantage over the fore
mentioned but succumbed late stretch. EVER TRUE sent for outside speed, contended the pace through the turn, was unable to move on with rivals into the
lane and held for show. COMMISSION MAN sent from between foes, chased inside and was unable to improve contending position under urging. FROST
CANYON allowed to settle early inside, dropped back through the turn and went evenly through the stretch. LUCKY LAST NIGHT sat in range outside and
faded entering the lane. DIAVAL was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
CANDY GIANT sat in striking position, split rivals into the lane the widened under light handling. STOCKWATCHER stalked three to four wide leaving the
backstretch, moved up alongside rivals in the turn, was asked entering the lane and proved no match for winner while able to get the place. CAPTAIN WILL
vied for the early lead, was unable to sustain the bid that needed and faded. TIMELESS TALES trailed early, was roused leaving the turn but was unable to
get up for show. CAPITALISM prompted the pace outside of CAPTAIN WILL, was steadied leaving the final turn and flattened. CAUSEWAY RUNNER
saved ground and lacked a bid. PRESIDENTIAL BIRD showed little interest.*Disqualification- By order of the Board of Stewards, CAPTAIN WILL is
disqualified and declared unplaced as per Thoroughbred Ruling #23.

OUT FRONT contested the pace, drew away through the turn then widened through the stretch to an easy victory. CAGEY hurried inside, chased the leader
but was no match for the winner and held for place. SKY DESTINY saved ground inside, chased into the stretch but was unable to improve contending
position through the drive. PLAY FOR HONOR unhurried away, advanced outside leaving the backstretch and flattened. YUKON MIST raced at the back of
the pack and passed tiring rivals. LOST HEROINE reserved off the paces between foes and chased to no avail. WEEKEND ACTION offered little. SMOKE
N' CHROME reluctant to load then broke outward leaving the gate, was out sprinted to the turn and had nothing in reserve in the lane.

MASKWECIS sat just off the pace from the three path, drifted in leaving the final turn but was quickly corrected setting aim on FLAT OUT LEADER and won
driving. FLAT OUT LEADER disputed the pace from the inside rail, was overtaken at the top of the stretch and finished clearly second best. BIG AL'S
VISION raced inside early on the turn and rallied late in stretch for show honors. SERAPPY G set a pressured pace, was unable to move on with rivals into
the lane and lacked the rally needed. RISING REVOLUTION hustled early, dropped back and failed to menace. KING KLOVER lagged early and showed
little interest. AUSTIN CALLING last away, chased and tired.

STRIDERS RING disputed the early pace from along the rail, responded to challenge into the lane from ZICATELA and drew clear late stretch. ZICATELA
prompted the pace from between rivals, was asked into the lane and was out finished but was clear for the place. THISDEWARSFORYOU settled off the
pacesetters leaving the backstretch, was roused into the lane then came in under right handed urging, was corrected then rallied inside for show honors.
CHASKA chased from the rail, rider checked entering the stretch and finished evenly. STAPLETON trailed early, was steadied at the top of the lane and
failed to menace. IRISH GOLD pressed from four wide and came up empty in the drive. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry at the
eighth pole and after review made the decision to disqualify THISDEWARSFORYOU for interference to CHASKA. THISDEWARSFORYOU finished third
and placed fourth.

WHEELSUPINTHIRTY reserved off the pacesetter, went in pursuit of the leader leaving the turn, overtook the leader at the head of the stretch and held
safely under a late drive. SAPRAE CREEK hesitated at the start, advanced steadily outside leaving the backstretch, continued through the stretch gaining
ground but was unable to reach the winner. MARYAM sat in striking position along the rail, took closer order leaving the final turn, rallied mildly through the
stretch and held for show. CALCULATING raced at the back of the field, closed outside with good courage and missed. NORTHERN BREEZE lacked early
speed and showed a mild interest late. RUBORIS broke alertly then widened leaving the backstretch, saw margins diminish leaving the final turn and
stopped. BLUEBELLEJAM sat mid pack and lacked a serious bid. DURA'S HALO settled and failed to menace.

LUTE squeezed leaving then raced at the back of the pack early, advanced quickly along the rail through the turn, found seam at the head of the stretch and
got up in time. DOUBLE RANSOME sat in striking range racing six wide, moved up alongside the leaders then swept the lead leaving the turn and was
rundown. SLY NOT SHY sat four wide in range, came five wide racing into the lane and rallied belatedly for show honors. ARCTIC REIGN angled inward to
rail in the early stages, took closer order then was put to a drive into the lane along the rail but had no response under steady urging. IMPERIAL SUN
quickly went to the front, contended the pace leaving the backstretch from between rivals, fanned three wide then weakened through the drive. MARIA'S
MAGIC raced wide through the backstretch, chased into the lane but was unable to threaten. STORMY SPIRITED disputed the pace along the rail through
the backstretch, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and tired. HE'S SMOAKIN dropped back while urged along but lacked a serious bid.
