FIFTY, off slow, and was bumped soon after, raced in the 3 path, eased out wider on the turn and closed to be along in time. JACKS A WARRIOR set the
pace just off the rail, extended his lead near mid stretch then just failed. PHARAOH'S CITY saved ground while well placed, came back for show. WHITE
BLUFF came in leaving the gate bumping the winner, prompted outside leader and then weakened. HE'S GOT TALENT, two wide and just off the pace,
faded. TUFFY'S LUCKY raced wide and had only brief speed.

BADUKE saved ground, angled out then back inside at the top of the stretch, bid to the front a sixteenth out and just lasted. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE)
chased inside, split rivals in the final furlong and just missed. HE IZ GONE stalked outside, rallied on the turn, loomed a threat but was outfinished.
COUNTY CORRECTIONS lacked speed, rallied wide on the turn, moved very wide into the stretch. INKY DINKY DO bumped early, rushed to contention
outside, led but weakened late. SEAT OF HONOR trailed early, angled wide on the turn and offered some late energy. TOMATER GATOR vied along the
inside to the stretch and came up empty. METAPHORICAL dropped back early and gave way readily.

Footnotes
COLLOQUIUM was just a bit antsy in the gate and she had her head turned to the left, getting off slowest, was hustled up between foes, was fanned in by
CONGRESSIONALSTORM entering the chute then moved to the rail, took the lead on the far turn, opened a long lead near stretch and was under left
handed pressure to near the wire. OWESAYCANYOUSEE came in and bumped with VERRAZANO VITTORIA leaving the gate, took up entering the chute,
raced just off the rail, angled out near the quarter pole and was drawing away from the others. ANISSA broke slowly, saved ground and passed faders.
VERRAZANO VITTORIA came out at the start and contributed to the bumping with OWESAYCANYOUSEE, saved ground just off the pace and had no
rally. HOLA PRINCESS moved to the outside, raced very wide into and through stretch and didn't threaten. LUV HER BABY BLUES raced wide and
dropped back steadily. PROSPECTIVE BELLE dueled for command two wide before tiring. CONGRESSIONALSTORM drifted in fanning in COLLOQUIM
entering the chute, raced two wide and then tired. PANSY, between foes, failed to menace. VIVA NEVADA, very wide, showed little. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF OWESAYCANYOUSEE, COLLOQUIM WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED
SECOND.

KARABESSA vied to the turn, pulled clear near the inside and eagerly pulled away under a brisk hand ride. WILLTHISSHIPSAIL advanced inside and
closed willingly while no match for her entrymate. YOURS COMPLETELY pressed the pace three wide and proved empty in the stretch. FROSTY FRIEND
lacked speed, moved near the inside while no threat. VALIANT SPIRIT dropped back early and was never in contention. FEISTY MADAM prompted the
pace four wide, made a brief move on the turn then faded. POINT LOCKOUT balked at loading, trailed early then passed fading rivals. ALEDA LUTZ was
hustled close up between rivals then gave way on the turn. IT'S A SHAW THING chased very wide and stopped through the stretch. DONNA QUIXOTE was
urged just off the pace along the inside and was finished by the far turn.

Footnotes
MONACO PRINCESS was gradually eased to the outside, looped the field on the turn, closed and took the lead in deep stretch. NOT LEAVING, wide and
just off the pace, split foes in stretch and was up for place. KAREN'S GEM stumbled badly leaving the gate, saved ground and closed well. DOUBLE THE
BET, three wide early, was left with the rail, drifted out entering the stretch and then lugged in near mid stretch and had to steady to avoid heels. BOW
TOWN CAT, two wide and never far back, finished willingly. ROLL ON BIG MAMA set the pace just off the rail, drifted out slightly near mid stretch and
weakened slightly. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT, inside and just off the pace, tired.

hitting the side of the starting gate, was bumped soundly and stumbled soon after, recovered, saved ground and was drawing away from the others, NOBLE
ENDEAVOR raced outside while never far back then tired. MR. PEREZ, between foes, dropped back steadily. MILTON THE MONSTER was put to sharp
right handed whip leaving gate and came in, bumping WILD TALENT into JERUSALEM GATES then stumbled after clipping the heels of ODDS ARE, raced
wide then tired. E T'S NIGHT RANGER came out leaving the gate bumping ODDS ARE, saved ground stalking then stopped. ODDS ARE was forced out
leaving the gate and had his heels clipped then was no factor. WILD TALENT was clobbered leaving the gate and lost all chance. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS INQUIRY, MILTON THE MONSTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR BOTHERING MULTIPLE HORSES AFTER THE START AND PLACED
LAST.

MESS'N AROUND settled inside, was asked for run on the turn, angled out and surged through the final sixteenth to move clear late. COUPELLA dueled
along the inside, shook loose in mid-stretch, tired but continued gamely. CORN OFF THE COB stalked the pacesetters outside, moved very wide into the
stretch and flattened out. KRISSYS MANICURE broke alertly then dueled outside and weakened through the stretch. PEACH ALLEY reserved inside,
moved out on the turn, drifted wide in the stretch and came up empty. WILDLY GOOD LOOKIN lagged far behind then caught a fading rival late. ATINA
SALSA lunged at the start breaking poorly, moved three wide and gave way.

BIRD KING rated in the three path, eased out a bit entering stretch, caught the lead in deep stretch and inched away. IRISH CORK set the pace just off the
rail and gave way grudgingly. TWIXY CAT raced outside, faded through the stretch. INFORMATIVE, forced out leaving the gate, raced outside and was no
factor. PERFECT DAYDREAM failed to menace. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD, unruly in the paddock and loading, came out leaving the gate, stopped after a half
mile and was eased across the wire

Footnotes
FRAN'S WORRIER stalked the pace outside, drifted in near the eighth pole crowding inside rival, was straightened and edged clear. TATTERED chased
just off the leaders inside, angled out in the stretch with a mild gain. FLATEXCEL set a measured pace along the inside, was taken up in tight at the eighth
pole and continued well. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) crowded just after the start, raced far back then rallied inside. AWE MUN chased in mid-pack and raced
evenly lacking a rally. CHRISATUDE fractious in the gate, ducked in at the start bothering rival then raced wide. EL DULZURA chased outside within striking
range then faded on the turn. TOMMY'S TOP CAT was urged close up very wide down the backstretch then yielded. HIGH RIDER balked at loading in the
gate, raced far behind and had no rally. BARCODE chased wide and gave way readily. FAIRLY BOLD lacked speed and weakened steadily. Following an
objection by the rider of FLATEXCEL against the rider of FRAN'S WORRIER for interference in the stretch, FRAN'S WORRIER was disqualified and placed
third.
