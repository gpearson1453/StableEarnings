FLASHIN THE CASH showed the best speed and was able to get to the rail and held sway through the stretch. COLOR ME BEHOLD raced three wide on
the turn and was slowly cutting into the winners margin in the final yards. FULL OF GOLD was allowed top settle well off the pace came six wide turning for
home but could not make up the needed ground while finishing well. RACQUETMAN came five wide on the turn to get into contention but could not sustain
the bid through the stretch. SADDLE IN COMMANDO was away quickly and battled for the early lead along the inside but faded on the turn. LOOSE
CHANGE raced in the two path on the turn and had no rally. DREAMING TYPE showed some early speed for the first quarter but then stopped in the
stretch.

GET ER DONE raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive and finished best in the two path through the lane. DUN SOBER showed good
early speed and was able to get over to the rail had a clear lead but could not fend off the winner in the final strides. SILIS came five wide on the turn and
was finishing well midtrack. COZY BAR came four wide on the turn to get into contention but was outfinished through the stretch. DANI'S CHOICE was
shuffled back and forced to steady going into the turn and could not recover after that. TATAR was in the two path on the turn while in contention was
fanned six wide entering the stretch and dropped back after that. BAR ROOM BRAWL was in tight quarters along the rail and was forced to check twice and
lost all chance after that. COLD SNACK THIRTY was in the back the entire race and never a serious factor.

OUT OF THE SKY broke well and was allowed to settle on the outside while three wide came five wide entering the stretch and edged clear through the
stretch. KELSEY raced in the two path on the turn put a head in front at the top of the lane but could not hold off the winner. CALL YOUR BLUFF raced
three wide on the turn then four wide entering the stretch but could not get to the top pair. SHARP HOLIDAY came into contention with a perfect ground
saving trip but could not sustain the bid in the stretch. PUT SARAH ON showed the best early speed to get to the lead along the inside but tired in the
stretch. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL was forced to check going into the turn while well back and made a mild bid in the stretch. SHE'SGOTTHEBEAT came in a bit
while going into the turn forcing Miss Ellie's Girl to check and was never a serious factor. COASTAL CURVES raced along the rail the entire trip and tired.

MAIUS showed good speed along the inside was headed at the top of the stretch but found more in the final furlong to edge clear for the win. ROCKIN O
raced in the two path on the turn headed the winner at the top of the lane and gave way grudgingly through the stretch in a game effort. UZI raced along the
inside the entire trip and could not make up ground. MR. B. G.'S CREED came five wide entering the stretch but could not make up ground. GO LITTLE TE
broke in the air spotting the field seven lengths and was never a factor after that. DA GUNNER was up close in the three path and faded on the turn. GO

Footnotes
SHESASMARTYPANTS showed good early speed in the two path and held sway throughout for the win. AINTTHATRIGHTUHHUH came four wide entering
the stretch and was closing but never a threat to the winner. SWEET AS CARO was forced five wide the entire trip and raced evenly through the stretch.
ONTHE WINGSOFADOVE had the perfect inside trip while passing horses racing wide on the turn and through the lane. EXCUSEMECOMINGTHRU was
off a step slow and well back in the early stages made a bid mid track on the turn but could not sustain the move through the stretch. TOP OF THE PODIUM
raced in the two path on the turn then came eight wide entering the stretch and could not make up ground. JUSTY appeared to be a bit rank in the early
stages while trailing and never mounted a serious rally. STAR IN HEAVEN was able to get to the two path on the turn and never mounted a rally. SARAH'S
STAR showed good early speed in the three path and faded in the stretch. NATIVE BLOOM was four wide while up close for the first quarter then faded.
LISTEN SISTER was up close along the inside for the first quarter dropped back and was eased late.
