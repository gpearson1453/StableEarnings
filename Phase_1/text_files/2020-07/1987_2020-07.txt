Footnotes
TIZ SAMURAI set a clear pace in the two path, remained clear in the three path around most of the far turn, shifted further out leaving the quarter pole and
widened under a drive. CHARGING LION chased the winner under some urging in the three path, followed that one very wide nearing the lane and could
not close the gap in the lane while easily besting the rest. RELENTLESS LION chased the pace two and three wide and lacked a rally. KENYAN never
threatened while racing two and three wide. POPPY'S TWO STEP was outrun inside. FLASHY BARON played no factor while racing three wide.
SALUTATION had some speed inside and was through after a half.

Footnotes
COUGAR VISION vied two wide down the backstretch, drew off around the turn and widened under moderate stretch urging. MISS DANCIN QUEEN
stalked the pace three wide, could not keep pace with the winner from the three-eighths pole but held for the place. MISS ANTONELLA lacked early speed,
raced four wide around the turn, angled into the eight path in upper stretch and just missed second. LA SMARTY was reluctant to load, chased the pace two
wide and lacked a closing bid. BLAZING RUBY failed to menace while racing four wide. VEE TEE played no factor while racing two wide. NOTION'S
BEAUTY was in tight early, saved ground midpack, checked and was dramatically shuffled back when CODE NAME ROSIE suddenly stopped in front of her
near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked any further bids. POLLYPEPTIDE was outrun inside. CODE NAME ROSIE veered in at the break, rushed up inside
to show speed inside of the winner then stopped midway around the turn.

MARY'S SONG set a clear pace in the two path and readily drew off under a drive. RIDGELYSREDHOT stalked the pace three wide, was no match for the
winner but stayed on well to be clearly 2nd best. RUBY'S RUSH chased the pace four wide, lacked a rally and held on for the show.
WORSTBESTIDEAEVER saved ground throughout, dropped back under urging around the far turn and improved position in the lane. A RING THING was
in tight at the start, chased the pace between foes and faded around the far turn. SAAR'S IMAGE failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
NOMO D'ORO settled off the early pace two wide between rivals, angled out in upper stretch, made little gain through the sixteenth pole, closed late and
was up in the final strides. TRAVELIN GAMBLER dueled inside of BAY OF ROCKS throughout, put that foe away leaving the sixteenth pole but was nailed
in the final strides. BAY OF ROCKS vied outside, edged ahead nearing the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead, began
drifting out and then back in and weakened late. MISTER MISTER was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally.
SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE was bumped at the start, raced well back and widest and rallied belatedly. EXCHANGE FEVER was bumped at the start, raced
two wide between foes and never threatened. SINCERE MAN saved ground to no avail. ARNINA failed to menace while racing three wide. MOUSETRAP
was outrun while racing two wide. LEAVING HOME was bumped at the start, raced four wide and played no factor. DANGERUS HEARTED was outrun
inside. THE MASON FACTOR was bumped at the start, raced three wide and made little impact.

MR. AL'S GAL stalked the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside and was up in the final strides. MISS AURAMET set the
pace in the two path, held clear past the sixteenth pole and was caught in the final strides. LUVIN BULLIES saved ground off the pace and was along for the
show. TOO MUCH TIP prompted the pace three wide between the top two finishers and weakened in the drive. WILD ABOUT STAR stumbled at the start
and trailed in the four path.

Footnotes
DEIRDRE OF LEGEND stalked the pace four wide, seized command leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. SMART RED lacked early speed,
raced four and five wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied. PLAY THE MAX set the pace in the two path, could not match strides with the
winner from the quarter pole and held on for the show. THREE COINS saved ground and never threatened. WE HAP NOW chased the pace four wide and
came up empty in the lane. JUST WHAT I NEEDED chased the pace three wide and faded. FANCY GIRL was outrun while racing three wide. CELIA'S
PRIDE prompted the pace three wide and was through after a half. POOCHIE LOU played no factor while racing two wide. BELIEF CURE steadied at the
start, was never involved, was eased in upper stretch, cantered across the finish line and walked off.

Footnotes
DEEMED A MISTRESS settled off the pace along the rail, advanced inside down the backstretch, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside,
was up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. FIRST CLASSS pressed the pace in the three path, led between foes down most of the
backstretch, vied inside a foe from the five-sixteenths pole, repulsed that bid but was unable to hold off the winner. JHESSABELL prompted the pace four
wide, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths pole, vied to deep stretch and weakened late. RB LARA stalked the pace inside and faded around
the far turn. ON THE VERGE was outrun while racing three wide. UPTOWN GEORGIE raced five wide around the first turn, bid outside midway down the
backstretch and tired around the far turn. JOLLY GOOD MHF set the early pace in the 2path and stopped.
