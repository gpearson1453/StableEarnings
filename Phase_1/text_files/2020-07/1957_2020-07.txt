Footnotes
SHOWMANSHIP Away best, showed the way along the rail and widened as clearly best. RAYO MY KING Tracked along the two path on the turn, angled
out in the lane and finished well. COOL QUARTET Was unhurried along the fence, angled wide and was along for a share. UNFLAPPABLE MAX Was well
placed along the two path, three path into the lane and weakened. CHARLIE RIFFIC Was unhurried along the three path and tired inside. SOUNDS GOOD
Broke sluggishly and then was outrun. COZZY'S POSSE Saved ground and was done early.
