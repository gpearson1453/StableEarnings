Footnotes
LONG LEGGED LINDA set the pace on a short lead while in the two path into late turn, shook off one challenger and was joined by another soon after, had
a short lead through the lane and gamely held. SERENA'S HOPE was off a step slow, raced in the back into the turn, angled from near the rail to the three
path approaching the lane, continued on with good energy from the five path and was closing in at the end to end up n even terms for the place spot.
CHARGAREE was in the two path through the turn, bid into the lane to get nearest to the winner, moved to the side of that one and could not advance
further. CHRISTIAN MISS pressed the winner from along the inside into the turn, settled off the pace into the lane and stayed on while not a serious threat
late. COUNTRY DREAMIN chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and lacked the needed response.
SILKEN GOODS was in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. TOO CROWDED raced in the three path through the turn and tired in the
lane. THE FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WHEREWEGOIN set the pace while on a clear lead, was joined by the runner-up into the lane, dueled with that one inside the eighth pole, lost the lead in
the last forty yards then came again along the rail to just edge up at the wire. CASH FOR GOLD stalked the winner while in the two path through the turn,
was asked for more in late turn, moved to near even terms with the winner with an eighth to go, continued to duel inside the sixteenth pole, had a head in
front late and could not hold sway. FLATOUTJUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, asked for more near the three-eighths pole, continued on with
steady energy into the lane, advanced from the three path and settled for best of the rest while clear for the show spot. TWOBIRDSONESTONE was
unrushed while near the rail into the far turn, angled off the inside approaching the quarter pole, came into the lane from the three or four path and continued
with momentum through the lane while slowly gaining. SLOVAK POWER was in the two path through the turns and lacked a bid after turning into the lane.
AIR WONDERFUL stumbled at the start, tracked the pacesetters while along the inside into the far turn, continued along the rail and was empty entering the
lane. S S TROOPER was never a factor while racing off the rail through the turns. HALF-MILE TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WAVERUNNER chased the pace while in the three path, moved three wide in late turn, joined the leader when straightening the lane, dueled with that one
though the final eighth and edged up late. MR. MUTADDA stalked then pressed the pace while two wide into the far turn, bid for the lead while two wide and
between rivals nearing the quarter pole, gained the lead near the quarter pole, continued with a narrow advantage into the lane, dueled with the winner
inside the eighth pole and was denied while clearly second best. SUNDAY DRIVE was in the three or four path through the turns, came into the lane from
the four path and moved up to be clear for the show spot while not a threat to the top two. SUGAR DOG FOX was fractious in the gate then stumbled when
then doors sprung, raced in the two path through the turns and tired entered the lane. QUANA DUDE was never a factor while always towards the back and
racing in the three path. PRADAR set the pace along the inside into the turn, was challenged by two others after mid-turn, dueled with those two into the
lane then gave way. DOCTOR VICTOR tracked the pace along the inside into mid-turn then was done.

Footnotes
SPECIAL RESERVE vied for the lead two wide through the turn, shook clear straightening in the lane then widened to the wire. NASHVEGAS was slow to
gather, raced in the three or four path through the turn when towards the back, continued with good energy through late turn, entered the lane from the eight
path and seven wide then finished with good energy to just get up for the place spot. CLEAR TO CLOSE was in the two path through the turn when never
far back, came into the lane from the two or three path, was closest to the winner in deep stretch and just was caught for the place spot at the wire.
STORMIN EL PRADO was near the rail through the turn and into the lane then offered a mild gain. IMPEACHABLEOFFENSE trailed into the turn while in
the two path, continued near the inside into the lane, raced from the two or three path through the stretch and was gaining at the end. TOM'S LAST
GENERAL in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from the seven path and was never a threat. GET SOME MO vied for
the lead along the inside into the lane then gave way along the inside. SKY MIKE moved through the three or four path in the turn, came into the lane from
the four path and never was a factor. LINEMAKER was never a contender while in the five to the four path through the turn. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND
stepped out at the start, hustled up to chase the pace through the turn while in the three path then was empty after turning into the lane. HOWARD ROARK
showed some pace along the inside into the turn then steadily faded.
