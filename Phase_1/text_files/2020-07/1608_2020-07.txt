Footnotes
GREAT in the second flight early while off the inside, continued to pursue the dueling leaders up the backstretch, ranged up three wide to challenge turning
for home, slowly edged clear under firm handling. PEACOCK KITTEN dueled up front in the two path, alternated the middle half, vied into the straight while
inside the winner and between horses, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, clear for the place. POST CLOSE broke alertly, set or forced the pace for six
furlongs closest to the inside, could not keep up with the top pair in the drive, saved the show. ATLANTIC RULER off a step slow, lacked early foot, came on
the outside exiting the final turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE devoid of early foot, remained back
throughout in failing to menace. MISTER INTUITION broke in, was straightened to settle in the second group inside the winner, began to tire after a half.

Footnotes
FORESTDUNGONE broke on top, showed the way early, clear before a half, turned back a bid from the runner up into the lane, clear again, driving. CAJUN
CREED forwardly placed while racing outside, advanced and briefly challenged the winner late in the second turn, proved no match in the drive, clearly
second best. CHAOSMOS settled off the pace, moved outside, came four wide into the lane, along for the show late while not a threat to the top two.
THAT'S D 'CAT last away, trailed, split horses past the furlong marker to pick off a couple of tiring rivals, not enough for the show. POPS LEGACY back for
a half, improved with a mild middle move the third quarter and faltered. EXTON raced in mid pack for a half and began to fade.

Footnotes
ZUGERSEE closest to the leader while racing toward the inside, moved closer to that rival late in the final turn, took over approaching the furlong marker,
shook clear under steady handling, held the runner up safe late. SHEZA MEAN BROAD four wide into the first turn when off the pace, remained in mid pack
the middle half, three wide into the lane, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late, well clear of the others. SALT LIFE ANGEL broke on top,
sprinted well clear, continued to enjoy a large advantage in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, offered brief resistance to the winner then could
not keep up nor proved to be a match for the runner up, remained clear for the show. DESTINY TWILIGHT off a step slow, raced back, improved position
into the lane, flattened out. DOUBLE RED settled off the pace, came up empty for the drive. OVERLY SWEET forwardly placed in the early going, began a
steady fade before a half. MY PAL CHARLENE off a step slow, moved to race in the main body, remained in the second flight up the backstretch then gave
way.

Footnotes
LES PAUL unhurried in the early going, began a steady advance after a quarter, three wide into the straight, shifted out for room, set down, closed well to
kick down the leaders. VENN with the pace from the start, continued to vie into and through the final turn, led late, proved no match in failing to contain the
winner, remained clear for the place. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN void of speed, trailed after a half, staged a belated rally to be in time for the show, also
closed the gap on the runner up late. DUSTY BOY broke alertly, narrowly showed the way into the first turn, set or forced pace rail, faltered in the drive.
ARCTIC ROSE four wide into the first turn, advanced and challenged after a half three wide, led in the far turn, also gave way in the drive. PRINCE
CARLOS remained back in failing to menace. SINGASONGSAM last away, moved up to race in mid pack early, had nothing left for the drive. HOPE FOR
CHANGE staged a steady retreat to be finished before a half.

BORN AGAIN GEORGE behind the pace while saving some ground, continued inside out of the turn, switched out to be wide for the drive, closed with good
energy to be uyp in time. MASTERLY broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace inside, edged away turning for home, well clear a furlong out, could not
contain the winner. STORMATION lacked early foot off the inside, four wide out of the turn, bothered slightly by a stricken foe just inside the furlong marker,
recovered and drew clear for the show, no threat to the top two. MAGIC COMMAND off a step slow, void of speed in trailing for over a half, improved
position up the inside. SUCCESSFUL RYKER vied up front while between horses, weakened in the drive. SOUTHERN SWAGG with the early pace while
three wide, tiring when bothered 1/8, continued to weaken. SNAPPER BITE with the pace while four wide into the turn, continued to race forwardly into the
stretch, pulled up sharply when in distress midstretch, vanned off.

MOLLY GOLIGHTLY broke alertly, raced within striking distance, came three wide out of the turn, set down, finished with a late surge to be up in time.
FOURSWEETNIECES away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, clear late, nipped
final strides. CAJUN MUSIC dueled up front while in the two path, gave ground grudgingly to the top two in the drive, comfortably saved the show. LUCKY
LINZ forwardly placed toward the inside, briefly boxed in late in the turn toward the inside, came up empty when clear for the drive. PADDY O'BELLE went
one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. WAR BANDIT broke back and was never a threat. D'WILD BARONESS unprepared when antsy in the
gate, reared, detained by assistant starter, broke well back, rank, pulled up. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, D'WILD
BARONESS WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER.

Footnotes
KINGDOM WAY outrun for five furlongs off the inside, came three wide out of the final turn, closed with good resolve to challenge late, determined. SIR
TRUEBADOUR broke on top, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into the lane, clear again by midstretch, responded when challenged
late, proved stubborn to the end, gained the nod for the place. LOUISIANA MOON chased the runner up off the inside, moved closer late backstretch, fell
back, rebid late, missed second while between the top two at the wire. RESILIENT RICK lacked early foot, two path through the final turn, swung out widest
for the drive, finished willingly to be gaining while too late. MISTAKE PRESENT forwardly placed off the inside, came up empty for the stretch run. EDEN
GREY'S KITTEN settled off the pace while saving ground, continued in the main body into the far turn, saved ground through that bend, came up empty
when called on for the drive. ROYAL ROCKET off a step slow, trailed throughout and was not involved.

Footnotes
FLASHYBOY BOBB close from the start off the inside, advanced on the early leader to duel through the turn, drew off through the lane under mild handling
to win ridden out. CLEVER RACER broke out but toward the front, raced forwardly off the inside, proved no match for the winner in the drive. AND YET
ANOTHER lacked early foot, came three wide into the lane, rallied to be closest to the top two late, narrowly held the show spot in the final strides.
PROPER CROSS broke back, lacked speed for a half, steered out to be four wide entering the stretch, finished willingly while too late. REDDING COTEAU
cleared soon after the start to show the way onto the main track, dueled inside the winner through the turn then gave way in the drive. JAIL HOUSE raced in
the second flight off the inside, had little left for the drive. IZZY B WINN in the main body while outside, four out to five wide turn, failed to muster a closing
response. MO'S RIDE made little impact while four wide out of the turn. LITTLE WISE GUY lacked speed, trailed into the lane, picked off some tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. GREELEY'S GLACKEN tired while racing toward the inside. DATA CENTRAL raced back and four wide through the turn,
had nothing for the drive. RAISON MARTINI tired from early efforts, well beaten.
