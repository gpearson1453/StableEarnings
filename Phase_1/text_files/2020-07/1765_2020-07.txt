INDIAN GHOST stalked the pace, found room along the inner rail to take command mid way on the far turn then drew away under steady handling.
VOODOO VALLEY , forwardly placed outside horses down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the far turn, finished willingly but was no match for the
winner. ROCKIN RON bore out hitting the outside of his starting gate start, was four deep turning for home and passed tired rivals. HAIKU , three deep the
first turn, raced three wide leaving the far turn and failed to be a factor. COFFEE PLEASE chased the pace outside TOP HAT SCRUTINY and gave way
after six furlongs. FIVE STAR PERFECT , along the inner rail the entire trip, was outrun. TOP HAT SCRUTINY , sent to the early lead, raced in the two path
on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CHICKEN DINNER , under a snug hold while saving ground and tracking a contested pace, eased out mid turn, circled five wide into the lane, rallied under
pressure to take command in mid stretch, drew clear under repeated right handed pressure then was geared down in the final yards. SIMMARD
SHENANIGAN was sent from the gate and held a short early advantage, sparred outside THIRD CARD DOWN into the turn, battled between runners from
the five sixteenths to upper stretch then churned on willingly to reclaim the place. DETERMINED MISSION stalked outside a rival, bid three deep mid turn,
gained a short lead while dueling and drifting out a bit into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then flattened out. THIRD CARD DOWN was urged up inside
and put a head in front near the five eighths, battled inside rivals from the five sixteenths to about mid stretch then gave way. PERFECT EXCHANGE dwelt
at the break, edged up nearing the half mile marker, chased but came up empty. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of PERFECT EXCHANGE. No
action was taken.

CAUSFORCELEBRATION relaxed tracking the early pace, bid three deep nearing the half mile marker, dueled under some rating around the final turn,
kicked clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, widened a bit past the furlong grounds then was fully extended to prevail. TOE CURLIN' KISS lacked
speed off the inside, angled out and was put to a drive exiting the far turn, circled six wide into the lane, closed gamely and just missed. WAR LANCE
steadied soon after the break, regrouped and was taken to rate, edged up between foes near the far turn, shifted four wide and had aim in upper stretch,
continued with interest past mid stretch but flattened out very late. FAST MASTER raced in range inside while saving ground, came under a ride past the
five sixteenths, shifted out in upper stretch and kept on with some interest. PARATYCACHACA , bumped at the break, raced between runners mid way on
the final turn, angled out but needed more. I'VE GOTTA PLAN opened up early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined nearing the half mile pole, dueled
past the three sixteenths then faded in the final furlong. EASTPORT saved ground off the pace, was stalled past the three eighths, angled out approaching
the stretch and offered a slight kick. SENOR SEVILLE lagged off the pace, came off the inside for the drive but failed to muster up a run. DETERMINED
PURSUIT stalked outside, edged up between foes past the five eighths, pursued into the far turn then faltered. LUDICROUS MODE , bumped at the break,
lost ground five wide, moved up outside rivals after a half mile, chased then gave way nearing the lane. BATS CHANCE , bumped and pinched back at the
break, recovered and then pulled his way forward in early backstretch, bid between foes nearing the half mile pole, sparred past the five sixteenths then
gave way entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS came out at the break, trailed off a three way pace battle, eased out on the turn, swung to the five path turning for home, swept to
command approaching the eighth pole, was kept to her business in the drive and lugged in approaching the sixteenth pole. RONA stalked the early duel,
advanced four deep leaving the turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and continued willingly. QUEEN OF TOMORROW disputed the pace between
horses and faded through the stretch drive. ESTHER'S FORTUNE came in at the break, raced in the two path on the turn, angled out for the drive and came
up empty. TAPDANCING GIRL , three deep disputing the pace, weakened the final three sixteenths. CANDY CORNER , bumped on both sides leaving the
starting gate, was not a factor. RICA CHICA hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened.

while on his left lead. BACK CHARGE stalked the dueling leaders, ranged up into the lane, bid, dueled outside horses in mid stretch then faded. TRUE
SHIPMAN , off the early pace while removed from the inside, shifted out in the drive but lacked a solid kick. DITEN , four wide, was under pressure into the
lane but failed to respond. NIC NIC BOOM saved ground and came up empty. PALACE KID rushed early and took a slim lead outside HAIR OF THE DOG,
sparred outside that one to upper stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and gave way. FELLOW , six wide turning for home, faded.
HEZAWINNERWITHME broke outward, lacked speed, swung wide into the lane but failed to rally. FIND YOUR BOAZ was outrun.

Footnotes
VICTORY GIVEN stalked the pace around the turn, was taken to the four path in upper stretch, closed between horses and was up late. DIRTYFOOT sped
to the early lead, raced near the rail around the turn, drifted out into the stretch and gave way grudgingly. BIG BOOTS circled foes turning for home, was
fanned six deep in upper stretch, had aim on the lead and hung. BOOBY TRAP lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, remained in the two path in the
stretch, raced inside horses and passed tired ones. DAPPER MUN bore out and was rank after bobbling at the break, rushed up to prompt the pace and
weakened. COOL MAN CLETUS stalked the pace outside horses, floated to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. FATHER'S LUCK , pinched back
leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and was no factor. DAY was not a factor. SAVE ME PAULA ,
four wide on the turn, was always outrun.

Footnotes
EPIC IDEA well rated while saving ground and stalking the leader, eased out for the drive, closed under right handed rousing and collared GLITTERING
JUDY inside the furlong grounds, took over with about seventy yards remaining, kicked clear and was taken in hand near the wire. GLITTERING JUDY sped
clear early, set the pace off the rail into the lane, kept on under a drive leaving the furlong grounds, dug in when confronted then gave way grudgingly.
MIDSHIP LADY eased back from between runners early, saved some ground, checked in close quarters leaving the far turn, worked her way between
runners near mid stretch and closed the gap towards the inside. MARKET MONEY , between rivals early, edged up into the lane, shifted out past mid
stretch brushing with CHINA SILK then churned on with interest. CHINA SILK , three wide between rivals, was brushed near mid stretch and came up
empty. GOLDEN CAN was shuffled back early and had a mild stretch recover. MARGIE'S HEAVEN stalked the pace, was in close mid turn, shifted in and
came up empty. CATERINA ONE , four wide between foes, lacked a bid. CHILLY SKY , off slow when hopping at the break, rushed up into the turn then
came up empty. PINK PEARL lost ground five to six wide and faded. MAMA'S GREY GHOST , off a bit slowly, rushed up five wide, chased to the head of
the lane then faltered.

Footnotes
BREVIARY chased the pace two wide, secured command entering the stretch, was put to brisk urging and pulled away. PATRIOTIC PUNCH , swung out
mid way on the turn, was well placed four deep at the head of the stretch, chased the winner and weakened. M. J.'S LADY , a forward factor in the two path
between horses leaving the turn, chased the winner and weakened. CORNETTA'S CHOICE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened
through the stretch. CATCH THE SKY circled the turn, floated to the five path entering the stretch and was not a factor. MY SUPER SALLY showed speed
along the rail and gave way turning for home. BOTTLE COURAGE , outrun, was eased the final furlong.

Footnotes
BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) took over between rivals after about a furlong, spurted clear entering the turn and was well rated just off the inside, responded
when set down past the three sixteenths, wandered outward a bit late then dug in tenaciously under left handed pressure to prove best. FOGGY DREAMS ,
three to four wide, raced between rivals mid turn, swung five wide into the lane, straightened and closed gamely to gain. BUSTIN HEARTS had speed to
lead early, rated back off the winner and tracked inside, angled out into the lane, had aim in mid stretch, shifted in when the winner drifted but lacked the
needed finish. DANCE OR STROLL , taken to rate while saving ground, edged up some in mid stretch but lacked a serious follow through. PRINCESS
KILLMAIN , off the pace, saved ground into the stretch, eased out late and gave effort to the line. I LOVE YOU , a bit sluggish from the gate, moved up five
wide approaching the turn, raced outside rivals past the three eighths, was fanned very wide into the stretch, straightened but only had a a mild kick.
STAKES ON A PLANE stalked between runners and faded. DAT DARES GOLD , four deep nearing the half mile pole, moved up some mid turn, chased
and gave way. TRIXIE'S TIME , off a bit slow, was nudged up to contention in the opening furlong, stalked three wide, was under a drive past the three
eighths then tired in upper stretch.
