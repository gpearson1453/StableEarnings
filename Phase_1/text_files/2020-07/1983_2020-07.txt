Footnotes
LIPLINER broke sharply, established an early lead, came around the turn in the two path, kicked clear entering the stretch and was kept to the task to the
wire. WILDWOOD MAGGIE trailed the field in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and made a late rally between horses in the final furlong
to just get up for second. SHEZ STUCK UP raced outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, chased the leader down the stretch
and was caught for the place in the final strides. LAURA ATTACK veered in leaving the gate, raced between horses in the early stages, came around the
turn in the four path and weakened in the final furlong. BETTER THAN PEARLS trailed the field in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn,
offered a mild bid entering the stretch and flattened out in the late stages. GOTTA B THE SALSA settled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile,
began to drop back passing the three eighths pole, saved ground around the turn and offered no bid.

Footnotes
UGO was pushed for position to track the leading pair, bided his time in the three path on the turn, began to improve when pushed along past the three
eighths, swung out into the stretch, went to a drive near the three sixteenths,, rallied outside, led past the furlong mark, and drove clear. GIVIN UP NONE
led inside while pressured by IRISH LIGHTED ROAD to his outside, saved ground through the turn while still setting a pressured pace, asserted his lead
when driven past the quarter pole, was headed just past the eighth pole, weakened but held the place. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD pressed the leader two wide,
went to a drive past the five sixteenths, proved no match for GIVIN UP NONE into the lane, and chased the leading pair down the lane. ROCKET RIDE
chased midpack, raced in the four path on the turn, lacked the needed rally in the lane, but responded well enough to a drive in the final sixteenth to hold
fourth. SILVER HIT settled in second last down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, no bid. LUCKY ROMEO
settled at the rear, trailed in the two path around the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, and never threatened.

drive approaching the furlong mark, was headed just past the furlong pole and chased to the wire a clear second best. TOUGH STUFF bobbled at the
break, was sandwiched between MIND TRAPPE and TAKAFUMI in the opening strides, settled at the rear inside of TAKAFUMI, continued in the rear pair in
the three path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter pole, made a mile outside rally and got up for third inside the final sixteenth. ED'S
ROCKET was placed on the lead, set a pressured pace while saving ground until being headed near the three eighths by TRAPPE VALLEY, weakened
after bieng headed, went to a drive inside down the lane but lost third place just inside the sixteenth pole. MIND TRAPPE broke out and bumped TOUGH
STUFF in the opening strides, chased the leading pair inside of HURRICANE HIGHWAY down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, went to
a drive approaching the quarter pole but offered no bid. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) broke inward and bumped TOUGH STUFF, settled at the rear outside of that
same foe, continued two wide in the four path in the rear pair on the turn, trailed into the lane, was given a couple of taps of the crop past the furlong pole
and made no rally.

Footnotes
U S DELTA FORCE led the field from the two path around the first turn, opened up a significant advantage up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the far turn, and dug in in the stretch to hold off the late challengers. HUEY ATTACK chased the leader around the first turn and up the backstretch,
launched a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, made up substantial ground on the far turn, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and
could not get by the leader. DOM CAETANO (ARG) raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack,
began a bid on the rail around the far turn, could not go with the leaders in the stretch, but was the best of the rest. OFF TO THE BEACH bumped with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path
and offered no bid. KALININGRAD bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, was pinched back and trailed the field from the two path the first
time down the stretch, made a bid rounding the first turn to race midpack up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.
TODDLES bumped with the horses to either side of him leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch between
horses, saved ground around the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WELOVECANDY settled at the rear of the main pack, improved to fourth in the three path past the three eighths, swung out into the lane, was driven for a
four wide rally in midstretch, led past the sixteenth pole and cleared while ridden out. MONGOL BULL chased two wide in midfield, was pushed along in the
four to five path while racing two wide on the turn, swung out into the lane and went to a drive past the three sixteenths, rallied well but was outfinished by
the winner. GORGEOUS GEORGE loped along at the rear down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was pushed along past the 5/16, rallied
inside down the lane, altered two wide near the sixteenth pole to get around the fading DO NOT ENTER, and got up for third in the final strides. SHANGHAI
POINT tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, went to a drive past the quarter pole, and kept on only evenly in the lane.
RIV tracked the leading pair inside of MONGOL BULL down the backstretch, chased the leading pair in the three path on the turn, went to a drive at the
three sixteenths but lacked the needed kick. DO NOT ENTER soon led, raced headstrong on the pace, saved ground through the turn, was pushed along
near the three sixteenths while still clear, but was swallowed up in the final sixteenth. Missing times determined following video review.

P H FACTOR led the field from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and held off the late challengers in the final sixteenth. BATTLE CREEK broke sharply, veered in slightly leaving the break, saved
ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn on the rail, launched a bid between horses passing the three
sixteenths pole and finished well. RIVER CACTUS raced between horses in tight quarters headed into the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the
pace, navigated the far turn from the three path, launched an outside bid in the stretch and was gaining in the final sixteenth of a mile. DOLLAR BLUE raced
in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and finished
evenly. AND WON came around the first turn in the two path, raced on the outside in the back of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn and offered no bid. TORNADO BOY saved ground through the opening half mile, trailed the field throughout, came around the far turn in the two path
and was never a factor. HIGH HEATER raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
JEGGYJEGGY was pushed to the lead inside, set a pressured pace in the two path on the turn, asserted himself on the lead into the lane, went to a drive
approaching the furlong mark and held sway. JIMMY AT LAST raced three wide in the leading flight early, pressed the pace in the five path on the turn, was
pushed hard near the five sixteenth but outkicked into the lane by the pacesetter, kept on under a drive in the lane and proved a clear second best.
CRANKSHAFT broke through the gate before the race, chased at the inside of the middle group early, kept on in the two path on the turn, saved ground into
the lane, kept on under a drive but could not threaten the top two. BOLD ATTACK tracked outside the leading trio early, settled back to join the middle group
three wide into the turn, chased in the six path around the bend, and gave chase two wide down the lane while never threatening the top three. TRES
GENERACIONES reared at the start and came away slowly, settled at the rear, regained touch with the field in the seven path on the turn, came into the
lane on the far outside and rallied mildly outside. WELLFIELD settled two wide near the rear of the main pack, chased in the six path on the turn, swung four
wide into the lane and lacked the needed kick in the lane. LIBOR PLUS came in and bumped SEQUINS STORM in the opening strides, settled at the rear of
the main pack, raced in the three path toward the rear on the turn, saved ground into the lane, and passed a few tired horses. UNBRIDLED RULER bobbled
at the start, was pushed to join the leading flight past the five eighths, raced between horses in the leading flight into the turn, flattened past the three
eighths and had no more for the drive. CHIPOLLINO settled near the rear of the main pack on the inside, saved ground through the turn, and came up
empty in the lane. SEQUINS STORM was bumped in the opening strides, raced between horses in the middle group down the bakcstretch, chased in the
four path on the turn, went to a drive near the quarter pole but weakened.
