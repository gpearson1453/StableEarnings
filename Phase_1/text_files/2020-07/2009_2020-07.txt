LUNAR PRAYER dueled three wide down the backstretch, remained up close while racing in the four path with a gap between her and the other duelers
around the turn, drew clear near the sixteenth pole and held off GWEN'S GAL's late charge. GWEN'S GAL lacked early speed, raced off the duel in the
clear in the two path, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied outside. MIGHTY CROSSING dueled inside of two foes to upper stretch, drifted out under
left-handed urging causing TINA'S SONG to clip heels, led to the sixteenth pole and weakened. TIP TOP DIVA hesitated at the start and was outrun in the
two path. TINA'S SONG dueled between foes to upper stretch, clipped heels leaving the eighth pole, fell, quickly regained her feet, galloped past the wire
and walked off. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident in upper stretch and disqualified MIGHTY CROSSING from third and placed her last for
interference leaving the eighth pole.

Footnotes
MOONLIT NIGHT dueled two wide, drew off around the far turn and widened under a drive. STEP OUT DANCING settled off the pace along the inside,
made progress two wide between foes rounding the clubhouse turn, made a three wide bid between rivals midway down the backstretch, could not keep
pace with the winner around the far turn but finished willingly to be clearly second best. RIP THORN stalked the pace three wide, bid midway down the
backstretch, was repulsed leaving the quarter pole, weakened and held third. J J WEDGIT MAN stalked the pace inside and came up empty. SO RED THE
ROSE was outrun while racing two and three wide. GOLDEN APPEAL played no factor while racing three and four wide. BAT TWO ONE dueled inside of
the winner for six furlongs and retreated.

MS. T REX was bumped at the start, raced well off the early, made strong progress at the rail, angled two wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole, seized
command turning for home and drove clear. GOT YOUR NUMBER set the pace along the rail, was collared turning for home, continued on the left lead and
held well for the place. THELADYISTRUE was fractious in the post parade, steadied off heels early, raced two wide around the turn and rallied belatedly.
DRIVEN TO SUCCEED saved ground and failed to menace. VACATION SECRET pressed the pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. HAPPY SAISON
broke slowly and was outrun inside. CREATIVITY broke slowly, raced two wide around the turn, came four wide into the lane and made little impact.
BOUNDTOBEOK was fractious in the post parade and had only brief speed three wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CASTLE RIDGE set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit nearing the lane, dug in inside of KENTUCKY DANCER through the lane and held firm.
KENTUCKY DANCER stalked the pace two wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, battled outside of
the winner through the stretch and was turned back. SAINTE THERESE steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two wide, made progress two
wide around the far turn, bid inside of the winner in midstretch but flattened out a bit late. SILENT NOTION saved ground off the pace, advanced between
foes rounding the far turn and improved position. FACEY'S SISTER lacked early speed, raced two wide around both turns and never threatened. NOT A
SECRET failed to menace while racing four wide. SAVANNAH ROXANNA prompted the winner two wide around the first turn and faded three wide.
MEEMAW'S HEART was pinched back at the start and made little impact while racing two wide. FOXY JOXY played no factor while racing three and four
wide. HANALEI SUNSET had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
VIPER was unhurried early, raced two wide around the first turn, advanced three wide down the backstretch, continued to gain three wide around the far
turn, seized command in upper stretch and burst clear under a drive. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE was initially hustled from the gate, led inside early, was
content to tracked two wide when DUSKY became intent on the lead, bid nearing the far turn, took the lead approaching the quarter pole, led to upper
stretch and was no match for the winner in the lane. LIMETINI lacked early speed while saving ground, went three wide around the far turn and rallied for
the show. IMPERIAL IVOR saved ground early, advanced down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane.
DUSKY set the pace along the rail and gave way readily nearing the quarter pole.

two wide and was up and clear late. DYNAMIC UNION settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied
through the lane. GOLDEN VALE raced two wide in midpack, rallied between foes and was outkicked. SINGINDOWNTHELANE set a pressured pace along
the rail, drew off around the far turn, held clear past the sixteenth pole and wilted late. JEAN GREY failed to menace while racing three wide. SHANNA'S
GRAY chased the pace inside and lacked a rally. JET SETTIN LADY was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. PRINCESS
PENELOPE was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, went four wide around the far turn and played no factor. TORNERO was hard sent early,
could not outsprint SINGINDOWNTHELANE and retreated around the far turn.
