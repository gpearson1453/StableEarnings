Footnotes
RAVEN'S CRY, always in range, closed along the rail through the turn, took command at the top of the stretch and drew away under a hand ride. HARDY
CANDY hopped at the start then settled off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed mildly in the stretch.
UNYIELDING came out a bit leaving the gate, stalked the pace, was hustled along the second path and then the rail on the turn but finished evenly. ROYAL
FUERST raced in mid pack, chased two-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. SANDRETTI was pinched back at the start, raced in mid
pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn but failed to menace. SPEED GAUGE settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but never reached
contention. VIVIDARI led quickly, set the pace, was drifting out late turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and faded.

DANCING DRAGON set a pressured pace, shook clear sharply on the turn then was all out to hold late. MAGIC SPIN pressed the pace briefly then stalked
the front runner, chased on the turn, launched an all out drive but just missed. PERFECT CRIME, at the rear entering the turn, was hustled three and
four-wide then finished gamely in vain. BEYOND BORDERS, away slowly, settled off the pace, rode the rail then two-wide on the turn, moved to the rail in
the stretch and rallied determinedly. DECIMATOR stalked the pace, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. THREE MILE LIMIT,
in range, came four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but did not threaten. TAPE TO TAPE got off slowly then moved up to stalk the pace, was
hustled from the rail on the turn but tired a furlong out.

AMORE dueled early, chased two-wide on the turn then was game to the end. D'S SOUL settled off the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn then
rallied gamely to no avail. STORM GAUGE was steadied at the start, checked behind rivals early turn, moved outside but was steadied late turn then rallied
willingly in the stretch. FRENCH CHARM chased in range early, was hustled two-wide on the turn, moved to the rail in the stretch and finished gamely.
MUSTN'T GRUMBLE chased early, was hustled hard along the rail on the turn but failed to menace. RED QUEEN'S COURT dueled briefly, chased along
the rail through the turn but evened out in the final furlong. PODGORA settled off the pace, closed into the turn, was hustled three-wide but lacked a closing

POWER HOUSE settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, rallied between foes, bid furlong out and drove clear in the late stages. STORMY
VISION stalked the pace, chased from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, bid late turn, led into the stretch but failed to contain the winner.
FRESHIEINTHEFOREST settled off the pace, encountered traffic late on the far turn then rallied late from between foes. MAMITA'S CHICA hopped at the
start and settled off the pace, came four-wide through the far turn, was hustled into the stretch but finished evenly. DEE DEE'S ANGEL raced in mid pack,
was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but was eased up in traffic late. CALAIS COVE, away slowly and off the
pace, came two to four-wide through the final turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. I LOOK INCREDIBLE moved up to duel on the first
turn, battled with OXESOME, wore that one down midway through the far turn, was quickly engaged by STORMY VISION, yielded, and tired in the stretch.
OXESOME showed early foot, was joined in a duel on the first turn, was checked midway through the final turn and backed away.

Footnotes
PINK LLOYD stalked in hand, was blocked while two-wide on the turn but he exploited a window of opportunity that opened at the top of the stretch, angled
to the outside and powered to the front, drawing clear still well in hand. SILENT JIMMIE bumped lightly with MAGICAL MAN at the start, settled off the pace,
chased two-wide and from the rail on the turn, angled out in the final furlong and rallied determinedly. DUN DRUM forced the pace, came two-wide through
the turn, was all out but was passed mid stretch but still chased to the end. NOT SO QUIET set a pressured pace, was passed mid stretch and gave way
grudgingly. MAGICAL MAN, bumped at the outset then rated off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn then evened out with a 16th to run. SOUPER
SUCCESS stalked early, was hustled three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
BAYOU BELLE bumped with NORTHERN ALLURE at the start, set a pressured pace,shook clear into the far turn, widened in the stretch and finished under
a hand ride. CLASSY GIZMO raced in mid pack, closed four-wide late turn then rallied gamely outside. JLOHR JAN stalked the pace, was hustled two and
three-wide on the far turn then chased to the end. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then closed
belatedly. GET OFF MY TAIL settled in mid pack, was hustled angling in from three-wide to the rail late turn and bumped QUEEN ANDHER COURT then
never reached contention. ATTENTIONSEEKER stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail late turn then flattened out in the final 16th. LA BONITA forced
the pace, dueled briefly on the backstretch, chased two-wide on the turn then tired in the stretch. BLUSHING BREW, in mid pack early, rode the rail
throughout, fell back on the far turn but lacked a rally. THE SUIR broke slowly and inward, raced from well back and was never in contention. NORTHERN
ALLURE, bumped at the start, settled in striking range, faded three-wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. QUEEN ANDHER COURT raced in mid pack,
was bumped and forced to check along the rail late turn, was eased upper stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.
