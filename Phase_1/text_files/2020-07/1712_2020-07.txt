Footnotes
ALERT KITTEN stalked the leader, was a factor on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch proved best. AILIS was unhurried early and roused on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BLU COLLAR ROMANCE was off the pace, raced evenly on the turn
and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. SONNY'S DREAM showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat.
AWESOME DRILL showed speed from the outside and set the pace but was headed mid turn and came up empty.

at the top of the stretch was second best. I HAVE FEELINGS showed no speed and gained ground on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch needed more. BANANA RAMA was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. CANTICO
was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. GET SAUCY stumbled at the start and trailed the field on the turn while outrun.
SCARLET HOUR was hustled early but chased on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
AUGUSTO B set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure in mid stretch proved best. MR CHANGUE stalked the early leader and was a
factor on the turn but with a bid from the four path in mid stretch was no match for the winner. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was in range and moved up on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. HIGH ROLLING DUDE trailed the field early and was hustled along on the turn but from the
six path at the top of the stretch evened out. TWO STELLAS was in touch but chased on the turn and had nothing left. TISHINA had no speed and showed
little in a dull effort. CUMMINGS ROAD was off the pace and showed nothing while never in contention.

CLASSY VISION was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch drew off. PRINCESS MORO was off the
pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. STORMY SUZIE stalked the leader, was a factor on the
far turn and had the lead at the top of the stretch but failed to hold. NO EXTENSIONS was in mid pack and raced evenly on the far turn but was no real
threat. NEW YORK MINT had no speed and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SAVOIA was in range and
saved ground on the far turn but failed to fire. MISS PATRIOT was in touch but chased on the far turn and came up empty. MINTAKA BELLE set the pace
but was headed on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

AWESOME FIVE tracked the leaders from the inside, was roused on the turn and from the four path through the stretch fought gamely for the win. BIG
BLACK STORM was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and gained gradually through the stretch but just missed. WALL STREET WOLF was up
close, a factor on the turn and had the lead from the three path through the stretch but gave way late. OMAR was hustled early and had a slim lead on the
turn but had nothing left. BALDUR was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.
YALLHAVEANICEDAY forced the pace and had a bid from between foes on the turn but flattened out. ZAPATA SKY was well back and showed nothing in a
dull effort.
