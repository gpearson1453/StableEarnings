the inside speed, angled out in upper stretch trying to keep up with the winner but could not, flattening out. KEIGHTLEY brushed a foe at the start and was

Footnotes
CONJURING went to a clear lead, shook off a foe entering the stretch and drew away. EDGE OF PLEASURE chased inside, angled out to the four path,
gained on the leader around the turn, confronted that one entering the stretch but was no match. STORMY JUSTICE raced toward the back, took the turn
from off the rail, came wide into the stretch and flew late but too late for the place spot. HIGHLY VISIBLE raced at the rear, lost ground on the turn, and
moved up on the rail down the lane. MS. MAXIMA steadied early on the backstretch, was unhurried, advanced on the turn in the two path but faltered in the
final furlong. PRINCESS BROOKE chased the leader and faltered at the eighth pole.

ULTRA RAYS tracked between horses to the turn, took over at the half and went clear in the stretch run under stout hand urging. HYDRA'S HOPE had
awkward start, raced back to the half, rallied three wide through the stretch run for place spot. PATTI GO GIRL rushed between horses early while evenly
with no gain in the drive. SWING MUSIC unhurried early, came four wide with a move into the stretch but leveled off late. TIZ STELLA flashed brief speed to
the turn and backed up readily from there. SUMMIT POINT had inside speed to the quarter pole but could not go on and gave way with little resistance.

on the turn, dueled inside two foes down the stretch, led late but settled for show in deep stretch. CORA ANNE bumped a horse at the start, tracked the
pace, came inside on the turn, drifted wide in the stretch, and improved position late. DON'T STOP MARIA bounced between horses at the start, raced a
reserved third, took the three path on the turn, dueled outside two foes down the stretch and tired at the eighth pole. EQUULEI was no threat.
