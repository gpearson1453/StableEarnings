CAVATICA stalked the pace, cruised past the leader leaving the turn and drew off in the stretch. CREDIT CARD FRAUD gained the early lead, set a tepid
pace, was no match and swished her tail repeatedly in the stretch. JITTERS sluggish at the start, chased while four wide and kept on in the stretch. RED
RIVER GIRL never menaced. BELLERIVE raced forwardly along the inside and weakened. MAGIC IN A HAT stumbled at the start, was outpaced while four
wide and did not factor.
