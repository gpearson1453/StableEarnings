Footnotes
BETTER BEGIN stalked the leader three wide, bid to the front near the three eighths, lost the lead again briefly but in mid-stretch but battled back gamely.
RUSSIAN MELODY eased back and to the outside near the far turn, bid to even terms but was outfinished. SYMPHONY OF LOVE saved ground off the
leaders and continued well. CINNAMON LATTE prompted the pace between foes and began fading on the turn. CATCH A PEEP ducked out sharply at the
start and was always outrun. STORM BABE dropped back inside and was never in contention. DUBLIN MEGAN quickly obtained a clear lead, vied briefly
on the turn and stopped. PATTY'S TEMPLE lagged far behind throughout. Due to inclement weather, the race was delayed for an hour.

Footnotes
VERO SUN came in bumped with SAMBAM leaving the gate, raced two wide, took the lead inside sixteenth pole and edged away. EL FENOMENO set the
pace in four path, remained clear through deep stretch then weakened late. SAMBAM, unruly loading, came out and contributed to the bumping at the start
with the winner, was wide and outrun early, angled in through stretch and finished well. COAST TO COAST, racing just off the rail and just off the pace,
came up empty. TICKED ALL DABOXES, in the four path, failed to menace. MIRROR MIRROR, inside winner, was left with the rail after a quarter mile then
tired. WATCH THE DIP, just off the pace in three path, eased out and tired. NONNO PIETRO, wide and just off the pace, tired. LEYENDA AZTECA broke
slowly and failed to menace. LITTLE LATER was never a threat. GOSLEY was always far back. A LENGTHY GATE CAUSED ANOTHER DELAY.

Footnotes
DEE JAY forced the pace outside, took over before half mile then quickly drew away handily. VIOLENT IMPACT dropped back inside, angled out on the
final turn and closed well while no match. SUPER DANCER settled wide off the leaders, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened out. UNCOMMON
VALOR prompted the leaders for half a mile and steadily faded. AMERICAN QUALITY set a pressured pace for nearly half a mile and stopped. BREW DOG
lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. SPIDER BITE lacked speed and was never in contention. DANZAFIED saved ground within striking range and
faltered. CRITICAL REVIEW broke out at the start, raced wide, stopped and lost contact with his field.

The latter, raced two wide, drifted out and finished on even terms with GRAVES ISLAND. THREE PHASE, wide throughout, was never a serious threat.
KLINGON WARRIOR broke slowly, saved ground, drifted out through stretch. FIX ME A SANDWICH set the pace outside winner and then gave way leaving

TERRY'S CHARM settled inside, advanced along the rail and edged away late under steady handling. REFUSEING chased outside, bid on the final turn
and closed well wide too late. KOAN set a clear pace, was collared near the quarter pole but continued gamely. MACHTREE saved ground just off the
leaders, led briefly in the stretch but yielded. IMPACTFUL chased wide for five furlongs and gave way. TRILOGY within striking range early, weakened
steadily. STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WORD ON A WING was slowest from the gate but then was quickly hustled to the lead, set the pace in four path, drifted out a bid through stretch and won
under strong handling. SPIRIT SPECIAL came out leaving the gate then moved to the rail, angled out in stretch and gained place. FORT FORTITUDE
chased while racing in the five path then couldn't keep pace. SPLICETHEMAINBRACE, outside early, angled in and faded. BUDDY'S RUN raced wide and
tired. ROOKIE SALSA fanned out leaving the gate, was never a factor.

Footnotes
MT SURIBACHI stalked the pacesetters, bid to the front into the stretch and edged away driving. STAY HYDRATED saved ground on the turn, angled out in
the stretch and closed well. STAR LUCK dueled along the inside, moved clear at the quarter pole but proved empty. PAT'S GRONK ran off in the chute prior
to the start, was blocked briefly advancing on the turn and continued rallying. INSPIRING JUSTICE set a pressured pace inside then began faltering on the
turn. GRANDFIRE chased between foes and was never a factor. GALLIC WAR saved ground and gave way readily. JUST EXPLODED broke sluggishly
and raced far back throughout. PROTA chased wide down the backstretch and stopped.
