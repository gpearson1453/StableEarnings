Footnotes
SUPER E rated covered up, commenced rally in upper stretch, surged in final strides between horse for dead heat win. HANDY rated nicely, rallied three
wide on final turn circling horses, steady gain driving in outside lane for dead heat win. COUNT DOWN led setting a soft pace, hada rail trip throughout, just
missed in close three horse finish. AIR LIFT settled, moved forward to second on backstretch then tired in stretch. WATCHTHEBOURBON was never a
threat. CREATIVE MINESHAFT was hard held at the start, drifted wide first turn, outrun. A steward's inquiry into stretch run resulted in no change of order.

Footnotes
LA LIMONADA stalked the pace two wide in the clear, bid two wide around the far turn, was initially repulsed in upper stretch, continued on determinedly
outside and was up in deep stretch. BOURBON AIDA set a clear pace inside, dug in inside of the winner when that foe bid midway around the far turn,
battled through the lane and gave way grudgingly. SPEED ALERT settled off the pace while racing three wide, moved up still three deep around the far turn
and rallied for the show. GUILDER saved ground in midpack around the first turn, raced between foes down the backstretch, angled four wide in upper
stretch and had a mild rally outside. PEARLYVILLE tracked the pace from the rail, bid in upper stretch but was on heels through most of the lane and never
got a clear run. AMPLIO ESQUEMA saved ground to no avail. RISING LIGHT was reluctant to load, raced two wide and played no factor. COLERAINE
chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty. LISTENTOTHESTARS hesitated at the start, was rank under urging early, trailed in the two path
around the first turn, rushed up four wide down the backstretch and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
WHAT THE BEEP set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, widened in upper stretch and held firm under a drive. TAN AND TIGHT stalked
the pace two wide between rivals, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly to narrow the gap. BELLA AURORA settled off the pace in the clear
inside, angled four wide nearing the lane and rallied mildly to gain the show. SOLARTE chased the pace from the rail and lacked a rally. DETERMINED
LOVE stalked the pace three wide and tired in the lane. CHASING MIDNIGHT broke a step slow and trailed throughout.

nearing the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. BALLYHOO PRINCE settled off the duel two wide around the first turn, raced in the clear inside down
the backstretch, bid three wide nearing the lane, took the lead in upper stretch, was quickly swallowed up by the winner but battled on to save second.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SWAP led throughout prevailing in a long drive to fend off closers.. MAKES MO CENTS found a gap between horses to improve position and
continued to close well for second. BARREL OF STOUT saved ground, swung to outside, gave chase under a stiff drive. DIZZY SIGHT was stalking in third,
then outfinished in the stretch. SPEAKERIT stalked to the turn, then weakened. RESIDENT LIBERAL rated mid pack, had the rail tracking leaders in the
stretch, then weakened. AMERICA'S SIMMARD angled to the outside soon after the break and continued to have a very wide trip, never a factor.. VINTNER
was never a threat. SIMMARDSTRIKE trailed.
