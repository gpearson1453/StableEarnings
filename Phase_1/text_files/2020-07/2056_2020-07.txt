Footnotes
NEXT AFFAIR stumbled at the start, was in behind rivals four wide into the first turn, began to move in early on that bend to about the two path before
coming back out three deep, advanced outside rivals three wide on the far turn, took command past the three-sixteenths and kicked clear under steady
handling. MISTER KOWEN was urged at the break and switched off the inside in the early going, went two to three wide setting the pace on the first turn
before being joined by an inside rival up the backstretch, stalked that one four deep before moving in entering the far turn, regained the lead just briefly near
the three-sixteenths but was soon overtaken by NEXT AFFAIR, kept on to hold the place. SEA EMPEROR was a bit slow into stride from the gates but
urged along, advanced inside early up the backstretch to take the lead at the five-eighths pole, dictated terms on or just off the rail while pressed by MISTER
KOWEN, began to weaken but kept on to try to regain the place while settling for show honors. ANCIENT LAND had trouble cornering into the first turn
going three to four wide on that bend, switched outside a rival late up the backstretch, went five then four wide on the far turn, could make no headway in
the lane. CHARLIE COMANCH brushed the outside rival at the start then was urged forward, was still caught four to five wide on the first turn off the
leaders, shifted to the rail up the backstretch and failed to threaten. STREAKS BRO was brushed lightly at the break, caught five to six wide on the first turn,
shifted in from six deep to the three path early on the far turn, dropped back and tired.

RIG TIME pressed the pace from inside foes but off the rail, went into the turn in the three path battling inside a rival and moving in a path on that bend, took
charge past the furlong marker and drew clear to tie the track record. WHEREDOESTHECASHGO bobbled ever so slightly at the start but recovered quickly
enough to break on top, vied outside foes, went four to three wide on the turn, could not match strides through the final furlong but was second best. DEL
MAR SUMMER switched off the inside, stalked off the leading pair going in the three to four path on the turn, proved no match for those two but was best of
the rest. MY INDIAN WARRIOR was in striking range while inside a rival early, continued to pursue outside five then four wide on the turn and failed to rally
in the stretch. E J'S GOLD chased from outside, went six then five wide on the turn, failed to rally. MR. MOOCH showed brief speed from between runners,
dropped back leaving the backstretch going four then three wide on the turn, tired. PULPITS FOX was away slowly and devoid of speed despite urging, was
kept wide going four wide into the turn and swinging seven deep out of that bend, passed tired rivals. NO PASA NADA angled in past the seven-sixteenths
reaching the rail just before entering the turn, saved ground but came up empty. REBOUNDER raced off the inside in the four to five path through the turn
and was never a threat. D E LOVER hopped at the start, chased in behind two wide into the turn, was eased up at that juncture and pulled up by the top of
the stretch then vanned off.

Footnotes
CERVEZA was bumped at the break, allowed to settle into stride then moved up inside heading up the backstretch to contest the pace, edged clear on the
turn in the two path, extended the margin into upper stretch and held safe. EFFORT N RESULTS stumbled at the start, trailed far back early, began to pick it
up on the turn in the two path, rallied between rivals through traffic to get up for place. SHAME ON POWERS came out at the break, was between runners
up the backstretch, chased three wide on the turn, lost place late. FRANCHISE TAGGED bumped the inside rival at the start then steadied on heels soon
after, moved in and settled just off the leaders, saved ground on the turn, evened out in the lane. STORMIN FAST raced in the back half early, began to
pass rivals six deep on the turn swinging eight wide into upper stretch and improved position. EVACUEE was wide early, entered the turn in the seven path
then tucked in behind runners five deep on that bend, was encouraged along and improved position but needed more to threaten. SEVEN SILVER COINS
vied for the early lead from between runners, went five wide on the turn chasing, drifted out past the furlong marker. JIM EDD WHO chased from between
runners early, dropped back and moved in behind foes four wide entering the turn, came up empty for the drive. DECK HUMOR chased outside, went five
wide on the turn, checked when in tight past the eighth pole. MORE ACTION soon dropped back in the four path on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
WALTZING ATTILA got away alertly and was soon clear, dictated the pace in the two to three path through the turn and extending the advantage, held sway
under steady handling. LET IT ROLL tracked the pace from inside on or just off the fence, could make no headway on the winner but held the place.
FLIGHT SONG was ridden along and guided inwards up the backstretch, went two wide on the turn, gained mildly. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY was in tight early
soon after the break, settled last but one, went three to four wide on the turn beginning to advance and was gaining late. BALLINOUTTACONTROL saved
ground inside on or just off the rail, improved position but lacked the needed late kick to threaten. WEDDING DANCE chased the pace, went four wide and
outside foes on the turn then weakened in the stretch. PINK CADILLAC was bumped at the break, raced near the inside up the backstretch then switched
outside a rival past the three-eighths going three wide on the turn, failed to rally. SOFIA'S GIFT tracked the leader from inside foes but off the fence then
dropped back between rivals, entered the turn three wide moving out five deep later on that bend, continued to weaken. I'M A DANCIN WHO was mid-pack
and outside early, moved in from six to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. SHUG'S BEST chased briefly from outside going five to six wide on the turn,
dropped back and faded. LADY BLACK JACK bumped the inside rival and steadied slightly at the start, lacked early speed and trailed while kept wide in the
five path through the turn, was never a threat.
