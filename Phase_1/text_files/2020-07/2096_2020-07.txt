Footnotes
OHYOUBEAUTIFULDOLL showed the best early speed while racing just off the rail was part of a three horse speed duel headed in the stretch but fought
back gamely for the win. LEBRON JANE raced three wide in a three horse speed duel came on even terms with the winner in the stretch but could never
get by that one and had to settle for second. FABULOUS FORUM had a tough trip right behind the three horse speed duel as she was full of run with no
where to go found a small opening on the rail tried to come through but was forced to steady in tight quarters. FLY DONNA FLY was between rivals in the
three horse speed duel but gave way in the stretch. MAIUSHCA was three wide on the turn and then fanned six wide entering the stretch and could not
make up ground. MISS MEAD raced along the inside and could not make up ground. OUR LADY BLING raced in the two path on the turn and tired through
the lane.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN LOTUS was away from the gates best and was able to get to the rail and drew clear easily while not asked for run through the stretch and
was geared down late. OOPSY DAISY chased the speed in the two path and was no match for the winner while clearly second best. DIVINE BLESSING
was off a step slow but quick to recover to get into contention along the inside but could not go with the top pair through the lane but was clearly third best.
SUBTLE RIDE raced along the inside but could not make up ground but was up for fourth. SARAH'S STAR raced three wide on the turn and could not gain
through the stretch. CURLIN TO COLOR broke a bit awkwardly to trail early was six wide on the turn and never a factor. SIZZLING GRACE was mid pack
along the inside and faded on the turn. SUNSHINE ELSIE raced four wide on the turn and had nothing in the drive.

SON OF ELEANOR took command of the race on the turn opened a clear lead through the stretch appeared he would be caught in deep stretch but found
just enough to hold on for the win. COWBOY DON was well off the early pace began his move on the turn and then burst into contention inside the eighth
pole looked like he would go right on by but just missed. AL RHYTHM raced three deep in the stretch but was outfinished while clearly holding third.
SMOKIN B raced two wide throughout while close to the early pace and had no rally in the stretch. COUNT N GOLD showed the best early speed and
opened a good lead early was challenged on the turn and gave way entering the stretch. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL raced along the inside and never mounted
a rally.
