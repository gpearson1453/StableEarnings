Footnotes
WE MISS GENO was not away on the lead but was quickly hustled to the front along the inside responded when challenged on the turn and drew clear late
for the win. STORMY GALE popped the gate and had a quick early lead but could not get to the rail and raced two wide on the turn and could not match
strides with the winner but held second. BEE EXXTRAVAGANT was checked up the backstretch and forced to steady then had to go three wide on the turn
and could not make up the ground. WHO B DAT Raced in the two path on the turn but could not make up ground. LAST CALL LEROY Raced along the
inside and never mounted a rally. ITS YOUR THING raced midpack for the first quarter and faded after that. PERFECT SPRING trailed throughout and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
COLORADO CANDY showed good early speed to engage for the lead in the two path and drew clear under mild urging in the final furlong. MAN OF FEW
WORDS was on the outside in a three horse speed duel and held tough to the eighth pole but could not match strides with the winner late. BUCKSHOT
PETE broke in the air to trail out of the gate came four wide on the turn and finished well for third while not a threat to the top two. COUGAR PASS showed
good early speed on the inside to set the pace but tired in the stretch. CRUZ'N OLLIE raced along the inside but never mounted rally. DON RAMON popped
the gate and had a quick half length lead but quickly dropped back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BLUEGRASS BETTY came five wide entering the stretch and steadily wore down the leaders to get the win going away in the final yards. BRAVE DISH
battled for the lead while three wide and was able to hang on for second. BIG JOSIE was well back along the inside and made a good move through the
lane to be up for third. QUICK LEGEND was along the inside and moved up through the stretch. FLASHIN THE CASH showed good early speed to engage
for the lead but tired in the stretch. CHARMING ANGEL was four wide on the turn and could not make up the needed ground. ULTIMATE INDIAN showed
good early speed along the inside to battle for the early lead but had nothing left in the stretch. KURIOUS KENNEDY was four wide on the turn but lacked a
rally when asked and faded. ALTARED EGO was always well back and not a serious factor. SCOTIA QUEEN lacked the usual early speed and was hustled
a bit to get to midpack and then faded after that.

Footnotes
TUFF WILLY TE showed the best early speed while racing just off the rail relinquished the lead on the turn as Chuck Nazty came through on the inside to
put a head in front on the turn came back again in the stretch and then fended off two late challengers for the win. SAND WALKER showed good speed in
the three path to engage for he lead was carried out a bit entering the stretch but found more and was able to regain second. RED WES had a very tough
trip was off slow and rushed along the inside had traffic issues when lacking room going into the turn and had to steady re gathered along the inside had to
switch paths at the top of the stretch and could not make up the needed ground when free. CHUCK NAZTY was off slow and then rushed up along the
inside to take a brief lead on the turn when the frontrunner drifted out a bit but could not sustain that bid and tired through the stretch. BUDDY NINER was
wide on the turn and had no rally in the stretch. WILDCATINJEANS raced mid pack and never mounted a rally. EYES ON CHARLIE was wide on the turn
for home and then drifted out mid stretch and could not gain on the leaders. GRIGSTON showed some brief speed but tired after a quarter. BEHOLD DE
SPRING Was always well back and not a factor.
