Footnotes
DUOPOLY pulled a bit in the early stages, then took over to set the pace, showed the way racing with a comfortable lead entering the far turn, responded
when briefly roused, finished willingly and was ridden out. CURLY RUTH raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the backside, continued three
wide on the far turn and rallied outside for second. DANCE RECITAL raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn and rallied on the rail for
third. SKOL CHANT raced close up along the rail, chased inside on the far turn and weakened. GLOBAL BRAND raced three wide early, then off the pace
inside, moved up three wide at the quarter pole and lacked a rally. POSITIVE POWER raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. PAU HANA was
outrun early and did not factor. NATURALLY QUICK raced four wide early on, then stalked two wide and faded. NO CON TESTA led the field passing the
wire the first time, was content to take back off the pace, then stalked outside and gave way. The final time is HAND TIMED. Fractions are unavailable.

LAKI away alertly, raced close up early on the inside, chased on the turn, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside of AWESOME ANYWHERE, ran
past that rival and pulled away late. AWESOME ANYWHERE dueled between rivals for the early lead, dueled outside on the turn, gained a short lead, was
no match for the winner and clearly second best. MIDTOWNCHARLYBROWN chased outside, raced between rivals on the turn, rallied mildly outside and
got third. AMERICAN PASTIME raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up inside on the turn and rallied mildly in the two path. CHATEAU dueled two wide for
the early lead, battled inside on the turn and tired. FACTOR IT IN raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and gained belatedly on the rail. INK
SPLOTZ dueled three or four wide, chased outside and gave way.
