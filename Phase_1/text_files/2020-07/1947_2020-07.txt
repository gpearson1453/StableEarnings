Footnotes
FREEDONIA in tight checked briefly early, ranged up on the outside on the turn vying three deep in upper stretch taking over late. DUNK pressed the pace
putting a head in front on the turn, extending in upper stretch would cede to outside pressure saving place. HEAT ROAD led early then dueled through the
turn into upper stretch extending late coming up a bit short. STAR MANEUVER a step slow through the turn gave a mild rally in upper stretch. SLEEPING
GIANT pressed early then chased on the turn fading into upper stretch. ICY INTERLUDE played no factor. MAGIC SPARKLE gave way on the turn.
