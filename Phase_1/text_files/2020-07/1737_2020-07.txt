SECOND BITE settled outside, faded on the final turn then came again and surged late between foes to get up in time. WOOD BEE set a clear pace inside,
was collared in the stretch then battled back in a game try. NEW YORK ROCK STAR stalked the leader inside, angled out, led narrowly in mid-stretch, but
was outfinished. GO METRO GIRL lacked speed, saved ground throughout, offered a brief rally then flattened out late. CARMELTINI chased between
rivals, moved inside on the final turn and gave way. LIKE A PRO dropped well behind, moved very wide and was never a factor. OUR CLAIRE BEAR broke
alertly and pressed the pace but faded after half a mile.

GENERAL BELLAMY stalked the pacesetter throughout, collared that rival near the head of the lane and won the head bob in a stretch long duel. SIGHT
LINE hustled to the front inside, vied through the stretch just missing in a game effort. ZIPPED CODE settled off the leaders, bid inside to the stretch then
flattened out. HIS ROYAL MAJESTY rated between rivals, bid on the final turn and chased inside through the stretch. DRUMMER DON dropped well behind
inside and continued well without menacing. MARQ ONE lacked speed racing wide and passed fading rivals. GINNER dropped back early and was never in
contention. WINDOW TABLE well placed outside the pacesetters, was asked for run on the final turn but proved empty. NOBLE KENT chased outside and
lacked a rally. BACKSTRETCH GEORGE saved ground within striking range but retreated. GOOD SAVE was squeezed back soon after the start then
faded losing contact with his field.

wide and just off the pace, tired. FLAT BILL stalked two wide then stopped.

Footnotes
MADAM MEENA stumbled at the start, pursued the pacesetter, took over into the stretch and pulled away while under wraps late. QUESTEQ saved ground
off the leaders, rallied but was no match for the winner. TRUNK OF MONEY chased three wide, moved closer on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.
CLEVER SARAH quickly sprinted clear, was collared into the stretch and weakened. WINGS OF FURY dropped back after the start and failed to rally.
CARDI G stumbled badly at the break losing any chance then raced far back. SHE'S PRIMO was pinched back in the early stages then never a factor.

Footnotes
SWEET REBELLION, between second flight, collared the lead near sixteenth marker and slowly edged away. ROSIE SUMMER set the pace in three path
and gave way grudgingly. LA BELLA CHICA, just off the rail and just off the pace, finished willingly. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE, racing just off the rail, failed to
respond. GRACEFUL MONARCH, in the four path while just off the pace, faded late. AFRICAN SONG saved ground and failed to menace. WROTE TO A
DIVA was never a serious threat. YELITZA, bumped leaving the gate, raced very wide. CATALINA R came out sharply leaving the gate and bumped
CHOCOLATTE then never threatened. CHOCOLATTE was clobbered leaving the gate and lost all chance.
