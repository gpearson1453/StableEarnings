HAMAZING VISION broke inwards brushing ABOVE BOARD, was righted to track that rival along the inside from just out of striking distance to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting to the three path racing into the far turn, took over racing past the quarter mile to open a clear advantage and
held TUCKER TIME safe to the end under right handed pressure. The latter was settled last to the first turn, continued under some restraint into the
backstretch, gathered momentum nearing upper stretch while swinging out four wide and continued willingly to close the gap. ABOVE BOARD, brushed at
the start, was urged to the lead just off the inside, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn, but yielded to the winner nearing upper stretch. CABIN JOHN
tracked the pacesetter outside the eventual winner as part of the second flight, angled to the inside entering the far turn but had no closing bid. MINISTER'S
GLORY tracked off the second flight while angling inside but faded early.

CATERINA IANO broke readily to gain terms with the leader attending the pace under light rating racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper
stretch to gain a narrow advantage from between foes entering the lane and edged clear under left handed pressure. LIL' RED DEVIL tracked off the
second flight outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted out three wide after a half while being prompted to advance, was caught four wide through the far
turn advancing in tandem with several rivals and continued willingly to prevail for the place honors. LADY LANGFUHR, brushed at the start, angled to the
inside to track off the second flight to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, switched outside foes to race four wide in the closing stages but
continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. CHINA DISH tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out to bid
three deep between foes racing through the far turn to upper stretch but had no final kick. STEAL THE THUNDER broke out brushing at the start, was
righted, then urged inside a rival dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, briefly resisted nearing upper stretch but gave out once entering the
lane. BLUES TOUCH tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
KELLER'S GOLD broke sharply, dictated the pace racing off the inside to the turn, was prompted to hold safe a rival's challenge to widen the advantage
racing into upper stretch and finished in hand once the issue was decided. CREATIVE ART tracked the pacesetter four wide in early stages, was prompted
to advance three deep racing through the turn and edged a rival for the place honors late while proving no match. RUN AWAY BETT, urged to a forward
placing just inside the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, switched outside the leader midway through the turn while moving to briefly close the gap
nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. FEARLESS WILL, off a step slowly, tracked just off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn and
continued evenly to late stages. LONG STATION tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight in the opening stages but steadily faded into the
stretch. VALLEY WILDCAT was settled last outside foes racing through the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.

shifted four wide entering the lane and continued with a steady late response to narrowly prevail in time under firm right handed pressure. DRAMA
CHORUS, off a step slowly, quickly recovered to track just off the first flight under light rating to the backstretch, advanced when prompted to bid for
command three deep nearing upper stretch, gained a clear advantage between calls while shifting to the inside and grudgingly resisted several challengers
to the end. J P WARRIOR angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, gradually drew into contention in tandem with the eventual
winner along the inside on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out to split foes, then bid between rivals racing past
midstretch but was outkicked. MR. COUGAR settled off the second flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing through the
lane and continued with an effort to gain position. SILVER MAKER settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the lane but made no
impression. MALIBU JACK, urged along the inside prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way into the stretch. ILLUMINATI
was urged disputing the pace outside a rival, then between foes into the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch.

SWEEPING EDGE, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening stages, was eased off those rivals to stalk the pace under rating along the inside
to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn to split foes three deep, moved to challenge for command in that path racing into upper stretch and went
clear late under brisk handling. PUBLIC SAFETY, urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the first turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage after a half,
continued to dispute the issue into the lane but proved only second best. FINN COUNTRY, urged between foes prompting the pace on a narrow advantage
racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue to upper stretch but weakened late. CAPTAIN DRAKE tracked off the first flight between foes from out of
striking distance to the backstretch and continued evenly to late stages while gaining some position. WATER PATROL was settled outside foes early, swung
out five wide racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. BIG FALCON ROCKET settled along the inside early,
saved ground to the lane but lacked a rally. HATTIES JEWEL, squeezed at the start, was held up last while angling to the rail early, was prompted to make
some brief progress after a half but came up empty on the far turn. SON OF POSEIDON, caught four wide in the opening stages, was urged to a forward
placing three wide racing just off the first flight to the backstretch, briefly advanced on the leaders in tandem with the eventual winner while caught four wide
into the second bend, soon gave way and drifted out widest racing into the stretch.

DROP THE GLOVES broke readily to gain a clear advantage racing well off the rail in the opening quarter, shifted in entering the turn disputing the issue
while momentarily losing the advantage after a half but continued with a steady late response to repel OH BROTHER JACK and went clear late under firm

after a half, but proved no match for the winner in the drive. TRUE WEST tracked the leaders three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing to
the turn and continued evenly in that path into the stretch. VOW OF FRANCIS settled into stride off the inside, was fanned five wide racing into the lane but

Footnotes
GEAUXCRO prompted to a forward placing racing just off the first flight, made a steady advance on those rivals nearing upper stretch to challenge for
command four deep leaving midstretch and prevailed in time under firm right handed pressure. GIANT GAMBLE gained terms prompting a rival's pace into
the turn, pressed the issue between foes past midstretch and edged rivals for the place honors while failing to contain the winner. SERENGETI CAT, urged
to the lead along the rail, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and weakened between foes late. THIRTY SECONDS OUT angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with a mild bid nearest the rail. TWO CHANCE settled off the
second flight racing into the turn, angled five wide racing through the lane but made no impression. ROYAL PRIVACY broke slowly, was prompted to
position between foes in second flight, steadied avoiding close quarters midway through the turn but came up empty racing into the lane. FAMILY CODE
settled along the rail in early stages and proved no threat.

Footnotes
BIRDS VIEW broke sharply, angled to the rail racing into the first turn setting the pace on a narrow margin, held sway into upper stretch and held safe the
challenge of AMANDA STORY under firm right handed pressure. The latter broke inwards bumping VIVA LOVANGO, was righted, then urged between foes
to gain a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, lost some ground to that foe nearing upper stretch but continued with a steady late
bid while just outkicked. FOXYS IRISH AFFAIR tracked the pace inside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, lost some position to the leaders on
the far turn, shifted out three wide in late stages closing the gap on the top pair but made no impression. FAST MATH tracked the pacesetter three deep as
part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn. VIVA LOVANGO broke slowly, then was bumped at the start and
trailed throughout.
