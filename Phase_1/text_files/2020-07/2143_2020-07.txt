Footnotes
CAPTAIN SAM bumped with PROPOSITION leaving the gate, took over soon after, angled to the rail while moving clear midway on the backstretch, stayed
along the rail around the turn and was kept to steady urging. R U HAPPY NOW steadied along the rail leaving the half-mile pole when the winner came in,
chased inside but couldn't gain. UNAQUOI raced three wide into the turn, was carried wide midway on the bend and finished willingly outside.
PROPOSITION was bumped between rivals leaving the gate, steadied, came in on LADY MUNNINGS nearing the half-mile pole, bore out into UNAQUOI
midway on the turn and made up ground late. LADY MUNNINGS came out, bumped with PROPOSITION leaving the gate, was steadied nearing the
half-mile pole, stayed inside and lacked a rally. THE REAL LEFTY raced two wide around the turn, bore out under left hand whip, bumped TANYA'S GEM
through the lane and failed to menace. TANYA'S GEM was forced wide midway on the turn and was bumped through the lane. KELTOI fell back leaving the
gate then couldn't catch up.

under mild urging. JULUCA was unhurried, stayed out from the rail while advancing around the final turn and proved second best while no threat. LADY A.

along the rail for over three-quarters then tired. ARTIFUL MOVE chased the early leader, moved two wide outside that one into the far turn then stopped.

CHARLIE MOPS angled in while not far back on the backstretch, raced two wide between horses around the turn, split foes through the lane and was up on
the nod. ANY SUGAR HONEY was hustled to duel inside, held a short lead between horses into the final strides but was caught. HYMN'S SYLVIA steadied
along the rail nearing the half-mile pole, steadied again while rallying the rail nearing the lane, was sent to vie inside the early leader into the final furlong but
hung. PANGO came in on ZEUS ODIN while unhurried nearing the half-mile pole, raced three wide between horses around the turn, angled out for room
through late stretch and gained to the end. An objection by Hernandez against the winner was not allowed. TWEET KITTEN wasn't far back outside, edged
closer three wide into the stretch then flattened out. GOHARA broke slowly, steadied along the rail nearing the furlong pole and continued evenly. ZEUS
ODIN steadied in tight between horses nearing the half-mile pole then failed to matter. JUST DO THE MATH was hustled to duel two wide to the stretch and
stopped. IT'S NOT FUNNY showed little.

Footnotes
STEADY ROCK ducked out sharply into SUNFLOWER ROSE leaving the gate, was slow early, split rivals to gain command leaving the furlong grounds
then drew out. LUNAR STAR settled, swung wide into the stretch, vied into the final furlong but was no match. SUNFLOWER ROSE was bumped soundly
leaving the gate, made a strong run along the rail after a quarter, sharply angled out three wide for room approaching the lane, loomed boldly between rivals
at the eighth pole and faltered. TALLULAH DARLING set or forced the pace in the three path, ran out some entering the stretch and stopped. MOXIE
MOMENTUM ducked out sharply while breaking on top then was no factor. MARLEE'S MAGIC dueled in the two path to the stretch then stopped.

GIO LUCKY stayed out from the inside while making all the pace and held following a long drive. OFFENDER vied outside the winner in the three path on
the turn but wasn't enough. SPIN LIGHTNING advanced three wide between horses on the turn then flattened out. LETORT broke slowly, came out four
wide on the turn, swung wide into the stretch and lacked the needed closing. POCOPSON STATION lagged early, swung wide into the stretch and gained
mildly outside. NONPLUSULTRA was fractious in the gate, was bumped leaving the chute, raced the three path and failed to matter. LAMECH came in,
bumped NONPLUSULTRA leaving the chute, wasn't far back three wide to the stretch then tired. REY ASTRAY pressed the pace along the rail for less than
a half, stopped and was eased up. REGGAE PIRATE was eased up when outrun.
