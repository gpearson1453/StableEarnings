Footnotes
ALWAYS WORKING sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. ATTA BOY BILLY tracked the
winner from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, failed to gain on that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. SHERM lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position, failed to gain on that top pair but was the best of the rest. BLEU MUSKET chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. HEAVENLY PURSUIT settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. SA LUTE MR. H broke inward, lagged, moved four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

KNOWN VALUE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace of SHEZJUSTINTHYME while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
three-eighths marker, quickly opened a clear lead and was ridden out to the wire. SHEZJUSTINTHYME was away alertly to set a pressured pace from the
inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on for the place. JACANA lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out into the
stretch, angled inside rivals inside the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. FOUR SCORE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through
the turn and finished willingly late. SMASHING SUCCESS was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and failed to menace.
DISCREET DEMONS was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HONEY BAY BEE broke
sharply to press the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going three furlongs.

LAST ONE STANDING hopped at the start, rushed to vie, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and was ridden out to the wire. BERNIE
was off step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. DUSTIN'S PASSION was allowed to settle
early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was up for the show. FATS DOMINUS was away alertly to set a pressured pace
from the inside and gradually gave way. CATS CHAMP lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PRIVATE BOSS was
forwardly placed early, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened after going a half. ENDANGERED was void of early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and was not a factor.

task. SHE OWNS THE PAYNT hopped at the start, was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out into the stretch, was no match for the winner but
finished well to hold the place. ALOTMOREACTION settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly late. YOU GO GIRL

from the inside and gradually weakened. AUTUMN ARRIVES lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten. KISSABLE U broke

SPOT ON was away in good order to duel for the lead with PERFECT PROMISE from off the rail, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held off
the closing CLOSE THE SHOW LO to prevail. CLOSE THE SHOW LO broke awkwardly and was bumped, race just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and rallied late. GAZING settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a
belated bid. STAY IN GRACE was bumped at the start, tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
willingly. SIERRA SUNRISE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. PERFECT PROMISE
disputed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. CLASSIC LEAH was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. CHEROKEE LOUISE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.
FRISKY FOX hopped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
ELLIOTT BAY dueled for the early advantage with MY GRANDPA from off the rail, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and drew off with little need
of urging. MUNCEY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, could not gain on the
winner but finished with a steady bid. MY GRANDPA was bumped at the break, disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way
through the final furlong. WINNING BLUFF showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was
bumped at the start, pressed the pace of the dueling leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
ROUGH RIDE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and was ridden out to the wire to be
kept to task. BLUE BUTTERFLY tracked the pace of the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that foe in the drive but held well to save the
place. MAGIC MAHOGANY pressed the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, drifted out slightly in mid-stretch and failed to gain in the drive.
STARZAN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. PLAN IN THE MAKIN raced off the pacesetters early, moved
six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JAMASON lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. TOKELAND was void of
early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. RIPTIDE ROMEO showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened.
SECOND NATURE SPY was off a step slow, lagged early and did not reach contention.
