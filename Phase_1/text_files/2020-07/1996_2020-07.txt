Footnotes
MOSCATO (GB) tracked the pace towards the inside route, was put strong encouragement angling to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, swung the
widest of all into the stretch, launched a relentless four to five wide rally, struck the front with less than seventy yards to go and edged away. OPTIMUS
PRIME (FR) shifted over to the inside shortly after the field broke from the flag, was well held all the way to the last jump, moved into the three path and
closed the gap on the fourth and final bend, was still in hand spinning into the stretch, settled in at the top of the lane then was given his cue, charged to the
front during the run leading up and then through the furlong grounds, albeit by a narrow margin, faced pressure from both sides in the last eighth, offered
resistance before yielded to the winner in deep stretch, had no trouble after having done so to saving the place. GIBRALFARO (IRE) kept watch on the front
runners while being rated two wide in midpack, came under a ride entering the stretch, put up a bid in earnest before flattening out in the final sixteenth.
REDICEAN (GB) secured a prominent position after the field had been sent on its way, was positioned on the inside border of path two drafting behind the
left shoulder of the leader for most of the trip leading up to the backstretch the second time, unleashed a bold takeover at the seventh hurdle, quickly
extended the margin, sensed others closing in during the final stages of the run around the final turn, was turned loose for the stretch run, gave in to heavy
pressure in midlane and weakened. CHIEF JUSTICE (GB) strung out three wide on the first turn, worked out a tuck into path two after leaving it, would
continue to venture along it all the way to the last turn, stepped into the stretch, lacked the needed response. PRAVALAGUNA (FR) abandoned the inside
for path two at the fifth hurdle, backed away after entering the last turn then was eased down the stretch. SURPRISING SOUL showed the way from near
the two path on a loosely-contested lead, got overpowered by REDICEAN at the initial of two jumps on the backstretch the second time, retreated after
clearing the last one, then was put to a protective hold and allowed to fade away down the stretch. WINNER MASSAGOT (FR) underwent a two wide
pursuit, never made his presence felt, then after being placed to a protective hold for the stretch run, was allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
THOMAS SHELBY coaxed from the gate, got shown an off sided stick for a few strides away from the gate, chased four then three wide from just off a duel
up front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide for home, took over command three-sixteenths from home and inched away under a
drive to prevail. WONDER IN broke out at the start under hustling bumping with CARTHON, dueled three then two wide with TAKE IT TO SCALE to his
inside, swung three wide for home under threat, got headed at the three-sixteenths and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest for the place
honors. CARTHON bumped at the start by WONDER IN, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and
improved position for the show honors. TAKE IT TO SCALE coaxed from the gate, dueled along the inside of WONDER IN from the two path, tucked inside
half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and tired. CALL THE
CAT five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. NORTHERN HAZE three wide in pursuit from the rear of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and never menaced.

Footnotes
PLUM ALI was taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear while given cover in front, started the far turn
in the two path, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths then was roused while removed from cover, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed strongly under a
brisk hand ride to get the lead inside the furlong marker, was given one tap of a down-turned whip into the final sixteenth and proved best under a hand ride
to the wire. STUNNING PRINCESS went to the front, set the pace on the inside through moderate fractions, was asked near the five-sixteenths then came
under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out under a right-handed whip inside the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and overtaken by the
winner but just held the place. UPTOWN FLIRT went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace in third position, saved ground on
the far turn, was given her cue just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into the stretch, chased under the whip in the drive and was out-kicked then
just missed the place but was clear for the show. MO NORMAL bumped with ANAMUYA early while rank under stout restraint then was wrestled back
nearing the first turn, saved ground on that bend, was unhurried at the rear, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path, shifted three then
four wide late on that bend, was roused five wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed
response. ANAMUYA bumped with MO NORMAL early, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside, was roused late on the backstretch,
went three wide under strong urging on the far turn, came under the whip at the five-sixteenths and had nothing left. LOST LAKE traveled around the first
turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. AUNT MARY settled
on the inside, was asked on the final turn, came under the whip at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. (Rail at 12 Feet)

Footnotes
FRESCO remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been released, was third in line on it tracking the front runners, began to slip to the
outside coming up to the end of the second bend, angled three to four wide and was given her cue, charged towards the one to catch, began the final
furlong looming boldly, wrested away the advantage for good during the ensuing sixteenth, then kicked clear, ridden out in the final stages. DIXIE CANNON
established the top in short order, cut over to the rail, showed the way, tailed by APOLLO'S ABRAXIS from the outside, continued along on the same
scenario for three-quarters, stepped into the stretch, was making its way through the furlong grounds when finally asked for more, relinquished to the winner
with approximately a sixteenth remaining, had no trouble salvaging second. NICKY SCISSORS sneaked her way into the pocket early on the clubhouse
bend, eyed the front runners within striking distance, was switched over to stronger handling cutting the corner into the stretch, proved no match.
HUNNYBUNNERDINI pursed the pace from path two in midpack for the opening six furlongs, flashed some interest tipping into the third one at the
five-sixteenths pole, swung into the lane, flattened out in short order. APOLLO'S ABRAXAS prompted the runner up unkind from the two path during the
initial stages, became unhitched after the second split had been posted, went into the stretch and backed away. HOLMDEL PARK got set in the two path,
took it for nearly three-quarters, inched over to the rail in time to be on it turning into the lane, failed to make any impact while railing almost throughout.

Footnotes
IRISH FRONT three then two wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, took
over command at the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. INSTINCTIVE RHYTHM chased three to four wide from just off the pace,
came under encouragement at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. FLATTER ME broke in
at the start bumping with AHEAD OF PLAN who broke outwards twice before separating, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
swung five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. NEW FRONTIER established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, got collared three-sixteenths from home and weakened in the late stages.
O'TROUBLE stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground before recovering under coaxing to be forwardly placed just off the inside, tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ broke in at the start and was
corrected, chased inside briefly before tipping out to the three path, tucked to the two path through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. AHEAD OF PLAN broke out at the start bumping with FLATTER ME twice as that rival broke
inwards, raced briefly in the two path before tipping out to the four path shortly after the start, tucked three wide through the turn, came under a brief flapping
at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and was flashed the stick to the near side while making no impact. ANZIO BEACH chased four
to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four to five wide for home and faltered.

SIMPLICITY (FR) moved in while placed under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved while given cover in front, traveled
around the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch then tipped out a path further while asked, rallied outside under a strong hand ride, was
put to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well to get up in the final three strides under good handling. JOYOUS TIMES came away in
good order, prompted the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was asked a bit near the quarter-pole then took the lead into upper stretch, was
asked for more around the three-sixteenths, came under a left-handed whip in the vicinity of the furlong marker, led determinedly into the final sixteenth but
was caught three strides from the wire while just able to get the place. KITTEN BY THE SEA broke out at the start, moved in on the initial straightaway, went
around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside under a hold, went three to four wide on the far turn, was given her cue inside the
five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch, made a bid inside the furlong marker, battled gamely between horses late and just missed while narrowly able to
get the show. BALON ROSE was taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, was rated off the rail on the backstretch, rounded the far turn while
inside to the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased behind horses into the final furlong, moved in some around the sixteenth-pole and finished
with good courage to just miss the trifecta. PURE WOW went to the front, set the pace on the inside through moderate fractions while getting some
company to her outside, was asked under heavy threat at the quarter-pole then lost the lead into upper stretch, battled under the whip in the drive and was
outfinished. KELLEYCANRUN saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, raced inside on the far turn, was roused in the two path at the
quarter-pole, shifted out while put to a left-handed whip in upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked
the needed kick. BAREEQA saved ground on the first turn, was reserved at the rear, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, was driven three
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. (Rail at 9 Feet) Final time generated from back up electronic timer

Footnotes
BERTRANDA remained forwardly placed after an alert beginning, slid into the pocket approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, tracked the leader
within striking distance, got tipped to the outside after the half had been rattled off, swung three wide and went on to challenge in earnest at three-sixteenths
pole, emerged at the eighth pole narrowly in front, inched his way inward, that is in the direction of the nemesis, hand urged on the right and intermittently
fed some stick work on the opposite one, came in enough so as to cause FIERCE LADY to steady and lose some momentum in the vicinity of the sixteenth
pole, ventured onward crossing the wire in time to fend off PRAIRIE FIRE's late run. PRAIRIE FIRE departed the backstretch from the two path, chased the
pace from near the rear of the pack, stepped into the lane and kicked into his best, altered course to the rail at the furlong grounds, eventually going on to
slip by QUALITY STONES, clawed its way closer and closer to the ones to catch, was maneuvered into the three path in deep stretch, mustered up some
late foot to get up for the place. FIERCE LADY required no urging from the pilot to establish the top, moved onto the inside route, carved out the pace, well
rated and with QUALITY STONES in accompaniment in path two, got turned loose heading onto the head of the stretch, shifted out until about two wide
when called upon for more, got pounced upon by the BERTRANDA sparking off a spirited fight by the furlong marker, yielded, but barely, was battling back
when forced to steady when momentarily put in tighter quarters by the winner at the sixteenth pole, lost its stride then eventually second. AWILLAWAY sent
over to the rail by midway on the backstretch, remained along it during the run around the bend, went into path two for the stretch run, closed in en route for
the final significant slice of the purse. BUSTIN TO PLEASE pursued the pace two to three wide on the turn, was more the latter at the top of the lane, had no
solid closing punch. PUFFERY chased the pace from path three on the bend, was let out a notch as the second split was being posted, got worked into path
five from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response. QUALITY STONES prompted the pace from the two path, put in an abbreviated bid at the top
of the lane, folded after proving to be not up to the task at hand. CARTWHEEL four wide onto the turn, was fanned out one path wider exiting it, failed to
menace.

home, tucked to the two path through the turn and remained patiently handled, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and
drew off under a drive to prevail. MODESTO brushed the near side stall at the start when getting away a half a beat slow, chased just off the inside, got set

home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. SOUPER

wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. UNION COLONEL coaxed from the gate,
dueled inside of FRENCH REEF from the gate while just off the inside, got shaken off by that rival near the half mile pole and tipped out three wide through
the turn now in closest pursuit, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. CALL HOME broke a half a
beat slow without incident, chased three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went four wide for home and made no impact. KITH chased three to four
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

lead into the stretch, kicked clear with three-sixteenths to run, drifted out some when put to a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, switched to a
right-handed whip while drawing away outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted in from the whip, was given a final crack of a right-handed whip inside the
sixteenth-pole then placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. HONEST MISCHIEF stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, settled on
the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and
proved no match while clear for the place. BON RAISON settled towards the rear of the field, was asked while three wide on the turn then driven four wide
into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. MIHOS was urged along at the rear of the
field, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. WENDELL FONG settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, tracked inside on
the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in some late and
came up empty. CAPTAIN SCOTTY came away in front, moved in while setting the pace, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked inside the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch and gave way.

FINANCIALSTABILITY saw the pilot resort to a hand ride after bobbling at the start, attained a forward position, departed the backstretch from path three,
steadily advanced on the front runners, under some encouragement, was hitched up to the leader mustering up a challenge in upper stretch, emerged at the
eighth pole as the new leader, drifted out a few paths from that juncture onward, had the rider flash the whip from the right side late, held safe. NO LIME
took up the chase from the two path on the turn, fanned out five wide coming into upper stretch, rallied for the place. PRINCIPAL DANCER put to a hand
ride after springing from the gate, came out slightly, was corrected but not before three others made contact with each other, went on to take up position in
the pocket by the half mile pole, kept watch within range, got called upon for more at the quarter pole, angled three wide into the lane, espied the wayward
winner and altered course into the two path shortly afterwards, held his ground the remainder of the journey to the furlong marker, had to settle for the show
after flattening out. MANDATORY PAYOUT pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, made it over to the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, got sent out
into the six path during the opening half of the stretch run, went fairly evenly afterwards to en route for the last major check. OH MY PAPA gained the
advantage after the field had been sent off and running, cut the pace from along the inside route, coaxed along, was put to the test by the winner coming
into the lane, yielded, then tired in the last eighth. PRINCE OF NEW YORK worked out a tuck into path two nearing the half mile pole, was yet in it getting
ridden into the lane, moved out slightly wider, made no impact. CONTINUUM brushed a few strides into the contest, got spotted along the inside by the end
of the backstretch, stalked the pace from midpack, arrived into the lane, was steered out in the direction of the seven path, becoming the widest of all, made
no headway. I SAW IT ALL pinched after the start, got guided over to the rail, went on to save ground to no avail. MORE THAN STRIKING prompted the
pace two wide until the end of the bend, shifted into the four path while backing away in the stretch.
