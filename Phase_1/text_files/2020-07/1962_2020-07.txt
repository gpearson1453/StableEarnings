her rival and was just up late. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey's Objection WINK TEXAS was disqualified for interference in the stretch. SQUOX dueled
from the outside early, fought through the turn, remained engaged for the drive, was bumped deep stretch and just missed. GO FIGURE chased the early
pace inside, remained in a forward position but was no match for the top two. MY ALIBI forced the early pace inside but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
PALMY SUNDAE broke well from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled through the turn, remained engaged with CHEESEBURGER through the
drive, drifted out slightly brushing with that one and was just up the final strides. After a Stewards' Inquiry there was no change. CHEESEBURGER dueled
from the outside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive, was brushed by the winner deep stretch and just missed. SIDNEY'S
HUNCH pressed the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but could not keep pace. CAPE TOWN WILLY chased the
early pace outside, responded entering the drive and rallied late. OVERLYAPPEALING could only improve position. SARATOGA VACATION forced the
early pace inside but came up empty in the drive. U COMPLETE ME chased the early pace and tired. DOOLIN was no factor. HE'S NOTE WORTHY was
no threat. SHO MO THE MONEY was never close. JR'S SAUVAGE had a steady fade.
