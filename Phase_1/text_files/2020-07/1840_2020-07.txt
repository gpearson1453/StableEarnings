Footnotes
HIGH DOLLAR never far back, surged along the rail on the turn to make the lead before a half then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best.
PRECIOUS JULES slow early, closed fast in the three path through the stretch and finished second best. REGAL CROSS broke in front, set a pressured
pace four then two wide into the turn then was outfinished. NORESTFORTHEWICKED pressed the pace five then three wide into the stretch then lacked
the needed response. KANDY CHARGE pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch, steadied entering the turn then leveled off. J STARR LINK
broke in a tangle then was in tight at the start and failed to reach contention. YOUR MOMS CALLING vied for the lead along the inside into the turn then
gave way. SONNYS CIGAR pressed the pace between horses two wide down the backstretch, steadied entering the turn and stopped.

of the racetrack and won going away under right handed urging. TROPICAL CYCLONE broke in front, set a pressured pace until mid stretch, drifted to the
four path then finished second best. TACTICAL QUALITY never far back, finished with good courage in the eight path. DINESEN was bumped at the start,
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. LEO D hit the gate, broke outward and bumped DINESEN at the start then closed a gap
late in the four path. WATER MOCCASIN was boxed in behind and between rivals causing his rider to check repeatedly in the opened half mile then went
evenly. KNOCKOUT RANGER moved up four wide on the far turn then leveled off. RED CHILL vied for the lead near the inside into the stretch then faded.
SAY HEY KID was through after a half.

full of run under right handed urging to win as much the best. DARE DAY darted out of the gate and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace while
getting quick fractions into the stretch then was no match for the winner but just held on for second under strong right handed urging. JOSIE'S RIDDLE
allowed to settle, rallied determinedly in the four path through deep stretch and just missed getting up for second. HANSENATION passed tiring rivals.
CUMBER well placed, lacked the needed response. PLAY BALL broke in a tangle and was through early.

Footnotes
PRETTY STORMY away alertly, set all the pace and finished full of run under right handed urging to win going away. KING OF LIGHT close up from the
start, advanced inside into the turn, shifted out to the four path and gained second in a stretch long drive. DIDDY DEW chased the winner and was
outfinished for second. BUBBA had good early speed then faded. TATIS was void early speed and passed tiring rivals along the inside through the stretch.
HIGH APPROVAL had brief speed. D K'S CANDY chased the winner from the two path down the backstretch, checked between rivals entering the turn then
stopped.
