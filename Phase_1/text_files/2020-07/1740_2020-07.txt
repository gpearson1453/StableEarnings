O'MALLEY'S MARCH trailed through the far turn, circled his field quickly to make the lead before the furlong marker and proved best under right handed
urging. LAST DROP OF WINE hopped hitting the side of the gate at the start, was never far back, dug in late four wide and got up for second. MAKE THE
RULES chased the pace into the far turn, led briefly two wide, battled determinedly through the stretch but was outfinished despite a game effort. DOCTOR
LEE with the second flight, went evenly. CUTLER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace into the far turn, was headed briefly, regained
command, set the pace into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAKE POP always within striking distance surged past rivals three wide at the top of the stretch, drew away under left handed urging and won as much the
best while taken in hand late. MIDNIGHT MIKEY stumbled out of the gate in front, battled for the lead two wide then along the inside into the stretch and
gamely held on for second. ALTISSIMO matched strides for the lead three then two wide and was outfinished. OVER ICCE was squeezed at the start and
no threat. MAGNA MAN was no factor. INTO THE OUT dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn then faltered.

closed determinedly in the eight path through the stretch and just missed. GOLDEN PEARL settled just off the leaders into the stretch, drew on even terms
for the lead three wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled the length of the stretch and was outfinished in the final yards. JERSEY BOUNCE broke sharply,
prompted the pace between horses two wide, gained a narrow lead at the top of the stretch and was outfinished in stiff drive. MRS. ROBINSON away
alertly, set a pressured pace three then two wide, dueled until deep stretch and faded late. NEVER FORGET HER pressed the pace along the rail into the
