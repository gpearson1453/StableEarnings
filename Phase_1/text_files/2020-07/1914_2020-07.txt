Footnotes
MOMOS With all members of this sextet being urged along in varying degrees springing from the starting gate, MOMOS assumed the front end in short
order, saw the pilot cease the previously-mentioned brisk encouragement while cutting over to the inside route, showed the way, tailed by MO MISCHIEF to
the outside, began to shake free of the nemesis late on the bend, was coming up to the furlong grounds when finally called upon for more, drew off under a
hand drive in the last eighth. MO MISCHIEF out-hustled for the lead by the top one, went on to force the issue from the two path, got roused turning into the
stretch, reacted a bit greenly at times whenever stick work was being applied, clearly proved no match today. BERHANU the quickest out of the gate by the
barest of margins found itself soon afterwards having to chase the pace instead, was hard ridden travelling two to three wide into the stretch, was more the
latter coming into the lane, backed away finishing a non-threatening third. REPO ROCKS at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, raced three
wide on the turn, as the widest of all, commenced the stretch one path wider, shied out slightly from another late en route for the final significant slice of the
purse. HOLLAND angled over sharply to the rail approaching the half mile pole, tracked the front runners, cut the corner into the stretch getting asked for a
response, tipped out into path two a sixteenth later, had no closing punch. BAJAN RUM backed out after acting up in the gate, proceeded to come away
without apparent mishap, shifted into the two path after HOLLAND took up residence along the inside route at the conclusion of the backstretch, wasn't
making any headway getting taken hold of when the aforementioned foe moved to the outside in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, retreated.

Footnotes
WINNING FACTOR was under firm restraint off the heels of a rival just off the inside into the first turn near the rear of the field, was in behind cover until
tipped out three wide into the clear down the backstretch and steadily advanced moving into contention seven-sixteenths from home, ranged up on the
leader three wide in tandem with KILRONAN between rivals to his inside remaining patiently handled, continued three wide into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away and took over command with three-sixteenths to go, then edged clear under a drive to prevail. BATTALION got bumped between foes
and was pinched back just after the start, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, tipped three wide at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors in the late stages. MR. KRINGLE
coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid
to the furlong grounds then kept on to preserve the show honors. ZIPALONG just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. QUID chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no rally. CATCH THAT PARTY forwardly placed among the main flight in behind the spurting away
leader just off the inside, had KILRONAN tip out in front nearing the far turn and lost some position before backing away to the tail of the field through that
bend, swung three wide into upper stretch under urging and passed a pair of tired foes in the stretch. KILRONAN tracked the pace along the inside in
closest aim of the spurting leader, slipped out to the two path half a mile from home in front of the aforementioned foe and advanced on the leader in
tandem with WINNING FACTOR to his outside through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and
tired. POLAR BEAR PETE established the front and crossed to show the way into the first turn from the two path spurting away from the field into the
backstretch, tucked to the inside and widened away through sensible splits, had the field take closer order half a mile from home, came under pressure from
a pair to the outside three furlongs from home and was very lightly coaxed along, cut the corner into upper stretch and yielded command and was not
persevered with through to the finish.

two path, was rated in second position while well behind the pacesetter, moved closer in the two path without being asked on the far turn, was given his cue
at the quarter-pole, rallied to a short lead in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed whip while battling with the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of
that foe in the final sixteenth and was eased up while best in the final strides. GET SMOKIN moved out while striding clear early, opened up a very large
advantage on the initial straightaway, rounded the first turn in the three path, continued with a sizable lead down the backstretch, saw that margin diminish
while in the two path on the far turn, was asked while closer to the rail approaching the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, was put to a
right-handed whip coming to the furlong marker, battled with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while just able to get the place.
DOMESTIC SPENDING (GB) moved his head at the start and was off a step slow, came under tight restraint early, saved ground on the first turn, was
reserved at the rear, came under some urging late on the backstretch, moved out on the far turn, was driven five wide into upper stretch then drifted out
under a left-handed whip, drifted in after being switched to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker, moved out after being swapped back to a left-handed
whip at the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while able to get the show. MOON OVER MIAMI settled on the inside under some
restraint, was roused on the final turn then moved closer, came under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, moved off the rail under a drive into the final
furlong and was out-kicked. EVER DANGEROUS was antsy in the gate then broke a step slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back,
was asked near the seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide under urging on the far turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
JUMP FOR JOY guided into the two path after the field had been released, disputed the pace from between rivals for the initial half, settled onto the head of
the stretch and was given his cue, arrived at the eighth pole leading by a slim margin, but facing pressure from both sides, saw the rail-hugging LADY BY
CHOICE drop out of the fight with approximately a sixteenth to go, then dug in with good determination to fend off the second place finisher.
LETMETAKETHISCALL vied from path three as the widest of three for the majority of the first half, pulling on the left, commenced the stretch run by shifting
one path farther off the rail, battled hard to the end but got staved off. ARCHUMYBABY pursed the pace from the two path, in the middle of two others
during the run around the bend, got maneuvered into path three early in the stretch, attained better racing room late and was along for the show. LADY BY
CHOICE settled along the inside route before departing the backstretch, paused in hand awaiting suitable options as the half was being rattled off, spun into
the stretch, espied a narrow but usable seam a few jumps later, responded when given her cue, utilizing it ti slip BABY BOSS with good momentum, loomed
boldly by the beginning of the final furlong, vied with vigour for another sixteenth before weakening. NO DEAL taken hold after losing its footing at the break,
cut over to the rail at the half mile pole, took it to the end of the bend, fanned out into path six from the upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all,
mustered up a mild response. QUEEN KAHEN pursued the front runners three to four wide on the turn, got sent out five wide for the drive home, came up
empty. BABY BOSS remained stationed along the inside after the start, vied as the innermost of three for control, was the first to have her pilot commit to a
drive, this occurring just shy of the quarter pole, relinquished a few jumps later then steadily backed away.

angled to the inside and ran on along the rail to procure the show honors. SUMMER TUNE tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear, tipped to

PATRIOT GAME broke in at the start brushing the near side stall and then brushing OAK HILL, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and made no headway. RED FLAG ALERT just off the inside settled in mid pack, tucked to the rail
at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. MATTY'S MARAUDER
two then three wide through the first turn, attended the leader from the outside under rating four paths off the inside and then three, tucked to the two path at

Footnotes
YAUPON emerged with the lead after breaking in line with its next two stall neighbors, showed the way, coaxed along from near the inside, with the second
place finisher in accompaniment towards the outer border of path two, got called upon for more being put to the test by that opponent heading home, won a
duel that lasted until the sixteenth pole, then got geared down for the final few strides. BINKSTER sparred with the winner two to three wide, increased his
presence as the second split was about to be posted, got cued up challenging in earnest as the twosome stepped onto the top of the lane, vied with vigour
until the general area of the sixteenth pole, wasn't able to go by, held on with willingness to salvage second. BLINDWILLIE MCTELL chased the ongoing
pace dispute from the two path, shifted inward in time to cut the corner into the lane, got outkicked. CUCINA bumped at the start, was three wide stepping
onto the turn and in path four exiting it, mustered up a mild response to earn the last major check. THE SICARII bumped from both sides after stumbling at
the start, was quickly spotted along the inside route, took it until the end of the bend, got steered out into path two for the drive, failed to fire appreciably.
KOSCIUSZKO sent over to the rail prior to departing the backstretch, remained along it to the quarter pole, got sent out five wide from upper to midlne,
lacked the needed offering. PERUVIAN BOY pulled off THE SICARLI after some contact at the start, travelled two wide on the turn, swung out five during
the initial portion of the stretch, gave way.

SHALAKO two to three wide in pursuit, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper

the first turn, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge through the length of the stretch, knocked heads with SINGAPORE TRADER through the final furlong and was just in the midst of taking narrow
command when nailed as a pair by the aforementioned foe near the finish. SINGAPORE TRADER two then three wide through the opening bend, settled
three wide in aim of the leader, tucked to the two path into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, took
over command straightened away, dug in under threat from a trio, repelled the aforementioned foe through to the final strides then got nailed at the end by
the winner. HAMMERIN AAMER three to four wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three
wide for home and weakened in the late stages. KUMAR coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside through the first turn tipping out
midway to the two path as the leader crossed in front, tracked just off the inside before backing away into the far turn and taking HOLIDAY BONUS with him
in behind, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, tipped out two to three paths inside the eighth pole and was outkicked.
HOLIDAY BONUS tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, got forced to be taken in hand off the heels of the aforementioned foe and was shuffled
back with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and scraped the paint inside that same rival, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid before weakening in the final eighth. HOFFENHEIM chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and tired. FLOWERS FOR LISA hustled from the gate, raced three wide into the first turn before establishing the front and
crossing to show the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch, remained safely in front into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
and was under challenge approaching the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and folded.

later on that bend while roused, rallied outside into the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, battled with two foes under a left-handed whip into the
final furlong and proved best under strong urging. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) went three wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, ranged up while
three wide on the far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then made a bid into the stretch, battled between horses into the final furlong, fought with
two foes into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. RED RIGHT HAND moved out into the first turn, raced in the two path on
that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the two path on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in

rated on the inside, drafted behind the leaders on the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, was asked near the quarter-pole then shifted out
behind foes while roused in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the rear,

PARIS LIGHTS away in good order, stalked the runner up two to three wide on the clubhouse bend, kept pace even with CRYSTAL BALL having picked up
the tempo several ticks once onto the backstretch, followed the leader's lead and shifted over closer to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, was latched
on applying pressure from path two all throughout the run around the far turn, came under stronger handling as did the nemesis as they settled in at the
head of the stretch, was induced wider leaving the eight pole once the second place finisher began to come outward past that station, claimed the lead with
less than a sixteenth to go, then gamely held it, despite some contact in the shadow of the wire. CRYSTAL BALL hustled from the gate, gained the
advantage, headed off the homestretch towards the three path, was gradually steered to the rail once on turn one, tucking along it once sufficiently in the
clear, carved out the pace, attended by her stablemate out in path two, failed to shake loose picking up pace during the journey on the backstretch and
instead went from the top of the second bend to its end with the winner directly abreast, got turned loose entering the stretch, desperately clung to the lead
during the ensuing furlong, began to come out leaving the furlong marker, leading the top one to move wider too, saw some leaning going on with the top
one prior to releasing the front end with somewhere around a sixteenth remaining, bumped with PARIS LIGHTS very late getting denied. ANTOINETTE
forwardly placed after the field had been sent on its way, got guided onto the inside route shortly after stepping onto the opening bend, saw TONALIST'S
SHAPE get checked and become rank herself right afterwards, continued to ride the rail until the quarter pole, got worked into the four path from upper to
midlane, was outfinished. TONALIST'S SHAPE remained stationed along the inside route after the start, checked as ANTOINETTE was being maneuvered
to the rail early on the first turn, got tipped three wide while rank, swung onto the backstretch, firmly held and going about more as a pro, took up the chase
from the two path on the second bend, angled slightly wider into the lane, went onward for another sixteenth before being allowed to back away. VELVET
CRUSH away last after having dwelt at the break, loped along in the two path, got set up along the inside at the hall mile pole, cut the corner into the lane
being urged along, had no rally.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT WHISKEY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the length of the stretch clinging to the lead to the sixteenth marker when able to put some space albeit small in
between himself and his main rival and prevailed gamely at the end. PAPA LUKE three wide in closest pursuit of the leader, got set down spinning three
wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe through the stretch in game fashion but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish.
FARRAGUT broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, kicked
on belatedly to secure the show honors latching on the top pair in the final jumps. MAKE MOTIME coaxed along just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile
from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. AMERICAN PIPER broke in brushing the near side stall
at the start, chased along the inside, cut the corner under urging into upper stretch, tipped out two paths near the eighth pole and weakened. TOP OF THE
MINT tossed his head just as the latch sprang and hit the off side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five wide
into upper stretch and tired. PERFECT BANKER chased three then two wide being taken in hand briefly off the heels of PAPA LUKE into the turn, came
under a ride from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and tired. ME 'N SAP two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired.
