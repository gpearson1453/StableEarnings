Footnotes
BAYTOWN BEAR vied for the lead two wide through the far turn, was floated out and into the seven path entering the lane, was loosing ground to the
pacesetter outside the eighth pole then benefited when leader ducked to outside rail, angled back into the three or four path and was geared down late while
well clear. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS vied for the lead along the inside on near the two path through the turns, drifted out entering the lane, was trying to
straighten when in the seven path when clearing for the top spot and being urged right-handed, ducked to the outside fence, restraightened and finished
along the fence to stay up for the place spot. PINCH MINE raced well back of the leaders into the lane then passed a tired one to gain the minor share.
STRIKEITORTAPIT vied between rivals into the backstretch, chased into the far turn and was done near the three-eighths pole.A STEWARDS INQUIRY
INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOUND THAT NO CHANGE IN ORDER WAS WARRENTED. ONE-QUARTER, ONE-HALF AND THREE -QUARTER TIMES
TIMES WERE OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
DRINKATTHECREEK tracked the dueling pacesetters into the far turn while along the inside, gained momentum after the three-eighths pole, bid three wide
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, swept past to the lead and quickly cleared then widened while under hand urging to the end. SISTER GEMA vied for the
lead into the far turn ,gained a short and short lived lead nearing the quarter pole, could not stay with the top one but kept on to second best.
RUNNINAWAYWITHIT was slow early and had to be shaken up to join the field entering the first turn, raced off the rail into the far turn, was asked for more
in mid-turn, moved four wide and appeared to be a contender entering the lane then flattened and just held the show spot. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY set
the pace while under pressure into the far turn, began to falter nearing the five-sixteenths pole then gave way. QUIET CONTENDER was in the four path
through the first turn, chased the pace from the three path into the far turn then was tiring upon reaching mid-turn. MIRACLES TAKE TIME was along the
inside and made little impact. TWO CARROT RANSOM steadily faded from the two or three path. SAY GRACE AMEN was outrun while along the inside.

Footnotes
JORDAN'S KITTEN trailed for half while off the inside, moved into the three path through the turn, angled further out in late turn, entered the lane from the
seven path with momentum, moved six wide when continuing to gain energy then edged clear late. NATIVE LION set the pace while along the inside,
remained tight on the rail entering the lane, gamely held off many but could not hold the winner safe while saving the place spot. SEEDS OF TIME was
unhurried while in the two path, came into the lane from the three or four path, looked for a path once straightened, found a slot and finished with good
energy to be closing in on the place spot. MONKEY MIND stalked and pressed the pacesetter while in the three path, remained a serious contender into the
lane and four wide then lacked the needed kick. TROPHY DOLL (IRE) raced along the inside throughout, came into the lane looking to cut the corner,
shifted into the three path and back toward the inside through the lane and lacked a closing opportunity. CENTERFOLD ANGEL was in the two path through
the turns, swung into the lane from the five path and five wide, had aim on the top one and lacked the needed response. MAD GRACE was in the three path
through the turns and never was a threat. SWEET N WICKED pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane then was tiring when put in tight
late.

Footnotes
HELLO ADELE vied for the lead from the three path, cleared into the lane while in the four path then widened through the final eighth while being kept to the
task. SEMINOLE SISTERS was unhurried while in the three path into the turn, moved through the four path when being asked near the five-sixteenths pole,
came into the lane from the five path and could only chase the winner home. JULIPS HOLD was unrushed while in the two path, cut the corner into the lane
and moved up along the rail. SERENA STAR fractious gate, raced in the back into the lane, shifted from the two to the five path through the lane and offered
a belated gain. KEE SHE was in the three path though the turn and never was a serious factor. GLOWED tracked the pace along the inside through the turn
then faded after entering the lane. MARINA NIGHT chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn, continued in the four path into the lane and
was empty late. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART set the early pace while under pressure through the turn, vied with the winner into the lane then gave way. SHE'S
A SALTY B was in the three path through the turn when trailing. PER RULING IG-2020-2106 FROM THE INDIANA RACING COMMISSION, SEMINOLE
SISTERS WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
LEADING THE CHARGE stalked the pacesetter from the two path, bid in late turn, quickly cleared into the lane then widened through the stretch while
being kept to the task. HAZEL RAH was along the inside through the turns, angled into the four path entering the lane then finished with good energy to just
get up for the place spot. INDOCUMENTADO checked early, raced four wide through the turns, was asked in far turn for more, moving well to be up for
place in deep stretch and was just nailed at the wire for the place spot. BAKER'S MAN was in the three path through the turns, shuffled through late turn
when others went wide, moved to a contending position with an eighth to go then weakened a bit late. WARRIOR'S REMARK was along the inside through
the turns and weakened in the lane. CIELO AZUL stalked the pace from the three path through the turn then tired after entering the lane. GALILEO'S ROCK
came in soon after the start, raced on the lead while along the inside into the far turn then gave way entering the lane. B R COOPER checked early when in
tight, raced well back and never was a factor while in the three path. REED O'PRADO was in the two path through the turns and was empty entering the
lane. FLINT made no impact while saving ground. DANANG checked early when cut off, raced towards the back and was empty in the lane. HIGHLINE
BRIDGE hopped at the start ,raced near the rail and was done after going a half. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #7 DANANG AGAINST THE RIDER
OF #9 GALILEO'S ROCK RESULTED IN #9GALILEOS ROCK BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM 7TH AND PLACED 11TH FOR INTERFERENCE SOON

Footnotes
RESURRECTION ROAD raced on the lead through the turn and into the backstretch, continued to be clear into the far turn, under pressure after the
three-eighths pole, repelled that challenge entering the lane, cleared then widened through the lane while near the rail. CASH OUT tracked the pace while
near the inside through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive and could not gain on the top one while settling for second best. GOODBYE EARL
chased the pace from the three path into the lane, was in the five path with aim on the place spot near the eighth pole, drifted in to the two path under
right-handed urging and was clear for the show spot. RAZEENA chased the winner into the far turn, bid after the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with
the top one then weakened along the inside. SUBIACO was along the inside throughout and tired. TUXEDO LEMON was outrun while near the rail.

Footnotes
QUIET COMPANY set the pace while near the inside, vied into the far turn, cleared in late turn, was challenged and overtaken near the eighth pole,
continued on gamely and came back near the wire to just get up. MISS MOSAIC stalked the pacesetter into the turn, bid from the three path into the lane,
stuck her head in front near the eighth pole, continued with a short lead then could not hold the previous leader safe at the wire. TRIVIAL raced in the two
path into the far turn,angled into the three path approaching the lane, came into the lane from the four path and slowly gained to the wire. MISS MERCKEN
was along the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and showed energy through the lane. COLOR ME PRETTY was along the
inside through the turns and lacked a closing response. GINSENG tracked the pace along the inside through the turn, was a serious contender into the lane
then weakened. PRIVATE BEACH was in the three or four path through the turns and never was a factor. CARINA raced in the two or three path into the far
turn and faltered near the three-eighths pole. KISS MORE stalked the pacesetter from the three path into the backstretch moved to a short lead after a half,
continued to chase the pace through the turn then faded. BE WITH US was outrun throughout while in the two or three path.

Footnotes
UNION SONG was patiently ridden through the turn while in the three path, bid from the three path into the lane, was edging up inside the eighth pole when
angling to the inside, continued with good energy late and just got up. LAVALIER was confidently ridden down the backstretch, moved to the lead while
three wide in mid-turn under minimal encouragement, cleared into the lane, drifted out a bit under right-handed urging, continued under steady urging in
deep stretch and was just caugth. IVORYSGOLDTREASURE was void of speed, raced off the rail into the turn, asked in mid-turn, gained ground quickly
into the lane then continued with energy to the wire to be best of the rest. SHESONSPEEDDIAL raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane and
moved up while not a threat. ABBY'S DESTINY pressed the pace from along the inside, led on the backstretch, continued to chase the pace into the turn
then tired. STACK SHACK set the pace and pressed into the turn, continued to chase into the stretch and faded. THIRST TRAP was outrun while in the two
or three path. MILLE FLEURS was along the inside through the far turn and was empty into the lane. LINCOLN CENTER never a factor along the inside. R
U MIZZEN ME outrun while entering the far turn from the three path.
