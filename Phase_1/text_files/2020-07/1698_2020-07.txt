Footnotes
MOLESLEY broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn, assumed
command entering the final turn, and held PADDY D'ORO safely at bay late under confident handling. PADDY D'ORO away alertly and tracked the leaders
in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive
to prove clearly second best. SMART DEAL settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his
bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. PASSING NOTES unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest one out from the rail in the drive. TOBELUCKY AGAIN away
well and settled off the early leaders while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the
rail in the stretch drive. MCMURPHY rushed up to press the pace two wide midway through the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of MOLESLEY in
the run to the final turn, struggled to keep pace with that rival entering the turn, and faded in the late going. BOOKIE stalked the early pace into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SEA
CADET stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep up entering the final turn, and weakened over the final
furlong.

narrow advantage into the lane, and inched clear late. G M T BABY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late in a game effort. DORYS

final turn, and then finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up for a share. KENSINGTON MARKET settled off the early pace while racing two out from
the rail, rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished evenly late five wide in the drive. NOTICE away well and pressed the pace three wide entering
he first turn, continued to force the issue three wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but was outfinished late. HEREVERYWISH

Footnotes
SUZY MASCARA stalked the early pacesetters while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, tipped
two wide leaving the turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prevail. HEART OF TEXAS angled in approaching the first turn to gain a tracking
trip from along the inside, rallied smartly from along the rail to challenge for the lead entering the final turn, and battled gamely through the lane from along
the inside to prove clearly second best. KICK UP THE DUST away well, and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, checked and briefly altered course leaving the turn, and finished four wide in the drive. THE KAT'S BACK stalked the
early pace three wide entering the backstretch, continued with a wide trip in the run to the final turn, rallied six wide through the turn, and finished willingly
five wide in the drive. NO TAN LINES broke sharply and pressed the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide through
the final turn, steadied briefly midway through the turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious impact. FANCY
FRAULEIN away alertly and raced to the lead while one out from the rail entering the backstretch, drifted four wide midway through the final turn, and had
little to offer late while finished four wide in the drive. REIGNS DREAMZ unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back
and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
MO NATION broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch, turned back a challenge from LAUGH WITH ME entering the lane, and drew clear late. MACHINE was pinched soon after the start, and was
taken up sharply, raced into a stalking trip from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed
from along the inside in the drive to gain the place. LAUGH WITH ME settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, advanced
three out from the rail midway down the backside and raced into contention approaching the final turn, rallied smartly three wide through the turn, and
finished four wide in the drive to just miss the place. JACK DON'T DRINK settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the stretch drive. SIDESHOW was pinched back soon after the start, and
trailed the field in the run to the first turn, while narrowly avoiding a fallen rider, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five
wide in the drive. FINALLY FANTASTIC raced eratic in the early going, while shying from horses to his outside, ducked out nearing the wire the first time,
bumping solidly with COWBOY CREEK, causing that rival to lose his rider, continued to race greenly with a wide trip throughout, and finished four wide in
the drive. STORM BEACH away alertly and tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn,
but was outfinished in the late stages. GOTTCHA PROMISE away well and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the
issue from the outside of MO NATION in the run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the turn, and weakened over the final
furlong. DON'TCRYFORSINDI settled off the early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to
make an impact. COWBOY CREEK was bumped hard passing the wire the first time, and unseated his rider. Following the running of the race, COWBOY
CREEK walked off under his own power. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the mishap in the run to the first turn.
After review, the stewards disqualified FINALLY FANTASIC from sixth, and declared this horse "unplaced" for causing interference to COWBOY CREEK
passing the wire the first time, causing that horse to unseat his rider
