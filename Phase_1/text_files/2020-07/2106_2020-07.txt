CONTENDRESS cleared off to set the pace, showed the way, dueled with UPGRADE ME on the far turn, turned back the bid from that rival and drew clear
under urging in the final sixteenth. UPGRADE ME was reluctant loading, stalked two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch, could not
stay with the winner and dug in to save the place spot. QUEEN OF CARNIVAL raced off the pace inside, then two wide, moved up some on the far turn and
rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. SUE'S EASTER GIRL raced off the pace, had a four wide trip, came three wide into the lane and did not factor. I'M A
STEPHANIE raced three wide early, stalked three wide, then chased the leaders and faded. MISS SPICY raced off the pace, two wide, failed to respond
and gave way. SECOND HAND HEART tracked along the inside, failed to respond when asked and gave way.

TEXAS RAIN rushed up in the early stages to contest the pace, dueled inside for command, shook free passing the quarter pole, drew clear and held well
under urging. BIG TINY bobbled slightly at the break, raced three wide off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole, closed steadily outside and was
along late for the place spot. BREW CASA chased outside, raced three wide on the turn, rallied in the stretch drive and was outkicked. SYMPHONY HALL
contested the pace early on, then raced closed up inside, saved ground on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. HEADLINING raced three wide off the
pace, four wide past the quarter pole and gained belatedly outside. TOP HAT CHARMER dueled three wide for the early lead, battled two wide on the turn
and weakened. AFFAIRS UNLIMITED raced off the pace, had an inside trip and failed to threaten. APRIL SUGAR raced off the pace, went four wide past
the quarter pole and did not factor. DESERT DREAMS dueled between rivals for the early lead and gave way on the turn. WICKED EKATI raced off the
pace between rivals, then inside and gave way. OKIE TOAST chased between foes and gave way.

LIGHTHAWK vied outside for command, dueled into the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, responded when asked and pulled away under urging.
DAUNTLESS PRINCE vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the backside and far turn, could not stay with that rival and remained well clear for
the place award. BROADWAY D'ORO tracked the leaders while saving ground, moved up at the quarter pole, angled out, lacked a rally and finished evenly.
DONT TELL NOOBODY was off a step slow, raced off the pace with an inside trip and had no rally. QUEEN'SREDBOY raced off the pace, came three wide
into the lane and failed to threaten. CAPTIVE KITTEN stalked two wide and gave way. FRONT PAGE raced three wide early, chased three wide, came four
wide into the lane and faded.
