HOT ON THE TRAIL chased off the rail then outside a rival, angled out leaving the bend, rallied and took over nearing the sixteenth marker and drove clear.
JEWEL THIEF set the pace up the backstretch, inched away from WISHFUL into the drive, overtaken by HOT ON THE RAIL nearing the sixteenth pole but
was clearly second best. WISHFUL chased from the outside, made mild bid alongside the leader around the turn, lost contact entering the stretch and went
evenly in the late stages. QUEEN OF THE TRACK bumped with outside rival at the start, traveled along the inside to the stretch and weakened.
DEHYDRATION stumbled and bumped leaving the gate, went two wide into the stretch and never threatened.

raced a bit off the rail, moved out three wide in upper stretch, angled out near the sixteenth pole and finished a gamely third. SPUD off a bit slow, raced
outside a rival, went three deep on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and showed a late effort. LIL RICHARDS BELLO off a bit slow to begin, saved
ground into the lane, went between runners in the drive and produced a mild late bid. COUNT ALEXEI vied three deep then chased between, traveled three
wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. KING ARTHUR chased off the rail, went four wide into the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, tight near the sixteenth
pole and flattened. BONA FORTUNA bumped early, saved ground and lacked a response to urging. CAL'S GEM shifted in and bumped rival soon after the

STREET IMAGE showed good early speed, led clear two wide into the stretch and held well under mild urging. POISE TO STRIKE broke out, pressed the
leader then chased off the rail to the stretch, continued to give chase through the drive then dug in late but was denied by the winner. BEDROCK broke out,
unhurried from off the inside, raced four wide into the turn, angled into the two path around the bend and whittle the gap on the top pair. STRIKE IT LUCKY
off slow and broke out, tracked from the inside and weakened in the lane. FINALLY GOT A RED veered out leaving the gate, asked but lacked early foot,
raced two wide leaving the bend and proved no menace. STREET BEHAVIOR lost footing at the start and was off a bit slow, chased off the rail, drifted out
into the stretch and tired.

raced off the rail up the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn, swung five wide leaving the bend, closed fast but was too late. DON'T BLAME JUDY
settled inside, inched closer into the far turn, kept along the rail to the stretch and got edged for second. SEDAMAR stalked the pace, moved forward past
the half-mile marker, chased outside a rival around the far turn and into the stretch, finished willingly but never threatened. MEAL TICKET three wide into
the first turn, four deep on the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and flattened. DESERT OASIS (GB) stalked outside a rival, three wide around
the second turn, then weakened in the lane. ZIARAH (IRE) traveled two wide, went between runners near the half-mile marker, angled to the rail and

Footnotes
CARPE VINUM broke out and bumped rival, in range along the rail, angled out upper stretch, bid outside the top pair, gained command and held the
runner-up at bay. CALIFORNIA KOOK bumped leaving the gate, raced two wide then between rivals, angled out upper stretch, closed well but could not get
by the winner. RED LARK (IRE) bumped both sides leaving the gate, tracked between foes to the lane, angled out upper stretch and finished well.
MOONHALL MILLY (IRE) stalked inside, awaited room behind rivals in upper stretch, angled out and finished willingly. MYLITTLERUNAWAY set the pace,
dueled into and around the far turn and into the stretch, fought back in the lane but was outfinished in the late stages. GOING TO VEGAS broke in and
bumped rival at the start, prompted the pace outside, moved up to duel into and around the far turn, resisted in the lane but was also outfinished.
BEGUILED away quickly from the outside then chased three wide to the first turn, went three deep on the backstretch, took an awkward step past the
half-mile marker, continued three deep into the far turn, swung four wide leaving the bend and weakened. FASHION ROYALTY (GB) lagged behind,
traveled along the rail, angled out exiting the far turn and passed tired foes. LUCIA'S DESIGN raced three deep and weakened. COLOMBIAN GOLD
bumped at the start, raced between rivals early then angled in, saved ground into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
P R RADIO STAR settled between rivals then a bit off the rail, angled four wide leaving the turn, rallied and drew clear late. I AM THE DANGER tossed
head and bumped both sides at the start, dueled for the lead from the outside, moved clear into the stretch, inched away in the lane then caught in deep
stretch. BLAMEITONTHELAW turned head and off slow at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced five then six wide into the stretch, rallied late
and gained the show honors. FIGHT ON bumped at the start, chased three wide around the turn and lost the show. TIGER DAD bumped leaving the gate,
dueled inside into and around the turn, chased the leader into the stretch and weakened. KNEEDEEPINSNOW along the inside then angled out off the rail,
came five wide into the stretch and lacked further response. PRINCIPE CARLO chased inside, two wide into the stretch and faded. THE STEWARDS
REVIEWED THE START OF BLAMEITONTHE LAW AND RULED THAT HE TURNED HIS HEAD, CAUSING HIS OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND
IS DECLARED A STARTER.
