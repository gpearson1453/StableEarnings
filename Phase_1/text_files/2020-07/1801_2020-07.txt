Footnotes
VIOLENT FIGHT tucked in nicely off the leaders for six furlongs, moved out for clearance three wide at the top of the lane, dueled outside MOUNTAIN
BREEZE through the last eighth of a mile and proved best. MOUNTAIN BREEZE prompted the pace outside IAMBUTTER, challenged for command
midway on the far turn, and battled stubbornly inside VIOLENT FIGHT from the eighth-pole home. UNPOPULAR OPINION was bothered by INACEPTABLE
shortly after the start, lagged far back into the far turn three wide, and rallied mildly. IMA COALMAN saved ground in midpack for six furlongs, moved out
approaching the stretch and was along outside for the last major share. EXPRESS BOY bumped with D. SILO at the start, raced in the second flight toward
the inside to the lane, and gained only mildly in the two-path. IAMBUTTER set the pace inside for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. FIRST IN LINE
settled in the middle of the group to the far turn, swung five wide to the stretch and lacked the needed response. D. SILO bumped with EXPRESS BOY at
the start, raced three wide early, and was not a factor. KITTEN'S CLOWN was four wide on the first turn, and made no impact. KING ANDRES steadied
slightly first time through the stretch, took the first turn four wide at the back, and showed little. INACEPTABLE leaned in bothering UNPOPULAR OPINION
shortly after the start, tracked three wide for six furlongs, and retired.

Footnotes
SUNDOWN KID lacked room briefly heading to the turn, came clear and was put to a ride four wide past the three-eighths, rallied determinedly and wore
down OROSCOPO from outside. OROSCOPO rallied four then three wide around the turn, took over outside EAST CODE and BRIDOLOGIST in upper
stretch and pulled clear, but was worn down through the last 70 yards. EAST CODE saved ground behind the leaders to the turn, moved out with a bid
between horses after a half-mile, and weakened through the furlong grounds. BRIDOLOGIST chased GRAND UNION early, took over from outside entering
the turn, cleared off and moved inside, and gave way in upper stretch. ROJO GRANDE broke out, chased three wide into the turn, steadied slightly dropping
back between horses near the quarter-pole, and veered out late shying from left-hand pressure. TEN MILES HIGH was outsprinted four to five wide early,
and dropped far back after a half-mile. GALAN broke slowly, and was outrun throughout. GRAND UNION sped clear early, lost the lead to BRIDOLOGIST
after a quarter-mile, and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
TROPICAT lacked room behind KYLE after the start, advanced into the turn, was pocketed behind the leaders a quarter-mile out, came clear in the
three-path through upper stretch, collared KYLE from outside in deep stretch and moved away under confident handling. KYLE came in after the start,
pressed APACHE BRAVE from outside, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear, but could not match strides with the top one late. HONOLULU
EXPRESS was jostled around between VALIANT VIRTUE and TROPICAT soon after the start, trailed inside to midway on the turn, swung out for the drive
and gained too late. APACHE BRAVE bumped with VALIANT VIRTUE at the start, set the pace inside to the stretch, and gave way. PEMAQUID PETE
saved ground throughout, and failed to menace. VALIANT VIRTUE bumped with APACHE BRAVE at the start, stayed in range to the stretch three wide,
and tired. NETTLETON broke out and was slowest away, raced four wide and could not keep pace coming off the turn.

Footnotes
FORTUNE COOKIE was urged to go after BRASSTOWN three then two wide late on the turn, kept to task through a long drive, and was along in time
outside. BRASSTOWN set a sharp pace inside, remained clear into the final furlong, but could not hang on while much best of the others.
KRACHENWAGEN chased outside the pacesetter for six furlongs, moved out to the three-path for the drive and could not gain. TRAPPEZOID was no
threat four wide. LONG GRAY LINE raced two wide and was finished after six furlongs. GRAY BEAU trailed every step and showed nothing.

Footnotes
FOR KICKS saved ground unhurried to the far turn, shifted three wide near the quarter-pole beginning to get in gear, got steered out to the middle of the
course in upper stretch, and rallied steadily to overhaul TENNESSEE COTTON from outside in the closing yards. TENNESSEE COTTON spent most of the
race in the four-path, rallied to the lead in mid stretch, and could not hold off the top one. OHMYMY established an even pace inside, and managed to save
the show over several on-rushing rivals. OURHANDSOMEGAL trailed to the stretch toward the inside, moved out for the drive and gained too late between
horses. LITTLE BELLA stayed in easy striking range three wide for six furlongs, and weakened in the lane. STRICT VOW broke slowly, swung out leaving
the far turn and improved on the far outside. ELITE APPEAL raced between horses in the two-path from the outset, and stalled in traffic through upper
stretch behind rivals. WILD ABOUT THIS raced inside all the way, and did not factor. PEMAQUID DOT pressed the pace outside OHMYMY, reached a
short lead after six furlongs, and was swarmed from both sides through the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
RED FOG was never far back, slipped through on the rail to join the leaders midway on the turn, dueled inside SLIPPY from the five-sixteenths to deep
stretch and edged away. SLIPPY ranged up three wide to wrest the lead away from THATS ALL HE WROTE after five furlongs, battled outside RED FOG
the rest of the way and came up second best. EXATLON was in or around the two-path to the stretch, and could not threaten the top two with an even finish.
SUPERHIGHWAY was sluggish from the gate despite feeling several cracks of the stick, moved menacingly four wide around the turn, then flattened out
while lugging in at the top of the stretch. GATOR FIFTY TWO lunged and broke out at the start, and was no factor three wide. LEBASI was finished early
inside. THATS ALL HE WROTE set an ambitious pace off the rail, was overrun from both flanks past the three-eighths and folded up. RATTLESNAKE
FACE dropped far back after six furlongs, and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
BREEZE ON BY broke to the lead, showed the way slightly removed from the rail, shook clear after a half-mile, widened steadily on his left lead and won
with something left. IMPERIAL KING pressed the pace inside, was in tight along the fence past the three-eighths, could not go with the winner turning for
home, and saved the place. ANOTHER DUKE advanced four wide around the turn, and finished evenly. WICKED BRODY became edgy in the gate prior to
the start, hit the left side of the gate and brushed with TOSCANITO coming out, and improved through the last quarter-mile without getting close to the top
three. LAUDA SPEED broke out, pressed BREEZE ON BY from outside early, and gave way on the turn. SO VIOLENT broke slowly, and was always far
back. GRUNTLED stayed close early while hustled along between horses, got outpaced through the turn and dropped far back. TOSCANITO bounced off
the left side of the gate and brushed with WICKED BRODY at the start, saved ground and dropped far back approaching the stretch. EXONERATED PREZ
dropped far back early.

Footnotes
TOURNESOL was unhurried for six furlongs, came four wide off the far turn still with a lot to do, and unleashed an impressive burst of late speed in
mid-course to run down a rival who appeared home free a sixteenth out. YESTERDAYONCEMORE (IRE) went along reserved between horses up the
backstretch, threaded through rivals past the quarter-pole, came clear in the three-path at the top of the lane, easily overpowered BLUE MISTRESS from
outside and kicked well clear, but was helpless to fend off the top one in the closing stages. BLUE MISTRESS prompted the pace outside MIJET, wrested
the lead away after six furlongs, had no answer for YESTERDAYONCEMORE in upper stretch and weakened inside. DAYS OF SPRING advanced from the
three-path to loom a threat after six furlongs, but flattened out after straightening away for the drive. ONYX moved up widest after a half-mile, remained out
in the course four wide through the far turn, and dropped back past the quarter-pole. FRERET saved ground in range early, and faded before reaching the
stretch. MIJET set the pace inside for six furlongs, and faltered through the lane.

Footnotes
FRONT LOADED broke with the front flight but backed off early, moved out three wide closing in on the leaders around the turn, headed SOUTH SEA from
outside past the quarter-pole, and drove well clear. SOUTH SEA contested the early pace outside rivals, reached a short lead between horses
five-sixteenths out, could not go with FRONT LOADED turning for home, and ran on with good courage to save the place inside RESERVENOTATTAINED.
The latter had the two-path through the turn, lugged in slightly brushing SOLDOLLIE into the lane, moved out and was edged for second. MY FRIEND
FLAVIN saved ground outrun into the turn, swung five wide at the top of the stretch, and improved for a minor share without threatening. FUEL THE BERN
stayed in range three then four wide on the turn, but faded after a half-mile. SOLDOLLIE battled up front early, moved inside past the three-eighths, came
under fire from SOUTH SEA and FRONT LOADED soon after, yielded after a half, and was bothered a bit by RESERVENOTATTAINED in upper stretch.
COUNTRY SINGER broke through the gate prior to the start, contested the early pace inside, could not keep up around the turn and dropped far back.

Footnotes
HEIRESSINDY came away cleanly (!) and was forwardly placed early, slipped through on the rail to join the leaders near the three-eighths, edged away
approaching the stretch and widened all out. BIMINI stumbled at the break and was bumped soundly between horses, advanced around the turn four then
three wide, could not reach the winner and ran on clear of the others. ASSUME CONTROL got slammed by RUN DEVIL and was forced into BIMINI at the
start, shifted off the inside to the three-path late on the turn, and finished evenly. RUN DEVIL ducked in bashing into ASSUME CONTROL at the start, then
was hard to handle being yanked off, pressed the pace outside FORTUNATE CAT in the three-path, and dropped back after five furlongs. TIME TO TWO
STEP hit the left side of the gate and dwelt at the start, made up some ground after a half-mile while out in the track, and had nothing more. FORTUNATE
CAT got sideswiped as BIMINI knocked into her at the start, went up to set a pressured pace off the rail, and succumbed to challenges from both sides on
the turn.

Footnotes
ZODIAC PRINCESS grabbed the early lead, rated along through an even pace inside, and responded under a drive to stay clear. NOBLE MARIA prompted
the pace outside the winner from the outset, could not seriously menace through the lane, and was second best. LIL BIT DANGEROUS bobbled a stride
from the gate, stayed in range toward the inside to the stretch, and lacked a bid. TRIESTE (BRZ) became edgy in the gate prior to the start, bumped with
FAST FRACTION in the run to the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack three then four wide, and posed no threat. CARIBBEAN KITTEN lacked room
tough to handle on the first turn, checked off heels and had to be taken out three wide, and ran on evenly without a rally. FAST FRACTION bumped with
TRIESTE nearing the first turn, moved out three then four wide on the far turn, and could not gain. TELL ME MAUX was three wide on the first turn, gained
mildly after six furlongs, and flattened out. BLUES SONGS raced toward the inside in the second flight, and never factored. ETANA came out a couple
lengths behind the others, and was always far back. VIVA PER LEI was outrun three wide. GAROTA got shuffled back slightly inside LIL BIT DANGEROUS
approaching the far turn, and dropped far back after six furlongs.
