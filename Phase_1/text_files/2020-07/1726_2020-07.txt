Footnotes
MAJESTIC PIC stalked the pace four wide, seized command turning for home and drove clear. UNTOUCHABLE U was pinched back at the start, raced well
back down the backstretch, made progress four wide around the turn and finished well outside to gain the place late. FRAN'S SALSA tracked the pace
between foes, angled out in upper stretch and was one-paced in the lane. CASE DISMISSED was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, swung
to the extreme outside in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. NORTHERN HEART lacked early speed inside, tipped out nearing the lane, made good
progress between foes to midstretch then flattened out. GREASEDLIGHTNING pressed pace three wide, led between foes around the turn, battled on
inside of the winner past the eighth pole then weakened late. CRYSTAL PIER saved ground and failed to menace. BALLERINA KITTEN broke outwardly
and bumped hard at the start, raced four wide and played no further factor. ROYALTY FOR LIFE was outrun while racing three wide. CIAO LUNA set the
pace in the two path and retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE QUEEN settled off the pace along the inside, made progress between rivals around the far turn, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole,
closed outside and was up late. KAILEE (IRE) lagged well back inside, advanced along the rail around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied
between foes. EBULLIENT was unhurried early while racing two wide, swung out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. SOMETHING MAGICAL stalked
the pace two and three wide, bid in upper stretch then flattened out late. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE saved ground off the pace bid in upper stretch but was
outkicked. FIRTH was hustled to the front, set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. TANDA'S JOY failed to menace while racing two
wide. CHICLET'S DREAM played no factor while racing four wide. NIGHTLIFE pressed the pace two wide and faded in the lane. MADAME X. was outrun
while racing four wide. ALIN AZUL never factored while racing five wide. LIVELY KITTEN was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
ARCH CAT broke sharply but settled off the pace outside down the backstretch, made a strong four wide run around the turn, came six wide into the lane,
seized command in upper stretch and edged ahead under a drive. SMOOTH B settled off the pace two wide, bid between foes leaving the quarter pole, vied
inside of the winner through midstretch and settled for second best. EXCLAMATION POINT lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, rallied for
the show, pulled up short and was vanned off. MY BOY LENNY vied inside of foes down the backstretch, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole,
chased around the turn and lacked a closing bid. BETHLEHEM ROAD had early speed between rivals, settled back into a stalking position nearing the turn,
chased around the bend and came up empty in the lane. WON AND DONE failed to menace while racing four wide. GLENNWOOD played no factor while
racing two wide. JAGUAR POZ had some speed then steadily faded inside. FAIRWEATHER FRIEND disputed the pace two wide down the backstretch,
drew clear in the three path early on the turn then stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
MY FRIEND LINUS was bumped at the start, raced well off the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed steadily and was up in the
final strides. YEI YEI set the pace in the two path, turned back bids around the turn, held clear to deep stretch an succumbed late. RELISHMENT tracked
the pace two wide through the opening half, bid three wide between foes around the far turn to reach near even terms near the quarter pole but was
outkicked. DREAMIN N SCHEMIN lacked early speed while racing two wide, moved up three wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane.
GLENGAR was very reluctant to load, raced off the pace four wide around the first turn, made some progress while trying to lug in down the backstretch,
saved ground around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. BANNON broke awkwardly, saved ground and never threatened. ENKIDU stalked the pace
three wide, bid four wide midway around the turn and tired in the lane. AWESOME AT RIEDES was bumped at the start and made little impact while racing
three wide. KNOKKE BY THE SEA played no factor while racing three and four wide. LE GROS BILL was outrun inside. AUTOGRAPH prompted the pace
three wide and retreated. UPPER CROWN had brief speed inside.
