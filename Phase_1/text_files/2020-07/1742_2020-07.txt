Footnotes
TEMPLEMENT was bumped at the start, a bit behind the field, rushed up inside to lead off the rail up the backstretch, angled out entering the stretch and
drifted out while staying clear. SHE WANTS MORE swerved in and bumped a horse at the start, bumped another foe to the outside, was never far back,
and came up the rail down the stretch to gain second. STORMY MEMO was bumped at the start, stayed in range to the stretch, then closed late to just miss
place. SAMIS CAR dueled three wide on the turn, drifted out a bit down the stretch, and evened out at the eighth pole. SAMOA bumped a horse at the start,
raced between duelers on the turn, was asked for more on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and faltered mid stretch. CURIOUS ZELDA contended for a
quarter, was last and five wide into the stretch and backed up.

Footnotes
FISH TRAPPE ROAD broke outward, bumping a horse, chased the leader to the far turn, pressed that one through the turn, then steadily wore down the
leader to take the win by a nose. CONGRUITY was reluctant to load, took the lead inside on the first turn, was pressured on the turn, responded but was
worn down late to get nailed at the wire. VENKMAN tracked the pace outside mid pack, rallied four wide into the stretch and had some pace late. CROWN
TO THE GOLD was bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, moved off the rail in the stretch, rallied but faltered late. GET EM UP SCOUT
bounced between horses at the start, tracked the leaders on the rail, angled off the rail in the stretch and flattened out. OUR THOMAS steadied on the first
turn, contended to the stretch and gave way. REVOLT raced widest on the backstretch and very wide on the turn, posing no threat.

lagged to quarter pole, avoided fallen rider past the quarter pole and rallied to finish well outside in the final furlong. NEWS BOX broke sharp to the lead,
shifted off rail around winner,missed in deep stretch and missed place. SQUADRON COMMANDER rated off leaders three wide to past quarter pole but
faltered in the drive. BABADOOOK good position behind leaders with no response late. HOORAY FOR HARVEY was off slow, settled inside with no
response when needed from the quarter pole. YANKTON never factored. GORGEOUS GEORGE off slow and never reached contention thereafter.
CHAMPSACHAMP well placed outside to quarter pole, went wrong,unseating rider and subsequently vanned off. AFTER A RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL FOR

BONITA SPRINGS sharp speed, battled all the way, drifted out a bit in the final furlong and cleared in the final sixteenth. SHEESA PONTIAC pressed
winner to the stretch, could not get past with a good effort for the place spot. RETRO STREET terrible start, no speed to far turn, fanned wide, finished well.
NO INTEREST tried to keep up with the top two to the stretch, faltered late. GRATS ROAD no speed to far turn, finished up well from inside late.
TENACIOUS SALLY trailed to quarter pole, fanned widest for the drive, mild gain. SILENT SOFIA good position from inside to quarter pole, backed up from
there. BOURBON GIRL well placed in good position to far turn, came up empty. HAUTE PROSPECT never in contention. The rider of SHEESA PONTIAC
claimed foul against the winner for interference in the stretch run, after review of the replay the stewards took no action and the race was deemed official.

with the winner and just lost the head on wire with a game effort. ABIGAIL LEE rushed up outside to quarter pole, made a four wide run with no gain on the
top pair in the final furlong. MY PINK BABY BIRD between horses to the turn and never a menace to top pair. READY SET GO settled back to the turn
outside with nothing left in the stretch. ALEXIS ROAD WEST close up to the quarter pole, ran out of gas and faded in the stretch. OHIO STORM never a
menace while far back. MISS ELIANA had an awkward start and never challenged. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE had an awkward start, never menaced.
SHES MIGHTY FINE speed to the turn but gave way readily and backed up from inside.

NEW YEAR'S LUCK moved up to duel between horses nearing the far turn, led entering the stretch while drifting out off the rail, then cleared for the win.
WHO'SYOURFAVORITE waited, was asked on the far turn, responded gradually and grinded out a late rally while being bumped at the sixteenth pole.
AGGRO CRAG (IRE) chased and then vied for the lead from the outside, then gave way at the sixteenth pole to give up place late. IT'S GAME TIME broke
outward and bumped a horse hard, tracked off the pace, bumped a foe at the sixteenth pole and held position. FALLS ROAD took the lead on the first turn
while inside, was joined by two foes to vie for the lead, and gave way in the stretch. BOURBON SHOTTE was bumped hard at the start, stayed back, was
wide on the backstretch, moved up a bit on the far turn and came seven wide entering the stretch.

Footnotes
GIANNA'S GIFT settled back to far turn, pushed on to the quarter pole, exploded with a rush, responded to go well clear with the perfect trip and well
handled. HEAVEN ESCAPE chased the leader to quarter pole, garnered a short lead at the furlong pole but was outfinished and no match for the winner.
YANKEE ROSE rushed away to a long lead on the backstretch but faltered in the drive and saved the show spot. MY GIRL ROCKET raced wide into the
first turn, behind leaders to the stretch with no gain from from inside through the final furlong. KOJO'S QUEEN far back to the stretch and only improved
position while wide. I LIKEM raced evenly with no response when needed. EVENSCORE failed to menace. WAR BALLAD chased from inside to the half
and backed up readily. HYDRA'S HOPE failed to menace. TRAFFICISKILLINGME well placed to the half, gave way readily and dropped back.
