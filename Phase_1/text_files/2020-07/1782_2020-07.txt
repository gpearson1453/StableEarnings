Footnotes
VICTORY CRUSADE was outrun early, cut the corner beginning to hit her best stride turning for home, came off the rail entering the final furlong and ran
down NENITA from outside in time. NENITA vied early between horses, exchanged bumps with CABRINA near the five-sixteenths, edged away from the
latter in mid stretch and pulled clear, but could not hold on. CABRINA dueled inside NENITA, exchanged bumps with that one late on the turn, and
weakened in upper stretch. NATIONALIST saved ground outrun early, moved out in the stretch and rallied mildly. I LOVE MAGEL steadied between horses
near the five-sixteenths, and lacked a bid. TRINNI SUNSHINE moved off the inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, and came up empty.
BETTERTHENYOURX faded five wide coming off the turn. FLYING SOFIA tracked outside the battling leaders to the end of the turn, and had nothing left.
CHILLIN LADY was outrun four wide. MUSICAL LADY was slow into stride, and showed little. MAGIC MOONSTAR unseated the rider fractious behind the
gate, and was outrun. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CABRINA AGAINST NENITA ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

Footnotes
WHOLEBODEMEISTER sprinted to the front at the start, moved off the rail dueling inside FREAK late on the turn and into upper stretch, drifted out through
the last eighth of a mile whenever the rider resorted to left-hand urging, and held on. CON LIMA made little headway on the turn despite being coaxed
along, lugged in approaching the eighth-pole, regrouped and rallied on the far outside to get up for second. FREAK challenged outside
WHOLEBODEMEISTER late on the turn and into the stretch, got floated out by that rival through the furlong grounds, steadied late while yielding and was
overhauled for the place. HAPPY CONSTITUTION advanced on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and rallied mildly. GO JO JO GO bumped with
RACE DAY SPEED at the start and was off slowly, raced well out in the track to the stretch and improved without threatening. MAYSTART unseated the
rider fractious during the loading process, broke slowly and lagged far back, and passed faders outside. RACE DAY SPEED bumped with GO JO JO GO at
the start, and was no threat inside. FLATTERFUL steadied shortly after the start, and was never prominent. FOUZIA chased outside the winner early, and
gave way on the turn. I AM THE BOSS raced four wide and tired after a half-mile. DIAMOND SLEW was slow to get going and never got close. ALEX'S
FIRST was through early four wide. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
MILLIONAIRE RUNNER broke out giving DONE ACTING a solid bump, settled within range to the far turn, split BASELINE and SENSATIONAL RIDE
rallying past the quarter-pole, and lumbered past OX TROT from outside in deep stretch on his left lead. OX TROT prompted the pace outside
SENSATIONAL RIDE, took over midway on the turn and cleared inside, proved no match for the winner late but was best of the others. DONE ACTING was
bumped hard by MILLIONAIRE RUNNER at the start, lagged far back to the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly. BASELINE got pushed out

TOKYO advanced a bit leaving the chute, went up to challenge for command three wide midway on the turn, took over after six furlongs from outside, and
drove clear while drifting out. CAFFEINE RUSH chased outside PRINCESS MERIDA up the backstretch, challenged for command between horses near the
three-eighths, hung tough inside the winner through upper stretch but was ultimately second best. LA GATA NEGRA moved up four wide to loom a threat
after six furlongs, but flattened out in upper stretch. PRINCESS MERIDA set the early pace inside, got collared by the top two finishers midway on the turn,
and gave way readily. SISTERMISCHIEF dropped far back after six furlongs.

BIBIANA pressed the pace outside SOLID AS A ROCK, took over after a half-mile while going comfortably, was roused into the stretch and edged away.
LADY ARCHA was outrun to the stretch three wide, and overhauled SOLID AS A ROCK in the closing yards for second. SOLID AS A ROCK set the pace
inside, was no match for the winner turning for home, and weakened late to surrender second. CHEZ PAREE hit the right side of the gate at the start, saved
ground outrun for a half, and gained mildly late for a share. LET'S BE HONEST stumbled at the start, came four wide off the turn and lacked a solid
response. DANCING DESTROYER faded inside after a half.

PRINCESS BETTY pressed the early pace, battled up front outside GITANA and INDEPENDENT MISS around the turn and into the stretch, drifted out
through a long drive and prevailed. INDEPENDENT MISS stayed close early, bid for command between horses around the turn, drifted out through the
stretch and yielded. CONGRATSROSY ran up behind the leaders and checked past the three-quarter pole, advanced outside late on the turn, lugged in
through upper stretch, and finished evenly. GITANA set the early pace inside, dueled inside rivals around the turn and into upper stretch, and faded through
the last furlong. CAPTURED LIGHT was no factor two wide. BUXOM BEAST faded after a half-mile inside. KATIE FALOONA trailed three wide.

SUBLIMINALCRIMINAL tracked the early leaders, took over three wide outside CHAMPERS after six furlongs and widened under a drive. CHAMPERS
prompted the pace outside ISLE OF MAN, reached the front early on the turn, could not withstand the winner approaching the stretch, and ran on best of the
rest. ROBIN TEAM SHOW lost position through the run up the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, and was along to be a distant third. NASSAU
STREET advanced inside after a half-mile, could not reach contention around the turn, and plugged along on his left lead for the last major share. ISLE OF
MAN sped clear early, and gave way along the rail around the turn. FARM STRONG was four wide into the stretch, and was well back when bumped by O
DANNY BOY late. O DANNY BOY saved ground outrun for six furlongs, drifted out steadily under left-hand pressure in the stretch, and bumped FARM
STRONG late. MY BOY BLUE steadied in a crowd early on, and faded between horses before completing six furlongs. CONCRETE CHARLIE brushed the
left side of the gate at the start, and dropped far back approaching the stretch.

YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN bumped with RACK GIN at the start, was reserved early between horses, moved quickly to take over four wide outside the
leaders after six furlongs, and drove well clear. RACK GIN bumped with the eventual winner at the start, tracked three wide early, lodged a mild bid midway
on the turn, could not go with the new leader into the lane, and ran on second best. CITY PARK shifted out four wide leaving the turn, moved into third on
his left lead through mid stretch, and stayed clear of the remainder. BLESSED JOURNEY swung five wide into the stretch, and could not reach contention.
TAAMER dueled for the lead outside SANDYS BLAZE for six furlongs, and gave way. LUCKY MIKE hit the right side of the gate at the start, raced three to
four wide, and was finished before reaching the stretch. SANDYS BLAZE dueled inside TAAMER for six furlongs, and faltered.

LEGAL DEAL set the pace slightly off the inside for a half-mile, brushed with ROYAL DUKE as that one came alongside turning for home, battled shoulder
to shoulder exchanging more brushes late, and held on the rail for a hard-fought decision.. ROYAL DUKE brushed with OUR TIME at the start, brushed with
the same foe on the backstretch and yet again into the turn, moved up three wide to challenge outside LEGAL DEAL after a half-mile, reached even terms
brushing with that one through upper stretch and again late, and was denied. WAR ACT advanced out of last saving ground around the turn, and rallied
mildly on the rail to get up for the show. SMASH stayed close inside for a half, moved out for the drive and weakened. WICKED TEMPTATIONS missed the
break spotting the field a couple lengths, came four wide off the turn and made no headway. MINTZ moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, and faded
through the lane. OUR TIME brushed with ROYAL DUKE at the start, up the backstretch and again entering the turn, and was finished before reaching the
stretch.

Footnotes
SILVERLY ENOUGH received a light bump from GRAINGER COUNTY at the start, was roused to get going two then three wide around the turn, bid
outside TAKE CHARGE DUDE through the furlong grounds, and forged past through the late stages. TAKE CHARGE DUDE took over outside VINNIE VAN
GO and FOR THE ROAD past the five-sixteenths, fought back when confronted by SILVERLY ENOUGH into the final furlong, and came up second best.
UNCAPTURED KING was outrun early, came into the stretch in the two-path, and rallied mildly. VINNIE VAN GO was in a bit tight early, was sent up on the
rail to contest the pace inside FOR THE ROAD and TAKE CHARGE DUDE nearing the half-mile pole, and stayed on to upper stretch before weakening.
LEGACY AZTECA raced four wide to the stretch, and made no headway on the far outside. GRAINGER COUNTY shifted in bumping SILVERLY ENOUGH
lightly at the start, could not keep pace three wide late on the turn, and faded away. FOR THE ROAD led through most of the backstretch run until hooked
nearing the turn, could not cope with pressure from both sides past the three-eighths, and folded up.

Footnotes
CREA'S BKLYN LAW was unhurried early, moved fast outside the leaders to seize the lead after six furlongs, moved inside and was kept busy to the finish.
LIKE YOU brushed with MECHA CORTA at the start, moved in approaching the turn, came back out three wide near the stretch, and was up outside
PRINCE JAMES for the place. PRINCE JAMES set the pace inside, could not withstand CREA'S BKLYN LAW coming to the quarter-pole, and was
outfinished for second. GRAN OMERO (VEN) saved ground outrun to the stretch, and drifted out while unable to gain late. INDIMAAJ made room for
himself by nudging MECHA CORTA out up the backstretch, attempted to go after PRINCE JAMES from outside into the turn, made no impression under a
drive, and retreated. MECHA CORTA got nudged out of the way by INDIMAAJ up the backstretch, and was finished before completing six furlongs.

Footnotes
TRIBUTE FLAG vied with several rivals early, cleared off three then two wide midway on the turn, and remained in command under pressure. KING WADE
contested the early pace between horses, moved inside chasing after TRIBUTE FLAG into the turn, and ran on second best. MAQUIAVELO argued the
early pace between horses, moved in a bit from the three-path through the turn, and held for the show in a strung-out field. D'GUAPO raced close up early,
and faded around the turn four wide. TARQUIN was a step slow to begin, and never factored. PATERFAMILIAS showed brief speed inside, moved out on
the turn, and faded steadily on his left lead. SWIPE LEFT broke behind the field, dropped far back inside through the stretch, pulled up in distress and was
vanned off. MR STARLIGHT trailed widest early, and was eased up in the stretch.
