Footnotes
ELITE MISSION took over from inside YOUREOUTOFCONTROL and MOZANO after a half-mile, drew clear around the turn, and was kept to a drive much
the best. MOZANO raced forwardly three wide from the outset, could not stay with the winner around the turn, and ran on clearly second best. CONSILIUM
raced four wide around the turn, and rallied mildly to get up for the show. SKYLINE VIEW raced two to three wide around the turn, moved in through the
lane and was outfinished for third. RICKY RUN advanced four wide on the turn, but flattened out in the drive. BELLAMY'S TREASURE saved ground to no
avail. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL vied early in the two-path, and gave way after six furlongs. FULL MOON RISING was always outrun. FELIX LEITER was
finished early. PINA COLADA RON retreated after a half-mile three wide. Running times unavailable due to power outage.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MALLOMAR advanced in the four-path after six furlongs, rallied determinedly outside HUMOR ME DIXIE and MAY I through a long drive, and
went clear in the closing yards well out in the track. MAY I emerged with the lead out of the chute, got hooked from the inside by HUMOR ME DIXIE after a
half-mile, dueled outside that rival around the turn and into the stretch, came back for a short lead between rivals in deep stretch while remaining on her left
lead, but yielded late. HUMOR ME DIXIE went up to challenge inside MAY I heading into the turn, drifted out while battling inside that one and STARSHIP
MALLOMAR through the lane, and weakened late. LETTER STORM was reserved early inside, and lacked the needed response when called on. SHE'S A
LADY GRIZ pressed the early pace outside, and gave way on the turn. WIND DREAMER trailed throughout. This race was hand timed, fractional times
unavailable.

Footnotes
TRINNI LUCK perched outside the early leaders, took over outside MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND leaving the turn, and drove clear through the lane.
MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND dueled early outside HALLAJOORI, got the best of that one midway on the turn out in the three-path, yielded to the winner in
upper stretch, and clearly bested the remainder. HALLAJOORI contested the pace inside MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND early, and weakened past the
three-eighths pole. INVALUABLE was outsprinted inside to the turn, fanned wide to the lane and passed tired horses. K'S RUNNING FREE faded after a
half three wide. RACHEL'S WISH was outrun inside. This race was hand timed.

INDICIA advanced inside on the turn, waited briefly behind the leaders past the quarter-pole, got through on the rail to take over from REAGAN'S ROSE
after straightening away for the drive, and widened under pressure. REAGAN'S ROSE set the pace in the two-path, could not withstand the winner in upper
stretch, and ran on clear of the rest on her left lead. BIG TINA raced forwardly outside, was asked for a response midway on the turn four wide, and
weakened after six furlongs. CLASSY WOMAN pressed the pace outside, and faded after six furlongs. PASSION PLUS faded four wide approaching the
stretch. LADY NINA tired after a half-mile. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

RUNNING FOR RIZ sped clear early, raced well removed from the rail battling inside HYDRAULIC on the turn, shook clear in the three-path in upper
stretch, and stayed in command while drifting out. FLASHY KYEM chased two then three wide to the stretch, was inside HYDRAULIC and WIN WITH
PRIDE late, and outfought them for second. WIN WITH PRIDE broke slowly, raced four wide to the lane, and was one-paced on the far outside.
HYDRAULIC challenged outside RUNNING FOR RIZ around the turn, got shaken off into the stretch, and weakened between horses late. ZORB saved
ground dropping back a bit on the turn, bid mildly on the rail in upper stretch and flattened out. This race was hand timed.

CHIT CHAT GIRL stayed in range early inside, moved outside the embattled leaders turning for home, rolled by a sixteenth out and drew clear. LUXE
DIAMOND pressed MYSTIC COMIN HOME from outside early, dueled with that rival around the turn and into the stretch, edged away with a furlong
remaining, but could not hold off the winner. MYSTIC COMIN HOME sped to the front early, vied inside LUXE DIAMOND around the turn and into the lane,
and yielded near the eighth-pole. ANOTHERSONGNDANCE broke open the gate prior to the start, raced in the two-path and faded after a half-mile.
SMARTIZAR raced in striking distance three wide for a half, and tired in the lane. LASTING JOY trailed throughout, and dropped far back in the stretch. This
race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA BLVD saved ground in easy striking range early, moved through on the rail to take over from DISTURBIN BOURBON near the quarter-pole,
entered the lane in the two-path, and was clear under a drive. THREE DEEP rallied along the rail late on the turn, came off the inside past the furlong
marker, could not reach the winner but was clearly second best. HARPER GO LUCKY lagged in the second flight for a half-mile near the two-path, moved
out through upper stretch and rallied mildly. COMING UP ROSES was slow into stride, hugged the rail through the lane and improved for the last major
share. EL ZEUS raced two then three wide to the stretch, and faded. DISTURBIN BOURBON vied outside FOG WARNING for a half, got the best of that
one late on the turn and was quickly set upon from inside by MAGNOLIA BLVD, and gave way into the stretch. BELLAS FELLA raced four to five wide, and
failed to make his presence felt. FOG WARNING dueled inside DISTURBIN BOURBON for a half, and faltered. MOON PISTOL faded after a half three
wide. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
GETTININTOMISCHIEF settled well off the dueling leaders, advanced in the four-path turning for home, collared a weary BIG SPENDER from outside
approaching the sixteenth-pole and moved clear. BEAU TRACE broke slowly, recovered to the middle of the field toward the inside up the backstretch,
came off the rail rallying past the eighth-pole, and was along for the place. BIG SPENDER dueled outside BOLT as they left the others far behind early, won
that battle after a demanding half-mile, moved inside shortening stride through the furlong grounds, and salvaged the show. SHAKEM N BREAKEM broke
slowly, moved out in the stretch and offered a mild response. BABA TOBI was outrun early, entered the lane in the two-path, and improved without
threatening. EARTHQUAKE was no factor inside. BOLT was hard-used in a gap duel inside BIG SPENDER, yielded after a half, and drifted five wide
leaving the turn. BLUESKY KITTEN was outrun throughout. COWBOY BOB eyed the dueling leaders in the three-path heading to the turn, and was empty
before reaching the stretch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
VITAEMI was never far back, took over outside SASSY JUSTICE approaching the three-eighths pole, drew well clear in the three-path at the top of the
stretch, and widened under pressure. SENSIBLE MYTH advanced on the turn while shifting out four wide, rallied through upper stretch and was clearly
second best while not a threat to the winner. ELUSIVE RYDER improved position five wide leaving the turn, and continued on evenly late. WORTH
AVENUE came three wide off the turn, moved inside through the furlong grounds, and lacked a final bid. SHE TAKES HEART moved up outside around the
turn, but faded through the lane. CLASSY OF COURSE was forwardly placed early, and dropped back around the turn. SASSY JUSTICE sped clear early,
lost the lead to VITAEMI before completing five furlongs, and dropped far back through the stretch. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
EYE OF A JEDI stayed close early, ranged up outside KUKULKAN and RED CRESCENT to grab the lead past the five-sixteenths pole, drove clear through
upper stretch and held firm late. NOBLE DRAMA raced four wide most of the way, advanced with aim outside EYE OF A JEDI turning for home, inched
closer through the final yards but did not have quite enough. RED CRESCENT broke to the lead, showed the way inside for six furlongs, yielded to the
winner approaching the stretch, and stayed on with good courage for the show. IDENTIFIER was strung out four wide on the first turn, moved inside through
the middle stages, came back out three wide at the top of the stretch, and could not threaten with an even finish. QUENANE raced three wide to the far turn
well back, fanned to the six-path at the top of the stretch, and made no appreciable headway. HARVEY WALLBANGER was outrun early inside, came five
wide off the far turn and could not gain. KUKULKAN (MEX) prompted the pace outside RED CRESCENT, challenged between that one and EYE OF JEDI
midway on the far turn, and gave way at the head of the lane. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
KALU pressed I'M CARDINAL from outside early, dueled with that foe from midway on the turn to deep stretch, and moved clear all out. NACHO PAPA was
ridden along with the leaders in his sights late on the turn, had aim outside through the lane, and rallied into second late. I'M CARDINAL set the early pace
hounded by KALU, battled inside that one from the three-eighths to deep stretch, and weakened. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was outrun for three furlongs in
the two-path, and passed tired horses. THE QUEENS JULES raced two wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed response. FUZZY IRISH RASCAL was
no factor three to four wide. MARCELINO tired inside. MANHATTAN PROJECT trailed four to five wide. This race was hand timed, fractional times
unavailable.
