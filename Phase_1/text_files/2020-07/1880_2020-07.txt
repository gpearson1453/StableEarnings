Footnotes
MYFIRSTEXWIFE dueled for command outside VALID EMPRESS, took over at the top of the stretch, drew clear through the furlong grounds, then held on
while drifting out. MAY DAY INFO bumped lightly with TWINKIESANDTURNIPS at the start, chased in the four-path for three-eighths of a mile, altered
course inside the winner through mid stretch and finished gamely. ASTROMELIA advanced inside on the turn, steadied behind the leaders past the
five-sixteenths, lugged in through the late stages and saved the show. LIZA raced four wide around the turn, and gained mildly outside. HECHIZADA trailed
far back to the stretch, moved out four wide past the eighth-pole and found her best stride going by tired horses. BORROWED ANGEL saved ground outrun
to the stretch, and improved mildly. MERENGUE was outrun in the two-path. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS bumped lightly with MAY DAY INFO at the start,
tracked outside the leaders three to four wide, and gave way approaching the stretch. VALID EMPRESS dueled inside the winner for three furlongs, and
faltered. MEANASASNAKE raced two to three wide, and was through early. TRAP GIRL retired early three wide.

Footnotes
MR TINGLES slipped through on the rail to grab the lead from TIGER turning for home, edged away in mid stretch, then was all out and saved by the wire.
TIGER broke out bumping FULL SEND, moved through between horses to get the lead soon after, showed the way in the two-path around the turn, lost the
advantage to MR TINGLES with three-sixteenths remaining, switched to his correct lead late and came back on to just miss between horses. FLORALA AL
was difficult to load delaying the start two minutes, chased in the three-path to the stretch, and stayed on well outside the top two. SPEARGUN gave chase
four wide to the lane, and was one-paced to the finish on the far outside. CATCHING FISH was no factor two to three wide. CANYOUHEARMENOW was a
step slow at the start, and outrun in the three-path. FULL SEND received a solid bump from TIGER at the break and was off last, bumped with VET'S GIFT
while outside that rival past the half-mile pole, and remained far back. VET'S GIFT bumped with FULL SEND entering the turn, moved inside and remained
outrun.

Footnotes
WHYRUAWESOME brushed with STONE HANDS at the start, stayed close early inside, got through on the rail to challenge KILLA DEE, poked a head in
front through mid stretch, and held gamely to the finish. KILLA DEE pressed the pace outside TIZ APPROVED, wrested the lead away after a half-mile,
battled outside WHYRUAWESOME through a long drive and was stubborn to the end. CAJUN FIRECRACKER raced four wide around the turn, finished
one-paced outside STONE HANDS and got the show while brushing lightly with that one. STONE HANDS brushed with the eventual winner at the start,
raced between horses two then three wide for a half-mile, and was edged by CAJUN FIRECRACKER for third while brushing lightly with him late. QUIJOTE
was out near the three-path on the turn, and could not reach contention. DARK AGES was steadied and shuffled back at the seven-sixteenths pole, and did
not recover. TIZ APPROVED set the pace in the two-path, and was overrun from both sides after a half.

Footnotes
NORTHERN set a pressured pace slightly off the rail, shook off TARTAN THE BULL at the top of the stretch and edged clear, then held firm to deny GAME
BOY BENNY through the final stages. GAME BOY BENNY was a step slow at the start, recovered to close range inside, shifted four wide at the top of the
lane, loomed outside the winner past the eighth-pole but did not have enough while much best of the rest. TARTAN THE BULL pressed the pace outside
NORTHERN, could not stay with that one turning for home, and saved the show while drifting out. LI'L MEATBALL was outsprinted to the stretch four wide,
and finished evenly. EARLY DELIGH was no factor two wide. TRANSITIVE bobbled at the start, and was outrun three wide. GEMOLOGISTER was
unsettled shifting his head at the break, hustled up to press the pace between horses, and was finished after three furlongs. WILD WIGGLIN JACK saved
ground on the turn, and never got close.

Footnotes
BOCA BOY sprinted to the front at the start, showed the way in the two-path clear around the turn, and was driving to stay safe. POPPY'S PRIDE steadied
along the inside early, moved out and advanced on the turn three wide, could not get to the winner but was clearly second best. HONESTO was outrun
early, swung five wide approaching the stretch, and was along to be a distant third. DANG IT shifted off the inside to the four-path around the turn, and
posed no threat. AHIMELECH was outrun inside and stayed on his left lead. AWESOME BEACH chased the winner for three furlongs, and gave way while
neglecting to change leads. CHIPSHAPE broke slowly, raced well out in the track and was always outrun. GOSPEL HOUSE chased three wide, and was
through after three furlongs.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL MOMENT saved ground under a firm hold early, moved out three wide advancing after six furlongs, took over from outside at the top of the
stretch, and was driving to stay clear. MAVERICK KITTEN was bumped hard by OLD MAIN at the start, improved position around the far turn while guided
out three wide, lugged in through upper stretch, bid along the rail and came up second best. SEVEN CHANNELS got pushed out by OLD MAIN entering the
first turn in the four-path, stayed out in the course to the stretch, and offered a mild response to best the others. VILE was fractious coming on the track and
fell unseating the rider, was quickly apprehended and went to post without further incident, broke out pushing OLD MAIN into MAVERICK KITTEN, lagged
far back inside for six furlongs, angled to the far outside and gained belatedly. TRACEABILITY was three wide early, moved inside after that and did not
factor. TREASURE RUN moved off the rail on the first turn letting BORGOBYTHESEA go on with it, bid between that one and OLD MAIN a half-mile out,
and stayed on to upper stretch before giving way. LOXODROME stayed in range early three wide, and tired after a half. BORGOBYTHESEA moved inside
coming away with the lead on the first turn, got collared at the top of the stretch, and faltered. OLD MAIN got bumped by VILE and pushed out into
MAVERICK KITTEN at the start, came out pushing SEVEN CHANNELS out entering the first turn, pressed the pace outside to the far turn, and was empty
before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
R PREROGATIVE got bumped into FLASHING DIAMOND by PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL at the start, adroitly recovered and pressed the pace three wide, was
under a drive to go after MISS MIAMI by the five-sixteenths, forged to the front in upper stretch and moved clear under constant pressure. FAITH N HOPE
raced three wide around the turn, had a clear shot outside the winner in upper stretch, and could not gain late. MISS MIAMI vied outside TALKTHETALK
early, cleared off into the turn staying in the two-path, yielded to R PREROGATIVE in upper stretch, and salvaged the show. BROADWAY CAT was put to
the whip early on the turn four wide, and went by faders late. FLASHING DIAMOND got bumped by R PREROGATIVE and steadied behind MISS MIAMI at
the start, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and lacked a solid final response. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL broke in bumping R PREROGATIVE at the
start, moved inside and was outrun. TALKTHETALK vied inside MISS MIAMI early, moved to the two-path attempting to rebid at the head of the stretch, but
faded from there.

Footnotes
MERSEYSIDE broke with her front feet in the air and came out last, settled well back for three furlongs, came three wide off the turn, moved farther out
kicking in through the furlong grounds, and closed with a rush outside CHARLOTTE THE BRIT to get up. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT saved ground in the
second flight early, shifted to the three-path leaving the turn, continued outward in the course rallying to the lead outside TRUE HEIRESS in deep stretch,
and was edged in the final yards. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT bumped with HEIR BALL at the start and was off a step slow, lagged well back through the turn,
fanned to the far outside in upper stretch and was rolling too late. WAR STAR brushed the right side of the gate coming out, cut the corner off the turn in
midpack, gained mildly on the rail but needed more. TRUE HEIRESS followed behind the front flight inside, slipped through on the rail to grab the lead
coming to the eighth-pole, and was overrun from both sides through the last 70 yards. CAT'S ASTRAY broke out, chased three then two wide around the
turn, and lacked a solid response through the drive. HEIR BALL bumped with TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT at the start, pressed CHARLIEANNA from outside,
reached even terms turning for home in the three-path, but gave way through the last eighth of a mile. FOXY LADY raced three wide and tired.
CHARLIEANNA cleared to the early lead inside, drifted to the two-path getting collared from both sides into the stretch, and retreated.

Footnotes
DIZZY GILLESPIE vied outside TWO STEP SLEW through a solid half-mile, took over early on the turn and moved clear, and was kept driving to the finish.
JUST KIDDING got bumped and bothered by UNBRIDLED HOLIDAY at the start, advanced steadily after a half, was under a drive trying to get to the leader
around the turn three wide, could not make an impression and ran on clearly second best. UNBRIDLED HOLIDAY broke in bumping JUST KIDDING at the
start, raced three wide around the turn, made no headway and saved the show. ROYALSTON was outrun to the stretch inside, and passed tired horses for
the last major share. TAKEDOWN failed to menace toward the inside. DIAMOND BACHELOR faded steadily after a half, and drifted five wide to the lane.
COWBOY CULTURE was finished early two wide. MR. PAPILLON was slow into stride, moved off the inside advancing on the turn, and flattened out in the
four-path by the top of the stretch. TWO STEP SLEW vied inside the winner up the backstretch, retreated on the turn, and dropped far back.
