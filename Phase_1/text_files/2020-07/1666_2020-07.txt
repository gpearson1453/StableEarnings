PANAMA PAPERS tracked close up on the inside, advanced on the far turn, rallied outside, gained command passing the furlong marker and pulled away
under urging. GRAVITAS raced three wide in the early stages, cleared off entering the first turn, set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn,
dug in gamely in upper stretch, was no match for the winner and held well to save the place spot. CHANNEL STUFFER raced off the pace, between rivals,
angled out entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside. FAME TO FAMOUS vied inside leaving the chute, then stalked the leaders, lacked a winning bid
and gained mildly inside in the final furlong. GENTLEMAN JOE vied for the early lead, then stalked two wide, pressed the pace on the backside, chased on
the far turn and weakened. TY RAN A HOMER raced three wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to threaten. MARKSMAN raced three
wide off the pace and did not factor. JUAN PABLO trailed inside, raced inside entering the stretch, was bumped and bothered by an injured rival at the
eighth pole, pulled up and walked off. CONSTITUTIONAL PAL was steadied leaving the chute, raced off the pace inside, was injured at the eighth pole and
bumped JUAN PABLO while being pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
CRAFTY DON vied inside for the lead, shook free passing the quarter pole, responded when roused, drew clear under urging and held well late. TARGET
TALES raced close up along the inside, moved up inside on the turn, waited for room and steadied at the quarter pole, then rallied in the stretch but second
best. CHUB ON DA RUN vied between rivals early, then dueled two wide on the turn, dug in through the lane and held on far a share of the show spot.
GOLDEN VIPER chased three wide, bid three wide at the quarter pole, finished evenly and earned a share of third. LAREDO chased three wide, came four
wide into the lane and lacked a rally. COUNTRY MILES was reluctant loading, fractious in the gate, chased between rivals and lacked a rally. MORNING
JACKPOT chased between rivals and tired. PAL chased four wide, went five wide past the quarter pole and faded. SWEETEST PARTY was outrun.
