Footnotes
JOSEFA stayed close on the rail for six furlongs, found a seam between FLORADO and FIELD BET turning for home, and drove clear much the best. V K
LEGACY saved ground early within range, had the two-path on the far turn, and rallied for the place. UPSTAGING settled in midpack early inside, waited
behind horses on the far turn, put in a run along the rail through the furlong grounds, then was outkicked for second. LETSNOTGETOEXCITED swung four
wide past the quarter-pole, and rallied mildly for a share. FLORADO broke out, went up to clear for the lead, showed the way inside to the top of the lane
and gave way. MARICOPA steadied off SPECIAL BEACH at the start, raced far back to the far turn, and went by faders. FIELD BET prompted the pace
outside FLORADO to the head of the lane, and tired. WONDER BLONDY was never prominent. REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE was always outrun. MADAME
MOON was finished after six furlongs. SPECIAL BEACH stayed in range early two to three wide, and tired.

Footnotes
MISTER LEONARDO stayed close early inside, was guided outside FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL at the top of the stretch, overpowered that one entering the
final furlong and moved clear, then held off CONGRATS AGAIN late. CONGRATS AGAIN was hustled along from the start, came four wide off the turn and
finished well outside the winner. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL sped to the front after the start, showed the way in the two-path, and yielded to the winner past the
eighth-pole. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE chased in the four-path, and lugged in greenly through the stretch. PAPA HONOR wound up four or five wide through
the turn, and remained outrun. MIGHTY THOMAS took an awkward first step and steadied back at the start, strode greenly to the turn, advanced mildly into
the stretch inside and faded on his left lead. FREELANCE lost his footing briefly at the start, chased three wide early, and tired.

Footnotes
KAYSERI took control after the start, established an even pace inside, was roused into the stretch and stayed clear. INTEREST was roused three wide
midway on the far turn, and finished well to be clearly second best. MILLEFIORI prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and lacked the needed
closing bid. WICKED SOLUTION was outrun for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. MIDNIGHT GEM raced close up three wide early, and tired.
BABYBEL was slow into stride, and never became involved. LA TRES JOLIE saved ground to the far turn, and was ridden along with no response
approaching the stretch. BELLA LINDA was always outrun.

R CALLI KIM fought rating into the first turn and had to be taken out three wide, settled a bit better through the middle stages, had aim outside the leaders
turning for home, and kicked in to win going away. LA RUSIA hopped slightly at the start to no ill effect, chased R CALLI KIM from a distance, closed in after
six furlongs, wrested command from outside in mid stretch, but could not deny the winner a sixteenth out. GLORIOUS GAL sped off to a lengthy early lead
through ambitious fractions, and weakened on the rail approaching the eighth-pole. SILLY NOTION raced three wide much of the way, and was along for
the last major share while never a factor. ITSAROLLOFTHEDICE was under a firm hold early, and was empty when roused. MRS. MAISEL was three wide
early, and posed no threat. LITTLE BIT GOOD was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
MATRACA chased from close range early, bid between horses past the five-sixteenths, dueled inside DONA CAMILE through a long drive and edged away
late. DONA CAMILE tracked three wide, bid in tandem with MATRACA as they overhauled the pacesetter late on the turn, and was bested through a
stretch-long dispute. AUBURN became fractious in the gate unseating the rider prior to the start, came away without further incident, came wide off the turn
and could only gain mildly while drifting about. DARESCA raced three wide on the turn, and passed only tired horses. NA NA DUDE broke out bumping
SWANEE BEACH after the start, and was outrun. FLAT OUT COOL set the early pace inside, and folded up after a half-mile. SWANEE BEACH got
bumped by NA NA DUDE after the start, was eased up into the lane, and walked off.

MANE ATTRACTION saved ground on the turn awaiting room behind the leaders, got through in the two-path between horses past the furlong marker and
was up inside rivals. MEADOW BEAUTY chased early, challenged between horses through the lane and was edged out late. DROP A HINT tracked outside
the leaders three wide, bid through the lane and was outkicked outside the top two. SWIRLING CANDY sped clear early inside, remained in command
through upper stretch, but yielded through the last eighth of a mile. MERSEYSIDE took an awkward first step, brushed with ROYAL JEWEL while inside that
one entering the turn, and failed to menace. ROYAL JEWEL brushed with MERSEYSIDE out in the five-path entering the turn, moved in and remained
outrun.

Footnotes
SHALL RETURN stayed close behind an early three-way pace fight, moved out three wide challenging between horses on the turn, and drew clear through
the stretch under pressure. BABY ICE ranged up four wide to lodge a bid outside SHALL RETURN approaching the quarter-pole, could not go with that one
through upper stretch and rallied well enough for the place while shifting in a bit. NOWITNA RIVER advanced a bit three wide after a half-mile, and rallied
mildly on the far outside. GILDA F. dueled for the early lead inside rivals, and gave way the last eighth of a mile. SUPER TWENTY FIVE hit the right side of
the gate at the start, and was outrun. NOT NICE vied early three then two wide, and tired before completing a half. SI TE VAS was outrun early, and
dropped far back in the stretch. SALSA RITA argued the pace between horses, and dropped out of it early on the turn.

Footnotes
JOYFUL HEART was a step slow at the start, advanced inside on the turn, got through on the rail in upper stretch and edged away after a hard drive.
DOCTOR DUB contested the pace outside ANOTHER SOFTBALL and ATTHEPEARLYGATES, and stayed on well to the finish. ANOTHER SOFTBALL
battled up front inside rivals early, got overhauled from both sides in deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. INDY RIDE was outsprinted early, cut the corner
off the turn and finished well on the rail. LAWYER DRILL shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, and went evenly to the wire. ATTHEPEARLYGATES
contested the early pace between horses, and weakened through the drive. VISIONS OF YOU broke slowly, and was always outrun. FREDDY SOTO
fanned widest into the stretch, and made no headway. ENZOEXPRESS faded around the turn three wide.

Footnotes
REAGAN'S HEART stayed in range four wide early, rallied determinedly to overtake the leaders from outside in deep stretch, then held off MONEY COME
through the last strides. MONEY COME lost his footing at the start, raced between horses on the turn in midpack, rallied late on the far outside and just
missed. JAXON'S GOLDIE pressed the pace three wide, wrested the lead in mid stretch outside COOL DIXIE MAN, drifted out under left-hand pressure and
weakened late. FELON pressed the early pace two wide, idled through the turn despite urging, rebid past the eighth-pole, then took up sharply between
horses 70 yards out. LITTLE TEQUILA cut the corner into the stretch, moved off the inside through the furlong grounds and continued evenly. COOL DIXIE
MAN lunged slightly and bumped with YES FOR LESS at the start, dueled inside to the stretch, and faded on his left lead. SOUPER SHENANIGAN raced
four wide and made no impact. YES FOR LESS bumped with COOL DIXIE MAN and was off slow, and never got close. WILD ONE FOREVER checked
behind JAXON'S GOLDIE soon after the start, and was outrun three wide. REGGAE PIRATE broke slowly and was always outrun. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS INQUIRY, AND OBJECTIONS BY THE RIDER OF FELON AGAINST BOTH REAGAN'S HEART AND JAXON'S GOLDIE, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD POSITION AND PLACED FOURTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
