in time. SINGLE BARREL was five wide to the backstretch, tracked to the second turn, also was four wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms while
brushing BIG HOOF DYNAMITE in upper stretch, brushed that one again leaving the furlong marker then could not stall the winner. BIG HOOF DYNAMITE
pressed the pace to the second turn, pushed up three wide to engage for the lead, brushed with the runnerup twice to mid stretch then was outfinished for
second. DIRT ROAD RED had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was four wide then swung out widest and six deep into the stretch and closed ground
belatedly. IMPERATOR was outsprinted to the half, offered a bid four then five wide on the second turn to loom a threat to the stretch then came up empty
late. MAGIC MOSCO bobbled to begin then hustled to the front, set the pace for five furlongs while three wide then tired.

FABRIANA rated in the 'catbird seat' to the second turn, rallied three wide then accelerated to the front and pushed away under steady urging.
BOONESBORO BEAUTY was allowed to settle for a half mile, rallied four wide to engage for the lead on the second turn, was outkicked by the winner to
mid stretch then stubbornly saved second. BUTTIE had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was four then five wide to the stretch, was not a threat to the
winner then could not get by BOONESBORO BEAUTY for second. ACCLAIM THE QUEEN pressed the pace for a half mile, pushed up to duel three then
four wide to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch then weakened. LORETTA had good speed, set the pace for a half, was overtaken on the second
turn then weakened in the drive. PACIFIC STRIKE had no speed, was three or four wide throughout and never a factor.
