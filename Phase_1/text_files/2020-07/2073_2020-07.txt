Footnotes
VINYL stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the second turn, gained the
margin entering the drive and was well clear while never asked. RUNCHIEFRUN chased the early pace from the inside, remained in a forward position
entering the drive, responded but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. ZING ZANG outrun early, advanced inside through the second
turn, responded and rallied late for the show. CHOPPA STYLE chased the early pace outside but could only improve position. OUTRUN was never close.
GOLDEN NOGUEZ broke sharp from the outside, gained the early margin, remained clear up the backstretch then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
AFLEET MOON dueled from the inside the early margin, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose at the eighth pole and was well clear while kept to
task. CAMILLE'S COURT dueled from between foes for the early margin, battled through the turn, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace
and just lasted for the place. SHANGHI DAISY dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn, remained forward but was outfinished for
the place. I'LL FLY AWAY could only improve position. SNEAKY FREAK chased the early pace outside then tired in the drive. CARAMEL LATTE was never
a factor.

NAVY REGATTA stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the turn, altered outside for the drive and found her best stride in time.
CHEROKEE CHATTER dueled from between foes early, battled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive but was outfinished. BROOKLYN BABY
dueled from the outside early, fought through the turn, remained engaged for the drive and was just up for the show. CUSTOM CUT dueled from the inside
early, remained engaged through the turn but could not keep pace. MY LITTLE SPITFIRE could only improve position. MILLIE'S AN ANGEL chased the
pace from the outside and tired. OH MY GOSH BECKY was no factor. ZIPITUPMYSISTER was no threat. MATTIE E was no menace.
