and was well in hand to the end. STARRY SKY broke slowly, trailed early then was up for the place at the end of an even effort. CATTLE DRIVE was
carried wide by the winner into the first turn, opened a clear lead after going a quarter, stayed out from the rail while in control into the far turn then tired.

KATY THE CAT stayed out from the inside while pressing inside the early leader, moved clear before a half, drew off into the stretch and was put to whip.
SWITCHRATTLENROLL was forced in toward BETTY'S GOT RYTHM while between rivals nearing the first turn, was unhurried, raced two wide around the
final turn and was clear for the place in an even effort. BETTY'S GOT RYTHM steadied in tight along the rail nearing the first turn, gained position along the
rail then tired in the lane. FARMAVET was slow early, angled to the rail on the backstretch then tired. PRINGIPESSA made the early pace outside the
winner, remained close into the far turn, stopped and was eased up. SIDNEY SUE lugged in in front of SWITCHRATTLENROLL before going a furlong,
wasn't far back to the far turn, stopped and was eased up. WAKA WAKA was outrun. Off time was delayed 9 minutes after MOUSE CAT ran off in the post
parade.

going away late under strong urging. PAPADOPALOUS was rated on the front while out from the inside, responded when challenged on the final turn,
dueled through the lane but bore out late under left hand whip. SWINGING STAR was rated outside the winner early, angled to the rail on the far turn and
weakened. SUPER VISION pressed outside early in the three path and faded after six furlongs.

THAT'S HISTORY dueled from the outset, saved ground around the turn, drew out after five furlongs and held under brisk urging. BAYTOWN GLORY broke
slowly, raced two wide around the turn, closed slowly outside through the lane and was up for the place. HAYNESFIELD BEST set or forced the pace two
wide outside the winner into the final furlong, gave up late and lost the place. SILVER STARSHIP was slow early and gained mildly. EXPEDITER chased
inside early and stopped. REY ASTRAY bobbled, ducked out leaving the gate then was outrun.

CHARITY STRIPE came out, bumped FORMAL CLASS leaving the gate, was sent after the early leader on the turn while in the three path, ran out while
running clear into the stretch and widened under mild urging. CUCKOO FORCONONUTS angled in on the backstretch, raced the two path around the turn
and proved second best in an even finish. SHACKLEFORDS LADY raced the three path and weakened. BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN came in, bumped with
FORMAL CLASS leaving the gate, saved ground and failed to matter. ATTENTIVELY was outrun two wide. REGAL ANTICIPATION opened a clear lead
soon after the break, made the pace in the two path for over a half then stopped. FORMAL CLASS was bumped from both sides leaving the gate then
trailed.
