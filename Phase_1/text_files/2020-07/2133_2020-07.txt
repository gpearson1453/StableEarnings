Footnotes
CANOODLING bumped from the outside leaving the gate, settled near the inside, angled three wide around the turn, rallied three deep, cleared inside rivals
and won going away. CIELO D'ORO broke in and bumped rival, traveled off the rail, angled in on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied and gained the
place. GRAVITRON chased inside, bumped with rival near the three-eighths, angled out at the top of the lane, bid between with a furlong to go but got
outkicked. PRETTY SAYLEE sped clear and crossed over to the inside, showed the way through the turn and into the stretch, urged left-handed
approaching the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. MANDRAGORA SEEKER chased inside then angled off the rail, traveled three wide then
carried four wide by rival on the turn and lacked a rally. I'M THE BOSS OF ME chased outside a rival, bumped with that foe near the three-eighths marker,
angled in upper stretch and gave way. LADY MO tracked off the inside, dropped back on the turn and was through early.

Footnotes
LIBERALISM up close alongside the leader in the early going, applied pressure and challenged around the turn, took over in the stretch and kicked clear
under a drive. ALTHEA GIBSON well placed behind the pacesetter inside, angled out off the rail on the turn then back to the inside at the top of the lane,
rallied along the fence and got up for second. ALL STAR HEAT attended the pace three deep, chased the top pair five wide into the lane, finished well but
lost the place. ELGOFRANCO had good early foot and set the pace with company to the outside, headed by rival near at the five-sixteenths, fought back
inside to the eighth pole but faltered in the final furlong. KEEP DANCING off slow to begin, chased outside, raced five wide then moved into the four path
around the turn and lacked a response when called upon. ANGEL CREEK chased between foes, two wide around the turn and had little left for the drive. I'M
SO ADORABLE three deep off the inside, outside a rival on the turn, drifted three to four wide leaving the turn and came out into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CAJUN TREASURE stalked inside, steered three wide, moved up alongside the leader a furlong out, kicked clear and held to the wire. HONOS MAN raced
inside, swung five wide leaving the final turn, rallied and finished a game second. SEEKING REFUGE settled outside a rival, two wide to the stretch and
finished well. TROMADOR steadied soon after the start, settled a bit off the rail, angled three wide into the lane, angled out further in the stretch and kept on
willingly. DESCARTES in tight and hit the rail into the first turn, stalked inside then moved a bit off the rail, bid outside the leader on the far turn, gained
command past the quarter pole, briefly cleared in the stretch but weakened in the late stages. KRIS' WILD KAT stalked outside a rival, went between foes at
the half-mile marker, three to four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. ALL AMERICAN HERO three deep early then cleared inside rivals
and angled in on the first turn, set the pace inside, met challenger around the far turn, lost contact in the lane and faded through the final furlong.
GEORGIAN ROAD between rivals into the first turn then tracked outside a foe, traveled three deep at the half-mile pole, three wide into the stretch and
lacked further response.

Footnotes
HAPPIER sped to the front, led clear in the two path, inched away into the stretch, drew away while urged once right-handed and hand urged in deep
stretch. HIMIKO bumped inside rival at the start, stalked outside the leader, chased three to four wide leaving the bend, finished well but could not make any
headway on the winner. LAST FIRST KISS raced inside, saved ground into the lane and went one paced through the final furlong. THIS TEA three deep off
the fence, three wide through the turn and lacked a rally while earning a minor award. QUEEN OF ACES stalked from the far outside, five wide into the turn
then four wide into the lane and weakened. UNBREAKABLE bumped at the start, chased between rivals early, two wide around the turn and tired.
BRANDONS DANGER tracked four wide into the turn, dropped back and came three wide into the lane and also tired.

the bend, lost ground entering the stretch, came again and drove past in final sixteenth. SALVATOR MUNDI stalked, inside, awaited room on the far turn,
angled out into the three path, angled back in at the top of the lane, steered off the inside in the stretch then back inside when TIBERIUS MERCURIUS

pole angled in some, drew clear in upper stretch, led through the drive, drifted out and got overtaken by the top pair. GO DADDY GO settled inside, came
out on the second turn, went three wide into the lane then angled out further and rallied late. SICILIA (GB) raced a bit off the rail, angled out and got fanned
four wide into the lane and improved position. SILENCED dueled inside to the far turn, outpaced entering the stretch and retreated in the drive. SWAMP
SOUFFLE mid-pack and outside a rival, took closer order three deep into the far turn, challenged four deep around the bend but gave way in the lane.

good early speed, cleared outside rivals, led in the two path to the lane, headed at the eighth pole, succumb to the pressure but lasted for third. MR
PAYTIENCE chased inside then moved out into the two path, showed a mild response and missed the show. CALI DUDE settled early, took the turn two
wide and lacked a bid. RINSE AND REPEAT between foes early, two wide into the turn, three wide exiting the bend and never responded when call upon.
SUMMER FIRE went four wide around the turn and never rallied. TRIBAL WAR CHANT tracked inside, came out on the turn, entered the drive four wide
and never made an impact. SQUARE DEAL showed early speed then chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and weakened.

MADONE unhurried in the early going, angled to the inside, moved off the rail and angled four wide into the stretch, challenged three deep upper stretch
and drew clear late. IVY LEAGUE stalked inside, angled three wide leaving the far turn, bid between upper stretch, outkicked by the winner in deep stretch
but proved second best. FLORAL ESSENCE forwardly placed behind the pacesetter, bid outside at the quarter pole, gained command into the stretch,
challenged by a pair of rivals in the lane and proved no match in the final furlong. BASILIA chased between then outside a rival, went between rivals on the
far turn and steadied past the five-sixteenths pole, split foes in the stretch and kept on to improved position. MY PRINCESS ELLIE four wide early, off the
rail on the backstretch, into the lane, in tight mid-stretch and lacked a rally after. MAMMA RAMA traveled two wide then angled out on the far turn, came five
wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and flattened. SMOOTH RITHMS set the pace inside, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and gave
way. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT stalked off the inside, dropped back around the far turn and tired. KOKO'S MOM was never a factor.

mild bid approaching the quarter pole, failed to match the winner into the lane, chased through the drive and held the place. EXHORT unhurried and steered
to the inside, saved ground into the lane, angled out a bit off the rail, closed but then steadied late off the heels of the runner-up in the late stages.
RAILSPLITTER stalked along the inside, saved ground into the stretch and got edged for the show honors. K P D DAY tracked off the rail, three to four wide
around the far turn and finished with a mild late bid. INFATUATE broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked off the inside, three wide into the drive
and finished one paced. PALACE PRINCE raced off the rail, four wide entering the stretch and lacked further response. SILENT MUSKETIER bumped both
sides at the start, settled early, traveled in the two path into the stretch, raced between foes, found traffic and steadied briefly mid-stretch and lacked further
response. HUGE BIGLY broke in and bumped rival in the beginning, traveled outside a rival off the pace, exited the final turn three wide and never rallied.
TEMBO off slow and broke in, raced along the fence, two wide into the stretch, angled out in the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
ATINA (ARG) away quickly from the start then settled a bit off the rail, steered out and came four wide into the stretch, collared rival with a furlong to go and
proved best. PAIGE RUNNER raced five then four wide on the first turn, in range just off the leader on the backstretch, headed rival at the five-sixteenths,
gained the lead while three wide, met challenger from the outside at the eighth pole, finished gamely but could not contain the winner. DIAMOND OF
VALUE raced in range a bit off the inside, inched closer into the far turn, lost ground entering the stretch and bested the rest. SHE BEGAN AGAIN settled off
the rail, five to six wide up the backstretch, came five wide into the lane and finished willingly. MAJESTIC DIVA caught in tight between rivals and steadied
on the first turn, stalked off the inside, three deep into the far turn, four wide into the stretch and flattened. LOVE OF ART (IRE) chased from the inside, a bit
off the rail into the drive and lacked a rally. PURE PERFECTION bumped with rival at the start, tracked a bit off the rail, moved out and raced off the rail on
the backstretch, traveled three wide leaving the final turn and passed tired rivals. WHOA NESSIE sped to the front and crossed over to the inside,
challenged around the far turn and lost command approaching the quarter pole, cut the corner into the stretch and faded. LOOKOUT TAYLOR chased
outside a rival, traveled two wide then came out into the stretch and tired. DROP THE MIC bumped leaving the gate, traveled inside, eased around the far
turn, down the stretch and across the wire and walked off under her own power.
