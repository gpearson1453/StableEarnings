BOUNDTOBEGOOD lacked early speed, advanced along a clear rail around the turn, tipped out near the sixteenth pole, closed strongly and was up on the
wire. MIO'S LONG TERM set the pace in the two path, drifted further out turning for home, angled to the rail in upper stretch and led until the final strides.
FLASHY READY RICK had his heels clipped behind soon after the start, chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a
rally. JACOB T saved ground and failed to menace. WILLIE THE WHALE pressed the pace in three path and tired. BOPPIN BOB chased the pace four wide
and came up empty in the lane. ORILEYS TYPHOON clipped heels soon after the start and trailed.

STOWE ANGEL set a rated pace along the rail, burst clear nearing the lane and widened while ridden out. PEACEFUL CHILD was rank and repeatedly
steadied off the winner's heels while boxed in through the opening half-mile, remained locked into the rail around the far turn, finally saw clear sailing in
upper stretch and finished willingly inside to gain the place. SECRET CASTLE pressed the winner two wide, bid nearing the far turn but was no match.
COMMCAT was pinched back at the start, raced well back inside, made progress at the rail into the far turn, angled out near the three-sixteenths pole and
improve position outside. GATTOLOTTACHARM stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. BELLANDOLA broke out and
bumped COMMCAT at the start, lagged inside, swung out leaving the half-mile pole, made little progress outside, angled back in near the three-sixteenths
pole and lacked a rally. BAYOU BOUGIE was squeezed back at the start, raced off the pace two wide, made progress outside down the backstretch, bid
four wide into the far turn, slowed suddenly, was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
COMPLETE SURPRISE was shut off at the start, advanced three wide around the first turn, seized command approaching the five-sixteenths pole, drew
clear and angled in soon after, held clear past the sixteenth pole and lasted under left-handed urging. LIAM'S LOOKOUT was shut off at the start, lagged
well back three wide early, made progress three deep around the far turn, closed outside and was rapidly gaining late. COLERAINE raced well back while
saving ground, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. PEARLY QUEEN veered in at the start, raced in range two wide, tended to lug in and
was one-paced in the lane. RAISON D'ETAT GIRL never threatened while racing two and three wide. PLAY CHARADES saved ground and failed to
menace. RUMOURIST sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail and stopped after a half. SHANNON TIDE was outrun while racing two
wide. TIDAL FIELD had brief speed two wide.

BOLD VALOR set the pace along the rail, drew off around the far turn and held well clear under a drive. TRANQUIL BLUE stalked the pace two wide, could
not keep pace around the far turn then finished evenly to win the place battle. HARD BEING ME raced off the pace two wide, went three wide around the far
turn and was along for the show. THE SEVEN FIVE was up close inside early, angled out midway around the first turn, bid two wide nearing the far turn,
chased around that bend and was one-paced in the lane. CHARITABLE VISIT stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, dropped back around the
turn and lacked any closing bid. HE'S A GOLD DIGGER failed to menace while racing four wide. WINNING SCHOLAR played no factor while racing three
wide.

Footnotes
HAY BABY GIRL pressed the pace two wide, took the lead between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole, vied two wide around the far turn, drew clear in
upper stretch, held clear past the sixteenth pole then just lasted. DUBAI WAS LIT lacked speed while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far
turn, surged late and just missed. CALL ME JELLY ROLL set the pace along the rail, vied inside of the winner around much of the far turn and held well
enough to preserve the show. BIRD TRAFFIC tracked the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. WIN THEN GRIN was in range two wide, came under
a ride near the half-mile pole and had little response. AZZURRA stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner near the five-sixteenths pole, was
unable to match strides around the turn and tired in the drive. BOCA BIRDIE checked soon after the start, dropped well off the pace, saved ground and
played no factor. DUDES PICK was fractious in the starting gate and made little impact while racing two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CASH FOR THE SOUL sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. ON THIS DAY stalked the pace from the
rail, angled out in upper stretch and finished willingly to narrow the gap. SOCIAL MEDIA was bumped at the start, dropped back to a clear last early, circled
five wide around the turn rallied widest to gain the show late. ICE KAUFY gave distant chase four wide around the turn and had a mild rally. OPPORTUNITY
CALLS chased the pace three wide and was outkicked in the lane. HEARTLAND HIT chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. CALL ME
COWBOY failed to menace while racing two wide. CRIMSON SPADE was bumped at the start, saved ground and played no further factor.
