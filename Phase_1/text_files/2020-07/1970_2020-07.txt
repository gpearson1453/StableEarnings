Footnotes
HOT SHOT KID broke readily, prompted the pacesetter into the turn, took over racing into upper stretch under a few left handed taps and extended the
advantage late in a ridden out effort. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER broke readily, was urged to the lead while angling inside racing into the turn, dictated the
pace through the turn, couldn't match the winner's bid racing into the lane but proved best of the others. ALWAYS settled outside a rival tracking off the
second flight, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and continued well enough to edge a rival for a share. SPEEDING KID, unhurried tracking off the
second flight, was taken in hand when pulling a bit racing past the half mile marker while advancing to contention inside foes, switched out racing into upper
stretch to lodge a brief bid but flattened out late. RACER, urged along pursuing the leaders along the inside, gave way early.

Footnotes
BREAK AT DAWN took up a position tracking just off the first flight under light rating racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper
stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest command in time under firm left handed encouragement. DOUBLE BEE STING, in touch from the outset
prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into the lane to gain a narrow advantage late but was collared in the final
strides. MADISON'S QUARTERS, urged to dispute the lead along the rail on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, dueled for command on the far
turn into upper stretch and weakened late. CARRIAGE, pulling a bit along the inside racing through the first turn, was rated out of striking distance along the
rail through the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, shifted out late and finished evenly while edging a rival for some position. SWEET BLINDNESS
tracked the leaders from out of striking distance outside a rival to the backstretch, then into the far turn but lacked a closing response. AURIGA stumbled at
the start losing position to the field, was settled last to the backstretch and never gained contention.

Footnotes
CANDY WOMPUS drifted off the inside racing into the first turn carrying out VIX VISION and LOGAN'S HEROE while pulling hard against restraint tracking
off the first flight, shifted nearer to the inside approaching the backstretch, was prompted to split foes with an early move to challenge for command midway
through the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, drifted out while losing the advantage
racing past the furlong marker but continued gamely in a prolonged skirmish to just edge MAY WE ALL under firm right handed pressure. The latter sped to
the lead while angling to the rail to set the pace on a narrow margin to the backstretch, came under pressure when headed by the eventual winner to resist
that rival racing into the far turn, continued grudgingly in a long drive to regain the advantage nearing midstretch but couldn't contain the winner. CHARLIES
A CHARMER broke in the air, was settled last, saved ground gradually regaining contention nearing the lane, angled out three wide in the closing stages
and edged a rival for a share on the wire. VIX VISION, carried out four deep between foes racing into the first turn, was colleced while angling to the inside
tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn to the lane gaining some position but had no final
kick. HERO OF FIRE settled off the second flight in early stages racing outside a rival, swung out five wide racing into the lane but made no impression.
KRIS ME DEADLY, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace into the backstretch, was eased off the leaders after a half to track those foes three wide into
the lane and steadily faded. LOGAN'S HEROE, carried out five wide racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders outside foes into the backstretch and soon
retreated.

TRAPALANDA switched outside a rival in the opening furlong while being prompted to contest the lead, gained the advantage to dictate the pace between
foes into the turn, then widened the advantage racing into the stretch while being kept to steady right handed pressure. MINES MADE UP broke sharply to
gain the advantage, angled immediately to the rail, lost the advantage after the opening furlong, conceded ground to the leaders racing into the turn, was
prompted to advance along the inside racing into the stretch to bid inside the leader but proved no match while lasting for second. CHATTERMAN tracked
off the first flight outside foes, shifted out four wide racing through the turn while being prompted to advance and continued willingly in that path while just
outkicked for second. DRC ALL INCLUSIVE, forwardly placed three wide attending the early pace, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner to upper
stretch and gave way. FENDER BENDER, restless in the gate, then off a bit slowly, angled to the inside early, saved ground to the lane but lacked the
needed final response. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN dropped out early.

SHE B GLAMOROUS was rated just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out to advance between foes nearing upper stretch,
bid inside the leaders entering the lane,, shifted out in the closing stages under brisk left handed pressure making some contact with SHABAM nearing the
wire and narrowly edged that foe on the wire. SHABAM raced in touch with the first flight between foes attending the pace in the opening half, conceded
some ground to the pacesetter nearing the far turn, shifted out three wide advancing on that foe nearing upper stretch, pressed the issue into the lane and
was just outfinished while being bumped by the winner approaching the wire. ROSIE'S FLOWER'S broke outwards carrying out DIGGER HEELS IN at the
start, was urged to terms with the first flight three deep pressing the pace into the backstretch, edged away to a clear advantage after a half while shifting
inwards a bit racing into the second bend, dueled between the top pair racing into the lane but gave out leaving midstretch. DIGGER HEELS IN, restless in
the gate, then carried out a bit at the start, was collected to track off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the far turn to
make some brief progress but soon flattened out. ARNOLD'S PATSY, urged inside rivals prompting the pace from the outset into the backstretch, gave way
nearing upper stretch.

RUNTECH bobbled at the start, wad collected, then urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, steadily advanced on that
foe on the far turn to bid for command nearest the rail approaching upper stretch and drove clear. BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI off slowly, was settled inside foes
in the last flight, gathered momentum while swinging out five wide racing into the lane and edged a rival for the place honors late. FLANAGAN tracked the
leaders from just out of striking distance along the inside, gained position inside foes racing into the lane, shifted out nearing midstretch and was just
outkicked for second. WHATA SHOW OFF tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on
the far turn, was carried out four wide by FRIDLEY racing into upper stretch, had no final kick and was vanned off the course after the race. MICA BAY
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. FRIDLEY sprinted to the lead along the inside, shifted off the rail after gaining a
commanding advantage after a half, held sway off the rail into the far turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch carrying out a rival and gave out entering the
lane. LISTEN TO ROSE never seriously menaced.

DISTINCT APPROVAL broke readily, was urged along the rail prompting a rival's pace racing into the turn, took over in upper stretch and held sway through
the lane under firm encouragement. RIGHT ON BY tracked off the first flight three deep into the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch, then continued three
deep between foes into the lane to prove best of the others. A KISS GOODNIGHT, held up in early stages dropping well off the leaders, was prompted to
advance outside foes racing into the turn and steadily improved position five wide to the end. REMARKABLE CHARM shuffled back at the start, settled into
stride, shifted out nearing the lane and improved position between rivals late. PASZ THE PEPPER, urged forcing the pace outside the eventual winner on a
narrow advantage through the backstretch into the turn, drifted out markedly in upper stretch and quickly gave way. SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE, caught in
close quarters at the break, angled to the inside tracking off the second flight, saved ground to the lane but lacked a rally. CRITTER tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight and gave way into the lane. SPELL WINDER angled inside to track the leaders in second flight and steadily faded racing into
the stretch. TRIPLE TROUBLE settled outside foes early and failed to menace. DIM SUM proved no factor.

Footnotes
ATTAIN SUCCESS tracked the leaders from just off the second flight racing four wide into the turn and continued with a steady advance in that path to
narrowly prevail in time under firm handling. TREVOR'S CALL broke readily, forced the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, went clear nearing upper
stretch and held sway to late stages while just failing to contain the winner. JACKS OUTLAW settled last along the inside racing into the turn, split rivals just
off the inside midstretch to bid inside the leaders and continued willingly while just outkicked. MARVELOUS THUNDER tracked just off the first flight along
the inside in the opening stages, shifted out on the turn to bid between rivals racing into the lane but had no final kick. HAWKWOOD tracked the leaders
between rivals in second flight, shifted out three wide nearing the lane and gave way. ASTRONAUT OSCAR bobbled in early stages, was urged to the lead
along the rail disputing the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE BOMBER stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to track off the first flight along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch gaining positiion
between foes, gradually drew into striking range shifting three wide into upper stretch and wrested the advantage in the closing stages to go clear under
brisk handling. SLICK AS ICE settled last dropping well off the field racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance four wide on the far
turn into upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors late while moving to close the gap. CABIN JOHN, urged forcing the pace outside a rival into the
first turn, took over from that foe entering the backstretch, dueled for command inside a rival racing to the far turn, then to upper stretch but weakened late.
I'M AN EIGHT switched out three deep early while being prompted to a forward placing, pressed the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch to
the lane and faded late. LUCKYNSUCCESSFUL, urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the first turn, was eased off the leaders racing into the
backstretch and continued evenly to late stages. MONEY BROKER tracked off the first flight three wide between foes to the far turn but offered no rally.
HANDSOME JOHN was shuffled out of close quarters at the start, switched out four wide racing into the backstretch while being prompted to terms with the
second flight but had no further response.
