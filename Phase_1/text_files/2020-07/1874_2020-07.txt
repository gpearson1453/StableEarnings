Footnotes
RAIDEN prompted the pace along the rail, inherited the lead at the five sixteenth pole but was soon met with a challenge from BARLEY BOY, responded to
challenge into the lane then drew away late stretch. BARLEY BOY raced three to four wide in the opening turn, sat in striking range outside, took closer
order leaving the backstretch, moved up alongside RAIDEN to challenge the lead but lacked the rally needed and finished second best. PATRICK angled
towards the rail racing into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch, moved up closer in the far turn, swung out racing four to five wide into the lane and
was along in time for show honors. RUNAWAY LIGHTNING saved ground mid pack just off the rail, lacked running room inside leaving the backstretch,
chased into lane and weakened late. AWESOME HIT attended the pace racing three wide, gained a narrow lead through the backstretch, was unable to
sustain the bid that was needed leaving the final turn and faded through stretch. SMALL TOWN DUDE pressed the pace from between rivals, was unable to
moved on with rivals at the five sixteenth and faded gradually. HUERFANO G. was last leaving the gate, saved ground inside and offered little.

SESAME established the front, remained unchallenged leaving the final turn, widened under encouragement and won handily. FLAT AS A PANCAKE
stalked three to four wide between foes, went pursuit of the leader in the final turn, chased into the stretch but was no match for winner. BLUSHING
BROOKE raced wide in the early stages, came under urging leaving the final turn and stayed on well for show. SALSA TANGO drifted out early, tracked
outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch and rallied mildly but was denied late. CARRAMIAMINE sat just off the pace, dropped back, steadied at the
five sixteenth and faded through the lane. LEENA trailed and showed some interest late. GO MAMA settled in range and lacked a serious bid.

Footnotes
PENNY A POINT stalked inside, waited for running room at the quarter pole, shifted out to the two path splitting rivals into the lane and won driving.
MARYAM shifted outside entering the backstretch, moved up closer to contention, came under a four wide drive entering the lane, rallied under steady
urging and just held for place. LADY RORSCHACH carried out in the backstretch, angled in entering the far turn, took closer order under encouragement
and closed gradually, missed. NORTHERN BREEZE trailed into the backstretch, dropped back then chased leaving the final turn, swung wide into the lane
and closed well. BLUEBELLEJAM sat in striking range, chased three wide into the lane and lack a kick that was needed. FIT FOR ROYALTY contested the
pace, showed the way through the final turn and faltered. PIPERS JOY vied inside, pressed the pace through the backstretch and weakened into the lane.

Footnotes
ADRIEN'S AURORA sat just off the pacesetters in the three path, waited for running room into the far turn, shifted out three wide into the lane, gained the
lead into the stretch and drove clear. TIZTHUNDERINOW vied inside for the early lead, dueled through the final turn outside of SMILEY, but lacked the rally
needed in the drive and just held for second. WISER TIMES lacked early speed needed, tracked the pacesetters, angled out into the far turn, drifted in into
the lane but was quickly corrected and closed gradually, just missing out. SILVER PRAIRIE saved ground inside in the early stages, chased in the final turn
under urging and made no impact in the drive. COMMISSION MAN reluctant to load, trailed entering the backstretch, gained closer order approaching the
quarter pole, swung out then rallied mildly through the drive. SMILEY hustled to the front, dueled inside of TIZTHUNDERINOW and yielded into the stretch.
GROOMED pressed the pace three wide and was done early. FROST CANYON flashed early speed and tired.

THE LADY CHABLIS controlled the pace early, lugged out in the far turn, rallied inside of CHIANTI into the lane, responded to urging mid stretch and won
driving. I TRICKED MY RIDE broke outward, raced three wide in the turn, angled inward approaching the quarter pole, rallied inside to earn second.
CHICOUT D'TIGER settled outside, was carried wide mid turn, came four to five wide into the lane and lacked the rally needed. CHIANTI sat just off the
pace, was carried out mid turn, rallied three wide just after the quarter pole and weakened in stretch. BITTERS angled inward leaving the backstretch,
chased from the rail then steadied at the quarter pole, shifted out then was eased. **STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry at the five
sixteenth pole and after review THE LADY CHABLIS was disqualified and placed fourth for interference to both CHIANTI and CHICOUT D'TIGER.

Footnotes
SUNBURST strolled to the front then was placed under tight restraint, was roused approaching the quarter pole, was under steady urging held sway.
BROADWAY BONNIE settled outside early, advanced quickly through the turn, was gaining ground on the leader into the stretch but wasn't quite good
enough while all out. BLUES ROAR vied for the early lead but was out sprinted to the turn, chased the leader into the lane but lacked the kick that was
required and settled for show. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY allowed to settle early, was under urging leaving the final turn then passed a tiring rival late stretch.
COPPER FOX sat in striking distance outside, chased then weakened. PORT PROTECTION lacked a serious bid. SMART FIX trailed the field and lacked a
bid. MISS HESI outrun throughout.

Footnotes
BEAR FABULOUS SON settled in striking position, raced four wide through the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, rallied determinedly through
stretch and held sway. GO WILD saved ground in the early stages along rail, gained closer order and closed determinedly getting up for place. BOLSANO
settled early mid pack, took closer order leaving the backstretch, circled into the lane, rallied determinedly outside under steady urging then surged in the
final yards and was narrowly denied for place honors. RED WINGS contested the early pace into the backstretch, dueled outside of THE HYBRID into the
far turn, disposed to inside rival but was unable to contain rivals late and weakened. THE HYBRID contended the early pace, prompted action inside of RED
WINGS at the three eighths marker, was unable to move on with rival and yielded late. CASH REWARD stalked the pacesetters from the three path through
the backstretch, raced in traffic into the lane then came up empty in the drive. THIN LINE raced wide through the opening turn then quickly moved into
contending position under restraint, raced five to six wide through the backstretch and chased to no avail. WATCH ME STRUT offered little. NEVER
EVEREVER settled early, lodged bid into the final turn and failed to menace.
