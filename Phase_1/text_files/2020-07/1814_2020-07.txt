Footnotes
DOUBLETURBO broke readily, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin racing to the turn, shifted out dispatching a rival racing into upper
stretch and gamely maintained the advantage between foes to the end under firm right handed pressure. MAY WE ALL tracked off the first flight while
angling inside, bid along the rail racing into upper stretch, couldn't gain even terms with the winner while contesting the issue to the end but edged a rival
narrowly for the place honors. GATITO tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, swung out nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to
close the gap to the end while being just outnodded for second. BEVOLUTION settled along the inside early and continued evenly into the stretch. SEEK N
JUSTICE, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. Race times omitted pending review.

Footnotes
HENRY O'HENRY broke sharply, sped clear along the inside to open a comfortable advantage racing into the turn, then held sway through the lane while
being kept to firm left handed encouragement. WHATDOYATHINK ducked out at the start crossing the path of WORN A BIT, was quickly righted, then
angled inside pursuing the pacesetter in tandem with a rival racing to the turn, lost some position nearing the lane, shifted three wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with a steady effort to secure the place honors in late stages. AZUSA ST. tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the
turn, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. MY EASY CASH tracked off the second flight inside a rival
racing to the turn, saved ground into the lane and continued evenly in the stretch. WORN A BIT, bothered at the start, quickly recovered, then was urged
pursuing the pacesetter outside a rival racing to the turn, gained a clear second nearing upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum in late stages.
TWISTED MAGIC settled into stride off the inside early but failed to menace. BANK ON ME dropped out early.

Footnotes
UNLEASH THE BEAST broke sharply, sprinted clear of the field while angling inwards to set the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, turned back a
challenge from BOBBY BABY after a half to open a clear advantage racing to upper stretch and maintained the advantage to the end under firm right
handed pressure. The latter, pulling hard against restraint in early stages tracking just off the second flight to the first turn, angled to the rail entering tthe
backstretch, advanced inside foes to prompt the pacesetter after a half, was rated momentarily nearing the turn avoiding close quarters ,switched outside
the leader nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. GATO GUAPO switched just off the rail tracking just off the pacesetter between
foes in second flight, was fanned three wide into the lane while being urged to advance but proved no match for the top two. THETRASHMANSCOMING,
reserved last to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into the lane to improve position late. CHRIS AND DAVE, urged to a forward placing between
foes tracking the pacesetter in second flight to the far turn, faded nearing upper stretch. TOUR DE FORCE, caught four wide while prompted to terms with
the second flight racing to the backstretch, faded after a half. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE, caught five wide racing through the first turn tracking just off the
second flight, retreated early.

Footnotes
DIXIE BLUES was urged inside a rival from the outset disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, shook clear leaving the midway point
of the far turn and held sway to the end under firm encouragement. TALENT AND TRICKS angled to the inside early tracking just off the second flight, made
steady progress gaining position inside foes to the lane, shifted outside the winner in the closing stages while continuing in pursuit but proved only second
best. GOPHER GOLD angled inwards to track just off the off second flight in early stages, saved ground through the far turn to the lane and gained position
to the end while earning a share. IMA HARLEY TOO, caught four wide between foes racing through the first turn while prompted to a contending position
tracking just off the first flight, was urged to lodge a brief, three wide bid on the far turn but lacked the needed closing kick. TEKELA'S GLORY threw his
head at the start while hopping a bit, settled off the second flight, switched outside foes nearing the far turn to race four, then five wide to the lane and
continued evenly late. DERBYS MONEYMAKER, urged to a forward placing three deep between foes racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight to
the far turn and gave way into the lane. YOU SAY SO, urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the second bend, gave way leaving the midway
point of the far turn. SAISON raced three deep between just off the second flight to the backstretch, continued between foes to the second bend but offered
no rally. SON OF SO, firmly rated near the inside in the opening three furlongs, never gained contention. BREEZE E PRADO, caught five wide racing into
the first turn, tracked off the second flight outside foes but faded early.

Footnotes
DON'S FINAL FINAL sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, turned
back a challenge from WHISKYFORBREAKFAST racing through the far turn to regain a clear advantage racing past midstretch and kicked away under firm
encouragement. The latter was prompted to a forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch, shifted in entering the far turn while moving to press the
issue outside the winner to upper stretch but proved no match in the closing stages while drifting about. CIAK tracked just off the pacesetter near the inside,
then between foes racing to the far turn, had no closing bid and altered course avoiding close quarters in the closing stages. OH LARRY tracked off the
second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while being fanned four wide into the lane and finished evenly late. SUMMERTIMER
tracked the leaders from out of striking distance off the inside in the opening half and lacked a closing response. SIR ZEBO, off slowly, settled well off the
field to the backstretch, switched outside foes after a half but proved no threat. VOOMERANG, a step slow into stride, settled off the inside and failed to
menace.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA LUCKY broke readily, angled to the inside setting the pace on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, held sway under pressure racing into
the stretch and held AUBEY RIDGE to the end under brisk handling. The latter tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch,
advanced to contention along the rail racing into upper stretch, switched outside the winner in late stages and was making solid progress late. OFF THE
MEDS tracked the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance into the lane but continued evenly between foes in late
stages. OMEN OF CHANGE, reserved along the inside off the second flight in the opening half, shifted out racing into upper stretch, then split foes
midstretch while finding his best stride late. WHERE'S JORDAN settled between foes racing to the backstretch, swung out four, then five wide racing into
the lane and displayed some late interest to improve position. WHERE'S OLIVER settled last to the backstretch, was fanned six wide racing into the stretch
and gained some position late while making no real impression. GOLDEN SCEPTOR, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter to the
far turn, shifted three wide racing into the lane while being prompted to advance but had no rally. HEAT FLASH tracked just off the second flight outside foes
in the opening half, angled four wide racing into the stretch making some brief progress but proved empty in the drive. PINE GROVE ROAD broke
awkwardly, then was caught wide racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. DAZZL'N MISCHIEF, pulling between foes against restraint tracking just
off the second flight, retreated between foes early.

MOMENT OF MAGIC, off a step behind the leaders, was urged between foes, then along the inside to gain terms with the pacesetter prompting that foe
along the rail into the turn, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch, kicked clear entering the lane and was kept to brisk encouragement. SIOUX VALLEY
tracked just off the first flight in the opening stages, was prompted to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late.
ROW THE BOAT settled outside foes in early stages, swung six wide entering the lane and found his best stride late to prevail for a share on the wire.
PHANTOM THREEONINE settled well off the second flight near the inside racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail entering upper stretch and was
making progress to late stages while just outkicked for a share. PURPLE MONSTER, unhurried along the inside dropping off the second flight racing to the
turn, angled out three wide entering the stretch, was caught in tight quarters nearing the furlong marker and lacked the needed final response. CIRCLE ME
BERT ducked out at the start, was urged between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. NOTTE
OSCURA tracked off the second flight outside foes in early stages, made brief progress four four wide on the turn but proved empty in the drive. GOTTA LIL
CAPTAIN, shut off, then steadied at the start, dropped out last and failed to menace thereafter. RAJA'S APPEAL, fractious in the gate before the start, made
brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside but gave way racing into the turn. CAPTAIN OF SUMMER, urged three wide prompting the pace in the opening
quarter, gave way early.

Footnotes
MISS PERFECTA broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, dictated the pace in hand on a comfortable advantage to upper stretch and held sway to the end
under firm hand urging. SUPERSTAR BEA tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight to the far turn, shifted out racing into the lane but
couldn't gain terms with the winner while prevailing for the place honors. APPEALING AUDREY, reserved last to the backstretch, angled to the inside,
saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch and continued with interest while being just outkicked for second. TIZ LITTLE BULL tracked off the second
flight between foes to the far turn and continued evenly along the inside into the lane. STORMY MUSIC, reserved well off the leaders to the backstretch,
advanced four, then five wide racing into the lane and finished evenly late. APPLE DAPPLE tracked the leaders three deep off the second flight in the
opening half, swung four wide racing into upper stretch but had no late kick. BEE BIT, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the far turn,
gave way between foes into the lane. AFTER RED SUN angled to the inside early tracking just behind the second flight, switched out nearing upper stretch
to gain some position between foes but was shut off then steadied racing past midstretch losing all momentum.
