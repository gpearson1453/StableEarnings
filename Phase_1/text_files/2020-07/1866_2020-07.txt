Footnotes
FIRE TIGAR took over at the rail into the opening turn and rated the pace, dug in to the challenge of the runner-up past the five sixteenths pole, put that one
away leaving the eighth and was steadily handled to hold on well. DANZ A REBEL saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
dueled at even terms two deep through the far turn but dropped back past past the eighth pole and had to settle for second. BIZ NASTY saved ground well
back from early contention then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path of the far turn and was along for third later yards. TOP HAT
TREASON stalked the early pace three wide, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. NEW BEGINNING stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail and showed little further. V FOR VIOLENCE saved ground well off the pace. ACCESS TO DENIS settled back off the rail then eased out into the
backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
CUBIC SOUND settled back off the rail then started a steady bid leaving the three eighths pole, took aim in the three path nearing the head of the lane and
dug in from there to take the nod at the wire. NAZCA MYSTERY bobbled a bit after the start then moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced with a clear advantage nearest the rail through the far turn, was steadily encouraged down the lane then nipped
under the wire. SLEW THE TURN raced off the pace inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly. KITE
SURFER rated just off the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. LIL
MR MATT saved ground off the early pace, came through the far turn about the three path and never factored. TAMAQUA settled off the pace about the
three path then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, but, faded through the far turn. CHESTNUT LIME showed little response from the two
and three paths.

Footnotes
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled just off the pace in the four path then picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms three
wide midway on the far turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn but dug in determinedly and raced clear under the wire. CANDY MAN ONE rated a short lead
inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at even terms nearest the rail midway on the far turn and continued a close factor to
deep stretch before relenting. FEAR THE LATI settled off the pace toward the inside and was boxed in past the five sixteenths pole, angled out with a bid
toward the quarter pole, left the far turn five wide and finished evenly. DEPUTY JAMES tapered in to stalk the pace two deep and challenged nearing the
three eighths pole, dueled between horses into the far turn but dropped back toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. BRUTUS BRAE stumbled at
the break and settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. ROAD
TO DUBAI raced well back early and never factored. BROTHER DAN was through after a half mile. STERLING CANYON saved ground.

Footnotes
RELENTLESS STRIKE took quick control and rated the pace inside, was pressured into the far turn then steadily handled to widen. CHERUBIM rounded
the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, took over second in the vicinity of the eighth pole but was no match down the lane. A POWERFUL TALE rounded the first turn in the five path and
settled off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in range to the quarter pole but dropped back through the far turn and flattened stride down
the lane. ONCE MORE EH saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and showed little more.
MACANAO settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride in the four path of the far turn. THE IRON
BANK raced well back and outside leaving the first turn and showed little response. GOODBYESEEULATER became edgy in the gate and was not a factor.
THE PREDICTOR stalked the early pace two deep but dropped back into the first turn and showed little response after a half mile.

Footnotes
ETERNAL HEART took the lead between horses leaving the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the turn at even terms while
nearest the rail, drew clear past the eighth pole and held on well. MY EMMALLY was hustled along with a brief early lead then pressured the pace past the
seven sixteenths pole, dueled at even terms two deep on the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn and finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner.
WINDSOR'S CHAMPION pressured the pace from the inside, steadied at the heels of Eternal Heart in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, left the turn
about the five path and finished well while gaining on the runner-up. MISS WAVE broke through the gate prior the start then picked up the chase toward mid
track, rounded the turn about the three path and finished evenly. QUITE SUGGESTIVE gave chase toward mid track, rounded the turn at the rail and
showed little more. MASTERDANCER chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little more. SPUNKY ALI CAT
gave chase from the inside and weakened leaving the turn.

Footnotes
GALLINELLA stalked the pace inside then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, had aim in the three path nearing the end of the far turn, took the lead just
inside the eighth pole, raced clear past the sixteenth and widened later yards. OCEAN LILLY stalked the pace from the four path and challenged nearing the
three eighths pole, moved to even terms leaving the five sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn but was caught just inside the eighth pole and
relented the final sixteenth. NURSE TOMPKINS stalked the pace two deep, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then
dug in down the lane to take the nod for third at the wire. COOL MO bobbled leaving the gate and settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid
toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then dueled through the stretch while missing the nod for third. LONGSTORYLUCY settled off
the pace and off the rail, bid past the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and passed some rivals in an even finish. SO RED THE
ROSE stalked the earlier pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride on the far turn. UNCUT
angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met at even terms leaving the five sixteenths but dropped
back midway on the far turn and weakened the final sixteenth. WHIZ PASS and SHE'S RIGHT were not factors.

far turn and was steadily handled to mid-stretch before being taken in hand. GOTHAM NEWS settled back off the rail then bid toward the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn in the four path but couldn't improve further. HOBE SOUND settled back about the three path then bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened a distant third. LASER LOOP raced well back off the rail and left the second turn outside, bid
mildly through the backstretch, came through the far turn in the five and six paths and passed rivals in the lane. MEILLEUR rated a long lead inside, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail at the quarter pole then weakened. BACOLI rated just off the early pace about the three
path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then weakened losing ground on the far turn. CATAUGA COUNTY never factored. COMPROMISO
was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
WINDSOR CALLING angled to the inside to set a pressured pace just off the rail, came in a path leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage nearest the rail rounding the turn but recovered the edge at the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on. SYNERGY UNBRIDLED
angled in leaving the chute then angled out to give chase, came through the turn about the four path, was bumped off stride mid-stretch but quickly
recovered to finish well and was gaining on the winner. FIREBIRD gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, was
bumped outward and into Synergy Unbridled mid-stretch and finished well to gain third the final strides. KULANI chased the leaders through the backstretch
and rounded the turn off the rail, angled out past the eighth pole and made contact with Firebird mid-stretch then showed no further effort. CHRIS'
CHEROKEEBOP pressured the pace from the three and four paths, contested the edge two deep on the turn, gave up the advantage at the eighth pole
then flattened out the final sixteenth. FIT BUT FAT was forced in and steadied leaving the chute then angled out to give chase, raced in the seven path of
the turn and showed little more. GATTOSING gave chase toward mid track, came through the turn in the four path then weakened. SAMADI BLUE angled
to the outside to give chase, raced in the four and five paths of the turn and was not a factor. COCONUT MAN gave early chase then weakened in the six
path of the turn. ORIOLES MAGIC leapt from the gate then angled to the inside to give chase, was shut off and roughed at the heels of Windsor Calling in
the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the turn. After posting the inquiry, the stewards made no change. Per Stewards ruling # 46,
Windsor Calling has been disqualified from earnings.
