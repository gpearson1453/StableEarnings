Footnotes
PRE HEAT broke with the field, fell back off the issue up the backstretch while outside, advanced into a forward position while four wide through the turn,
saw that progress stall by midstretch, late push while continuing outside, up final strides. MACHO ROCCO closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch
in the two path, moved to challenge and vied between rivals through the turn, showed the way past the furlong marker, continued to lead late, could not
contain the winner while lasting for the place. NEWYORK GIANT fell back off the issue early, moved closer while three wide and between horses in the turn,
pressed the runner up past the furlong marker, could not get to that one late or match the winner in lacking a late punch. SEELEY in the second flight off the
inside, carried out wide by a rival bearing out late in the turn, set down for the drive, displayed some late interest to be closing the gap on the first flight at the
wire. LEO DEL REO last to leave, trailed, picked off a couple of faltering rivals in the drive while lacking a serious bid. KING'S PRAYER worked clear before
a quarter, narrowly showed the way through the turn closest to the inside, gave way when headed in the drive. CASTLEMAN forwardly placed early along
the inside, bore out through the turn, jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO
STAND.

Footnotes
BIG GUY IAN moved up out of the chute to vie for the lead, narrowly showed the way into and through the turn, headed nearing the furlong marker from the
outside, found more late to prevail in game fashion. FIRE BLASTER moved out to stalk the two leaders in the three path up the backstretch, advanced and
challenged on the outside turning for home, drifted out slightly while putting a head in front nearing the furlong grounds, outkicked in the late going, lasted for
the place. RELEASE THE BEAST lacked speed while saving ground, continued back through the turn, made a late run up the inside to be getting to the top
two late. KING OF THE TESTO also lacked speed, raced in the two path through the turn, set down for the drive, displayed some belated interest to also be
closing the gap late, not enough for the show. MASTERLY broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, relinquished the advantage to the winner
before a quarter, pressed that one into and through the turn then gave way at the head of the lane. RUSTON VOW last to leave, trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
TREYS MIDNITE MOON outrun in the early going, raced in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, moved out and advanced on the leaders three
wide in the final turn, put a head in front past the furlong pole and drove strongly clear. BIG BOY DAVE REX closest to the early leader, moved up to duel
outside that one after a half, continued on equal terms through the second turn, held a slight advantage over that same rival upper straight, proved no match
for the winner, held sway for the second spot late. KILLEEN broke alertly, fell back off the issue up front, saved ground through the second bend, angled out
for the drive, staged a mild rally to be narrowly up for the show late. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT moved up to be clear into the first turn, dueled the middle half
mile, continued in contention upper stretch then faltered in the final furlong to lose the show in the final strides. LUCKY ANDY within striking distance while
racing out in the course, came up empty when called on for the drive. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY lacked early foot, continued to trail after a half, failed to muster
a rally in the stretch run. ATLANTIC RULER last away, continued back, five wide into the stretch, remained back.

Footnotes
SUCH prompted the pace off the inside, asked along after falling back a bit off the leader turn, three wide into the lane, long drive, fully extended to grind out
the win late. HERE COMES HOMER in the main body while well out in the strip up the backstretch,continued five wide through the turn, crept closer when
set down for the drive, not enough late while remaining far out in the track. SMOKIN' TRUTH moved up to set the pace out of the chute, shook clear in the
turn off the inside, drifted out while continuing to show the way stretch, gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. CLASSIC GREELEY back off the early
pace, quickly dropped to the in side once on the main track, saved ground while moving closer in the turn, flattened out in the drive and finished up evenly to
lose the show late. COOL INDIVIDUAL last away, lacked speed, improved position while four wide into the lane, did not pose a serious threat. MIKEY'S
MOUSE broke back, improved into the lane then failed to sustain that advance in the final furlong. COSTA ALOT raced back and was never a threat.
WHISKEY'S GONE forwardly place in the early going, began a steady fade before a half. CACHITO settled off the early pace, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
COSTA SUGAR settled in midpack for a half, advanced and challenged on the outside and four into the lane, vied past the furlong marker, proved best late
in a determined effort. KEHRON'S CREED in the second flight while in the two path, dropped inside turning for home, rail bid entering the stretch, narrowly
showed the way past the furlong marker then could not match strides with the winner late. HARLANS WARRIOR pressed the issue early, dueled through
the turn closest to but not on the inside, allowed the runner up the rail upper stretch, vied past the furlong marker then weakened from between the top two
late, saved the show. ALOHA KAI lacked speed while out in the strip, came five wide out of the turn, improved position with some late interest while widest
of all at the wire. MISS GURETTA broke back, lacked speed off the inside, improved position through the stretch. SHE SANG DIXIE forwardly placed while
off the rail, had little left for the drive. CAT'S ETERNALFLAME showed the way early, dueled through the turn in the three path, gave way. BECCA'S
WHISPER off a step slow, remained back. D'FREAK NASTY tired while racing off the inside. SPANISH ARCH faded while four wide.

Footnotes
RAISON MARTINI broke with the leaders stalked the pace in the two path, advanced and took over turning for home, edged clear and maintained a daylight
advantage the final furlong while being kept to pressure. SANDBAGGER AL settled in mid pack while off the inside, crept closer in the three path late in the
final turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one late, edged away for the place. SMOOTH CURRENT broke alertly, clear
past the wire the first time, continued to set the pace the middle half while inside, briefly responded when challenged by the winner exiting the final turn,
could not match that one to the wire nor contain the runner up, saved the show. MY TY FU PEG went evenly paced throughout along the inside in lacking a
closing response. SAVING ARGUMENT last to leave, trailed early, moved out, came four wide into the stretch, improved position by picking off some tiring
rivals. LAST NITE OUT broke back, lacked speed, improved a bit into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. CUSTOM READY was never dangerous in
remaining back. CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE forwardly placed in the early going, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
MAW MAW'S SOPHIA broke in, vied onto the main track closest to the inside, worked clear into the turn, breather around the bend, maintained a
comfortable advantage to the wire while kept to task. GUILTY CONFESSION vied early outside the winner and between rivals, fell back off the issue
through the turn, was three wide out of the turn, came again for the place in the drive, no real threat to the winner. GET DIRECTIONS with the early pace
outside, raced in the second flight in the two path through the turn, came up empty for the drive to finish up evenly and preserve the show. SUPER LEGS
lacked speed, moved outside, came four wide into the lane, improved slightly while not a serious threat. LADY CARLOS pushed inward then came in further
to be off slowly, moved up steadily to race in mid pack before a quarter, continued one paced in lacking a closing response. KORAT QUEEN with the pace
three wide and between rivals early, in the second flight through the turn, backed up in the drive. REASON TO WALTZ remained always back. MIRACLE
SWEEP was also always outrun.

Footnotes
O'L RED broke alertly, narrowly set the pace inside, shrugged off closest pursuer when straightened for home, maintained a comfortable advantage to the
wire in a sharp effort. STATE TREASURER broke slowly to race back early, same some ground through the turn, rallied through traffic in the stretch,
finished willingly to be up late for the place. TOUGH CHARLIE broke in good order, pressed the winner from the outside, proved no match for that one in the
drive, chased past the furlong marker, caught late for the place, narrowly saved the show while between horses at the wire. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN in the
second flight for six furlongs inside, steered well wide for the drive, finished with some interest while not enough for the runner up spot. BIG EM C lacked
early foot, saved ground turn, in some traffic along the rail late in the turn, got through to improve upper stretch, flattened out to also not have enough for the
second spot late. FUTURE RULER settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. SMOOTH COLLIERY in the
main group while five wide through much of the turn, also failed to produce a rally.

Footnotes
IMDUSTY broke back, lacked early foot, continued to track the first flight into the stretch, switched to the far outside. AMAZING AMERICAN closest to the
leader off the inside, continued to pursue that one through the turn, engaged that same rival when straightened for home, put a head in front past the furlong
marker but could not contain the winner late in a solid try. TRAELEE in the second group off the inside, closer in the three path turning for home, vied past
the furlong marker then hung in the late going, saved the show. RARE STRAIN broke well, settled off the pace outside, went evenly in lacking a closing
response. RAGING MOON sprinted clear soon after the start, continued to show the way by daylight early turn, vied into the stretch closest to the inside
then gave way the final furlong when headed. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT lacked speed, failed to make an impact toward the inside. LIL BOYS IN TOWN off a step
slow, finished well back. S ON MY CHEST refused at the start.FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS
ALLOWED TO STAND.
