SHUTUPN'KISSME vied two wide early, drew clear and angled in approaching the turn, drew off around the bend and held well clear under a drive.
THELADYISTRUE was off a step slow, made progress down the backstretch, moved into a clear second two wide around the turn and finished willingly
while unable to threaten the winner. GOT YOUR NUMBER set the early pace inside of the winner, steadied entering the turn and faded inside. DRIVEN TO
SUCCEED saved ground and failed to menace. VACATION SECRET chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. VICTORY ROYALE was outrun
inside.

Footnotes
DON'T SPIN ME stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, seized command leaving the half-mile pole, drew clear down the backstretch, remained
well clear at the rail rounding the far turn and held sway under a drive. NOT A SECRET lacked early speed while racing three wide, advanced four wide
around the far turn and rallied widest. KENTUCKY DANCER saved ground off the early pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, continued on the left
lead in the lane and was one-paced late. SAINTE THERESE settled off the early pace three wide, moved into contention outside down the backstretch,
chased the winner two wide around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. SCOREEARLYANDOFTEN was up close two wide early then steadily
faded. GIRL DRAMA vied two wide around the first turn but was through early. SCARLETT'S RANSOM had speed inside and stopped after a quarter.

Footnotes
KATALIMA settled off the early pace two wide, angled out on the backstretch, made some progress around the far turn, lost momentum near the
three-sixteenths pole, angled four wide soon after, closed outside and was up in the final strides. MAKIN US LOOK GOOD disputed the early pace between
rivals, took command inside a foe near the three-eighths pole, drew off around the far turn, held clear to deep stretch but succumbed late. TAPTAP was
forced out entering the first turn but quickly angled down into the two path off the pace, advanced three wide around the far turn, loomed in upper stretch but
flattened out. HOW IS SHE raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied belatedly. QUINCYS WAY failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
MARYLEE played no factor while racing two and three wide. DANCE FOR A DIME chased the pace inside and faded. BASKET GIRL had the saddle slip
forward, became quite rank and bulled through horses entering the first turn, rushed up three wide around that bend to take the lead late on the turn, led to
the three-eighths pole, was hard to handle rounding the far turn and was eased in the lane.

eighth pole, bumped with the winner nearing the sixteenth pole and was outgamed late. MIGHTY BOP was bumped at the start, settled off the pace two

ALPINE MOON stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in the three path near the quarter pole, drew off around the turn and widened while kept in hand
and well away from the loose horse in the lane. TALKBACK saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide near the three-sixteenths pole, continued on the left
lead in the lane and rallied for the place. WEDDING DAY KITTEN saved ground well off the pace and was along for the show. SHE'S A LIL PISTIL chased
the pace two wide and came up empty. HATTITUDE set the pace in the two path and tired around the far turn. JEAN GREY checked entering the first turn,
raced two and three wide and never threatened. CAT CAT'SHORSEPLAY raced off the pace three wide and was through after a half. WON LIL INDIAN
saved ground and made little impact. TAP TOBOGGAN was outrun two wide. SHANNA'S GRAY lost the rider at the start, galloped merrily along in front of
the field at the rail through almost all of the race, causing the race to be HAND TIMED.

DECOUPAGE set a clear pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. AMELIA BEDELIA stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch to
take dead aim but could only gain slightly. SHERWOOD LADY settled off the pace while racing three wide, made a three deep bid around the far turn but
flattened out a bit in the lane. PUNK ROCK PRINCESS lacked early speed while saving ground, briefly left the rail to pass a rival midway around the far
turn, made good progress around that bend but flattened out in the stretch. B'S WILD CORK failed to menace while racing two wide. C R CASE'S LEGACY
never threatened while racing three wide. AUSSIE GOLD stalked the winner two wide and tired after a half. MATTYICE was pinched back at the break,
raced three wide and made little impact. ANAZARA was rank early, raced two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
BARKER LANE lacked early speed outside, angled to the rail nearing the three-sixteenths pole, made progress inside, tipped out in upper stretch, split rivals
leaving the sixteenth and was up and clear late. NO SUGAR NO CREAM set a clear pace along the rail, held clear past the sixteenth pole, was
overpowered by the winner in the late yards but lasted for the place. LA DUQUESA prompted the pace two wide, had dead aim outside but hung late. LADY
TOSCANOVA chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. HIDE saved ground well back and rallied belatedly inside. OUR REVEILLE was
devoid of speed, raced four wide and rallied belatedly. MOHAWK MISS failed to menace while racing three wide. LOVE YOU GOODBYE had early speed
between rivals then faded inside. MANNA FROM HANNAH broke slowly, raced two wide and never threatened. INFLIGHT was outrun inside.
