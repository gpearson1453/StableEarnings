Footnotes
ONE FAT KAT accelerated to the early lead, set the pace and eagerly pulled away through the stretch while ridden out. PETTICOATSNPISTOLS lacked
speed, swung wide in mid stretch and passed tired horses. POLISHED GAL had her heels clipped by HENDAYA leaving the backstretch, had a mild move
outside horses in mid stretch and gave way in the drive. PAISLEY SINGING , carried out by HENDAYA leaving the starting gate, circled the turn, was
fanned four deep turning for home and weakened. VAUNT chased the pace outside the winner around the turn and gave way in the drive. BLUE SKY
VENEZUELA saved ground around the turn and gave way. ANNIE BOO BOO jumped over the fallen horse and rider leaving the backstretch and was eased
late. HENDAYA bore out leaving the starting gate, was very eager to go early, ran into traffic leaving the backstretch where she clipped heels and fell.
HENDAYA got up and jogged off the turf course. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the spill but no action was take. PER RULING FROM THE
MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, ONE FAT KAT WAS DISQUALIFIED DUE TO INELIGIBLITY.

Footnotes
SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE , in hand stalking the leader, eased out mid turn, came four wide for the drive, closed under left handed pressure, took over just past
mid stretch and edged away in the final sixteenth. LADY ROZINA broke a step slow, advanced four wide outside horses heading towards the half mile
marker, dropped in around the turn to give chase, kept on grinding through the final furlong and just up for the place. CASH REGISTER was nudged up
between foes soon after the start and cleared within the opening sixteenth, set the pace two to three wide, was taken on nearing the eighth pole and gave
way grudgingly. PETION LASS broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, eased out near the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. GOBI , off
the pace, raced three to four wide past the quarter pole and lacked a bid. CASE DISMISSED eased back a bit nearing the half mile pole, chased outside a
rival mid turn, angled wider and faded.

Footnotes
OUTSIDE THE BOX came out a bit at the break and brushed with GONE HOME, corrected and edged up inside under rating, eased out mid turn, split rivals
after a half mile, shifted out and rallied between runners nearing mid stretch, gained a command with about a sixteenth remaining and held firm under a
drive. INSIDE RISK , four wide early, ranged up three wide mid turn to take aim on the dueling leaders, angled out a bit wider into the lane, had the winner
rally to the inside of him past mid stretch but kept on gamely. GONE HOME , brushed at the break, was gunned up between rivals soon after and took
command, dueled to the inside of HONOR RUN from the far turn to mid stretch then gave way. HONOR RUN , away to a brief early lead, was headed from
the inside by GONE HOME, dueled outside that one around the turn, battled back to a slim advantage near the three sixteenths, kept up the fight past the
furlong grounds then faded late. NO FOOLING DUDE had speed inside then was rated back off the leaders, dropped further back past the five sixteenths,
eased out near the sixteenth pole, was giving effort but failed to make an impact. FIVE CARD DRAW , between rivals stalking the early pace, came four
wide for the drive but lacked a bid. ONCE IN A LIFETIME , off the rail giving early pursuit, faded around the turn. IRISHTOWN broke outward, never
reached serious contention while off the rail then retreated through the drive.

Footnotes
WAR STROLL , steadied in tight quarters along the rail leaving the backstretch, angled out on the turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, closed
determinedly outside horses and was up late. HE'S ONE WILD DUDE , three wide on the turn, worked between horses in the stretch, angled in near the
sixteenth pole and finished gamely. MIDWEST JUSTICE showed speed along the rail and weakened late. COLONEL SHARP stalked the pace, circled the
turn three wide, loomed a serious challenger in mid stretch then weakened. MORE ABUNDANCE lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and
was not a menace. FLY E DUBAI , four wide on the turn, was not a factor. TRICKY LION was no factor. I AIN'T NEVER lacked speed, swung to the nine
path near the eighth pole and finished with interest. BATTLEBUS chased the pace outside MIDWEST JUSTICE and gave way. FORMAN THE FOREMAN
was a brief factor down the backstretch. GREELY IS BACK gave way along the inner rail.

Footnotes
WEEKEND DELIGHT settled in the clear nearing the far turn while within range, angled four wide gaining momentum into the stretch, closed determinedly
under left handed rousing, forged to command between rivals late and prevailed. ESTHER'S FORTUNE vied inside a pair of foes into the first turn, cleared
briefly before being rejoined by SEVILLA SANGRIA near the five eighths, sparred under rating, moved back clear past the five sixteenths, opened up after
being set down in upper stretch, drifted a bit, dug in when confronted in deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. MELISANDE , in hand two to three wide
early on, moved up leaving the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch and closed willingly. WITTY BANTER lacked speed while saving some ground early
on, raced three wide leaving the far turn, dropped in near the stretch, came back out past mid stretch but could only muster up a mild late response. SEA
STORY , unhurried early, raced three wide into the lane, angled out and kept on with some mild interest. MAYAN QUEEN was sent up outside rivals into the
first turn, prompted the pace three deep, came under a ride pursuing the leaders past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. LADY
FOX settled off the pace while towards the inside, raced between runners leaving the far turn, dropped back in and came up empty. SEVILLA SANGRIA , a
bit keen early, bid between foes near the five eighths, disputed the issue outside ESTHER'S FORTUNE to the five sixteenths, could not match strides
heading towards the stretch then tired. SUDDENLYLASTSUMMER , well placed inside, lacked a kick leaving the three eighths and retreated. CAR LADY
was outrun.

Footnotes
SMOKIN HOT FACTOR , two wide between horses entering the turn, eased out a bit turning for home, secured command outside THE FORTY FACTOR
approaching the eighth pole then drew clear. THE FORTY FACTOR , clear soon after the start, angled in, set the pace slightly off the rail and finished
willingly after losing the lead. EKATI WILDCAT , steadied in narrow quarters along the rail entering the turn, angled out on the bend and closed nicely
between horses. IWISHIWASPECIAL , four deep on the turn, failed to menace. SWING STEP , three wide around the turn, drifted out near the sixteenth
pole and gave way. SEBRAY hugged the rail on the turn, angled out, raced between horses in upper stretch and was not a factor. I IDOLIZE YOU briefly
chased the pace then dropped back.

Footnotes
FIYA broke sharply, disputed the pace to the inside of BROOKS ROBINSON while under rating, spurted clear under some hand coaxing in upper stretch,
came under a drive nearing the sixteenth marker and held firm. MATTA , well placed stalking the dueling leaders, saved some ground around the turn,
eased out a bit into the lane, continued willingly and was clearly second best. GODLOVESASINNER settled in mid pack, eased out a bit and waited briefly
into the lane, found room to advance between runners, kept on with interest and saved the show. EASY RIVER hopped at the break then was bumped and
pinched back, dropped in towards the rail early and settled, was steered well out in the course for the final furlong and finished willingly. JOSEPH settled off
the pace, swung eight wide for the drive and had a mild run. ABUELO PAPS , between runners early, chased around the turn but lacked a solid bid.
DAYSTRIKE steadied when in close saving ground into the turn, remained inside after regrouping but failed to seriously menace. CAREY TIMES , three
wide early, angled five wide into the stretch but failed to make an impact. WHISKEY AND YOU , four to six wide, was not a threat. BROOKS ROBINSON ,
away alertly, contested the pace outside the winner, could not match strides in upper stretch then faltered through the final furlong. GIRLS LOVE ME ,
bumped at the break, raced off the pace, angled four wide for the drive but was not a threat. D C FIREMAN , three deep with pursuit past the half mile pole,
faltered.

Footnotes
SAINTLY SAMURAI bobbled at the break, stalked the duel, was taken to the four path turning for home, closed outside the leader and was up in deep
stretch. READY AND RICH disputed the pace outside RUSSELDOINGTHINGS, sprinted clear in mid stretch and weakened late. MY FRIENDS BEER ,
reserved well off the duel, floated to the five path turning for home and had a slight rally outside foes. SPARTY stalked the duel, circled the turn three wide
and weakened in the drive. COUSIN JIMMY raced in the two path on the turn and in the stretch and failed to be a threat. WELLING lacked speed, failed to
be a factor and was eased. RUSSELDOINGTHINGS hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
LAGOM rated kindly while tracking the pace inside, eased out in upper stretch, closed between rivals near the sixteenth pole, took command late and
prevailed under a drive. ALLERIA , bumped at the break, straightened and went clear early, set the pace towards the rail, turned away some challenges
leaving the far turn, shook back clear, dug in when collared inside the sixteenth marker and kept on gamely. AWESOME JAZZ , jostled at the break, settled
off the pace while saving ground, crept closer into the far turn, angled out soon after, circled four wide to loom into the lane, ranged up outside the top pair
and hung. ROCKSTAR GIRL rated in range in the two path but came up empty in the drive. BELLAMY KNOWS , three wide around both turns, chased into
the stretch then weakened. COLD HEARTED CAT , off the pace while four wide, was carried out by MORAVIAN PRAYER nearing the half mile marker,
recovered and dropped back in some, chased past the five sixteenths but lacked a stretch response. WOLVERETTE prompted the pace outside ALLERIA,
bid to apply more pressure into the far turn, was turned away past the five sixteenths then weakened nearing mid stretch. MORAVIAN PRAYER appeared to
have her rider's saddle slip nearing the backstretch, was taken wide past the five eighths, was pulled up around the final turn and walked off.
