R MARIE ducked in at the start, recovered to gain the lead and held sway in the stretch under steady pressure. A ROYAL ACE prompted the pace along the
rail and stayed on willingly in the stretch. TA bothered at the start, was reserved, entered the stretch three wide and rallied. FIVE QUEENS outpaced early,
was swung four wide for the stretch run and managed a mild bid. NIGHTSTAR showed little.

MONYDONTSPENITSELF outpaced early, commenced her bid on the turn and closed with a rush under energetic handling in the stretch to narrowly
prevail. P C SUSPECT sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was reeled in late. MONDAY CONFESSION chased while three wide and stayed on.
OVERANALYZER stalked the early pace and weakened. LOUD N PROUD never menaced. DUKATI was sluggish at the start and no factor. NATTYTYME
was always outrun.
