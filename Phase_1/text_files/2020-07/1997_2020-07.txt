closer along the rail into the stretch then leveled off. Z J WINS away alertly, set the pace off the rail for a half then gradually weakened. ARTAKSEZ was no
threat. MISTBINDER was no factor. MASCHERATO pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then gave way. QUEENA ESTHER was through after a half.

YOU'RE IN COREY broke in full stride to set all the pace and prevailed under brisk handling. THE FALCON pressured the winner into the stretch, drifted out
to the six path under left handed urging losing ground and finished second best. GUCCISSIMO unhurried early, found his best stride late in the two path.
YESUS STAR was bumped at the start then went evenly. WYATTS WARRIOR failed to menace. CAT'S CURIOSITY bore in badly at the start bumping
rivals then was no factor. TRAP bumped hard start, outrun. DEPUTY OX was forwardly place while under a hard pursuit and folded in the final furlong. GIO
SAMMY had speed into the turn then stopped.

CANDY EXCHANGE prompted the pace two wide past the three furlong marker, made the lead, set the balance of the pace, drifted out under left handed
urging through deep stretch and lasted. TICO THUNDER tracked the leaders near the inside, shifted out past the quarter pole, also drifted out late under left
handed urging and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage in the final stages. SPEEDY MOBILE away alertly, set the pace into the far turn then was
outfinished. BLACKTIEANDTUX was in tight at the start, moved closer three wide midway down the backstretch then failed to sustain that bid. MOBIL AT
LAST failed to menace. BIG OHIO trailed.

PERSEVERING HONOR prompted the pace two wide to the top of the stretch, made the lead then widened through the final furlong to win as much the
best. ONLY ONE BOSS LADY allowed to settle, closed fast on the outside in the six path through the stretch and got up for second.
MYTICKETTOPARADISE bore in at the start, lugged in from there causing NUNS ISLAND to clip heels, set the pace to the top of the stretch and finished
on even terms with ONLY ONE BOSS LADY at the wire. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS was shut off at the start then lacked the needed response. DEB'S ALL OUT
was outrun and lacked racing room along the rail through the stretch. PERFECT DOLL had speed along the inside into the turn then wilted. AIKEN APPLE
collided with the fallen NUNS ISLAND midway between the nine sixteenths pole and five eighths pole, and stumbled unseating her rider. NUNS ISLAND
was squeezed and clipped heels with MYTICKETTOPARADISE between the nine sixteenths pole and five eighths pole, stumbled and unseated her rider.
THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED MYTICKETTOPARADISE FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE
NINE SIXTEENTHS POLE AND PLACED HER SIXTH.
