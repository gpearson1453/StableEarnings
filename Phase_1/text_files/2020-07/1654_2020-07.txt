Footnotes
CHECOTAH bobbled slightly at the start, was brushed soon after, set the pace between foes down the backstretch, drew off around the turn and widened
while kept to task. GROUP TEXT settled off the pace outside, raced four wide around the turn and rallied for the place. SPECIAL RISK had early speed
between rivals, stalked three wide around the turn and was one-paced in the lane. R TRUE SENSATION chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally.
SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE broke slowly, showed some speed inside, dropped back around the turn and lacked a closing bid. UNIQUE HUMOR broke outwardly
and brushed with the winner soon after the start, vied inside of that foe down the backstretch, could not keep pace around the turn and steadied while tiring
near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
BUST ANOTHER stalked the pace between foes down the backstretch, vied outside his stablemate around much of the far turn, cleared nearing the quarter
pole and widened under a drive. ZOMBIE stalked the pace inside, tipped out to bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, was no match for the winner and
held well clear for the place under moderate urging. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE settled off the pace inside, went in the two path around the turn and was
along for the show. THE ITALIAN chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. EQUUS NOVUS set the pace between rivals in the three path down
the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn and tired nearing the lane. MORE FRONT was rank behind a wall of horses down the backstretch, bulled
between foes to get clear run four wide into the turn and lacked any further bids. I GOT THE BRAHMS played no factor while racing four wide.
NINETYEIGHTOCTANE trailed well off the rail.

Footnotes
ATREYU settled off the pace inside, made progress down the backstretch, continued to gain inside around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, burst
clear in upper stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging in midstretch, straightened out under a strong hand ride and just lasted. THE MIGHTY JUDGE
was unhurried inside early, advanced inside into the far turn, swung out nearing the quarter pole, split rivals in upper stretch, closed strongly outside and just
missed. ENGLISH TUDOR set the pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch, drifted out but stayed on well enough to preserve the show. HERO'S
HOPE lagged far back inside and rallied belatedly inside. AFTERBURNER stalked the pace two wide for a half, faded around the turn and finished evenly.
CLOONTIA stalked the pace three wide and tired nearing the lane. UHWARRIE SKY chased the pace two wide between foes around the first turn, had a
four wide run around the far turn and faded through the lane. SOUPER CATCH played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
COMMANDER'S INTENT tracked the pace three wide, steadily gained outside and was up and clear late. SMALL INVASION vied inside, ceded the lead
inside a foe from midway around the turn to upper stretch, re-bid to take charge nearing the eighth pole, led to deep stretch and lasted for the place. FIELD
OFFICER was fractious in the gate, raced of the pace two wide for a half then rallied inside to just miss second. APPRAISED bobbled at the start, raced four
wide off the pace and rallied belatedly. TAPIZAR KING pressed the pace three wide, led around much of the turn to upper stretch and wilted. LIAR failed to
menace while racing five wide. CONFUSION chased the pace two wide and was through after a half. LEADING MAN vied between foes early and retreated.
IM POPPAS FAVORITE was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PRINCESS A'GO GO lagged well back inside, made progress at the rail around the far turn, closed inside and was up and clear late. DON'T FIGHT perched
two wide behind the pace fight in the clear, seized command entering the far turn, drew clear around that bend, held clear to the sixteenth pole and had no
resistance late. PAZ THE WINE settled off the pace while racing two and three wide and rallied for the show. QUEEN OF MUSKOKA stalked the pace, took
the lead near the half-mile pole, was collared not long after, chased inside and weakened. MISS TOM TOM failed to menace while racing three and four
wide. PREMIER JUSTICE bobbled at the break, raced two wide in midpack, had a mild three wide gain around the far turn then faded through the lane. S P
F NINETYNINE played no factor while racing three wide. GLAMOROUS THUNDER set the pace in the two path and was through early.

TRICKLE IN set the pace along the rail, was briefly headed around the far turn, responded well inside, re-cleared in midstretch and held sway under a drive.
DUCHESS OF SUSSEX tracked the pace three wide, finished strongly between rivals and was up late for the place. EMBOSSED stalked the pace from the
rail, tipped out in upper stretch, had a mild rally but was outkicked. TOOLCAT lunged at the start, was keen to advanced between runners early, prompted
the pace two wide, bid around the far turn, briefly led and weakened a bit in the final furlong. AMERICAN GIANT lacked early speed while saving ground,
swung the extreme outside near the three-sixteenths pole and surged widest. CORRECTNESS failed to menace while racing two wide. PURE RHYTHM
was no threat while racing two and three wide. KISS THE GIRL saved ground to no avail.

HUNT ME DOWN settled off the pace while racing three wide, made some progress still three deep around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch,
closed inside and drew clear late. STUCCO dueled inside to upper stretch, drew clear in midstretch but had little left for the winner in the final sixteenth.
EMPTY NESTR vied two wide to upper stretch and weakened. FOURTEEN CARROT stalked the duel in the clear three wide, loomed in upper stretch but
lacked a closing bid. STARRY SKY lagged far back inside, swung four wide near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. THEKIDSBACK played no factor
while racing four wide. SINCERE MAN was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside and faded around the turn. PAYNEFUL chased the pace two wide
and retreated. CSABAWABA stumbled and the lost the rider at the start.

Footnotes
PROJECT WHISKEY prompted the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained command in upper stretch, dug in inside,
brushed with the runner-up late and held firm under left-handed urging. DREAM MARIE settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn,
made progress outside down the backstretch, made a quick four wide bid around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, ceded the
advantage to the winner in upper stretch, vied outside from there, brushed with that foe late and was held off. PRINCESS CADEY saved ground off the early
pace, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole and rallied for the show. PIECE OF MY HEART set a pressured pace along the rail, could not match
strides with the top two from the three-eighths pole, angled out when they cleared in midstretch and stayed on fairly well to save a piece. HOPEFUL
GROWTH tracked the pace three wide and came up empty. COMICAL stalked the pace inside and had no response. QUEEN BRIDGET broke in an
extreme tangle to immediately drop ten lengths behind and never got involved. LONG POINT BEACH pressed pace two wide between rivals and retreated
around the far turn. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and took no action.

Footnotes
GUFO broke a bit awkwardly, raced well off the pace two wide, swung four wide nearing the quarter pole, surged forward when roused left-handed in upper
stretch, seized command leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead under confident handling. PIXELATE settled off the pace two wide, advanced three wide
around the far turn, bid between rivals in midstretch, finished well but was no match for the winner. VANZZY stalked the pace in the three path, took the lead
in upper stretch, was collared inside the eighth pole, could not match strides with the top two but finished willingly to hold the show. TALKING settled off the
pace inside, raced two wide around the far turn, made progress in upper stretch but flattened out. SUNSATION set the pace in the two path and weakened
in the lane. ME AND MR. C played no factor while racing two and three wide. BYE BYE MELVIN stalked the pace inside and came up empty in the lane.

DANCE WITH ME BW set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn and widened under a drive. IRIDESSE prompted the pace three wide, was
no match for the winner, continued on the left lead in the lane and held clear for the place. ROYALLY BRED saved ground off the pace, tipped out near the
quarter pole and was along for the show. MIZZDORA failed to menace while racing two wide. ROYAL MOONLIGHT chased the pace three between foes
and tired. AMYS LITTLE DIVA AA had early speed four wide and faded. CREAMOFTHECREAM MHF was outrun inside.
