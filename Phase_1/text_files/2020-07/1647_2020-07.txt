Footnotes
SITTIN AND THINKIN was outrun to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch then shifted out in upper stretch and closed with a strong run to catch TWO
BEARS late. TWO BEARS set the pace while racing in the two path to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch but could not withstand the winner's charge.
SARAH'S SMIRK pressed TWO BEARS two wide to the stretch, shifted out then lugged out in mid stretch, was corrected but outfinished. COASTAL
STARLITE had no speed, raced four wide to the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive. RAMONCITA LIGHT also had no speed, trailed while
five wide on the turn and was never a factor. PRORIKA got outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. SHE'S IN LUCK was chasing the pace four
wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
CHARGING HOME was chasing to the turn, bid four wide to the stretch then rallied steadily and was along in time. SWEETENER dueled for the lead three
wide, pushed away to mid stretch then could not stall the winner. BRITE TAN contested the pace inside the runnerup, was two wide to the stretch, could not
stay with that one to mid stretch and weakened. ANGRACIA chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then finished evenly in the final furlong. SPIRIT
LAKE had no speed, was four wide on the turn and lacked a closing response. PERFECT MOOD got outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail.
KELLY'S AMBER had no speed and was never a threat. HAZARE was green and lagged to the turn, raced five wide to the stretch then ducked out suddenly
nearing the sixteenth pole and was taken in hand. POWER OF SEVENTEEN chased the leaders early, was caught off heels in traffic at the half mile pole,
checked back, came two wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.
