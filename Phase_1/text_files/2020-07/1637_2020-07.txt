Footnotes
HER GIANT tracked from midpack four wide around the turn, rallied five wide turning for home, and drove past the leader at the sixteenth pole. LADY TO
THE MAX established a loose advantage early on, stayed in the two path around the turn, dug in in upper stretch as GLORIOUS TAPIZAR made a bid,
repelled that foe, but was surpassed by the oncharging HER GIANT in the late stages. GLORIOUS TAPIZAR was off a step slowly and shied at the start,
raced far off of the pace, shifted down from the four path to the rail while rallying around the turn, then shifted back to the three path turning for home to
make a bid for the lead, but hung and was surpassed by an outer foe in the lane. MRS. KIMBERLY K chased the pace while under coaxing, shifted off of the
rail around the turn, came into the lane in the four path between horses, but hung on her left lead and finished evenly. ROSY MAY stalked two wide, shifted
in around the turn, then lacked an inside rally through the lane. MINNIEMOREPROMISES trailed into the turn, took the bend two wide, and failed to make
an impact. AZLYNN'S DREAMER saved ground but was outrun.

Footnotes
NORTHERN CONNECT stalked the leaders two wide from a few lengths off of the early pace, drew clear from an inner foe and shifted inwards around the
bend to make a bid for the lead inside of the leading duo, assumed command from those foes turning for home, then was kept to task through the lane. C
ISLANDSURPRISE vied for the lead inside of INDICATING while staying in the three path, left the rail open for NORTHERN CONNECT around the far turn,
was headed between rivals at the quarter pole, then failed to keep pace with them in upper stretch, but kept on and regained place from her outer tiring foe
in deep stretch. INDICATING vied for the lead outside of C ISLANDSURPRISE while being kept in the four path by that foe, was no match for the inside
rallying NORTHERN CONNECT at the quarter pole, forged place from her inner dueling counterpart turning for home, but weakened through the lane and
was outfinished by that foe for place. URBAN KAT stalked the pace setters from along the inside, but was put to a drive to keep pace into the far turn, failed
to do so at the three furlong pole, then was no factor thereafter.

FED POLICY saved ground far off of the pace advanced behind the leading group into the far turn, waited for running room passing the five sixteenths pole,
swung to the five path at the quarter pole, sustained a rally to make a three wide bid in upper stretch, dueled through the lane, and got up in the final strides.
DOUBLE OAKED tracked from midpack in the two path, made a three wide bid for the lead approaching the quarter pole, forged a lead and held a margin
between horses in upper stretch, then dug in gamely through the lane, but failed to fend off FED POLICY in the late stages. ROLLOVER RISK stalked along
the inside, split the leaders two wide at the quarter pole producing a bid inside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, but was outfinished by those rivals through
the lane. I SAW HER FIRST set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole and faded through the lane. PRINCESS MARYKATE tracked
from midpack in the three path, but failed to keep pace with foes into the far turn. ON STRIKE trailed early and was never involved. PEPPER THEM GIRL
stalked the leader from the outside, vied into the far turn, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole and stopped through the lane.

NICE WORK sped clear from a pair of inner foes at the half mile pole, widened his advantage through the turn, and was driven home through the lane to
hold safely. CADRON FLATS was off a step slowly, tracked from far off of the pace three wide, rallied four wide turning for home, and achieved place in the
final furlong. IMPUNITY was outsprinted early, raced far off of the pace two wide between horses, then offered a mild rally along the inside through the lane.
FIREHORN stalked the loose leader from along the inside, shifted to the two to three path around the turn to inch closer to the leader, but proved no match
for that foe at the quarter pole, held place in upper stretch, but weakened late. KEIGHTLEY vied two wide early on, stalked the loose leader into the turn, but
weakened at the five sixteenths pole. ALEC AND ARTHUR was off a step slow, saved ground while far off of the pace through the turn, but to no avail.
