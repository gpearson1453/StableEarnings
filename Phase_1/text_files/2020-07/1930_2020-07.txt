MISS TWENTY sprinted clear, pulled away into the stretch and drew off readily. LA TOURISTA stalked, was outpaced on the turn and kept on in the stretch.
FLYTA forwardly placed, was checked on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. THATSAWASTEOFWINE chased inside, urged along on the turn, was
steadied when short of room at the five-sixteenths pole and failed to recover. SAMMY'S FLASHBACK was settled while four wide and lacked a rally.
MISTINI was always outrun. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE WAS BOTH A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL INTO AN
INCIDENT ON THE TURN, AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGES TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
NIGHT'S MAGIC forced the pace, surged clear on the turn and drew off in the stretch under a drive. CLINE TIME led early, was headed on the turn, proved
no match, and stayed on. CADEN'S FOXY LADY outrun, commenced her bid on the turn, moved three wide into the stretch and offered a bid. RUBIETTA
BLUES was outpaced early and stayed on in the stretch. KYLIES COLLEGEFUND off slowly, settled well and showed some mild late interest.
TANGALANG never menaced. MANEATER STROLL chased while three wide and tired. LIL GRACEHOPPER retreated.
