Footnotes
SASHAYING SIS set the pace from off the rail in the three path up the backstretch and moving in a path late on the turn while appearing to shorten stride,
was challenged in upper stretch by SAY HELLO TO HEAT then in late stretch by CEES SMOKEN but dug in to hold. CEES SMOKEN settled off the leading
pair, went five wide on the turn, made a bid in late stretch but couldn't get past. SAY HELLO TO HEAT bobbled at the break then was encouraged forward
in pursuit of the eventual winner, went four wide on the turn and made a bid drawing nearly even near the furlong marker but lacked the needed late kick.
WHAT A SURPRISE raced evenly on or just off the rail. PRINCESS JADA shifted in up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, angled five deep
out of that bend and failed to rally. THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU was off the inside going in the two path into the turn and moving out four deep through that
bend before shifting six wide into upper stretch, ran on evenly. MERITTRIS raced outside at the back, went in the five path through the turn, came out seven
wide into upper stretch and was never a threat.

raced mid-pack outside going six then five wide on the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. GATLING GOLD raced outside in the back half of the field early,
went in the four to five path on the turn, shifted out eight wide in upper stretch and gained some late. ATTILA'S FLAG bumped the inside rival at the break,
shifted in thereafter, went two to three wide on the turn before shifting five wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly. TERAS SILENCE was outpaced early,
raced about six wide through the turn and improved position in the stretch. DOUBLEDOWN DREAMER chased from inside, came out turning for home to be
three wide past the head of the stretch and was empty thereafter. WISHFUL SLIM came out a bit at the start and was bumped hard, shifted in and
encouraged along in the two to three path heading to the turn, was bumped again near the sixteenth pole and not persevered with thereafter. RUFFY STICK
was bumped into a rival at the start, chased briefly two wide into the turn moving out four deep then another two paths into upper stretch, drifted in a bit in
mid- to late-stretch and bumped a rival near the sixteenth pole. DIABOLICAL TURN chased briefly two wide into and on the turn, came out four deep into
upper stretch and was empty. SECRET SALSA was bumped hard into a rival at the start, chased briefly three wide then dropped back, faded, and was

Footnotes
QUANTICO JOE stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, came in just a hair leaving the turn and having taken the lead, drew clear. TOM T WHO
tracked the leaders, advanced between runners on the turn four wide, steadied slightly past the three-sixteenths when in tight between and switched out at
the top of the stretch, ran on for the place but made no headway on the winner. ALMOST A STORM brushed the outer foe at the start, contended inside
rivals but off the fence in the two to three path on the turn, drifted out a path past the three-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch. SEND THE STORM settled
into stride off the leaders, advanced inside or just off the rail on the turn, continued to improve in the stretch. IMPUTED was bumped at the break, switched
outside foes early and moved up to chase, went six wide on the turn and lacked a late kick. GERDA'S GONE switched off the inside into the turn, came
three wide past the quarter pole, moved out six deep into upper stretch, altered inside a rival in mid-stretch and improved. TOX was bumped into a rival at
the start, shifted in and was nearer the rail in the three then two path on the turn, angled out five wide nearing mid-stretch and ran on evenly. MARTHAS
BOY shifted in from outside rivals while dropping back, went in behind four to five deep on the turn before coming out eight wide into upper stretch, failed to
rally. BULLY RIDE showed brief speed between rivals then dropped back in behind rivals entering the turn, went in the three to four path on that bend, came
out seven deep into upper stretch and was empty. SKEETER WHO failed to rally while going in the five to six path through the turn. LESTER'S MEMORY
was brushed at the break then urged forward to show brief speed three wide up the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and faded.
LOOSEWHEELSLOUIE stumbled into a rival at the start, pulled up on the turn and was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry as well as objection by the
rider of TOM TO WHO against QUANTICO JOE alleging interference, the latter was disqualified and placed second behind the former.

Footnotes
CATCH TEN moved out in the early going, angled back in past the three-eighths reaching the rail early on the turn, bid inside foes turning for home, drew
clear. CHARLIE COMANCH bumped the outside rival at the start, attended from between rivals, went four wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, got
the place. CHAMPITO vied between runners three wide on the turn, kept on for show honors. HOLD ME ONLY raced forwardly from between runners, went
five wide on the turn while dropping back, needed more in the drive. RISKY REVENGE broke outwardly, set the pace from inside foes but off the fence,
edged clear on the turn racing in the two path, weakened in the stretch. LATIGO RIO was bumped at the break, caught six wide outside rivals on the turn,
shifted in while weakening in the stretch and came up empty. MANOSO hopped, veered out and steadied at the start spotting the field roughly six lengths or
so, saved ground to no avail. VEIW FROM THE BAY was bumped into a rival at the start, kept wide going in the four path on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
LADY JADE shifted in early, went two wide on the turn rapidly making up ground, bid inside the leader in upper stretch then kicked clear. ACCLIMATED
SONG sped clear in the early going, widened on the turn racing in the three path, overtaken in upper stretch and had no extra. STREET BELLA went three
to four wide on the turn mid-pack, shift in having reached upper stretch and kept on for show honors. SASSY KITTY pursued the leader from outside going
four to five wide on the turn, came out a further path for the drive and had no late kick. PROSSER'S KITTEN settled at the rear, switched outside a foe and
began to pick it up two then three wide on the turn, came out six wide in the stretch and ran on to improve. JAZZELLE chased from the three path into the
turn, moved out five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. MS. LEA lacked early speed despite asking, raced on or just off the rail and was not a
threat. SPLITS N STRIKES was restless in the gate and broke a step slowly, was kept wide going in the six to seven path mostly. RAIN MAGIC tracked up
close from inside, dropped back and faded and was not persevered with the final sixteenth. SPIRITOFTHEDESERT broke inwardly, shifted in heading up
the backstretch, went into the turn in the three path moving out to the five path on that bend, was eased in the lane and vanned off.
