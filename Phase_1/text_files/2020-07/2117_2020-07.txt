SHE ANSWERED dueled, on the lead, shook clear in mid stretch, held sway late under firm handling. DARE TO TRY raced mid pack early, rallied in the
stretch five wide and finished well to be getting to the winner. BONKERS contended throughout and needed more late but was best of the rest. PAGO
QUERIDO had good position for for a half, then lacked a late response. PEACE WITH HONOR set a pressured pace and tired in the lane. BARBARA
GORDON allowed to settle, failed to menace. RELEASE ME broke slowly and was no threat. QUALITY TOO SPARE flashed brief foot and tired. ERIN'S
ENTHUSIASM broke inward and the rider lost his irons the entire trip. The stewards posted the inquiry sign but took no action

Footnotes
NO MORE TALK pressed early, rallied three wide quarter pole, drew clear, driviing. KINGSTON PIKE was never far back, rallied in the stretch and was
second best. PERFETTO contested the pace throughout and held well in the lane. SHAFT OF LIGHT was allowed to settle early, had a mild rally while no
threat. CARDCOUNTER set the early pace and was through after a half. PHISH FAN was no factor.
