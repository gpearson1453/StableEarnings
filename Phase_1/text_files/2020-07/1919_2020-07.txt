MOONLIGHT CRUSH sat in striking position racing three wide, inherited the lead at the three sixteenth pole and widened under steady handling. FUTURE
STATE unhurried early, lodged a mild bid and was along for place. MISTY DO IT tracked the pacesetters inside, dropped back leaving the final turn and
offered a mild rally late. POP'S LITTLE GIRL secured a forward position and had nothing left in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
FACTORED IN allowed to settle outside in the early stages, went in pursuit of the leaders with three furlongs left, swept the lead at the top of the stretch and
was ridden out. POKER TABLE quickly went to the front, responded to challenge from TRANSPLANT, was showing signs of tiring approaching the stretch
and held for place under a light drive. ZUCCHINI gained closer order leaving the final turn, shifted out to the three path into the lane and along in time for
show honors. TRANSPLANT broke alertly, sat just off the pace, loomed boldly at the quarter pole but faltered in the drive. TIMELESS TALES trailed the field
and lacked a serious bid. CHISUM G chased the pacesetters and was done eearly.

Footnotes
REDNECK REMARK sent for speed but was out sprinted by BIONIC BIRD to the turn then shifted out to the two path, swept the lead at the quarter pole
then edged clear and won driving. DOC ROSS reserved off the pacesetters in the three path, came under urging into the lane between rivals, rallied through
the stretch and just held sway for place honors. BACKSTREET BOBBY hit side of gate leaving, was brushed five eighths inside of LITTLE BRIAN then was
in tight in the far turn along the rail, came under encouragement shifting out into traffic then angled in quickly, lacked running room into the stretch then
steadied, found running room inside mid stretch and was along in time for show. LITTLE BRIAN sat in range between rivals then was in close quarters,
brushing BACKSTREET BOBBY, chased shifting out to the four path mid turn, rallied outside under urging then drifted inward and was edged out late.
SILENT EMISSARY tracked outside, took closer order at the three eighths marker, chased into the lane then gave way between rivals. BIONIC BIRD sped
to the front quickly, was overtaken approaching the quarter pole and stopped.

Footnotes
RUCK prompted the early pace from the three path, dropped back from rivals through the far turn, lodged bid then was all out late stretch and held.
BURNIN' POCKETS pressed the pace along the rail, contested the lead leaving the backstretch, rallied inside of DENSE FOG into the lane, inched clear of
that one then was caught late stretch. SMALL VICTORIES raced at the back of the pack outside of RAYREADY, raced wide through the backstretch,
advanced quickly through the far turn, responded to heavy urging into the stretch and got up in time for show. DENSE FOG set a pressured pace from
between rivals, contended the lead outside of BURNIN' POCKETS into the far turn, drifted out into the lane, stayed on well enough under encouragement
then weakened deep stretch. DARE TO ENTER reserved off the pacesetters, chased leaving the backstretch racing three to four wide, rallied belatedly then
yielded late in traffic. TRANG tracked the pacesetters, gained closer order approaching the stretch but make no impact giving way late. RAYREADY trailed
throughout.

CRAFTY ENGAGEMENT raced four wide into the backstretch, contested the early pace, fanned three wide into the far turn, overtook the lead at the quarter
pole and prevailed under a drive. SKY DESTINY reserved off the pacesetters, gained closer order in the far turn, drove four wide into the lane, moved up
menacingly then angled in sharply at the head of the stretch and was unable to reach the winner. YUKON MIST sent for speed but was out sprinted, was
unable to move on with the eventual winner and flattened out through the drive. STORMY SPIRITED saved ground inside and offered a late rally. MI CHICA
raced three to four wide through the backstretch, lodged a mild bid into the lane and failed to threaten. CAGEY vied inside for the early lead, prompted from
the rail leaving the backstretch and gave way in the stretch. METERS MEMORY lost irons leaving the gate, trailed and passed tiring rival. LOST HEROINE
was outrun throughout.

STONE CARVER broke alertly then sat in striking position, overtook COCO TIGER at the quarter pole, widened into the stretch under light handling.
TROOPER JOHN raced six to seven wide through the backstretch, advanced quickly approaching the five sixteenth marker, circled the field into the lane,
responded to urging through the stretch and finished gamely in vain. SHARP DRESSED BEAU sat in striking range, chased the leaders into the stretch and
was along in time for show honors. COCO TIGER sped to the front, was overtaken approaching the quarter pole marker and flattened out through the
stretch. MR. DAZZLE hustled early, chased inside and lacked closing response needed. BAR NO Q settled outside, was asked to quicken leaving the
backstretch and failed to threaten in the drive. MOON KING raced wide through the backstretch, hustled four wide through the turn and faltered.
THISDEWARSFORYOU sat in range and lacked a serious bid. RED RIVER BEAR saved ground inside, swung out into the lane, horse fell throwing rider,
did not finish and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch involving RED RIVER BEAR but made no
change after review.

Footnotes
BLAZING CHANNING raced in second flight from the five path, came five wide into the lane then brushed rival, was headed into the stretch and prevailed
under a drive. LUCKY LAST NIGHT drifted out into the backstretch brushing rivals then steadied, sat in range then shifted out to the four path, rallied inside
and was out finished. STEELFORCE chased the field, advanced along the rail, shifted out into the stretch then rallied belatedly for show. MARIA'S MAGIC
raced four wide then closed late outside. IMPERIAL WOOD chased the pacesetters, brushed at the quarter pole the raced in traffic and found running room
late. COZY CAPER showed the way racing three wide into the backstretch, was showing signs of tiring then steadied at the top of the stretch in traffic and
weakened. GUNN WITH THE WIND saved inside, took closer order leaving the final turn, rallied inside and gave way late. ARCTIC REIGN under a strong
hold into the backstretch, raced three wide mid pack, chased into the lane, lacked a clear path into the stretch and lacked a rally needed. FORMAL TUX last
leaving and lacked a serious bid. FLANDERLAND showed little interest. DOUBLE RANSOME pressed outside, was unable to move on with rival and wilted
at the quarter pole. IMPERIAL SUN raced wide in the early stages, dropped back and was eased through stretch.
