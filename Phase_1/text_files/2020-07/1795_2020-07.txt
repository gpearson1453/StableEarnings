Footnotes
HOLD THE SALSA reluctant to load after the delay that followed a gate scratch, proceeded to come away in good order, vacated the inside route for the two
path at the top of the turn, kept watch towards the back of the pack, was on the move to the outside approaching the quarter pole, was hard ridden into the
four path for clearance in upper stretch, kicked into his best with under an eighth to go, gained ground readily,surging by LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE in the
final stages to prove best. COTTON took up the chase from the two path after brushing with EIGHT WEEKS LONG, was asked to pick it up by midpoint on
the turn, was still in the two path swinging into the lane, gained ground on a weakening LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE in the final sixteenth, finally going by in the
shadow of the finish line to procure the place. THIN WHITE DUKE at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, raced three to four wide on the
turn, as the widest of all, was more the former turning into the lane, rallied in tandem with COTTON, missed second. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE eye to eye
with WAR CALL seemingly from the get-go, made it over to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, shook free of the nemesis coming up to the
five-sixteenths pole, got asked for more spinning into the lane, emerged from the eighth pole holding its largest lead, began to weaken in dramatic fashion a
sixteenth down the road and got overhauled. EIGHT WEEKS LONG sluggish after brushing with the second place finisher right after the start, was quickly
spotted along the rail, cut the corner into the lane, came up empty. BUSTIN BIEBER out-sprinted despite being hustled out of the starting gate, got guided
over to the rail at the nine-sixteenths marker, tracked the front runners from there from the top of the bend to its end, angled two wide into the lane
appearing to have little left and backed away. WAR CALL sparred with the winner from the two path to the five-sixteenths pole and faltered.

Footnotes
MITZRAYIM underwent a three wide journey, got roused into the lane, gained on KLICKITAT in a steadfast manner, struck the wire in the last jump to
snatch away the decision. KLICKITAT moved over to the rail after the start, was forced to fend off a pair of opponents to outside for the opening
three-quarters, came under stronger handling in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker, stepped into the lane, dug in only to get nipped at the end.
MICHAEL'S BAD BOY strung out mostly three wide for three-quarters, was asked to pick it up a short distance from the quarter pole, went into the lane and
mustered up a mild response sufficient enough for the show award. HIGH TONE disputed the pace two wide from between rivals for the opening six
furlongs, failed to claim the top, but stayed on for the last major check. PETRUS chased the pace three wide to the head of the stretch, made no headway.
SIDD FINCH reserved stalking the pace from path two early, slid over to the rail midway on the backstretch, took it around the fuller turn, angled three wide
for the stretch run, came up empty. PIER FORTY kept watch on the pace towards the inside route, was under a ride after leaving the half mile pole, tipped
out into path two at the top of the lane, had no offering. HURRICANE ANDREW hung out five wide on the chute, travelled three wide on the turn, got sent
back to the five path after entering the stretch, made no impact. TALESPIN had a ground-saving journey, was never it it. GATTO MARRONE sighted three
wide and getting called upon for run on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, backed away. PRINCE HALO tucked into path three early on the
backstretch after being mostly four wide prior, pressed the issue as the widest of three until the top of the turn then gave out.

Footnotes
FOOCH tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied in
tandem with TENURE to overthrow the leader near the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to fend off a pair getting the bob on the wire. TENURE broke
out at the start and was corrected, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied with good
energy knocking heads with the aforementioned foe and displaced the leader as a pair near the sixteenth pole, fought on to the finish but lost the nod on the
line. VARIANT PERCEPTION bumped at the start by CORAL LEGACY who broke inwards, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, closed well to issue a challenge through the final furlong and just missed outside the top
pair at the finish. CORAL LEGACY broke in at the start bumping VARIANT PERCEPTION, chased three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. CAVARADOSSI four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish and was outkicked. ONTHEWAYTONEVRLAND (IRE) established the front and showed the way in
hand just off the inside under some pressure from ELENZEE to the outside, tucked inside through the turn and came under increasing pressure, took the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat just off the inside and was displaced near the sixteenth marker, drifted in when weakening shutting down
the rail and forcing BOURBON CURRENCY to check in behind him and weakened in the late stages. BOURBON CURRENCY three then two wide in
pursuit from mid pack, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, angled to the inside near the eighth pole rallying along a seam on the rail
when forced to check sharply as the aforementioned foe drifted in when displaced from command near the sixteenth marker shutting down the lane losing
all momentum as a result and was not able to recover to the finish. BOURBON MISSION tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, cut the corner
roused into upper stretch, altered off the inside near the sixteenth marker as BOURBON CURRENCY got stopped in front while offering no response. LE
GENERAL chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ELENZEE
pressed the pace from the outside three then two wide through the turn, got urged cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS away last, was pulling a bit on the bit taking the inside route during the opening phases, settled down getting tipped into the two
path at the top of the bend, stalked the pace, too far back to make its presence felt, got moved to the outside for the drive home, fanned wider and wider
until finally gaining clear passage to the wire, this being path six, closed in on the ones to catch, collared the runner up with a few jumps to spare before the
finish line and edged away. AMOS secured a prominent position after the start, tracked FREDDYMO FACTOR without benefit of any cover, inched up
approaching the quarter pole,cut the corner along on open corridor, was already leading by a slim margin when asked in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths
pole, kicked clear, felt the presence of the winner by the sixteenth marker, got reeled in. FREDDYMO FACTOR established the top after coming out and
making light contact with VIOLENT POINT in the shadow of the starting gate, got guided into the two path, carved out the pace, pulling on the left, saw the
winner narrowing in late on the bend,drifted one path farther off the rail when called upon at the head of the stretch, succumbed a sixteenth down the road,
stayed on for the show. DRYNACHAN took up the chase three wide, altered to the inside down the stretch, made no impact. CANARSIE ANGEL drafted
behind the pacesetter during the run around the bend, got steered out and challenged four wide coming onto the top of the lane, flattened out. VIOLENT
POINT stumbled striking the side of the starting gate, was then brushed into by FREDDYMO FACTOR, raced from along the outside, underwent a three
wide pursuit on the bend, angled five into the lane, lacked the needed response. PUPAREE strung out four wide on the turn, got sent out seven wide from
upper to midlane, failed to menace. MOANA'S TALE two wide on the turn, had no rally. ANYDAYISHERDAY rode the rail on the turn, stepped into the lane
and wandered out to the eight path to no avail. ANCIENT BROWN took the inside route, angled three wide at the three-sixteenths pole, had no rally.
HUNNYBUNNERDINI two wide entering the turn, was three wide leaving it, gave way. CRATER RIM two wide departing the backstretch, backed away after
displaying brief speed, then was vanned off after the finish.

Footnotes
CIVIL UNION sat forwardly placed three wide, pressed the issue as the widest of three during the run around the second bend, gained a narrow lead
coming up to the quarter pole, went onward for another sixteenth before being called upon for more, gave the desired response and kicked clear. OLYMPIC
GAMES (FR) reserved undergoing a two to three wide journey, crept up late on the far turn, angled four wide into the lane and went after the ones to catch
in earnest, finished with willingness down the center of the course to garner the place. BEAU BELLE gained command after the start, cut over to the inside,
showed the way being rated along, felt pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside on the far turn, got put to a drive getting displaced by the winner at
the quarter pole, had the rider drop the whip a sixteenth later, went well enough afterwards to salvage the show. DYNA PASSER slipped off the inside at the
five-sixteenths pole, swung out five wide entering the stretch, closed in en route for the final significant slice of the purse. PALLAS ATHENE prompted the
pace from the two path, undertook the task from between foes on the second bend, stepped into the lane and backed away. BEALE STREET unhurried
while two wide early, moved to the outside after departing the backstretch, was sighted in path four by the three-eighths pole, got set down a sixteenth later,
fanned out seven wide from upper to midlane, made no headway. WEGETSDAMUNNYS dove to the rail, took it until the quarter pole, angled out six wide
during the initial portion of the stretch, made no impact. LEMON ZIP kept an eye on the pacesetter from the pocket, tipped a bit wider at the top of the lane,
faltered. RED CURLS fifth in line along the rail leaving the homestretch, abandoned it for path three on the clubhouse bend, was back on the rail by the
subsequent turn, cut the corner into the lane, had no rally. SEEKING REVENGE strung out mostly three wide to the quarter pole, gave way.

Footnotes
MAGICAL ROMANCE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command inside the sixteenth pole, then prevailed edging away at the end. DREAM CHASING showed the
way in hand three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the inside half a mile from home, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under threat and repelled the challenge when collared inside the sixteenth marker and was along safe for the place honors. BABY GIRL five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide for home,
dug in latched on to the leader through the length of the stretch but was ultimately repelled to the finish while along for the show honors. HIGH SCHOOL
CRUSH chased four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. PIPPI broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, swung three
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PAINITE chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no response. KEYPIT broke out at the start bumping EMPRESS LUCIANA in concert with
SARATOGA LULLABY, chased five paths off the inside before tucking to the inside through the turn, spun three wide for home and weakened. SARATOGA
LULLABY broke in at the start bumping EMPRESS LUCIANA in tandem with the aforementioned foe, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. EMPRESS LUCIANA got
bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home
and made no impact. MOLLY'S SHRINK hard to load, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. GOTTA B BOLD in tight along the rail under a firm hold twice, chased along the inside, angled five wide into upper stretch and made
no impact.
