Footnotes
CASCADE DANCER dueled for the early advantage with SHE OWNS THE PAYNT, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and edged away through
the final furlong. SHE OWNS THE PAYNT was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner from off the rail, vied and gave way to that rival
grudgingly through the final furlong. YOU GO GIRL was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and rallied late.
JACANA was allowed to settle early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SUDDENLY WINNING chased the leaders while
racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. ALOTMOREACTION showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
MADISON ANNE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
VINNY FROM DIXIE was bumped at the break then reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the
three-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin and was ridden out to the wire. SOVEREIGN NATION set a pressured pace from the inside, was no match for
the winner in the drive but clearly second best. ATTA BOY BILLY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the
drive. BRETT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SHERM lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. MY FIRST TRIP was bumped at the start and steadied, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. WARM
LAKE DUDE pressed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. COUGAR GRAY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor.

WHEEL RALLY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and was up in the closing yards. FREIBURG stalked the
pace of TUMAC MOUNTAIN while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and just missed. TUMAC
MOUNTAIN sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by FREIBURG nearing the five-sixteenths marker,
vied with that foe and gave way grudgingly late. GRAYCASTER lacked early speed, moved up for a contending position and finished evenly late. SCOUT
PATROL settled off the leaders early and failed to threaten. IRON ROB showed no early speed and lacked the needed rally. BENNY THE JET showed brief
speed and weakened.

through the turn and finished with a late bid. BERNIE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, checked in mid-stretch, angled out and

Footnotes
PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY bobbled at the start, opened a long lead at once, increased his advantage through the turn and drew off as a handy winner.
MUNCEY settled off the leaders early, angled out into the stretch and was up for the place. UNMACHABLE lagged early, moved six-wide through the turn
and finished with good late energy. LANSKY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gradually gave way. FROLIC AND DETOUR chased the
leaders from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. LOLO PANIOLO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. L
D' RADO GOLDRUSH showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ALITTLELESSTALK pressed the pace of KILLARNEY LASS while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter, vied into deep
stretch, was challenged by DIAMONDS R and DONTKISSNTELL late and gamely prevailed. DONTKISSNTELL was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and rallied to just miss. DIAMONDS R was off slow, raced off the leaders from the
inside, remained inside for the drive, reached the winner late and finished willingly. KILLARNEY LASS set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded
when challenged by the winner approaching the stretch, vied with that foe and gave way through the final sixteenth. PADDY'S SECRET broke awkwardly,
lagged early, saved ground and did not reach contention. BROOME was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened after going
a half.

ALL ABOUT TIME sprinted clear at once, increased his margin through the turn and drew off as the easiest of winners. STANLEY RYDER lacked early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a steady bid to gain the place. MAGIC MAHOGANY broke
sharply then was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. RENO ROY
chased the leaders from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. STARZAN was off a step slow, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and did not reach contention. BIG HEATER chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. BLEU
MUSKET showed brief speed from between foes, steadied and did not threaten thereafter. CONTINUE ON VICTOR dwelt and raced far back throughout.
