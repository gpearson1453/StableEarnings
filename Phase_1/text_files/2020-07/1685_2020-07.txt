TEASPOON OF PEPPER was unhurried early, dropped inside for the turn, angled out a bit in the drive and closed too late. SECRETLY PARANOIDE talked
two wide but could only go evenly in the lane. SPICY FELINE settled early, tried to rally four wide into the lane but lacked the needed response. PLEASE
ZIP IT tracked the leaders from the inside into the stretch and faltered. VONHRA lacked early speed, raced in the three path on the turn and did not rally.

SHE'S SO PRETTY was permitted to lag early on, advanced from the four path on the second turn, cut inside entering the lane to engage for the lead and
proved best late. JAZZY EINSTEIN was bumped at the start, recovered and was settled, moved quickly to the lead from the three path on the second turn
but was out dueled through the lane. STREET SONATA lacked early speed, was fanned to the five path while offering a bid, and gave out . ENDLESS
STORY bumped with Jazzy Einstein at the start, stalked early two wide but was finished early. OH WHAT A RIDE showed little. VICTORY COMMAND set
the pace from the inside, but stopped on the second turn and was eased through the stretch. EARLYNTHEMORN pressed the pace from the outside and
stopped then was eased in the deep stretch.

Footnotes
RED LIVY (IRE) had good speed, set the pace in the three path to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch then held under steady urging. MEET MISS KITTY
chased the winner early, was fanned four wide to the stretch then finished steadily for second. SWEET RAFAELA had no speed, was two wide on the turn
and was making up ground belatedly. BRILLIANT BIRD pressed the winner in the two path to mid turn, eased out to the three path to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty. I LOVE ROMANCE had no speed, was outside of SWEET RAFAELA and three wide to the stretch and failed
to offer a closing response.

Footnotes
DOUBLE TIGER was outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, collared RUN HEAT nearing the sixteenth marker, was clear
late then just held off SIZZLING EVENING late. SIZZLING EVENING had no speed, was three then four wide to the stretch and closed with a rush but was
too late. CYCLOPS was settled to the turn, had to race four wide to the stretch but finished willingly to the line. RUN HEAT hustled to the front, set the pace
in the two path to mid turn then lugged out five wide to the stretch, drifted inward in mid stretch and tired. BABY YOU GOT IT chased the pace three wide to
the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive. STARTENDER also was chasing the leader, raced off the rail to the stretch and lacked a closing
response. GRAND SIERRA pressed the pace early, got outrun on the turn and gave way in the stretch. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE had no speed and was
never a factor. TIZ PERFECTION showed little.

PAPAPIFAS hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then responded when set down and held driving. TRIBAL WAR CHANT chased the
pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished steadily for second. ELEGANT TANNER shifted out leaving the five eighths, was five wide to the
stretch then closed some ground late. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO got outsprinted and was outside of ELEGANT TANNER, had to race six wide on the turn and
also was making a mild late bid. FUENTE (GB) tracked the pace two wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. MON CAMO pressed the pace
4wide, got outkicked in upper stretch and weakened. SOUND JUDGMENT had no speed, was three wide to the stretch but never a serious threat. BLAISIN'
EAMON hustled to press the winner three wide, got outrun on the turn then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
REDACTION attended the pace three wide to the stretch, dug in determinedly in the final furlong and prevailed. BILLTOWN BANNER stalked the leaders to
the turn, was four wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive but could not impact the winner while besting the others. SOUTH RIM hustled to contest the pace
inside the winner, was two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was tiring. DESERT MOVIE broke a bit slow, shifted out down the backstretch,
had to circle five wide but was rallying on the turn then was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. DARKHAWK stalked the pace from the rail to the
stretch, loomed a threat nearing mid stretch but was in tight inside of SOUTH RIM, checked and weakened. BOISTEROUS RASCAL was chasing to the
turn, came two then three wide to the stretch but did not rally. FIGHTINGALLTHETIME had no speed and trailed throughout.
