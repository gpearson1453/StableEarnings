SUM OVERTURE tracked from midpack three to two wide into the turn, shifted to the four path to range up alongside the trio of duelers at the five sixteenth
pole, produced a three wide bid for the lead in midstretch, and drove past his inner rivals in the final sixteenth. FLIGHT TIME (BRZ) rushed after a mediocre
begining, vied outside of a pair of rivals for the lead into and around the turn, then dueled with ARTEGON in upper stretch after MR OPPORTUNITY
stopped turning for home, but was surpassed by an oncharging outer rival while getting the better of his inner foe in the final sixteenth. ARTEGON rushed in
the early stages to vie for the lead two wide and between horses, dug in gamely in upper stretch after putting away his inner foe, but yielded inside of a pair
of foes in the final sixteenth. ALIEN SEASON saved ground while far off of the pace into the turn, shifted to the six path turning for home, and finished up
willingly for a minor reward. TWINKLING KNIGHT tracked from midpack inside of foes, shifted to the five path and produced a mild rally passing the five
sixteenths pole, but shifted down to the four path turning for home, got outkicked by ALIEN SEASON in upper stretch, and flattened out. TEE TEE saved
ground while far off of the pace, but failed to factor. MODERN TALE trailed early on and was never involved. AUSTIN RAY stalked along the inside, but
shifted off of the rail at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened in upper stretch. MR OPPORTUNITY set the early pace after a sharp start, vied inside of a
pair of foes around the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
GOLDEN RULE HAVEN trailed after a bit of a slow start, rushed outside of foes into the backstretch to bid for the lead four wide at the eleven sixteenths
pole, vied for the lead two wide into and around the far turn before forging a lead between horses at the quarter pole, but was headed by his outer rival in
upper stretch, bumped with that foe passing the furlong pole with both sharing the fault, then outgamed that foe the wire. POCO CHARLIE stalked the pace
in the three path, came under a drive into the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, edged a narrow advantage in upper stretch,
bumped with his inner foe at the furlong pole, and was outgamed by that rival to the wire. PORT HUNTER set the pace early on, stalked down the
backstretch, waited patiently between horses and behind the leaders turning for home, then shifted to three wide in upper stretch, but chased the leaders
willingly through the lane. COUNT YOUR PENNIES prompted the pace two wide early on, stalked inside of a pair of foes down the backstretch, but was
shuffled to trail the field around the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly, but missed show. RIVER STONES stalked
along the inside early on, but was outmoved by multiple foes into the backstretch, trailed into the far turn, rallied in the five path around that bend, but
flattened out turning for home and weakened. INDIAN SPRINGS rushed in the four path into the first turn to bid for the lead at the eleven sixteenths pole,
showed the way into the far turn, but weakened at the quarter pole and stopped.

Footnotes
INTO THE SUNRISE set the pace inside of a rival while staying a path off of the rail, shook loose from that in upper stretch under mild urging, and kicked
away through the lane handily. HEART RHYTHM vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner while in the three path, proved no match for that foe in
upper stretch, then dug in gamely and prevailed for place over an inner foe through a stretch long duel. PAKA stalked the leading duelers from the three
path, cut the corner turning for home and produced a bid for place inside of HEART RHYTHM while the leader kicked away, but was outfinished by that foe
through the stretch duel. TIJUANA BRASS was off a bit slowly, raced off of the pace two wide before shifting to the four path in upper stretch, then stayed
on willingly without threatening. PILOT PRINCE was off slowly, took the turn in the four to six path while far off of the pace, and produced a mild kick outside
of foes. RAM was forwardly placed along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. CUZ tracked from midpack three wide, shifted to the five path in upper
stretch, but was no factor. NILSBY was forwardly placed two wide, but weakened. ENDOWMENT tracked from off of the pace in the four path around the
turn, but was no factor. T MONEY was no factor. DUCKDEVIL ran off in the post parade, then saved ground while far off of the pace, but was done early.
CAPTAIN BERNARDO was never involved.

Footnotes
WOOPIGSOOIE prompted the pace three wide, forged a narrow advantage into the turn, put away inner foes before meeting a challenge from BAQUERO
FLIES passing the five sixteenths pole, dug in turning for home and shifted down to the rail in upper stretch, then gamely fended off the aforementioned
foe's bid through the lane. BAQUERO FLIES trailed the field early on, but advanced in the four path and outside of foes into the turn to produce a bid for the
lead passing the five sixteenths pole, achieved even terms with the leader in upper stretch, but hung when that foe shifted in, and got outfinished by that
rival through the lane. NOT AGAIN JACKIE stalked two wide, failed to keep pace with the leaders passing the five sixteenths pole despite no
encouragement from the rider, then kept on through the lane to chase the leaders home without threatening. AH YEAH set the pace two wide and between
horses into the turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. HITTHEGROUNDRUNNIN was hustled in the early stages to vie for the lead inside a pair of
rivals, but weakened passing the three furlong pole. COWBOY HARVEST broke outwards and was forwardly placed early on, but failed to keep pace with
the field after a quarter mile, then was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
DIXIEINCANDYLAND stalked the leading pace setters from along the inside, waited patiently for racing room turning for home, shifted to the three path
approaching the furlong pole to be outside of the leaders, commenced a rally inside the furlong pole, bid inside the sixteenth pole, and just got up at the
wire. HIDDEN FACTS set the pace inside of AIN'T NO ELMERS early on, shook clear from that foe turning for home, but was met with a challenge from
DIXIEINCANDYLAND at the sixteenth pole, and was nailed on the wire by that foe. AIN'T NO ELMERS vied for the lead outside of HIDDEN FACTS into and
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, then kept on through the lane, but was outfinished by an outer foe through the final
furlong. DOMONETTE saved ground while off of the pace, shifted off of the rail turning for home before tipping to the four path approaching the furlong pole,
then finished up willingly to cut the gap on the leaders in the late stages. SHE'S ALL SKEET raced off of the pace two wide, but failed to factor. ANGEL
ALESSANDRA stalked the leading duelers from the three path, inched slightly closer to those foes turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch.

ZAPPER VAN WINKLE stalked the leading duelers from the three path, inched closer turning for home as the inner leader kicked clear, sustained his bid
through midstretch to wear down the leader at the sixteenth pole, then held safely to the wire. WYOMING CONQUEST dueled for the lead inside of
ASPHALT, drew clear from that foe turning for home, but was worn down by the eventual winner at the sixteenth pole, then just held place at the wire.
BOURBON BRYCE chased the pace from along the inside, shifted to the four path approaching the furlong pole with many lengths to find, then stayed on
belatedly, but ran out of ground while gaining on the leaders. HEX failed to respond to pressure through the early stages and trailed the field, took the turn in
three to four path while gaining slightly, but leveled off in the five path in midstretch. ASPHALT dueled for the lead outside of WYOMING CONQUEST, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SENSE YOU LEFT set the pace and established a loose lead around the first turn, held her margin into the far turn before being confronted by
REARRANGE turning for home, shook clear from that one in upper stretch, but drifted out at the sixteenth pole, herded out her rival, then safely held her at
bay to the wire. REARRANGE stalked the loose leader from the two path, inched closer turning for home, but failed to match strides with that foe in upper
stretch, then was herded out at the sixteenth pole when that rival drifted out, and kept on through the late stages but failed to gain even terms. SHUSH
settled off of the pace three wide between horses around the first turn, shifted to the six path turning for home with many lengths to find, then rallied willingly
outside of rivals for a minor reward. TUFF BIRD trailed in the two path around the first turn, advanced outside of rivals in the five path around the far turn,
sustained her gain through the lane, but was outfinished by an outer foe for show. MISS PACO LEMON stalked while forwardly placed along the inside,
shifted off of the rail while holding show in upper stretch, but failed to make a bid and weakened. ANGEL DE CORA tracked from midpack in the two path
around the first turn, waited for racing room behind the leading group in the two to three path turning for home, shifted inwards to the rail in upper stretch,
but failed to produce a rally, and weakened. ITHACA FALLS tracked from midpack three wide, held striking position around the far turn, but weakened in
upper stretch. POSH PRINCESS saved ground far off of the pace, advanced while shifting off of the rail around the far turn, but ran into traffic between
horses at the quarter pole, failed to split foes, then failed to factor along the inside through the lane. ANNMARIA was caught four wide while far off of the
pace around both turns, but weakened between horses turning for home. Following a Stewards' Inquiry and a Rider's Objection of REARRANGE vs SENSE
YOU LEFT for interference in deep stretch, no change was made to the original order of finish

Footnotes
ALL WEST trailed early on, rallied in the four to five path outside of rivals around the far turn, sustained his advance through the lane to bid for the lead at
the sixteenth pole, then cleared off through the late stages and won going away. MOTAGALLY prompted the pace two wide, inched closer as
SAGAPONACK made a bid into the far turn, dueled between rivals around that bend, dug in to hold a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but was bested by
an outer oncharging rival at the sixteenth pole. SAGAPONACK pressed the pace three wide before inching forward and dueling for the lead outside of a pair
of foes around the far turn, continued to vie in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace between horses passing the sixteenth pole. AUTOMATE tracked from
midpack along the inside, took the far turn in the two path, then kept on along the inside for a minor reward through the lane. LOOKIN HIGH settled off of the
pace two wide, advanced in the three to four path into the far turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, flattened out, and weakend.
COMEDIAN saved ground while far off of the pace, shifted to the three path turning for home, and passed tired foes without threatening. CHURN N BURN
lied close to the pace along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the seven sixteenths pole, and faded through the far turn.
BEVERLY PARK set the pace along the inside early on, dueled inside of a pair of foes for the lead into the far turn, but weakened passing the five
sixteenths pole, and stopped through the lane.

drifted out in upper stretch, reached even terms passing the furlong pole, and cleared off late. STONEWOOD set the pace from the onset, but drifted out in
upper stretch, then drifted back in while being headed, and yielded through the final sixteenth. SAIL ON ELLEN stalked along the inside, took the turn in the
two path, forged show while drifting out in upper stretch, then stayed on willinlgy. HARMS WAY saved ground while far off of the pace, the split foes turning
for home, and stayed on along the inside through the lane. SHIP'S CREEK advanced in the four path around the turn, came into the lane five wide, but
drifted in in upper stretch and leveled off. ILHA DO MEL tracked from midpack, advanced to strking range three wide into the turn, but flattened out in upper
stretch and faded. POWER OF MAGIC saved ground to no avail. LUSTICA saved ground far off of the pace, came into the lane in the three path, but failed
to factor. SHESALITTLE EDGY raced off of the pace in the four path, but weakened turning for home. MEMORY MOMENT was forwardly placed two wide,
but weakened three wide at the quarter pole. ALITA was never involved. SLODKA KAROLINA was outrun throughout, and showed little.
