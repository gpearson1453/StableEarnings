Footnotes
TRAUMARAMA was off the pace to the turn, chased the leader to deep stretch and wore that one down at the eighth pole to get the win. VIDA LEVA EU
was the speed off the rail to deep stretch but was edged by the winner in the final furlong, while second best. ABOGADA tracked from the inside, was asked
for run on the turn and had some rally while no match for the top two while flattening out late. MARIA ROSE raced between horses mid pack, moved up on
the far turn and evened out in the stretch. QUEEN OF CORONA was five wide on the backstretch, rallied into the turn, and evened out in the stretch.
TICKET TO RICHES was three wide while mid pack, had no rally on the turn, but improved position in the stretch. KARA'S ANGEL ran inside toward the
rear and was no threat. GIRLS GOT TRACK was near the lead to the upper backstretch and dropped back, finished the race and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BIG ON BIG led from between foes on the backstretch, inherited the rail on the turn when a foe dropped back, was challenged entering the stretch but got
clear and was ridden out in deep stretch. BRIG steaded at the start, losing position, came wide into the stretch and was gaining quickest at the end.
HISTORICALLY rallied in the five path on the turn and evened out late. ARMADA, alway close, moved up on the turn in the five path to challenlge the leader
entering the stretch but leveled out late. WHAT A RUMOR broke awkwardlly, then veered in sharply from the inside post, took an inside trip but lacked a
rally in the stretch. NOPICKINONCHARLIE was never involved. MIDNIGHT WARSHIP veered out sharply leaving the chute, raced up front while three wide
and tired in the stretch. KISSINGER was up front inside, but dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
EOWYN ran gapped behind the dueling leaders, took over on the turn, then stayed clear of a game foe down the stretch. PERSONALLY bumped a foe at
the start, stayed back to the turn, was quickest there while six wide, and gamely chased the winner down the stretch. MISS EMMA'S SONG waited, moved
up in the five path on the turn but evened out at the eighth pole. TEMISINA was bumped at the start, stayed well off the dueling leaders, made up ground at
the rail on the turn but faltered in the stretch. WHODUNNITANDRAN pulled to rally four wide on the turn but faltered in the stretch. DAISY JANE dueled
outside a foe early and tired while on the rail down the stretch. LISNET was never close. NUTTIN BUT RUNNIN dueled inside a foe and dropped back on
the turn.

BURSTING IN AIR hustled early, bounced first turn, perfect spot, rallied clear. ALEXANDRA THIRTEEN vied on the lead to deep stretch, outfinished while
best of rest. MAYAPRETTY loped along from the rail, went around tired one, finished well. PLEA inside speed for three quarters, weakened from inside late.
THROMBOCYTOPENIA raced evenly, lacking a winning bid from the far turn. CHANNEL VICTORY unhurried to far turn, improved position from outside.
JUST FINE BY ME never menaced. BIRD KEY slight problems first turn, passed a few from the far turn. DIAMOND HILL perfectly placed for three quarters,
gave way readily thereafter. MADE TO MEASURE raced outside most of way with no late response when needed. SO LONG DIXIE stayed within striking
distance three quarters, used up, empty. DULCE MARIA through after half from inside, dropped back quickly.

Footnotes
BABADOOOK tracked leader to quarter pole, roused to go clear in the lane under good handling to the wire. MAXIMIZER settled behind leaders to stretch,
rallied three wide while coming on too late. CARTER CAT no speed to turn, rallied widest in the stretch for show spot. TRUE TO DIXIE raced evenly from
inside with no improvement. GOLDEN READY brief speed inside, gave way readily from turn. TIO MOSCO never a menace. ROCKING CHIEFTAIN no
factor from between horses into the stretch run. HIGH ABOVE showed little throughout. SKYSWEPT brief speed, stopped.

Footnotes
PATTI PATTI PATTI chased from mid field, was behind a wall of horses entering the stretch, moved out wide for room at the sixteenth pole and closed with
a rush for the win. STORMY MEMO ran off the pace next to the winner, went between horses on the turn while moving up, split horses down the stretch to
lead late, but was nailed in deep stretch and settled for place. PROM THEME was pushed on for more while on the turn five wide, sreadily gained down the
stretch, but evened out late. IVY O'DAY chased from second, led from the turn to the eighth pole and leveled out. CURIOUS RUTH stumbled and bumped a
foe at the start, loomed as threatening entering the stretch four wide, then faltered past the eighth pole. CHASIN' BAI chased from inside but lacked a rally
from the rail down the stretch. CENTRAL BANKING bumped a horse at the start, led clear to the turn, and tired in the stretch. GRAMS FUTURE was off a
step slow, was widest on the backstretch and widest into the stretch.
