Footnotes
SHIO stalked from outside just off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, took over by the furlong marker and drew clear. QUAD was urged forward at the
break, set the pace racing off the inside, went in the three path on the turn, overtaken by upper stretch, held the place while no match for the winner. TOM T
WHO shifted in late up the backstretch, went in the two path through much of the turn before shifting five deep coming past the three-sixteenths pole, ran on
to get show honors. TRUMP RIDE shifted out after clearing the gap, went five to six wide on the turn, came widest of all into the stretch and gained mildly.
MUSCLE HEAD chased between rivals four wide into the turn, dropped back late on that bend, had no late kick. PHOENIX FIRE switched off the inside
near the three-eighths pole, went in the two to three path through the turn while gaining but could not sustain the effort and evened out in the lane. ALMOST
A STORM was mid-pack along or just off the rail and ran evenly. SEND THE STORM was up close amongst the early leaders, continued in behind in the
three path on the turn, weakened thereafter. MODJESKA HEAT went in the three path through the turn and was never near enough to threaten. CLASSY
HOMEWRECKER raced well back inside, tired.

Footnotes
INDIA WILKES set a pressured pace racing off the inside, went in the two path on the turn, shook clear leaving the turn into upper stretch, was given steady
handling and just lasted from RUN'N DOWN A DREAM, who settled off the leading pair, saved ground early on the turn before moving out four wide coming
past the three-sixteenths, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch under a left-handed whip but closed to just miss. MS BUCKSNORT pressed outside the winner
going three wide on the turn before weakening. FACE CARD CONTESSA bobbled just slightly at the break, trailing early having shifted in, went on or just
off the rail through the turn, was no match for the top trio. HENNO MOMO raced back early, moved ahead of foes but still well off the leading trio on the turn
racing in the two to three path on that bend, lacked a rally. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE broke a step slowly, raced outside going five wide on the turn and
was never near enough to threaten. PASSION RIDE broke a step slowly, went four wide on the turn and was not a factor. ALL TOO SUPER switched off the
inside up the backstretch going three wide on the turn, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
TREBULSKI pressed from outside, bid at the quarter pole taking a narrow lead by the three-sixteenths having gone four wide on the turn, kicked clear in the
stretch under steady handling. VIVARO raced outside a foe in behind the leading trio heading into the turn, went two wide through most of that bend before
shifting out four deep past the three-sixteenths, was no match for the winner but second best. THAT DOG WILL HUNT settled in the back half inside, began
to move out early on the turn eventually fanning six wide coming out of that bend, ran on for show honors over EL CHUMELITO, who tracked the leaders
inside through the turn, came out three wide turning for home and needed more. THE KID IN SYD was outpaced early, shifted in late up the backstretch,
went mostly three wide on the turn, moved out in upper- to mid-stretch and gained late. SICULO was coaxed a tad at the start, set the pace under pressure
racing just off the rail, gave way in the stretch. CORDES chased briefly from outside, lost ground on the turn going four then being carried out seven wide on
that turn, ran on evenly. BUMBLEBEE was positioned in the three to four path mid-pack into and on the turn, was bumped near the furlong marker and
came up empty. TU SOLO TU shifted in and saved ground racing on or just off the rail on the turn, came out in upper stretch and failed to rally. HONOR
THE ANTHEM pressed the pace from between runners, dropped back three wide on the turn coming five deep into upper stretch and was empty. COMEDY
KING was mid-pack just off the inside up the backstretch on the turn, came out and bumped a rival in upper stretch then steadied, was not persevered with
thereafter. C C COALER was outrun racing just off the inside.

Footnotes
SOMBRA NEGRA stalked from outside, went five wide on the turn, struck the lead outside the sixteenths pole and was drawing off at the end. SMART
SPREE stalked from between runners four wide into the turn, challenged late on that bend taking the lead at the three-sixteenths and moving clear into
upper stretch, was overtaken in mid-stretch but held the place. CRUMAN TAPOTE settled in behind the leaders off the inside going in the four path on the
turn, angled out six deep turning for home, gained but missed second. DIABOLICAL KING pressed the pace, bid between rivals three wide midway on the
turn, could not sustain the effort. EMBELLISHING BOB exchanged a bump at the break and was totally devoid of speed, began to edge closer in the two
path on the turn and continued to gain in the stretch inside rivals. VIDAKS BACK exchanged a bump at the break, was urged forward to set the pace off the
rail one path, gave way and faded. WILLY TELL HIM saved ground in behind the leaders on then just off the rail through the turn, came out in upper stretch
and failed to rally. I B EZ switched off the inside early going four wide on the turn and was not a threat. SUPER SWISS raced outside a rival in behind the
leaders, went two then three wide on the turn, came out wider into upper stretch but was empty. AGO GO GAL was kept off the inside going in the six path
through the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
RAGTIME RYTHM settled at the rear outside, went seven wide on the turn, lugged in and out through mid-stretch while taking the lead just outside the
sixteenth pole then edged away. INDIAN SECRET stalked the leaders, went six then five wide on the turn making a mild bid and putting a head in front near
the furlong marker, was outfinished. SEVENTH HENNESSY pressed inside, bid near the quarter pole, kept on in the lane to get show honors over BAND
OF GLORY, who broke just a half-step slowly, pressed the pace going three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. I'LL BE DIP raced between foes
five wide into the turn then moved in a path after getting in a bit tight entering the turn, was also in just a bit tight leaving that bend, galloped out well.
INDIGO SLEW chased four wide into the turn but early on that bend began to drop back and moved in a path, came up empty. ALL STEAMED UP set the
pace off the rail, vied between runners on the turn, faded.
