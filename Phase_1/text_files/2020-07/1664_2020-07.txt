right-handed encouragement. C DUB stalked outside, bid alongside the leader around the turn, carried wide then angled inside LOVE YOUR LIFE at the top
of the lane, chased the winner through the late stages and held the place. TIZ LOVE chased a bit off the rail into the turn, drifted out near the three-eighths
then angled back into the three path, showed a mild response in the final furlong and whittled the gap late. ROYAL SEEKER up close between rivals,
outpaced into the turn, kept wide by inside rival on the turn then came six wide into the drive and lacked a rally.

SWEET HONOR sped to the front with pressure to the inside then cleared that rival, padded the lead around the turn off the rail to the stretch and widened
under a a drive and hand urging late. TENGA'S JUBILEE tracked from the outside, went three deep into the turn, four wide exiting the bend, gave futile
chase through the lane but was clearly second best. ALICIA'S PRIDE trailed the field in the early going, raced in the two path into the turn, came out and
entered the stretch six wide, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. FLATTERING POSE bumped leaving the gate, stalked bit off rail, moved out and
came four wide into the lane, angled out in upper stretch and got edged for the show honors. COOL NIGHT tracked off the inside, went four deep into the
turn, five wide into the lane and lacked rally. SHARE THE VISION chased between rivals to the turn, angled to the inside around the bend, cut the corner
into the drive and weakened. GEM OF A TIGER stumbled, broke in and bumped rival at the start, traveled off the rail, five wide into the lane, angled inward
in upper stretch and had little left for the drive UNTAPPED POTENTIAL pressed the leader from the inside early, chased the pacesetter into the turn, lost
ground into the lane and faded. HARU'S STAR off slow to begin, pulled up just past the five-eighths marker and vanned off following the race.

Footnotes
TINSEL TOWN QUEEN stalked off the inside, went outside a rival around the turn, came three wide into the stretch, pulled up alongside the leader
approaching the eighth pole, grabbed command shortly after and drew clear. MAGNIFICENT Q T brushed with inside rival at the start, raced near the inside
to the lane, shifted out past the three-sixteenths pole and closed well for the place. FRACAS dueled outside for command, cleared rival around the turn, led
in the two path into the drive, challenged nearing the furlong marker and weakened late. SPEEDY GIGI dueled from the inside for the lead, outpaced around
the turn and weakened in the drive. DIAMOND OF VALUE raced off the rail, four wide around the turn, bothered by MAGNIFICENT Q T past the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened in deep stretch. ENCOUNTRESS raced two to three wide around the turn and failed to rally. ALL TEA ALL SHADE
brushed with outside rival at the start, traveled along the inside through the turn, came off the rail in the lane and was empty in the lane. The Stewards
reviewed the incident between MAGNIFICENT Q T and DIAMOND OF VALUE just past the three-sixteenths and ruled that although MAGNIFICENT Q T did
shift out and bother DIAMOND OF VALUE, she was not cost a chance at a better placing and there would be no change.

UNCLE CHUCK broke well from the outside, stalked off the rail, bid two wide into the far turn, gained the lead midway around the bend, kicked clear
mid-stretch under a right-handed encouragement, drifted inward in the final furlong and drew away under hand urging. THOUSAND WORDS stalked off the
inside, bid three wide and outside UNCLE CHUCK into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner but finished a clear second. COSMO stalked the
pace off the rail then moved to the inside, went two wide around the turn and proved no match for the top pair. GREAT POWER controlled the pace in the
early going, showed the way from off the rail up the backstretch, angled to the inside and entered the far turn along the rail, headed around the bend, fought
back inside to the quarter pole then gave way.

BELLAFINA stalked from the inside, a bit off the rail and angled in some entering the stretch, angled out near the three-sixteenths marker and closed
gamely for second. AMUSE in range just behind and outside the leader, traveled off the rail and four exiting the turn, then finished willingly to earn the show.

Footnotes
EKKLESIA went three wide into the first turn, stalked off the rail then outside a rival, raced two to three wide around the far turn, collared rival under
left-handed urging in the lane, gained command mid-stretch, took a bad step inside the furlong pole, recovered quickly and gamely prevailed. STILL IN THE
GAME settled off the rail then outside rival, came three wide into the stretch, closed well but could not get by the winner. BIG MEL stalked off the rail, saved
ground around the far turn, bid inside in upper stretch, lacked the needed late punch but held the show. DODGER sped to the front to gain control, pulled
early on the backstretch, led from the two path into the drive, met challengers from both sides, fought back between rivals but faltered. WINNERS CLUB bit
off the rail into the first turn, came off the rail early on the backstretch then angled in, tracked the leader under restraint to the far turn, asked two wide
around the bend, angled out in upper stretch, drifted in then out late in the stretch and could not rally. QUICKER traveled off the rail, three wide then four
wide into the stretch and weakened.
