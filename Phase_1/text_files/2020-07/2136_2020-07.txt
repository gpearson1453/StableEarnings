Footnotes
GOLDEN V C forwardly placed from the start, moved closer exiting the turn, challenged between horses past the furlong marker, edged clear late under firm
handling. TIZ CAN FLY settled off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, shifted out a bit wider for the drive, finished up willingly to be in time for the
place. PRINCE LOKI broke inward and slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, immediately moved out, behind some traffic late in the turn, continued
behind horses into the lane waiting briefly, altered course to the far outside and also finished well to improve position late. RUN TO FAME bumped and
bothered just after the start, taken in hand in the run up the backstretch, closer four wide late in the turn, vied past the furlong marker outside the winner,
lacked a late punch to lose a couple of positions late. BRAVE RIFLE in tight, shuffled back after the start, trailed into the lane, improved position in the drive
without posing a serious threat. FIRST METAL COUNT broke alertly, cleared toward the inside soon after, set the pace in the two path turn, faltered when
headed entering the stretch. ONE SMOOTH KATCH lugged in repeatedly in the early going, mid pack turn, faded through the stretch. MACLEAN'S SILVER
pressed the issue early from along the inside, steadied along the rail into the turn, fell back and continued to fade through the lane.

Footnotes
MIRABEAU away in good order, allowed the dueling leaders to go early, ranged up closer while four wide into the lane, vied past the furlong marker while
remaining widest of the first flight, drew clear late under steady handling. WINNING ROMANCE with the pace along the inside, continued to alternate up
front while saving ground turn, remained inside, could not match the winner the final sixteenth, came back to be clear for the place. MY KIKI broke on top,
alternated up front in the two path for three furlongs, between rivals turning for home, continued to hold a slight advantage with a furlong remaining, proved
no match for the winner in the run to the wire, weakened to lose the place late, saved the show. TECATE TIME fell back to trail after the start, made little
impact. MAMAS GONE CRAZY broke a half step behind the leaders, moved up to within striking distance, challenged three wide exiting the turn, began to
give way when straightened for home.

Footnotes
ROYAL PRIORITY broke alertly, well clear through a quick opening quarter, continued to maintain daylight into the stretch, enough left to just last for part of
the win. SUCKERFORAGREY void of early foot, continued to lag through the bend, shifted out once straightened for home, finished full of run to finish on
even terms for the win. THE AURELIA FACTOR in the second flight inside in the run up the backstretch, shuffled back into the turn, came back while
continuing to save ground into the stretch, clear of the others. SUNSHINE DEELITE broke in, was straightened to chase the leader off the inside, continued
closest to that one through upper straight, little left in the late going to lose a couple of positions. SKY DIETY raced in mid pace, lacked a response in the
drive. NOBLE LOVE off step slow then slow to settle, void of early foot,picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. OH TOODLES was never a
threat. LOVELY CHARLIE chased the early leader up the backstretch, began a steady retreat early in the turn, continued to give way in the drive.

Footnotes
FLASH HANDS vied up front while between foes, dueled in the two path into and through the turn, put that rival away past the furlong marker, briefly clear,
responded when the runner up came alongside a sixteenth out, found more late to dig in. LIL ALLIE DANCER broke out, raced back after being
straightened, raced four wide through the turn when beginning to advance, continued to close the gap on the winner, challenged that one from the outside
with a sixteenth remaining, raced on equal terms to the wire, outkicked in the final strides. GEMODIXIE broke in mid pack, moved up the rail to duel inside
the winner, continued to alternate for the advantage into the lane, weakened gradually the final furlong, saved the show. HARLANS WARRIOR broke alertly,
fell back behind the dueling leaders, went one paced throughout in lacking a closing punch. DAYLIGHT DEELITE void of early foot, improved position
slightly while not a serious threat. PAPER DOLL broke back, remained back and off the inside, five wide through the turn, lacked a serious bid in the drive to
finish up evenly. ISLAND BLUE in the second flight while racing off the rail, faded. PURELY BLESSED remained back in failing to threaten. ASDRUBAL off
slow, trailed, fell further and further back, jogged in.

Footnotes
MIZZEN MONARCH off a step slow, trailed well back for five furlongs, began to advance far turn, circled strongly six wide into the straight, kicked down the
winner late in an inspired effort. SPELLBINDING away in good order, sprinted clear past the wire the first time, continued to show the way up the
backsretch, remained well clear into and through midstretch, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. GATOR PROUD void of early foot, five wide
out of the final turn, rallied for the show to be clear of the others. AMERICAN MOM within striking distance early, settled in the run up the backstretch, came
four out of the final turn then went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing kick. AT ONCE four wide through the first turn when in mid pack, fell back the
middle half mile, came in the two path for the drive, switched out then improved position with some modest late interest. SEVEN COME ELEVEN chased
the leader for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX settled in mid pack, came up empty for the drive. LUCKY HARBORAGE settled
well off the early pace, moved up a bit the middle four furlongs, failed to respond in the drive. ARCTIC GUITAR was finished early. FLIRTYFLIRT forwardly
placed early, lost contact with the leaders after a half then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
GENTRIFIED last to leave, well back early while saving ground first turn, began to move closer just before a half, steered out to be four wide into the stretch,
challenged outside the two leaders past the furlong marker, edging clear late while being kept to task. INDIUM closest to the leader toward the inside,
continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, advanced to duel far turn, narrowly showed the way into the stretch, vied between rivals and inside the
winner past the furlong marker and gave ground grudgingly to that one late. SOCIAL MISFIT settled off the pace and the inside, crept closer three wide far
turn, saw that progress stall entering the stretch, could not get back to the top two late while up for the show. LITTLE TOE sprinted clear to show the way
into the first turn, remained clear up the backstretch, dueled through the final turn inside the runner up, began to gradually weaken nearing midstretch, lost
the show late. THAT'S D 'CAT settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the second turn, failed to respond with a serious bid in the drive.
QUALITY PRODUCTION lacked speed outside, five wide through the second turn, also was found lacking in the drive. DON'T SPLIT TENS went one paced
throughout, came up empty in the drive as well. SHANIKO'S SECRET lagged far back after the start, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. FROM NOW ON forwardly placed early, was finished after a half. UNCLE NEARIS also was through early.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN LIAISON tracked the dueling leaders off the inside, went after that pair in the three path midway on the final turn, took over into the stretch,
drove well clear. MIA O MAYA outrun in the early going, continued back, came four wide out of the final turn, rallied, long drive for the place, game for that
position, no match for the winner. FREDA'S SMOOTH AIR broke up, dueled up front through some lively early fractions closest to the inside, continued to
vie into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, outkicked for the second spot. CRIMSON FELINE jostled at the start, fell far back
early, came five wide out of the final turn when mounting an advance, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly while remaining well out in the strip.
KRAFT'S RATE went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. TEMPLE SHADOW bobbled at the start to steady slightly, recovered to settle off
the pace, behind traffic late in the final turn, came up empty when clear for the drive. SOUTHERN DUDETTE broke alertly, helped set a lively set of early
fractions, continued to duel second turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
JAX MAN unhurried for five furlongs, asked along when beginning to advance far turn, challenged four wide entering the stretch, got clear past the furlong
marker, responded when challenged late, bumped with the runner up when that one lugged in, held in the final strides. POWER JET broke out to bump
HALOSTAR, was void of speed, continued to save ground into the far turn, slipped through the rail turning into the stretch, altered course inside the furlong
grounds, set down, late bid, lugged in late, bumped,missed. HALOSTAR bumped at the start, quickly recovered to sprint clear into the first turn, continued to
show the way by daylight in the run up the backstretch, briefly responded when challenged by the winner turning for home, could not keep up with that one
the final furlong nor contain the runner up, narrowly lasted for the show. GRACIDA fell back to trail after the start, remained void of speed for six furlongs,
was five wide exiting the final turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to narrowly miss the show. CAFE DU MONDE settled off the pace, had little left for the
drive. MY BOOK chased the leader toward the inside, boxed and in some traffic turning for home, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
SNEAKY ALLIE KAT settled off the early pace, moved closer along the inside before a half, chased the top two into the stretch, proved no match for that
pair through the lane, well clear of the others. . MYTHAJACUL vied briefly earl;y, allowed the leader to go first turn, prompted the pace out in the strip,
continued to stalk the middle half, engaged the leader from the outside turning for home, wore that foe down late under steady handling. GRANDDERBY
was finished early, far back. SUPER MAMBA devoid of early foot, continued well back for five furlongs, improved inside of several rivals in the second turn,
steered out for the drive, flattened out to finish up evenly. NOCOMET broke on top, got clear through the first turn, continued to show the way up the
backstretch and into the far turn, responded when the winner came alongside, dueled with that one through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that
one until late, clearly second best. LOOK HAPPY within striking distance in the early going, stopped after a half, jogged in. BING BING forwardly placed
early, faded. UNBRIDLED PULPIT four wide trip, was never a threat.
