CHERORAMA went evenly in mid pack losing ground to upper stretch improving late six wide. DEREK'S COP E CAT slow early trailed on the turn, taken
seven wide in upper stretch picked up tired ones there. DANCE WITH STARS pressured the pace dueling through the turn weakening along the inside the
final eighth. OLGA AGAIN rushed up to threaten on the turn extending in the four path down the lane flattening out late. NICKI MINUH UH pressed with
early speed then faded on the inside from the quarter pole. REDEEMED SPIRIT gave way on the turn. PRISSY SISSY flashed early speed then faded on
