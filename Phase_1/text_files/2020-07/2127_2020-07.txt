Footnotes
ON FIRE broke in front, set the pace under a snug hold into the far turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch, was headed near the furlong marker
and fought back gamely two wide and proved best while fully extended. RED CHILL chased the winner into the stretch, rallied along the rail to make the
lead before the furlong marker then just missed hanging on in a game effort. TACTICAL QUALITY slow early, closed fast three wide through the stretch.
PIOCHE GOLD chased the winner into the far turn along the rail and lacked the needed response. YOUNG AMERICAN was never close and stopped to
walk int he stretch.

the lead near the furlong marker and won going away. ALL THE BEST well placed, rallied determinedly two wide and finished second best. GOODFRIDAY

through the clubhouse turn, dug in when joined by GOODFRIDAY MORNING before a half, matched stride with that one until mid stretch then weakened.
MAGNA MONEY chased then early pace and was through after a half.
