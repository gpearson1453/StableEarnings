on the left lead in the lane and rallied outside for the show. BALLYHOO PRINCE saved ground in range, advanced inside around the far turn but flattened
out in the lane. DUSKY dueled two wide, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, was collared near the eighth pole and tired in the drive. OCONEE was lightly
bumped after the start, raced three wide and failed to menace. VILLAGE PRINCE was outrun inside. RICHIE'S B L dueled inside around the first turn and

WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT vied two wide down the backstretch, took the lead near the quarter pole, drew clear nearing the eighth pole and widened under a
drive. BARBSGRAY LION dueled inside of the winner down the backstretch and around much of the turn, angled out when that foe cleared in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead and held second. OUR BAD GIRL lacked early speed, advanced three and four wide around the turn and was along for the show.
TOTO'S DARLING was off slow, advanced outside to reach a stalking position nearing the turn, chased the pace three wide around the bend and weakened
in the lane. BOLD LITTLE BABY chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. GLORIOUS MYSTERY lacked speed, raced three wide around the
turn, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. HISSY FIT broke slowly and was outrun inside.

KING MAURO stalked the pace three wide, took a narrow lead near the three-sixteenths pole and drove clear. CATCH MY CABOOSE set the pace along
the rail, vied inside from the three-eighths pole to midstretch and gave way grudgingly. MORNING MUSE settled off the pace while racing two wide,
advanced three wide around the far turn then flattened out in the lane. CENT COMM lacked speed, raced three wide and improved position. GREELY IS
BACK pressed the pace two wide between foes, briefly led midway down the backstretch but faded around the far turn. STEPS TO GLORY was outrun
inside. CHARITABLE HERO trailed inside.

SILVER CASTLE set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. SCOTTISH MAN steadied while trying to get out at the start, raced off the pace
three wide, advanced between foes around the far turn, finished well and was up for the place in deep stretch. ORACLE OF OMAHA was bumped then in
tight at the start, rushed up outside to apply pressure to the winner two wide, could not keep pace with that foe around the far turn, continued on the left lead
in the lane and lost second late. STACKSDENERO chased the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. CAPITAL ASSET failed to menace while racing
two and three wide. LASS MOMENT saved ground off the pace, angled out near the eighth pole and never threatened. JOEY GOTCHA played no factor
while racing three wide. MAKEMIE PARK had brief speed inside. STROLLANOTHERTIME lunged at the start, raced two wide and made little impact.
BURREN ROCKS was bumped at the start, had some speed three wide but was through after a half.

ALPINE MOON stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, took a slim lead near the three-eighths pole, vied two wide to the three-sixteenths marker,
drew clear nearing the lane, widened under a drive past the sixteenth pole and was taken in hand late. FLOATING BY was off a bit slow, tracked the pace
three wide around the first turn, moved into a stalking position outside down the backstretch, could not quite keep while racing three wide around the far
turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and finished willingly to gain the place. SILK STOCKING was forced to check when shut off near the
six-and-a-half furlong marker, saved ground off the pace around the first turn, angled four wide early on the backstretch, made little gain under some urging,
raced three wide around the far turn and was along late for the show. TEL AVIV bobbled at the break, sped up to set the pace two wide around the first turn,
vied inside of the winner down the backstretch and around much of the far turn then weakened in the lane. RYOAN had some early speed inside and faded.
VONDA played no factor while racing three and four wide.

ALWAYS TALKING set a pressured pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn and dug in through the lane to hold firm. FENDER BABY pressed the
pace three wide between rivals, could not quite keep pace with the winner around the turn, re-bid in the lane and was slowly gaining.
SWEETONTHEGENTS settled off the four-ply pace scramble inside and rallied mildly inside. MY LOVELY GIRL prompted the pace four wide, dropped back
around the turn and was one-paced in the lane. GOLDEN DESIRE failed to menace while racing three and four wide. WOLF CREEK PASS unseated the
rider and ran loose pre-race then made little impact while racing three wide. INDIAN FIBER vied two wide between foes and tired. NICE N' BROAD ducked
out and lost the rider at the start, completed the circuit in good order riderless and walked off. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and took no
action.

Footnotes
WALL settled off the pace while racing two wide around the first turn, made progress four wide around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep into the far turn,
reached even terms near the eighth pole, battled outside past the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. NEGRONI UP advanced four wide around
the first turn, vied two wide from there, drew clear leaving the three-eighths pole, led inside to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. CARTER'S RUN saved
ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and was along for the show. DEPUTY DREW saved ground and never threatened. BANISHMENT
stalked the pace two wide and came up empty. PROMISING PISTOL played no factor while racing two wide. AWESOME BUZZ vied inside and retreated
after six furlongs. EDDY DIRT raced wide and was through after a half. PLAYFUL SUNRISE chased three wide and stopped.
