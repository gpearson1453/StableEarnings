Footnotes
COMMANDING LADY was a step slow to begin, began to advance after a half-mile, came four wide for the drive, rallied on her left lead and collared
NENITA from outside with 70 yards remaining. NENITA dueled outside MORE DIAMONDS from the start to upper stretch, stayed on gamely and saved the
place. NATIONALIST followed behind COMMANDING LADY in the four-path coming off the turn, rallied on the far outside staying on her left lead, and
finished well too late. MORE DIAMONDS dueled inside NENITA from the start to upper stretch, and gave way. AUBURN raced three wide, and lacked a
solid response. HARTS N FLOWERS saved ground and failed to factor. MERENGUE was hustled along from the start, and faded two wide approaching the
stretch. HECHIZADA was always outrun. WICKET HOPE got bumped into IRISH THUNDER by SAY BYE BYE up the backstretch, and dropped far back.
IRISH THUNDER was bumped by WICKET HOPE near the nine-sixteenths, and dropped far back. SAY BYE BYE broke awkwardly, leaned in shouldering
WICKET HOPE into IRISH THUNDER up the backstretch, continued making her way inside, and faltered. BUSINESSINDUBAI broke outward, raced four
wide and was finished on the turn.

Footnotes
SAVATIANO stayed in range for three furlongs, shifted out five wide into the stretch, rallied steadily and overhauled DREAMING THOUSAND from outside
late. DREAMING THOUSAND got bumped by HANGAR ONE at the start, chased BROTHER SKYE from outside to the top of the lane, took over nearing
the eighth-pole, could not hold off the winner but was best of the others. GEGE CONQUEST hit the left side of the gate at the start, saved ground under a
drive on the turn, gained between horses through the furlong grounds, moved inside and was up for the show. H P BIG HOPE was strung out five or six
wide to the lane, and rallied mildly on the far outside. MINDSHIP Q stayed in range through the turn shifting off the inside, and weakened in the late stages.
HANGAR ONE broke in hitting the left side of the gate and bumping DREAMING THOUSAND, raced two to three wide and could not reach contention.
POSEIDONS MYTH saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved off the inside with a furlong remaining and showed some mild late interest. CHOIR BOOTS
bumped with SOLD AMERICAN while in the three-path entering the turn, and never menaced. BROTHER SKYE sprinted clear after an alert getaway, but
folded up after a half-mile. SOLD AMERICAN bumped with CHOIR BOOTS while outside that rival entering the turn, and tired steadily after three furlongs.

Footnotes
BLOSSOM BOW was never far back, went up to challenge between horses after a half-mile, took over outside UNION LANE coming to the quarter-pole,
cleared to the rail through upper stretch and was under a hand drive to the finish. WITCH HUNTER advanced two then three wide on the turn, and rallied to
be clearly second best while no threat to the winner. AMELIA MADELYN chased outside UNION LANE early, got outpaced around the turn three then four
wide, and ran on to just salvage the show. LA TRES JOLIE saved ground outrun to the stretch, moved out for the drive and could not gain appreciably.
UNION LANE set the pace inside, got collared shortly before completing six furlongs, and gave way. BREAKFAST POND tired around the turn four wide.
LANGUE LIEE dropped back around the turn three wide.

Footnotes
DON'T EATTHE APPLE was edgy in the gate, came away in good order and contested the pace outside CABRINA before shaking that one off into the turn,
jumped back to her left lead tiring past the 70-yard marker and was saved by the wire. CARISMATICA stayed close early between horses, lugged in greenly
under right-hand pressure from upper stretch to just outside the sixteenth-pole, came back outside the leaders and just missed cautiously hand urged
through the closing yards. CABRINA battled inside DON'T EATTHE APPLE early, could not stay with that one after a quarter-mile, moved out and rebid
turning for home, and stayed on stubbornly between the top two. ST. LOUIE ARCH became edgy prior to the start, hit the left side of the gate coming out,
raced four wide and passed tired horses. GASPARILLA BLAST raced four to five wide around the turn, and posed no threat. TRINNI SUNSHINE scraped
the rail chasing the leaders into the turn, and faded after three-eighths of a mile. RENEESINHEAVEN was outrun throughout. MAMA LONGLEGS was
finished early three wide.

Footnotes
LITTLE NESSO bumped with DARK BLUE FLAME after the start, stayed close between horses early, took over in the three-path outside NAG NAG NAG
near the quarter-pole, drew off under a mild drive through upper stretch, and was wrapped up through the last sixteenth of a mile. PRETTY RACHEL moved
off the inside approaching the stretch, switched leads a bit awkwardly a furlong out, and finished well to be clearly second best. NAG NAG NAG set the pace
in the two-path, was no match for LITTLE NESSO at the top of the stretch, and weakened inside. KATIESDREAMGIRL raced four to five wide around the
turn, and made no impact. MY GLORY chased three to four wide, and tired after three furlongs. MAK HERO missed the break spotting the field a couple
lengths, felt the whip early and showed nothing. DARK BLUE FLAME bumped with LITTLE NESSO after the start, saved ground and was finished before
reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
SOUPER COURAGE advanced gradually inside through the middle stages, tipped off the rail to go after JOYFUL HEART nearing the eighth-pole,
overpowered that one and kept CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN at bay under good handling. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN was outrun for six furlongs, moved out to the
three-path at the top of the stretch, and finished with good energy outside the winner. JOYFUL HEART broke to the lead, set the pace inside, and weakened
in deep stretch. SON OF OAHU tucked in early behind the leaders, loomed outside JOYFUL HEART at the top of the stretch, but flattened out. MY POINT
EXACTLY raced three wide on the first turn, moved in and cut the corner turning for home, and lacked a solid response. BASHA tracked from easy striking
range for six furlongs, came under a ride three wide before reaching the stretch, and was empty. RULE YOURSELF was no factor through a three-wide trip.

CREATE AGAIN went up to grab the early lead, drew clear widening the advantage after a half-mile, and was kept busy through the stretch never in danger.
CHARLIE THE GREEK was ridden along to stay in range three wide on the turn, and finished with good courage to go clear for second. LOVE NEST
pressed CREATE AGAIN from outside early, could not stay with that one approaching the stretch under a drive, and was outfinished for second. DROP
KICK was outrun for six furlongs, came four wide into the stretch and could not gain. CHASE RUNNER chased along the inside to midway on the far turn,
and tired. OX TROT was finished early. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
KOBE FIFTY TWO was slightly off the rail battling inside NOTHIN BUT NET into the turn, shook clear approaching the quarter-pole moving inside, and
widened under a drive. THENEXTBESTTHING was never far back, had aim outside the leader in the three-path turning for home, stayed on his left lead and
did not have enough. NOTHIN BUT NET got bumped by ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT at the start, dueled outside KOBE FIFTY TWO in the three-path, got
shaken off near the top of the lane, and saved the show. BABY BROTHER moved off the inside to wind up three wide late on the turn, advanced mildly in
upper stretch, and finished evenly through multiple lead changes. VENERATE was briefly in tight as ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT crossed in front of him entering
the turn, moved up approaching the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. MONEY HOUSE was no factor four wide. ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT broke out
bumping NOTHIN BUT NET, came in entering the turn putting VENERATE in tight, and faded steadily before reaching the stretch. AWESOME ENOUGH
raced three wide into the turn, and moved inside dropping back past the three-sixteenths. THATS ALL HE WROTE was outrun inside. FELON was finished
early inside.

Footnotes
BACCARAT FASHION steadied slightly behind CORY GAL at the back early, saved ground beginning to take closer order late on the turn, shifted three
wide rallying past rivals at the top of the stretch, set sail after OVER GATORS and wore that rival down from outside to win going away. OVER GATORS
broke to the lead, sprinted away from MIDTOWN ROSE heading to the turn, settled into the stretch well in command, but could not deny the winner through
the last sixteenth of a mile. BARGAINAIRE saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid bid through an even effort. CORY GAL tossed her head at the
break and was off slow, shifted out five wide late on the turn, and could not gain appreciably. MIDTOWN ROSE pressed OVER GATORS from outside to
the turn, and faded after a half-mile. BAHAMIAN GIRL raced three then four wide around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
POLICY OPTION stayed close early, got shuffled back a bit midway on the far turn, steadied behind the leaders in upper stretch, got steered out but lugged
in badly through the furlong grounds, got steered out again jumping back to his left lead, and surged outside CROI MOR to overcome a two-length deficit in
the last 50 yards. CROI MOR led early before yielding to PLENUM, prompted the pace outside the latter for six furlongs, wrested command in mid stretch
and pulled well clear, but caved in through the final yards. SAFE AND SOUND broke out, lagged well back two wide to the end of the far turn, moved out
rallying in the four-path between rivals through mid stretch, and finished gamely. SULEMAN was shut off between rivals at the start and moved inside
trailing, checked inside DR. SAMADI leaving the first turn, continued inside and took up behind O DANNY BOY early on the far turn, fanned out five wide
past the quarter-pole, and finished with good courage outside SAFE AND SOUND just missing the show. FARM STRONG saved ground outrun early, took
the second turn three wide, and gained mildly without threatening. ALL IN CHARGE broke out, raced three wide around the turns, and lacked the needed
late response. RATIFY was strung out four wide throughout, and faded in the final stages. PLENUM broke out, was hustled to overtake CROI MOR for the
lead before reaching the first turn, showed the way to upper stretch, and faltered through the final furlong. O DANNY BOY tugged along early inside, and
was empty when roused. DR. SAMADI was never prominent. ELBRUS raced two wide, and faded steadily after a half-mile.
