Footnotes
NATURAL ATTRACTION gave early chase from the outside then saved some ground in the four path of the turn, drifted a bit leaving the turn but dug in
through the lane to get up the final yards. HOPPING HENRY set a pressured pace then dueled at a slim disadvantage nearest the rail through the turn,
pulled clear of YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY in the upper stretch but was caught in the final yards. The latter of whom, pressured the runner-up and contested
with a slim advantage two deep on the turn, ceded to that one in the upper stretch but still finished evenly. TAPPIN FOR GLORY angled to the outside to
give chase, rounded the turn in the five path but showed little further. VIDMER'S COURAGE chased the pace toward the outside, raced in the three path of
the turn and had little left. IN THE GOSPEL gave chase toward mid track then saved ground on the turn. UNCLE FUNKY became a bit restless in the gate,
came away awkwardly and was not a factor. STOLEN BIZ saved ground.

Footnotes
SCOTTISH DENIS stalked the pace inside then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took a slim lead at the five sixteenths and contested the edge
two deep on the turn, drifted a bit into the lane but dug in to the finish to hold on. MO CUISHLE settled off the pace about the four path the opening turn and
raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and finished well while gaining on
the winner. VINTAGE GIN angled to the inside to rate a short lead, came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the advantage while
remaining a threat nearest the rail on the turn, but, dropped back mid-stretch and was outfinished for second. LADY'S CORK rated close in the three path
the first turn then picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn then flattened later yards. YODEL LADY
came away awkwardly and made contact with Seeking Sera, settled off the early pace then made a mild bid at the seven sixteenths pole. SEEKING SERA
was bumped leaving the gate then saved ground. SMARTY DELIGHT showed little after the opening half mile.

SWEETIN BREAD angled to the inside to rate a short lead, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, maintained the advantage at the rail on
the far turn, put Black Steel away inside the sixteenth pole then held off the late arrival of RIP THORN, who stalked the earlier pace toward the inside then
picked up the chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled three wide leaving the turn, dug in for second in the final yards and
was gaining on the winner. BLACK STEEL settled close about the four path then challenged nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled with the disadvantage
two deep on the far turn, remained a threat in the upper stretch but flattened out later yards. AFFIX saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths
pole, raced four wide on the far turn and showed little more. MORGAN COUNTY stalked the pace from the two and three paths, challenged nearing the five

ONE FAT KAT quickly cleared the field and moved to the inside to set the pace, drew away on the turn and was in hand through later yards. HOUSE OF
LOVE gave chase inside and raced at the rail through the turn, eased out entering the stretch and dug in to take second the final strides. DANCING
DESTINY chased the winner while racing off the rail then flattened stride later yards. STYLISH PAINT gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path
then passed a rival. COUNTRY MAGIC came away awkwardly though picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail
then weakened. LIL LINDER was not a factor.

BOOM BOOM GONE stalked the initial pace off the rail from the seven eighths pole and moved to even terms at the seven sixteenths, took the lead nearing
the three eighths pole and put Lola's Kisses away through the backstretch, picked up the challenge of POSTINO'S SECRET midway on the far turn and dug
in determinedly to edge that one out to the wire. The latter of whom bobbled outward leaving the gate and settled back about the three path, raced outside
entering the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, challenged the winner midway on the far turn and dueled gamely to the finish.
DAH PHILLY rated off the pace in the two and three path, bid past the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened stride; a distant
third. MORNINGAFTERBLUES saved ground well off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, improved position on the far turn but showed little more.
CHARITABLE ROSE raced off the pace while saving some ground then showed little response through the backstretch. EARNED THE SHOT stalked the
early pace from the three and four paths, though showed little response after a half mile. DYNAMIC UNION saved ground off the pace then picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but faded through the far turn. LOLA'S KISSES took the lead into the first turn and moved to the inside to rate the
pace, was met at even terms toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the advantage approaching the three eighths, continued chase the remainder of the
backstretch then faded at the rail on the far turn.

MEAN TO AMEND raced in the four path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, dueled to the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, briefly
ceded the advantage but dug in under determined handling to hold on. EARLSCASTLE raced in the five path the first turn and settled close into the
backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, continued in the five path of the far turn and dueled for second late stretch while gaining on the winner.
RIGHTEOUS MAN saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path, eased to the outside
into the lane and got up for third the final yards. MAYHEM LIKE ME stalked the pace off the rail then challenged while between horses nearing the five
sixteenths pole, raced at a close disadvantage through the far turn and took a slim lead leaving the turn, but, flattened stride later yards. MOONLIT NIGHT
roughed off the heels of Dan The Man Can into the opening turn then stalked through the turn, gave chase down the backstretch, though, faded on the far
turn. DAN THE MAN CAN angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and ceded the lead at the five
sixteenths, then faded at the rail on the far turn. FANCY CASTLE dropped well off the pace while saving ground.

UNCANNY was shuffled back at the start then checked sharply on the chute and moved to the outside to give chase, steadily progressed in the six path of
the turn and dug in down the lane to get up the final strides. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave early chase toward the inside and raced at the rail through the
turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and moved clear from there but was caught in the final strides. BELLANDOLA chased the pace outside, raced in
the seven path of the turn and finished well to get third the final yards. ADIOS HILLARY chased the leaders from the inside, rounded the turn at the rail and
finished evenly. IRMA GIRL gave distant chase, raced in the three path of the turn and finished evenly. SISTER ANNA engaged in close early chase and
raced at a short disadvantage through the turn, but was carried out leaving the turn and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. LIVE FREE chased the pace
through the backstretch then lost ground on the turn and entered the stretch in the six path. MESMERIZINGPEGASUS angled to the inside to set the pace
and kept the edge at the rail through the turn, but drifted leaving the turn and weakened. EMPRESS HEART gave close early chase then faded through the
turn.
