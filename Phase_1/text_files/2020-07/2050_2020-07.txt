Footnotes
ROSAT broke sharp and quickly opened up a three length advantage, stayed along the rail through the turn, maintained lead into the stretch, responded ok
to initial urging, started to tire past the sixteenth pole, and had enough to hold on for the win. SEATTLE ENCOUNTER bumped early into the race by drifting
in rival, stalked leader while in the two path, entered turn three wide, and came into the stretch in the three path, responded well and finished well making up
ground late. IRISH JACK drifted in early and bumped foe, in the two path while settling well off the pace, went to the rail entering the turn, and stayed along
the rail through the turn and lacked needed rally in the stretch while safely holding third. P TOWN TITAN settled along the rail early well off the pace, had to
steady entering the turn due to rival drifting in slightly, lacked any response in the stretch and hand ridden to the wire.

Footnotes
MERGIE TROID angled in to the rail on the backside, settled along the rail entering the turn, started making up ground on the turn, tipped off the rail into the
three path at the eighth pole, confidently handled when surging past rival late. NIGHT OF IDIOTS took lead while two wide outside of rival on the backside,
held the advantage through the turn two wide, entered stretch, in the two path, repelled pressing foe in the stretch but caught late by rallying rival.
SLIGHTLY stalked leaders in the two path on the backside, entered turn two wide, entered stretch run in the three path and took aim at the leaders but
lacked needed response finishing an outfinished third. CHARMING ALEXIS pressed pacesetter along the rail on the backstretch, kept rail entering the turn
and through the turn, started to weaken at top of lane and lacked response when asked in the stretch.
