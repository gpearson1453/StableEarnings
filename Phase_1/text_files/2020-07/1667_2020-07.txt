HEY WILMAAA stalked the pace widest to the turn, pushed up to duel four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in mid stretch then held on under strong
hand urging. WITH OPEN EYES brushed with DIAMETRIC at the start, had no speed, trailed to the turn, swung out four wide to the stretch then shifted
widest and closed determinedly but too late. PRUDENT contested the pace between rivals and two wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then
finished evenly. DIAMETRIC brushed with the runnerup at the start, hustled to vie for the lead inside to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch and
weakened. ZAKAR was a pace factor three wide, had the rider drop his whip nearing the three sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive.

four wide to the stretch then shifted out widest for the drive and was closing late. CAROS EMPIRE had no speed, raced off the rail on the turn but gave way
in the drive. TWO TERMS broke slow, was green and lagged well back to the stretch and was never a factor. THE HENRIETTA chased the winner four wide
to mid turn, shifted in nearing the stretch but gave out in the lane.

leaving mid stretch but stayed on determinedly. MORE POWER TO HIM had no speed, settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and

Footnotes
BOY HOWDY pressed the pace from between rivals and was three then four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and bravely got up late. SHARON'S
FURY set the pace and eased in, was two then three wide to the stretch, resisted gamely to final strides but was nailed. BOLD ROMAN prompted the pace
outside the winner, was fanned out to the five path to the stretch, responded determinedly and just missed. PRINCE CHEVAL was chasing the top three to
the turn, circled five wide and followed BOLD ROMAN into the stretch then was closing the gap late. UR NOT MY PRESIDNT had no speed, saved ground
to the stretch and made up ground belatedly. CASH LIMIT also was outrun to the turn, raced four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late
response. CANDY CREW was unprepared for the start and broke about six lengths last, had no speed and was not a factor. BEL'S BLESSING was chasing
the leaders while off the rail to the stretch then gave way.

MYANGELCINDY was bumped by CHIRP at the start but showed good speed, dueled two then three wide to the stretch, responded to edge away to mid
stretch and held stubbornly. CHIEFTAIN'S LADY attended the pace outside the winner, was three then four wide to the stretch, got outkicked by that one to
mid stretch but kept to task to the line. RESPECT MY CANDOR had no speed, was two then three wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. CHIRP broke
out and bumped the winner at the start, chased three wide to the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. HEATSEEKER BABY checked off
CHIEFTAIN'S LADY's heels leaving the five eighths, was chasing to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing bid. MOMMY ROSE was
also chasing the pace then saved ground to no avail.

RIDE OUT THE STORM hustled to the front while off the rail, set the pace two wide to the stretch then responded to steady urging and held.
CIRCULODEGANADORAS chased the winner to the stretch while three wide but had to settle for second. MY IDOL was also chasing the pace, raced two
wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. DREAMING ABOUT YOU was allowed to settle for a half mile, was roused three wide on
the second turn and closed some ground late. CIMARRON had no speed while three wide to the backstretch, got fanned out four then five wide on the far
turn but could not offer the needed late response. AUTISM'S QUEST settled mid pack to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. BE LIFTED UP
tracked the winner to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. SWEET CHAYANE lagged to the stretch and was not a factor.
HARDSENSE was outsprinted to the backstretch then was in check while off heels from the five eighths to the three eighths and lost any chance.

Footnotes
ROWDYROOSTER was unhurried for a half mile, rallied three then four wide on the second turn, responded when set down for the drive, collared AL
MILLON BOB leaving mid stretch and held. AL MILLON BOB contested the pace to the second turn, pushed away two wide to the stretch, responded when
set down but could not stall the winner. BLUES RAPPER broke a bit slow and was void of speed, lagged to the half mile pole, picked off rivals two then
three wide on the second turn then continued to respond in the stretch and got the nod for third. HOLD ME CLOSE chased the leaders to the second turn,
rallied three wide to the stretch, loomed boldly to mid stretch then could not sustain the needed response. GOLD N GRAND tracked the pace from the rail to
the stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. IRISH OUTLAW had no speed, was two wide throughout and not a factor. BEAUSUN stalked the
leaders to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch but tired in the drive. DYE MAKER was always outrun. CALIFORNIA CANDY was on the pace for a
half mile, stopped suddenly on the second turn then was eased in the stretch but walked off.
