Footnotes
CAN'T TOUCH ME moved between horses into the turn, rallied to pass the leader on the turn, battled another rallying foe in the stretch and was best late.
TIGER LISA raced between horses early, moved up on the turn, dueled the winner in the stretch and was beat late. WEIGHTLESSNESS broke in at the
start and bothered a foe, raced in the second flight while on the rail, moved up between horses on the turn, took the rail down the stretch to gain ground, but
leveled out at the eighth pole. OLDFASHIONED ANGEL pressed the lead early, dropped off to a stalking position, rallied to gain some in the stretch, then
flattened out at the eighth pole. FASHION ENVY was urged five wide on the turn but was never a threat. CHASIN' BAI took the lead, opened up on the turn,
but faded while angling off the rail in the stretch. EQUULEI was bothered at the start by a horse breaking inward, was last early and never a serious threat.

pressured pace off the rail, drew ahead at the half mile pole, was headed on the turn and fought down the stretch to get clear for second late. EDGE OF
PLEASURE pressured the leader to the half, backed off a bit, headed the leader outside on the turn and dueled down the stretch, getting beat for place late.
DOLLY DEAR was off slow, chased the leaders from well back at the rail, dropped back a bit on the turn, then re-rallied inside to catch the leading group
down the stretch before flattening out. ROCKY PARADE was under a ride on the turn and lacked a needed rally. HEAVENLY MINE was wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally.

MIDNITE THUNDER bumped a foe at the start, chased the leader, pressed that one while racing into the turn and took over in the three path before clearing
off. GOING WITH STYLE stalked from mid pack, rode the rail past foes on the turn and held position down the lane as second best, and no match for the
winner. FLINT CORN was unhurried early, urged on the backstretch, pushed on while running on the turn, and rallied mildly. TANCAHUA was last early,
saved ground and rallied mildly. COUNTRY TAKE OUT had the lone lead, got passed on the turn, came wide into the stretch and drifted out.
IT'SGOODTOBESEEN bumped a horse at the start, was urged heavily to chase the leader, and dropped back nearing the turn.

Footnotes
NESSUM DORMA sat chilly to far turn, roused in stretch, responded well with a late burst to run down the leader in the final stages under good handling.
ANNOULA good position to far turn, launched a three wide move on the far turn and cleared off in the stretch but was run down in the last seventy yards.
TRADITIONAL ARCHER broke a bit tardy with perfect position quickly, made a strong quarter pole move but came up empty in the stretch run. FUNNY
FEATHER sat off leaders to far turn, came off rail into stretch with nothing left. CATCH MY KITTY raced widest into first turn and improved position only
thereafter. MAGIC FINNISH off leader to the half, rallied and gained the advantage but gave way readily. BLUEJEANLADY flashed inside speed to the half
but gave way readily and dropped far back. FLORIDA RUST was never a facto and struggled down the stretch while far back but walked back on her own.
