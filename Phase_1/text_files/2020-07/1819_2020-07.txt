NOT YET tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and battled willingly
from between rivals throughout the stretch to prevail in the closing strides. CALGARY CAPER trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two out from
the rail, raced into a tracking trip in the run to the final turn, rallied smartly three wide through the turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just
miss, while finishing on even terms with BOUNDARY BAY for the place. BOUNDARY BAY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the
first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled valiantly from along the rail in the
drive to just miss, while finishing on even terms with CALGARY CAPER for the place. SLEW'S DA BOSS broke sharply and stalked the leaders in the run
down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. MOONMAN away
well and pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run to the final turn, struggled to keep
pace with the leaders entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

DAKATI stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn and quickly took control
leaving the turn, and drew clear in the lane while being ridden out. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering
the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but closed
two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. BRANDON'S LEGACY away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn,
forced a fast pace while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, but battled gamely to hold
the show. CRYPTONOTIS settled off the pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final
turn, and finished five wide in the drive. SUNDAY DANCER away well and stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
struggled to keep his position in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. RED
BUFFALO settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and found his best
stride late while finishing two out from the rail in the drive. STORM ROCKET was bumped at the start, and settled well off the early pace while racing three
wide into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

ALLSTAR BOY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained
his advantage into the final turn, and was all out to hold off a late bid by JUST MAKE BELIEVE to prevail. JUST MAKE BELIEVE broke sharply and tracked
the leader while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly one out
from the rail in the drive to just miss. HARDENED HEART settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive in a solid effort. JACK DON'T DRINK stalked the leaders from along the rail entering
the backstretch, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. BAKKEN THE U S S R away well and tracked the leader
two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive. WUTHERING WIND
was slow into stride while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three wide in the
drive. AKASHIC settled well off he early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back, and failed to make an
impact. UPTOWN FUNKY CAT stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded
over the final furlong. The three quarter time for this race was HAND TIMED

FIVE STAR GENERAL broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, engaged the leader entering the final
turn, and comfortably assumed command entering the lane, and inched clear under confident handling. HE'S THE REASON away alertly and controlled the
pace into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with FIVE STAR GENERAL
entering the lane, but battled determinedly to prove second best. R W STANLEY stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. DRILLER away well and tracked
the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive
to just miss the show. DAY RAIDER unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late
interest three wide in the drive. WHISKEY BOUND settled off he early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide

Footnotes
MAKIN IT UP clipped heels in the opening strides, but recovered to take a staling trip into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, advanced from
along the rail midway down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail through the final turn, tipped four wide to launch her bid entering the lane and
was up in time. ILHABELA away well, and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled for the lead from along the rail entering the final
turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to just miss. BONITA B drifted out in the opening strides forcing MAKIN IT UP to clip her heels, stalked the
leader into the first turn before taking a narrow advantage into the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide from between
rivals in the drive, but was outfinished late. SARA tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. INTENT ON GOLD settled off the early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, and improved her position over the final furlong while finishing three out from the rail. PESADILLA broke sharply and raced a
bit erratic into the first turn while holding a stalking trip, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but needed more when called upon. WILD WOMAN
tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, maintained her position to the final turn, but weakened over the final
furlong. BELLE ANNA settled well off the early pace while racing wide into the backstretch, was always well back and never a factor. ROSBERGS GIRL was
away slowly and trailed throughout.
