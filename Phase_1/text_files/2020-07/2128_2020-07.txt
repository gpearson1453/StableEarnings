Footnotes
BOSSALINA stalked the pace in hand, took command along the rail late turn, moved clear into the stretch and widened under a hand ride. SAYSO, rated at
the rear of the pack, was hustled through the turn moving from the second path to the rail then finished gamely for place. GRATEFUL PRAISE was steadied
at the outset but showed speed, dueled on the backstretch, gained a short lead into the turn, set a pressured pace, was headed near the 1/4 pole and
chased through the stretch. TEXT ME UP had brief speed then pressed the duelers to the turn, chased four-wide to the stretch but failed to menace.
TOTALLY PERFECT dueled on the backstretch, chased hard but backed away late turn and had no closing response. THIS ROUND'S MINE, at the rear
early, was hustled four then three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DAD'S MISSY stalked the pace from the rail, closed two-wide late turn, bid in the final furlong and drove clear. MUSKOKA DANCER broke alertly and took
the lead moving over to the rail, set a pressured pace, was passed in the final furlong and held place. CAROLINA GRACE, bumped at the start, settled in
mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out at the head of the stretch and rallied determinedly. SAVVY'S SISTER broke inward and bumped
KATIA'S FURY, pressed the pace, forced the issue early turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. DONT GET SMART raced off the pace,
was hustled four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. I AM I SAID settled in mid pack, was taken back along the rail early turn, was hustled along
but did not menace. DUNBOW ROAD raced in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn then evened out in the final furlong. KATLA'S FURY was
bumped by SAVVY'S SISTER and in turn bumped CAROLINA GRACE leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but was
eased up in the final furlong, crossed the wire and walked off.

FIESTA IN VEGAS stalked the pace, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn, bid mid stretch and drove clear. PLUIE D'AVRIL pressed the duelers
on the backstretch, closed four-wide late turn, had command at the top of the stretch but failed to hold the winner safe. MISGUIDED PASSION lost her path
at the outset and settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. SADIE IRENE dueled early, gave
way grudgingly on the turn then chased through the stretch. WARNING BELLE broke outward then showed speed, dueled, dropped back a bit early turn,
chased to the stretch then evened out. SIMPLY MYSTERIOUS dueled on the backstretch, gained a short lead briefly on the turn, was headed at the 1/4
pole and evened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NO QUESTION broke outward, settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied and got by the leader in the late stages
under a drive. MISS VERRAZANO hit the gate leaving, stalked the pace, bid at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch and gained the lead but failed to hold
late. I'M A GINGER raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. VICTORIAN MOON broke outward
and settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then finished gamely and in the thick of it. WUK UP QUEEN was herded at the outset,
raced in striking range, bid three-wide near the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch but was no match for MISS VERRAZANO and gave way. CONQUEST
RAPIDUNO, in mid pack early, was hustled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed with some interest. FOREST AT DAWN lost her path at the
start, settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn then posted a mild rally. CHEEKYLICIOUS raced in striking range, chased two to four-wide
through the turn then finished gamely in vain. MAXIS BABE stalked early, was hustled two-wide on the turn, backed away approaching the stretch and
lacked a rally. FLATOUTONAMISSION sprinted clear at the break, set a pressured pace from the rail, gave way to challengers late turn and faded through
the stretch.

BOARDROOM stalked the pace in hand along the rail, closed two-wide into the stretch, took command a furlong out and widened under a brisk hand ride.
MONEY RIDE set a pressured pace, was engaged mid turn, dueled, was passed by BOARDROOM a furlong out, chased, and prevailed to take the second
spot. ALL INCLUSIVE forced the pace, bid mid turn, dueled, was also passed a furlong out and was outfinished for place. LONTANO, off slowly, raced in
mid pack, closed four-wide late turn, was under a ride in the stretch but finished evenly. PRINCE OF THIEVES raced off the pace, was hustled three-wide
through the turn then finished gamely to no avail. CLEANUP TIME broke outward and was steadied, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn
but lacked a closing response. HE'S MEANT TO BE raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.
