the start, sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was reeled in. PALETTE outpaced, moved three wide into the stretch and managed a mild rally. RED
NOON RISING was steadied at the start and did not menace. I'M NASTY TOO raced forwardly while three wide, was checked at the three-eighths marker
and faded. VELVA'S LEGACY chased while four wide, moved closer on the turn and flattened out. HELFAST GIRL failed to threaten. SAYUA stalked the

LETMENO set a contested pace, held well into the stretch, leaned out at the furlong marker when in tight quarters and battled gamely to prevail. ACRE
reserved, made a sweeping four wide move on the far turn, was brushed at the furlong marker, sustained his bid but could not get past the top one. BILLY
BATTS forwardly placed, was angled in for the stretch run, kept on but lacked the needed bid. SHASHASHAKEMEUP settled well, moved closer on the far
turn, was swung four wide into the stretch and came up empty. PRODIGIOUS BAY prompted the pace along the inside and weakened in the stretch.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER
REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THEY DISQUALIFIED LETMENO FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

FLAT OUT SPEED bobbled at the start, forced the early pace, took over at the five-eighths marker, held sway and was driven clear. AURELIA GARLAND
raced in striking position while three wide, stayed on well and prove no match in the the late going. OCEAN BREEZE settled between foes, advanced on the
far turn and lacked a substantive rally. STRONG FLAG saved ground and could not menace. DYNASTY OF HER OWN leaned out at the start, had a wide
trip and did not factor. LAGOON FALLS showed some brief speed and retreated.
