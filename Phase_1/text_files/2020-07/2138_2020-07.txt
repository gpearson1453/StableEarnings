Footnotes
BETTERTHENYOURX set a pressured pace, dug in along the rail through a long drive and had just enough. PLATINUMCENTS broke out bumping FLAT
OUT COOL, stayed close three wide early, bid outside the winner through the lane and could not get by. AUNT IRENE received a solid bump from
MIRANDA SOFIA at the start, raced three wide outrun to the stretch, and rallied to go clear of the others. FLAT OUT COOL absorbed a good bump from
PLATINUMCENTS at the start, raced in the two-path on the turn, and did not threaten through an even effort. MIRANDA SOFIA broke out bumping AUNT
IRENE and was slow to begin, and posed no threat. CHILLIN LADY pressed the pace between horses, and weakened approaching the stretch.
BORROWED ANGEL was outrun throughout. SAUCY TUNE was slow into stride, came widest for the drive and made no headway. TRINNI FLOWER was
finished early inside.

Footnotes
GREY DOM eyed the dueling leaders three wide around the turn, challenged outside MIGHTY THOMAS past the eighth-pole, and wore that one down on
his left lead. MIGHTY THOMAS went up after FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL soon after the start, outdueled that one by upper stretch and pulled clear, then could
not withstand the winner staying on his left lead. CURRENT HOPE bumped with TURPAIL at the start, saved ground throughout and finished evenly. FIRST
NAVY ADMIRAL dueled inside MIGHTY THOMAS for three furlongs, weakened in upper stretch and gave way. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE raced four wide
around the turn, and lacked the needed response. EL SICARIO broke slowly, moved out five wide approaching the stretch, and remained well back.
TURPIAL bumped with CURRENT HOPE at the start, raced two wide and was through early.

Footnotes
MARIES MELODY inherited the lead as FOXY LADY got throttled back on the first turn, rated along inside to the stretch, and responded well to remain
clear. KAYSERI tracked from striking range toward the inside, had aim outside the leader turning for home, could not muster a serious threat and just saved
the place. BABYBEL lagged well back early inside, swung four wide for the drive and rallied too late. MIDNIGHT GEM raced in the two-path to the far turn,
shifted out four wide to the stretch and gained only mildly. FRERET bobbled slightly after the start, saved ground on the turns, and lacked a response.
WICKED SOLUTION trailed to the stretch, and gained on the rail without ever becoming a factor. QUEEN FIELD advanced mildly three wide after six
furlongs, but faded through the stretch. FOXY LADY led through the stretch the first time, got wrangled back outside MARIES MELODY on the first turn,
stayed on the chase to the far turn, and was empty between horses before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CON LIMA went up to take over inside HAPPY CONSTITUTION entering the main track, fended that rival off around the turn two or three paths off the rail,
maintained control through the furlong grounds under a mild drive, and was geared down late. HAPPY CONSTITUTION challenged between horses early
on the turn, tried to get past the winner from outside to no avail, and settled for second best. WEST SIDE GIRL tracked outside the leaders into the turn,
could not keep pace under pressure after a half-mile, and plugged along for the show on her left lead. BELLA SERENA was no factor two wide. LILACS was
finished early inside.

Footnotes
MAVERICK KITTEN settled well off the pace, picked off rivals with a three-wide run on the far turn, caught MONETIZED from outside in upper stretch, and
drew off shifting inward under a drive. ROBIN TEAM SHOW was hard to load, raced two wide for six furlongs, paused momentarily a quarter-mile out,
shifted a couple paths further out into the lane, rallied between horses through the furlong grounds and was just up inside TRACEABILITY for the place.
TRACEABILITY trailed two to three wide for six furlongs, came widest for the drive, rallied mildly and just missed second. CALL BROS chased the
pacesetter from outside, closed in around the far turn, and flattened out between horses after straightening away for the drive. MONETIZED set the pace
inside, could not handle the winner turning for home, and weakened through the furlong grounds. FAKE MUSE saved ground throughout, and was empty
through the lane. DILIGENT advanced mildly on the far turn two or three wide, but could not sustain the rally. BORGOBYTHESEA went along under a firm
hold early inside, and was empty when roused.

KRSTO SKYE sat perched outside the dueling leaders early, ranged up to join the fray midway on the turn, overpowered TAKE CHARGE DUDE in upper
stretch and drove clear. TAKE CHARGE DUDE dueled outside TRAVY BOY early, put that one away on the turn but got hooked by KRSTO SKYE right
after that, could not match strides through upper stretch and saved the place. TRAVY BOY got outdueled by TAKE CHARGE DUDE after three-eighths of a
mile, moved outside approaching the stretch, and came back on to narrowly miss second. SPEED APP was slow from the gate, saved ground outrun to the
stretch, and gained on the rail without threatening. COMBINATION hit the right side of the gate at the start, stayed in range early four wide, and had no real
response to urging after three furlongs.

YOLANDA'S PRIDE grabbed the early lead, rated along clear through an even pace, and widened through the stretch under a drive. AFFICIONADO (FR)
bumped lightly with LA RUSIA at the start, raced two wide for six furlongs, shifted to the three-path at the top of the stretch, and was up for the place
outside. DIENDA raced three wide early, moved inside entering the far turn, and was outfinished for the runner-up spot. LA RUSIA bumped lightly with
AFFICIONADO at the start, prompted the pace outside the winner for six furlongs, and weakened through the lane. LA VIEXA was never a factor. OUR
FANTASY was outrun throughout. LET'S BE HONEST was reserved early inside, and had nothing when called on. CAT'S J N J came under a ride after a
half-mile, had no response, and stopped into the stretch.

LURE HIM IN was unhurried early inside, stayed glued to the rail edging a bit closer after six furlongs, rallied up the fence and caught CAPTAIN D in the
closing yards. CAPTAIN D set a pressured pace inside for six furlongs, shook off UNCORK THE BOTTLE and THRESHOLD while shifting to the three-path
in upper stretch, stayed on gamely but was overhauled from inside late. DOMINATE THEMOMENT settled in the second flight two wide to the far turn,
moved out to the four-path looming outside the leader through the furlong grounds, but hung through the last sixteenth of a mile. UNCORK THE BOTTLE
pressed the pace between horses, challenged in earnest past the quarter-pole, but weakened through the drive. KUNAL saved ground in the middle of the
group to the far turn, moved to the two-path for the drive, and was nipped for the last major share. THRESHOLD pressed the pace three wide, and faded
after six furlongs. LETS PLAY HARDBALL was slow away from the gate, trailed to the lane and made no headway on the far outside.

HELPING LISA D was close behind a contested early pace, ranged up three wide near the quarter-pole, took over outside ALIZEE through upper stretch,
wandered out and in while staying on her left lead, and had enough to hold on. BELLA CIAO saved ground unhurried to the turn, moved off the inside under
a drive five-sixteenths out, rallied widest and was inching closer in the final yards. ALIZEE dueled for command outside VIOLENT TRICK, poked a head in
front after six furlongs, could not deny the winner in upper stretch and weakened. VIOLENT TRICK dueled inside ALIZEE for six furlongs, and gave way.
I'LL TAKE THE CAKE bobbled slightly at the start, and was finished soon after completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
FORT KING sped clear after the start and moved inside, maintained control into the lane and held all out. MY BROTHERSLEDGE saved ground advancing
late on the turn, moved off the rail in deep stretch and finished gamely outside the winner. SLICK STAR stayed in range early inside, had aim in the two-path
turning for home, and was outfinished. LAWYER DRILL chased outside the winner for three-eighths of a mile, and weakened in the three-path through
upper stretch. R BOY EVENS raced three wide, and failed to menace in an even effort. REAGAN'S HEART was outrun in the two-path to the turn, moved
inside for the drive and gained mildly. BOLT gave chase three then four wide to the top of the lane, and faded. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY hit the right side
of the gate at the start, was far back to the stretch, and showed some late interest between horses. INDY RIDE raced in the second flight throughout while
near the two-path. YOUNG RAYMOND raced three wide on the turn, and could not reach contention. WAHOOWAH steadied at the break, and was far back
throughout. FREDDY SOTO took up inside INDY RIDE midway on the turn, and dropped back.
