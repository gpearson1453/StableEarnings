Footnotes
IT'S SO EASY stumbled at the break, lacked speed, advanced wide, offered a late surge and quickly moved clear. POSITIVE FORCE dueled outside
throughout and continued gamely to the finish. WILL TAKE OVER vied along the inside, led narrowly in the stretch and finished willingly. BELLA G dropped
well behind, rallied inside and failed to menace. BETTER BEGIN was well placed outside the dueling pacesetter but gave way after the half. ALLEGRETTO
chased outside and weakened steadily. TWO GRACES trailed long way and was never in contention. AGAVE QUEEN was urged just off the pace down the
backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL BREW saved ground, split foes on the backstretch, took the lead near stretch, was clear mid stretch and then lasted. GRAND OASIS, between
foes early, moved out on the final turn and then was fanned wider into stretch, closed and just missed. CURLIN'S KNIGHT swung his head to the right
hitting the side of gate, recovered quickly and was sent up to duel two wide, remained a factor to early stretch and held on well. DUBROVSKY was wide and
just off the pace, dropped back last on the final turn, swung wide and passed faders. KION dueled for the lead along the rail then tired. HAIL TO THE KING,
three wide, bore out entering the stretch then gave way. DONNIE BRASCO saved ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ACED settled outside, advanced on the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch, surged and rapidly increased his advantage handily. IRISH RIVIERA
dropped back early, rallied on the turn and closed well but was no match for the winner. EXTRA MEDIUM trailed for half a mile, moved strongly wide into the
stretch then flattened out. TALLY MO quickly moved clear, was collared after half a mile and weakened. START MEEE stumbled at the start, saved ground
and failed to menace. TWIXY CAT pursued the loose pacesetter for half a mile and gave way. FEDERALE stalked outside to the quarter pole and stopped.
BOSS OF BOURBON ST chased wide down the backstretch and stopped abruptly.

ARIMA raced wide and dropped back. GIRARDI, outrun early, eased out on far turn and passed faders. LORDEN'S LOVE, three wide chasing the pace,
tired. BUCKS SOME saved ground and stopped.

Footnotes
MUCHA MEZQUINA pressed the pace outside, took over into the stretch under confident handling and pulled away under a hand ride. B B'S BUSTED firmly
rated inside, swung out to secure room into the stretch, finished gamely but could not get to the winner. FED UP FIRED UP settled outside, remained wide
throughout and closed well. KITTEN'S FINEST raced just off the leaders outside, bid into the stretch and weakened. WOOD BEE set a pressured pace
inside to the quarter pole and came up empty. LIKE A PRO dropped back along the inside and was never a factor. CARMELTINI lagged far behind
throughout.

PINK CADDY, between rivals early, moved out three wide and quickly took the lead in early stretch and won with speed to spare. CAPITAL Q, three wide
and just off the pace, fought back for place. MADAM MEENA broke slowly, saved ground just off the pace then had no rally. PHILADELPHIA BELLE, just off
the rail setting the pace, drifted out leaving the turn and faded. KEY LIGHT failed to menace. CHARLY'S CHARM saved ground early, eased out and
showed little. AKNA broke slowly, raced two wide and tired. ICE CREAM PARTY showed nothing.

Footnotes
ITS A JOURNEY advanced strongly after the half, was blocked briefly on the final turn, split foes into the stretch, surged clear in thwe final furlong. MILL
AND GLORIA set pressured pace inside, lost lead to stablemate, gamely. I'M NOT JOKING prompted leader outside and continued willingly through stretch.
REGAL RETORT fanned very wide on first turn, stalked wide and flattened out. MONACO PRINCESS saved ground within striking range and proved empty
in stretch. ANKLE MONITOR settled well back outside and failed to rally. SWEET MAGGIE MAE trailed for three quarters and never a factor. AFLEET
DESTINY saved ground close up and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
FLY TIME, racing with renewed interest returning from a five month hiatus, bobbled slightly then was bumped leaving the gate, saved ground to near
stretch, split foes in stretch, drifted in slightly, took the lead deep stretch and held on. RAGAZZA CARINA, broke right hitting the side of gate and bumped
the winner after an extremely long gate load, was also outrun early, swung very rallying into stretch, closed strongly and just missed . ROSIE SUMMER
saved ground just off the pace, took the lead and was clear mid stretch but then weakened. LIGHT OF HOPE vied for command two and three wide, was
brushed lightly near mid stretch and faded. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE, wide and just off the pace, faded through the final furlong. CINNAMON LATTE, between
foes and just off the pace, was left with the rail and tired. STORM BABE saved ground, steadied in tight entering the stretch. SUNSHINE SKY, very wide
and just off the pace, tired. CATALINA R failed to menace. FILLY FROM PHILLY was never a threat. MOZA set the pace in three path then had nothing left.
GRACEFUL MONARCH FLIPPED AND INJURED HERSELF AND WAS ORDERED SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE VETERINARIAN. A
CONSULATION DAILY DOUBLE WAS PAID.
