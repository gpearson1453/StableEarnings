Footnotes
KALUGA BOB contested the early pace, took over into the turn, responded to his cue and held sway in the stretch. BAYOUADRINK chased while four wide,
advanced on the turn, was no match and stayed on in the stretch. TOSKA'S RULER led early, was headed on the turn and kept on well in the stretch to
secure a minor share. FOR ME LET IT BE outrun early, commenced his bid on the turn and finished well in the stretch. COME ON RICO raced forwardly
while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE swerved in at the start and failed to threaten. PAINT I AIN'T
settled while four wide, moved five wide into the stretch and offered no response when asked. STUDENT DANCER raced forwardly along the inside and
weakened. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY never menaced. SMOKY SMOKE was always outrun. NO CRUTCHES reared at the start, lodged a four wide bid on
the turn and faded in the stretch. RAISE THE RANSOM showed little.

SECRETARIATS PEACH outrun early, lodged an inside bid on the turn, split foes approaching the furlong marker, rallied and was going away at the finish.
EMOJI THIS raced forwardly along the inside, was angled off the rail for the stretch run, led late but proved no match for the winner's surge. TANGALANG
chased while four wide, was urged on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. CLINE TIME hopped at the start, cruised up on the turn, led and came up empty
in the stretch run. RUBIETTA BLUES never menaced. UNUSUAL NATIVE led early, was headed on the turn and gave way. WOKE UP READY was always
outrun. I'M A BARBIE GAL showed little. O'LYDIA was off slowly and took no part.
