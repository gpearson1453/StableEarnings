Footnotes
GRAYZ MIRACLE squeezed at the start, stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, angled outside, responded, dueled, drifted
in mid stretch bothering BLULU and was along in time. After Steward's Inquiry and Jockey's Objection GRAYZ MIRACLE was disqualified for interference in
the stretch. DIXIE LOVING dueled from between foes early, battled through the turn, remained engaged through the drive and was just up for the place.
BLULU dueled from the outside early, fought through turn, remained engaged through the drive, was bothered at the sixteenth pole and missed the place.
WILL B LATE dueled from between foes but had nothing left. AD LIBITUM broke out at the start, bumped with a rival and was no factor. REBORN broke out
at the start, bumped with a rival, dueled from the between foes and faded.

Footnotes
BOSTON CADILLAC broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled through the turn, remained engaged for the drive, responded and
inched clear late. GOLDEN SMILES forced the early pace from the inside, made a bid entering the drive and was just up for the place. FIRE OF GOLD
stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded but just missed the place. SWIFTOWN MISS dueled from the inside
early, remained engaged through the turn but could not keep pace in the drive. HONEST WOMAN was no real factor. JET SWEEP was never close. FLAT
OUT BIG MONEY was no threat.
