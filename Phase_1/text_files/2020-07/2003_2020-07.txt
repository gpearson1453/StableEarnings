Footnotes
HEARTFULLOFSTARS settled off the rail, urged upon through the turn, move forward four wide, took over in upper stretch and drove clear then hand urged
in the late stages. HORSE GREEDY asked early and vied between rivals for command, dueled with OUTLAW around the turn and gained a short
advantage midway around the bend, inched away into the stretch from the two path, relinquished control to HEARTFULLOFSTARS in the drive but kept on
well to prove second best. FABOZZI attended pace the pace five deep, bumped with RICKEY B entering the turn, chased the top pair then bid three deep
on the turn, failed to sustain momentum in the lane, weakened and held the show. RICKEY B vied three deep, bumped with with FABOZZI into the turn,
chased two wide, came out some in the lane and weakened. OUTLAW vied from the inside, dueled with HORSE GREEDY around the bend, then gave way
in the stretch. CONCUR vied four deep and between runners early, put in tight quarters and steadied nearing the half-mile pole, moved to the inside and
lacked a rally.

outside, gained the lead inside the furlong marker and drew clear under urging. MARKET SENTIMENT tracked, inside, moved out a path on the turn, angled
out in the stretch and finished well. C DUB set the pace under pressure, inched away on the turn, carried the lead to the eighth pole and weakened late but
saved the show. KING PARKER mid-pack in the early going, raced outside a rival on the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, brushed with
rival in upper stretch and missed the show honors. BURN ME TWICE broke well, up close just outside the leader, raced three wide around the turn, brushed
with rival in upper stretch and weakened after. SEVERIN settled outside rival, angled in and saved ground around the turn, angled out in the lane and could
not rally. PAPA TURF pressed the pace inside, lost contact with the leader approaching the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
PROUD PEDRO (FR) unhurried in the beginning, raced a bit off the rail then moved to the inside, two wide into the last turn then tipped out into the three
path, put to a drive entering the stretch, rallied to the front and proved best late. NORTH COUNTY GUY stalked a bit off the rail and outside the leader,
moved up to press the leader up the backstretch, gained command and led into the drive, cleared in upper stretch, challenged from the outside by the
winner and was outkicked in the late stages. BORDER TOWN stalked inside, pulled from the three-quarter marker to the half-mile pole, settled into the
stride after and stayed inside, angled out in the stretch and lacked a bid. CATCH THE EYE raced in range and outside a rival to the final turn, asked in the
drive and never responded to urging. SOUTHERN KING controlled the pace early, pressured by rival up the backstretch, fought with that rival around the
last turn to the three-sixteenths pole and faded in the lane.

BIG SWEEP stalked the leader from the outside, ranged up alongside rival on the turn, took control and moved clear in upper stretch and stayed clear to the
wire. BEEN STUDYING HER raced inside to the turn, moved out into the two path, chased the winner through the lane and finished willingly. SMILING
SHIRLEE settled off the rail, four into the turn, three wide leaving the bend and went evenly through the final furlong. LOUD LOUD MUSIC sped to the front,
set the pace up the backstretch, raced two wide then angled to the rail on the turn, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane and gave way

BULLETPROOF ONE sped clear and angled over to the inside, set the pace from the two path into the turn, led clear exiting the bend, drifted out in the
stretch under urging and won easily. QUERELLE hopped at the start, raced along the inside, angled out entering the stretch, finished well and earned the
place. GYPSY BLU chased three wide around the turn and into the stretch and held the show. MISS HOT LEGS chased the pace from the inside to the
stretch and went evenly in the final furlong. SHINES HER LIGHT (IRE) raced outside a rival, three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and improved
position. FANTASY HEAT chased off the inside, came three wide into the lane and failed to rally. AMUSE traveled four wide, moved closer into the turn,
exited the bend four wide and also lacked a rally. TIJORI chased off the rail, steadied between near the seven-sixteenths pole, swung five wide into the lane
and weakened. SOLD IT settled, traveled two wide around the turn, forced out and steadied entering the stretch, angled to the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
PREACHING TRAINER reserved off the inside, checked off the heels of a rival and altered out on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, closed and got
up in the final moments. UNDENIABLE PROOF dueled for the lead outside a rival, held command in the lane and resisted through the final furlong but was
edged by the winner. TOO LATE stalked three deep, three wide into the stretch, came out past the eighth pole, rallied outside the leader but lacked the
needed late punch to go by and missed the place. OFFSHORE AFFAIR tossed head and shuffled back at the start, unhurried in the early going, traveled off
the rail, steered out and came four wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out and closed well. FOSTER BOI bumped leaving the gate,
traveled outside a rival, came four wide into the lane, angled out mid-stretch and finished well. DOC TOMMY broke in and bumped rival, stalked between
rivals, checked into the turn, went three wide into the drive and finished evenly. SMOKIN BLACKJACK stalked inside, checked into the turn and flattened in
the late stages. TIZHOTNDUSTY settled early, steadied behind rivals on the turn, continued a bit off the rail to the lane, awaited room past the eighth pole
and kept on to the wire. ETTERBAY UCKLAY raced outside a rival, went two wide into the stretch, angled out at the eighth pole but could not find the
needed late response. GREAT ULYSSES chased inside, steadied past the half-mile pole, dropped back into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and could
not rally. BAM BAM AGAIN tracked four wide on the turn, forced out by rival leaving the bend, came in some in the lane and had little left for the drive.
UTALKNBOUTPRACTICE dueled for the lead from the inside and weakened in the drive.

SEPTEMBER SECRET stalked off the rail then outside a rival, moved up and collared the leader near the quarter pole, quickly cleared and powered away
under mild hand urging then ridden out to the wire. STARS OF BLUEGRASS tracked off the inside, inched forward around the turn, traveled two wide into
the lane, responded when asked but could not threaten the winner while clearly second best. BIG MAMA SUE stalked the pace to the turn, raced three wide
then angled out and came six wide into the lane, showed a mild rally and earned the show. MUCHA WOMAN dropped her head and was off slow to begin,
advanced into the turn, raced four wide around the bend and weakened in the drive. BIG DRESS chased from the inside, angled out and exited the turn
three wide and never produced a bid. SPICY SOMMELIER bumped at the start, set the pace and angled over to the inside, could not match the winner into
the stretch and faded through the lane. MONICAT allowed to settle in the early going, raced two wide into the lane, split foes in the stretch and passed tired
rivals. DECORATE bumped leaving the gate, settled outside a rival then between foes on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and never threatened.
BE MICE ELF off slow to begin, traveled along the inside, saved ground into the lane and came up empty. DANCING DANA unhurried in the early going,
went three deep on the turn then drifted out a bit late on the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
SOLITAIRE chased from the inside, climbed near the three-eighths pole, angled out into the stretch, rallied to the front past the eighth pole and drew away.
ARYA'S DAGGER up close four deep, bid three deep on the turn, gained the lead near the quarter pole, cleared briefly in upper stretch but proved no match
for the winner in the late stages. POLAR ROUTE stalked off the rail and outside rival, floated out into the lane and held the show. ALICIA'S PRIDE trailed
the field up the backstretch from the inside, angled seven wide around the turn, asked and summoned a mild rally in the lane. CAMEO SHORES settled
early, raced between runners, checked near the three-eighths pole, angled three wide around the bend, shifted out near the eighth pole and kept on
willingly. FOXY CARMELA set the pace under pressure from both sides, fought back two wide and weakened in the final furlong. DADDYS REAL DIVA
chased off the rail, drifted out into the stretch then again near the eighth pole and lacked a response when called upon. SAPPHIRE SILK pressed the pace
from the inside and weakened in the drive. SHALLOW chased off the rail, four to five wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and never rallied.
SOME ROYALTY broke well then chased off the rail, went four wide around the turn and weakened. KUDA HURAA up close three deep and between rivals
early, lost ground around the turn and faded through the lane. ENRICHED BY DEB tracked from off the rail, angled six wide around the turn and came up
empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
LINCOLN CITY stalked the pace inside, went up to apply pressure near the seven-sixteenths pole, lost contact with the leader again and chased into the far
turn, bid between rivals nearing the quarter pole and drew clear under urging. SUCCEEDANDSURPASS (IRE) pulled early, raced three wide then outside a
rival on the backstretch, went three wide into the stretch, closed and got up for second. EASTERN OCEAN broke in and bumped rival at the start, stalked
outside a rival, bid three deep near the quarter pole, outkicked by the winner and edged for the place. OF GOOD REPORT raced between rivals and two
wide into the first turn, tracked off the rail, angled four wide, split foes in the stretch, showed late effort and missed the show honors. COLOSI reserved from
the inside, angled out into the stretch, shifted in mid-stretch and impeded STORM THE BASTILLE, and finished with a mild bid late. CITY RAGE raced
between rivals into the first turn, stalked a bit off the rail, steadied briefly into the second turn, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and finished evenly.
THE STREET FIGHTER raced two wide into the first turn then outside a rival, went three wide into the stretch and improved position. REPROBATE traveled
two wide then came out on the backstretch, swung six wide into the lane and finished willingly. MADMAN went three wide into the first turn, tracked off the
rail, exited the far turn five wide and lacked a rally. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) bumped leaving the gate, tracked inside, pulled from the five-eighths to the
just past the nine-sixteenths marker, steadied near the three-eighths pole, impeded by COLOSI near mid-stretch and faded after. TRIPOLI stalked off the
rail, went four wide into the lane and weakened. DARK PRINCE away quickly, set the pace inside, pressured on the backstretch then inched away from
rival, challenged from the outside into the drive and gave way. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL PLACED BY THE RIDER ABOARD STORM THE
BASTILLE AGAINST COLOSI FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED COLOSI FROM FIFTH
TO TENTH FOR IMPEDIING STORM THE BASTILLE IN MID-STRETCH.
