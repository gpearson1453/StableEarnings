EZEE ENOUGH dueled from the inside early, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the eighth pole
and was well clear while lightly roused. PORTABELLA MOON stalked the early pace outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when sat down
for the drive but was no match for the winner while just lasting for the place. DAD'S STAR CAT outrun early, advanced through the turn, responded but was
no match and just missed the place. HEATHER DIVINE forced the early pace inside but had nothing for the drive. KARAT MAMA was never a factor. DIXIE
LOVING dueled from between foes and faded.
