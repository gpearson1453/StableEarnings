Footnotes
R WILD CHILD set a pressured early pace inside, shook off OUR LITTLE DEVIL approaching the stretch, and remained clear under a drive. OUR LITTLE
DEVIL pressed the pace outside R WILD CHILD to the stretch, and ran on to save the place. MORE DIAMONDS eyed the battling leaders to the stretch,
and finished one-paced. MIRANDA SOFIA got bumped hard by SAY BYE BYE and knocked into RENEESINHEAVEN at the start, lagged well back for
three furlongs, and rallied outside for a share. FURY SONG moved in to the two-path entering the turn, and was no factor through an even effort. TRINNI
FLOWER saved ground to no avail. MAKE A MINT was never prominent. SANDBAH broke in bumping SAY BYE BYE into MIRANDA SOFIA, came five
wide off the turn and made no headway. RENEESINHEAVEN got bumped by MIRANDA SOFIA at the start, and was outrun. SAY BYE BYE was solidly
bumped into MIRANDA SOFIA by SANDBAH at the start, and was always far back. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
MASHUGANA was ridden along chasing after the leaders on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, and rallied determinedly to overhaul WORLD GONE
WILD from outside. WORLD GONE WILD sped clear after the start, showed the way slightly off the rail to the stretch, remained clear to late, but could not
hold off the winner. MISSING LINK bumped with MELANIE'S PRIDE at the start, chased outside WORLD GONE WILD to the stretch, and lacked the
needed closing response. ACTING LUCKY raced three wide around the turn, and was not a factor. DIAL A LADY made no impact two wide. STORMY
JESS was through early four wide. SHAKEM was outrun four wide. MELANIE'S PRIDE bumped with MISSING LINK at the start, and was always well back.

Footnotes
A BEAUTIFUL DAY prompted the pace two wide, got roused approaching the stretch, overpowered QUEEN FIELD readily and kicked clear while shifting in.
AFFICIONADO (FR) tracked from close range inside for six furlongs, rallied in the two-path through the drive and finished well. INTEREST saved ground on
the turns, had the rider lose the whip at the top of the lane, moved out and rallied mildly on her left lead. MISS MY MACHO broke out bumping OCALA,
stayed close three wide early, loomed a threat turning for home but flattened out. PERT hesitated at the start spotting the field several lengths, trailed to the
stretch and gained outside late. OCALA was bumped by MISS MY MACHO at the start, entered the first turn four wide, and could not reach contention.
QUEEN FIELD was keyed up setting the pace through moderate fractions, and gave way on the rail in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SOPHISTICURL hooked up outside FRANKLY MY DEAR out of the gate, battled head and head throughout and prevailed for a hard-fought decision in the
final strides. FRANKLY MY DEAR dueled inside SOPHISTICURL virtually every step of the way, and was edged out in the closing yards. RAINING
SUNSHINE cut the corner rallying into the stretch, moved out with aim at the leaders through the furlong grounds, but was one-paced to the finish. BATTLE
CRY raced in the middle of the field two then three wide to the top of the lane, moved farther out and lacked a bid. NAVAL WAVE was three wide off the
dueling leaders around the turn, and faded in the stretch. NYSSA was forwardly placed two wide to the quarter-pole, and tired. WHISTLER DIXIE was
finished early three wide. CAUSINGAHULLBALOO bumped with MANGROVE MAMMA at the start, came under a ride into the turn, and had no response.
GULF COAST GAL broke slowly, came five wide off the turn and dropped far back. MANGROVE MAMMA became edgy in the gate dislodging the rider,
bumped with CAUSINGAHULLBALOO at the start, raced greenly behind horses early, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
GETTHE MUNY BERNIE pressed the pace outside R NINJA J K, wrested command through mid stretch, and edged clear under a drive. AMERICAN
PHENOM was outsprinted to the stretch, split horses entering the final furlong, and finished well outside. R NINJA J K set a pressured pace inside, and
weakened through the late stages. JUSTCUZIFEELLIKEIT raced in range to the stretch two wide, and lacked a rally. REINOANIMAUX was no factor.
CHAMBERLAIN chased inside for three furlongs, and tired in the stretch. R PRIVATE JET was up with the leaders after the start, got shuffled back severely
on the rail approaching the turn, and never recovered.

Footnotes
CITIBIKE chased two wide to the stretch, stayed on task through a long drive and got up outside TIPSY AGAIN through the closing yards. TIPSY AGAIN
sped to the front and cleared inside, neglected to change leads in the stretch and shortened stride late. MIZ CHAPLIN was put to the whip early, had to be
taken hold of behind the pacesetter going to the turn, made no headway on the rail when roused again near the three-eighths, got taken out three wide at
the top of the stretch, and was going well too late. MARCHING IN tossed her head right before the start and lunged slightly coming out, trailed far back for
three furlongs inside, stayed on the rail and gained without threatening. CHIQUI THE GRAY raced well back three then four wide early, and gained belatedly
on the far outside. MISS MAC chased three wide to the stretch, and tired. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA was put to pressure on the turn two then three wide,
and was empty.

Footnotes
OVER THE CHANNEL edged closer to AZRAEL two wide around the far turn, took over from outside in upper stretch, and drew clear under pressure.
RHYTHMIA raced three wide in the second flight early, came four wide for the drive, drifted out while rallying late and was up for second. TIL THE END was
outrun inside to the far turn, shifted out three wide approaching the lane, moved farther out through the furlong grounds and was bothered a bit outside
RHYTHMIA in the final yards. AZRAEL brushed with MOZO BELLO at the start, vied early outside TOTONO, cleared off and moved inside after a
quarter-mile, could not hold off the winner at the top of the stretch, and faded late. TOTONO argued the early pace inside AZRAEL before backing off,
stayed close on the rail to the stretch, and weakened. MOZO BELLO broke through the gate prior to the start, brushed with AZRAEL after the start, and
lacked the needed response. SOUPER COURAGE was never prominent. SUBLIME APPEAL stayed in range three wide for six furlongs, and tired.
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL was slow from the gate, and trailed throughout.

DECKOLOGY popped clear soon after the start, built a lengthy advantage slightly off the rail, moved out another path through the stretch and was kept
busy. STEADILY was slowest to begin after bumping with ROBIN'SBLINDDEAL, saved ground advancing mildly on the turn, moved out to the four-path
through upper stretch and rallied to go clear of the others. STORM THE BRIDGE bumped with WHERE YA GOIN OWEN and brushed with THE BIG
JOKER at the start, got bumped between those two again early, moved inside entering the turn, and finished with good courage on the rail to get up for
third. ROBIN'SBLINDDEAL bumped with STEADILY at the start, chased four wide to the stretch, and weakened. POPPY'S DESTINY chased between
horses three wide, and faded before completing a half-mile. THE SPIDER chased outside the winner to the top of the lane, and gave way. ETERNAL
CROSS bumped with WHERE YA GOIN OWEN soon after the start, bumped lightly with the same rival near the five-eighths pole, and dropped far back.
THE BIG JOKER broke out brushing STORM THE BRIDGE at the start, bumped with the same foe after a quarter-mile, and dropped far back four wide.
WHERE YA GOIN OWEN bumped with ETERNAL CROSS shortly after the start, got bumped between that one and STORM THE BRIDGE getting shuffled
back past the five-eighths, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
SONAR was innermost of a foursome contesting the early pace, could not stay with LORILOUPIES into the turn, moved out and rebid in the four-path after
a half-mile, collared the leader from outside a sixteenth out and drove clear on her left lead. LORILOUPIES contested the pace four wide early, cleared off
and moved in a path on the turn, drifted out a bit weakening past the eighth-pole, and remained clear of the others. THISSMYTIME argued the early pace
between horses three wide, dropped back on the turn, moved inside for the drive and ran on evenly. JEANA'S GEM sat off the embattled leaders from close
range, lost ground on the turn, and offered nothing more outside late. TRUE ATKA saved ground outsprinted to the turn, and never factored. R U ROYALTY
vied two wide between horses early, and retreated on the turn. CAJUN DELIGHT was three wide into the turn, and stopped before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
TIME FOR TROUBLE bumped with DRAMATIC KITTEN at the start, advanced outside through the middle stages, moved in cutting the corner under a drive
late on the far turn, got through on the rail as ALPERES drifted out through upper stretch, moved clear and was geared down late. STARSHIP MUFASA
was keyed up between horses contesting the early pace, got shuffled back leaving the first turn, went along behind and between foes up the backstretch,
rebid three wide turning for home, could not kick on with the winner but bested the others. ALPERES vied three wide into the first turn, moved inside battling
with DRAMATIC KITTEN through the middle stages, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. POWER (BRZ) tracked from close range three wide for six
furlongs, and lacked a solid final response. FUTURE PRINCE saved ground to the far turn, had the two-path into the lane and had no rally. K'S FUNHOUSE
lost contact with the field early, moved to the far outside in the stretch and went by tired horses. DRAMATIC KITTEN bounced off the left side of the gate
and into TIME FOR TROUBLE at the start, went up four wide with the leaders around the first turn, vied outside ALPERES through the middle stages, and
gave way turning for home. FUEGO broke out pushing UKNOWTHEDRILL out, entered the first turn four wide near the back, and remained outrun.
MIGHTY FAST bumped with KATZ ME AT NOON at the start, contested the early pace on the rail, and was finished after a half-mile. UKNOWTHEDRILL hit
the left side of the gate and was pushed out by FUEGO at the start, raced four wide and dropped far back after six furlongs. KATZ ME AT NOON bumped
with MIGHTY FAST at the start, steadied first time through the stretch, checked sharply and steadied along fighting restraint on the first turn, continued hard
to handle up the backstretch, was empty when asked, and was eased up in the lane.
