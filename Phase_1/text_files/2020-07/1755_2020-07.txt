Footnotes
JERRID tracked the leader in third to the stretch, then cruised past that foe at the eighth pole for the win. HERE'S CARLOS ran between runners at the rear
to the stretch and gained late for second after coming wide leaving the far turh. BOLD PROPHET led at the rail on the first turn, stayed in front till losing the
lead in the final furlong and got beat for place at the wire. VAN DAMME was reluctant to load, raced unhurrued inside two foes, and improved position in the
stretch. DETERMINATOR stalked the leader in second, was urged in upper stretch and flattened out past the eighth marker. ALPHA BOY raced outside two
horses ealrly, was unhurried, widest on the backstretch, under the whip on the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
AULD CUP was off slow, urged, raced mid pack to the turn, was put under a ride, continued evenly down the stretch and accelerated at the sixteenth to
prevail. OSVALDO was unhurried, rallied in upper stretch, shifted in, and gave way late to lose the win. COME ON VENEZUELA had the lead off the rail to
deep stretch and faltered. GRADE was bumped at the start, stalked the leader, moved up on the turn and was bothered in the stretch. CAPE MARCO
DRIVE waited to the far turn, was placed under the whip there and improved postion. ONE THIRTY NINE moved up inside nearing the turn and ran even.
KING JUSTICE bumped a horse at the start, was last early and naver threatened. CAUSEWAY CANDY bumped a horse at the start, stalked right behind
the leader, but dropped back at the rail down the lane. GUNNY ROO was bumped at the start, parked on the rail early and no threat. The rider of GRADE
lodged an objection alleging interference by OSVALDO in the stretch but the stewards disallowed it and made no change to the order of finsish.

WEST BURKE good position to far turn, caught up with leaders inside and gamely prevailed at the wire in a gutsy effort. WEST VIRGINIA PAM just behind
leaders to stretch, forged to short lead at the furlong marker but was outfinished. MOMOS HUMOR staggered at the start, far back to far turn fanned widest
with a good effort to finish well. MACHINE GUN MERRY off in a tangle, trailed to the stretch ran on late and moved up. MIRIANA'S QUEEN had a bad start
never a real factor while improving position only. DULCE MARIA hugged the rail throughout to bid stretch, moved up late. SEVEN SEVENTEEN speed to
the front, held to far turn, backed up in the stretch. LISNET never a factor. GRAY NAY failed to menace. BACCARAT chased leader to far turn, gave way
readily. DAISY JANE never a factor far back. SALLY good position to the stretch,pulled up in the stretch in distress.

ALEXANDRIA dueled inside from the backstretch to deep stretch, drifted out a bit late and proved best. GONNABEGOOD was off slow, eager to go to the
front, engaged in a long duel with the winner, was floated out a bit in deep stretch and held well for second while beat for the win. ANGEL'S SASSY was
never far back, rallied three wide on the turn, gave game chase down the lane but could not catch the top pair. CONGRATS JENSEN dueled between to the
turn, backed away and flattened out. TAP THE TOWN moved closer early but came up empty. LEJEUNE dwelt and refused to break.

Footnotes
DISTINCTIVE FLOWER opened a huge lead early, then maintained an advantage while holding off the closers in the lane. BIRDACIOUS was bumped at
the start, raced last early, moved up to mid pack on the rail nearing the far turn, and was inside moving fastest late. LEONA'S REWARD was an unhurried
second to the stretch, ran on to rally with the field in the lane but was beat late for the place. GRIZABELLA dropped back on the backstretch, rallied in
tandem with a horse while six wide on the far turn, and moved up. WATCH HER STRUT raced between horses on the backstretch, rallied in the three path
on the far turn and lost position late. CALI DREAM was bumped at the start, put under restraint early and improved position in the stretch. DRILLIT was
widest on the backstretch, briefly improved down the stretch but lost position late. MEP was bumped at the start, ran mid pack, was making a move in the
stretch but was bumped and squeezed back, losing position. FLAT OUT BEAUTY was off slow and no factor. HERE COMES JIGS contended for a quarter,
then faded, and was bumped late while losing position.

Footnotes
SCAT'S CHOICE rushed outside, accelerated to lead turn, ran off in good fashion through the final furlong. A LOT OF SPUNK good position to the turn, no
match for winner while clearly second best. MARIAH'S GIRL rushed to contend to the turn and was in an all out drive to come back for the show spot in a
good effort. SPECIAL BLUE sharp to the front, overtaken out of the turn by the winner and faded back. LONGDRINKOFWATER broke a bit slow, recovered
,rushed on the turn with a wide trip. LOVE'S TAVITO good position to the turn, could not go on with no response when needed. SUMMER WAR inside trip to
the stretch, went around tiring ones and backed up. CRIMSON LUCK had an awkward start while lunging at the start while never a contender thereafter.
SEAWARD was slow to begin and never a factor thereafter. MY MARGARET ANNE never a menace throughout. FRONT CIRCLE broke flat footed from the
gate and never menaced,
