Footnotes
THE TWO NANCY'S set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. BEKKI'S DANCE well placed
and off the rail, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place. TAPPING THE KITTY tracked the
pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for racing room, then weakened late and held the show. U
KNOW I B LION hopped at the start, stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane and weakened in the drive. SURFINA broke a step
slowly and improved position. THIRTY NINE SEVEN mid pack, moved up four wide through the turn,then had no stretch rally. EMMY SHIMMY was never
involved.
