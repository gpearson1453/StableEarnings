Footnotes
SAMURAI GIRL controlled the pace from the onset, drew away leaving the turn and was kept to task. SNEAKY SISTER stalked the pace racing three to
four wide, chased the leader into the lane but was no match for the winner. MOE'SANNIE raced near the back of the pack, came under a ride into the lane
and closed well for show. SOPHIA SAID WHAT sat in range from the five path, was asked for response turning for home but lacked the closing response
needed. LITTLE ROSALYN sat in striking position, dropped back through the turn and tired. FOOLISH BLUE MOON was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
PACIORETTY pressured the early pace from the rail, moved up alongside RAINY BAY to challenge the lead, dueled into the stretch then gained a short
advantage mid stretch and prevailed under a long drive. RAINY BAY vied between rivals for the early lead, responded to challenge from PACIORETTY
leaving the backstretch, dueled outside of the fore mentioned from the turn into the stretch and gave way grudgingly after a long drive. FROBISHER BAY
sat in striking distance of the pacesetters, lodged a rail bid into the lane but was unable to improve contending position through the stretch. WHERE'S THE
GOLD stumbled leaving the gate then trailed the field and closed gamely late. RAYREADY reserved early and failed to menace. CARLOT COWBOY
prompted the pace from the four path, was unable to move on with rivals and faded.

REGAL CANDY broke alertly, sat in striking position from the four path, ranged up three wide at the half marker, rallied determinedly from between rivals
and inched up in the final strides. TOMAHAWK EXPLORER bumped away from the gate then quickly went to the front, was under attack entering the lane,
responded to challenge from outside rivals, battled gamely inside through the stretch but was out finished. ZBIG sat five wide in striking range, bid four wide
at the head of the lane, drifted inward mid stretch then steadied behind rivals and yielded. HUSTLE HOME broke inward bumping into TOMAHAWK
EXPLORER, prompted action leaving the backstretch from a rail position, was unable to move on with rivals into the lane, wilted then was vanned off.
DIEGO'S DAY hustled away and was done early.

PIPER ROSE saved ground early, moved up into striking range through the backstretch, chased into the stretch then ran down rivals from outside in time.
DAZZLING CHIC quickest leaving the chute, contended the pace from the rail, responded to looming threat from CITY OF PEARLS and was run down late
but was able to hold on for place honors. CITY OF PEARLS prompted from outside, chased the leader into the lane, rallied determinedly under steady
encouragement, gained ground outside and just missed out. LYLA LORRAINE stalked three wide, angled towards the rail entering the far turn, shifted out
into the stretch chasing the leaders and failed to threaten in the drive. SOMETHING ABOUT ME threw head when leaving breaking awkwardly, hustled
through the backstretch into striking range and lacked a closing response. ALY'S LAST MAGIC trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TRIPLE POWER set a pressed pace, responded gamely to challenge from PRESS GANG then prevailed under a long hard drive. PRESS GANG tracked
the pacesetters from the rail, ranged up three wide into the lane, moved up alongside TRIPLE POWER at the head of the stretch but was not quite good
enough late to get by. SHIMS SHADOW angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, shifted out then chased into the stretch and held for show.
ALBERTA BOUND allowed to settle outside, chased outside into the lane, was gaining ground late and flattened out. SIBERIAN BEAR settled just off the
rail, swung out into the lane and passed tiring rivals. VISION QUEST chased mid pack and failed to threaten. HERE COMES BARNEY pressed the pace
from the four path, was unable to move on with rivals and tired.

Footnotes
CAN'T TOUCH THIS sat in striking position from the four path, went in pursuit of the leader then rallied determinedly outside of TROOPER JENNY, came
together mid stretch under right handed encouragement and was out finished under a long drive. TROOPER JENNY contested the early pace, disposed of
inside rival but was quickly met with a serious threat from CAN'T TOUCH THIS entering the stretch, came together mid stretch under steady heavy urging
and narrowly prevailed under a long hard drive. MISS MCFAD sat in range from the five path, chased the leaders through the turn, was gaining ground
gradually outside and missed out. PARIS IN PLAY lagged early and offered a late bid. CHRISSY'S CHROME lacked early speed, lodged a mild bid then
flattened out through stretch. MIXED MEDIA pressured the early pace from the rail, was unable to move on with the rivals entering the lane and wilted
abruptly then was eased. IT'S THEATRE TIME saved ground inside and was outrun. **JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of CAN'T
TOUCH THIS against the rider of TROOPER JENNY alleging interference deep stretch was upheld after review and TROOPER JENNY was disqualified
and placed second for interference.

Footnotes
VICTORY SHADOW attended the pace from the five path, inherited the lead at the quarter pole, responded to looming threat from GONE LONG GONE,
drew clear into the stretch and held under a late drive from SPANISH DIVA. SPANISH DIVA reserved off pacesetters, took closer order through the turn, bid
four wide into the lane, closed well late and missed. PRINCESS PONTI contested the early pace from between rivals, was unable to move on with rivals
leaving the turn and stayed on under encouragement to secure show honors. NORTHERN STRYKER broke outward and slow then trailed the field, gained
closer order under encouragement and rallied belatedly. GONE LONG GONE prompted the early pace from the rail, lost ground through the turn, lodged a
rail bid into the lane but had nothing left in reserve for the drive. CLASSIC TARTAN sat in striking distance outside, raced wide into the lane and lacked
serious bid. AMBER RIDGE lacked the early speed that was needed, was allowed to settle off the pacesetters then angled inward racing into the turn and
faded. EMERALD CANYON pressed three to four wide, steadied at the five sixteenth pole, was roused into the lane under right handed urging then steadied
and yielded.

Footnotes
HARD TO COME HOME vied between rivals, dueled outside of DRAYMAGIC leaving the final turn, rallied determinedly outside under good handling and
won driving. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, chased through the turn then took advantage of rail opening into the
lane, rallied gamely inside and missed. DRAYMAGIC contested the pace from the rail, moved up to challenge HARD TO COME HOME for the lead, was
under steady encouragement entering the stretch from between rivals and weakened late. OJO DEL MAR away quickly to set a pressured pace, raced three
to four wide entering the turn, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed. METRO DREAMER last away from the gate, chased wide in the final turn and
was unable to improve contending position through the stretch. XTREME DENIGRAY hurried early and chased to no avail. ALL MIGHTY BO allowed to
settle early outside and offered little. SUNNY TRUCE saved ground inside and was done early. IMPOSING CAT tracked outside, had no response when
asked and tired.

Footnotes
OOPS BUSTED contested the pace from inside, gained the lead into the far turn, drew away from the three eighths pole, was kept to task through the
stretch and held safely under a late drive from HI DREAMIN. HI DREAMIN tracked the pacesetters outside, chased into the lane, was gaining ground on the
leader but was no match and finished clearly second best. PLAY FOR HONOR saved ground inside, swung three wide at the quarter pole and closed well
belatedly. BYRE DECREE squeezed out leaving the gate, trailed the field, swung wide leaving the turn and rallied belatedly. LITTLE NEW YORK sat mid
pack and showed some interest late. SEDITION settled inside early, was roused at the quarter pole along the rail the lodged a mild bid into the stretch.
INBETWEEN US sent for speed outside, was overtaken leaving the backstretch, chased into the lane and gave way. ALREDI FANCY hustled early, was
never far back through the backstretch and passed tiring rivals late. SCARLETTE ROSE offered little. RUSTY SHOE PENNY reluctant to load then flipped
with rider before loading, broke alertly showing some early speed and faded gradually.
