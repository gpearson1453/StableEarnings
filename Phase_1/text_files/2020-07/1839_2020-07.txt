BAYLEAF eased back and to the outside before the opening quarter, bid on the turn, led narrowly in mid-stretch and proved best following a long drive.
MUCHA MUCHACHA underwenta shoe repair in the paddock, bumped with inside rival at the start, vied inside and battled gamely to the finish. TIZ A
SHARPIE dropped back off the pace early, continued willingly while no threat. IWASBORNAWINNER bumped at the start, rushed up inside,three wide on
the turn and faded. BRYCE'S PHILLY dueled outside for half a mile and weakened. STAY SALTY trailed her field chasing inside and was never in
contention. PASCHA PASCHA stumbled badly at the start losing her rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race.

HEATHERLY, in the five path rounding the first turn, moved in and raced two wide entering the backstretch, rallied to the lead near quarter pole, was fully
extended to deep stretch and then was being eased up. YES MZ ADAH set the pace along the rail then was no match. BIG RED SEVEN broke in a tangle,
split rivals on the final turn and passed faders. PRETTY COOL CAT, three wide and not far back, tired. FLEUR DE FORCE saved ground and stopped.
SARATOGA BY DESIGN stalked two wide, stopped suddenly and was eased. FLIPPITY FLOP stumbled leaving the gate, was far back and was eased
when hopelessly beaten.

Footnotes
MANIPULATE quickly took control, widened after the half, remained safe but was kept to a drive while never threatened. DUBROVSKY settled off the pace
then rallied along the rail with a gradual gain. SURFER BOY GEORGE chased just off the inside and continued well while no threat. KNOKKE BY THE SEA
lagged far behind inside, moved out on the final turn passing fading rivals. HAIL TO THE KING stalked the winner three wide, made a brief bid on the final
turn then faded. SYNERGIZED saved ground close up, angled wide on the final turn and tired. KION settled wide off the leaders then stopped abruptly.
ANTRIM AUBREY broke slowest, chased wide and lost contact with his field.

PETULANT DELIGHT got to the rail entering the backstretch, set the pace inside under rating, drift out entering the lane, was straightened under pressure
and was taken in hand late. AMI'S ARTIE, racing just off the rail, took up chase but was no match. BOAT OVER THE HILL saved ground to near mid
stretch, eased out and was no threat. QUENCH MY THIRST raced outside and tired. VOCAB, two wide, failed to menace. DELINQUENT, wide, showed
little. JONES TAXI was never a threat. DON POLO, outside winner early, stopped.

STORM FACTOR reserved inside, split rivals rallying into the stretch, collared the leader passing the eighth pole and drew clear. GLORY SONG set a
pressured pace inside, was clear briefly into the stretch then outfinished. NOBLE AUTHORITY rated off the inside, swung wide advancing into the stretch
but flattened out. HIZAAM stalked the leaders three wide then weakened in the stretch. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE prompted the leader to the stretch then came
up empty. THE FAIRLEE BOYS was fanned wide on the first turn and never in contention. The race was contested with the rail out 22 feet and fractional

B B'S BUSTED under firm restraint to the stretch, swung wide advancing rapidly and surged away while kept under pressure. MORGAN'S Z VA forced the
pace, dueled into the stretch and continued willingly. TIG TOG (IRE) settled far behind then closed well inside through the stretch. QUESTEQ rated just off
the leaders inside then flattened out in the stretch. MA DE TAW earned a narrow advantage inside rivals and weakened in the stretch. SHE'S PRIMO made
a menacing wide bid on the final turn then faded. MISS JEN dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. SWEET TURN prompted the pace
three wide for half a mile then gave way. WHITNEY COVE broke slowest, was put to the whip early but had no response. CHANCEE chased near mid-pack
and stopped abruptly. The race was contested with the rail 22 feet out and no fractional times were available.

SIR BACK IN BLACK angled in on the backstretch, swung out on the turn, took the lead in deep stretch and edged away with speed to spare. ASHRAQ was
slowest leaving gate, hustled to the lead inside, remained clear mid stretch but then was no match. BLACK LIGHT, bumped leaving gate, raced just off the
rail and faded late. ARK IN THE DARK, always well placed between foes, faded. STRICTLY THE BEST broke slowly then never threatened. MR PHIL came
in and bumped foe leaving the gate then had brief speed. WAR TOCSIN, three wide dueling, stopped.

up empty. HIBACHI rated close up inside then flattened out through the stretch. MASTERFUL TOUCH unruly loading, raced far behind and moved very
wide in the stretch. SAILOR AGAIN chased outside and began fading on the final turn. JOE FLASH dropped back inside and was never in contention.
