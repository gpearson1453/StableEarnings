Footnotes
MISCHIEVIOUSBUD set the pace from the outset from the two path, continued on a clear lead while off the rail into the lane, widened to the eighth pole and
held the clear advantage to the end. ASTROMAN chased near the inside through the turn, shifted into the five path under left-handed urging and was slowly
gaining to the end. AZZARO STEEL chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid near the quarter pole into the lane to appear a serious threat
then weakened inside the eighth pole. NEIGHBORLY veered to the rail at the start, raced near the rail through the turn and into the lane and moved up
while not a threat. PLAY UP was checked early when in tight, raced in the three path through the turn, was asked for more in late turn then tired. HENRY
RULES was off with a slight hop, raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and finished tired. GUARD was well back into the lane then passed
a couple tired ones. RILEY RICH chased the pace along the inside through the turn, was still a contender entering the lane and was empty. PUNKSTER
was in the four path into the turn and was done near the three-eighths pole. FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION. OTHER

with the top two late while finishing best of the rest. ORSETTO was in the four path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing response.

the lane from the six path and moved up while not a threat. STYLIN UPTOWN chased the pace from the three path through the turn then weakened after
turning into the lane. VOODOO JUSTICE in the four path through the turn and never was a factor. SLEWPY'S HALO was outrun while near the rail.

Footnotes
CATLIKE was quickly clear, raced in the two path into the turn, slowly widened through the turn and into the lane, moved to her largest advantage with an
eighth to go then held under minimal urging. KATIE GIRL chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path
and was up for the place spot. C J S SUZIE BYU settled early while in the two path, moved up through late turn and into the lane, was closest to the winner
with an eighth to go, could not gain on that one and lost the place spot very late. JUMP RIGHT IN raced in the two path through the turn when not far back,
came into the lane with a shot and did not respond. SPARKLING JUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was well placed into the
lane then tired. DYNASTY OF GOODS was near the rail through the turn and in the two path, angled into the six or seven path for the drive and was never a
factor. HELLO ADELE chased the pace into the turn while along the inside and steadily faded. SUNSET VALLEY was outrun while in the two or three path
through the turn. 1/4, 1/2 AND 5/8 TIMES WERE OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
COOK MEMORIES chased the three rival duel through the turn, tipped into the four path into the lane, moved to near even terms just outside the eighth
pole then inched to the front late. LOVE BROKE THRU was along the inside through the turn,angled into the three or four path into the lane, bid between
rivals outside the eighth pole, moved with the winner inside the eighth pole and was outfinished by that one. HOPPESTRY vied for the lead two wide
through the turn, repelled challenger after straightening in the lane, led with an eighth to go then yielded to the top two. BOLD CONCEPT was in the two
path through mid-turn, angled into the four path in late turn, came into the lane following the winner then moved up while not a serious threat. QUITE A
BABE chased the pace from the three path into the turn, bid three wide near the three-eighths pole, continued to duel for the top spot in late turn, gained a
short lead into the lane then weakened. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS vied for the lead along the inside into late turn then gave way to others. PAIGE'S STAR was
never a factor while in the three path through the turn. THE 1/4 TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

CALIFORNIA SWING was steadied early, rallied four wide on the far turn to take control, drew off and was conservative late. QUALITY STEP raced inside
and gained the place late. SCARLET CITY stalked inside, bid at the three-eighths pole to get a head in front briefly, but was no match. GIANT HONOR drew
off early, then was reeled in after a half. LORD REVELSTOKE was not a factor.
