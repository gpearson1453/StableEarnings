QUEENOFCATNIPHILL was content to track the lead early, shifted out for room and bumped a foe at the half mile, chased the leader gamely through the
far turn and advanced steadily to draw clear in late stretch. DROP DEAD GORGEOUS was bumped by a foe at the start, vied for the lead to the far turn, got
clear, was chased down by the winner in deep stretch while best ot the rest. PLATINUM GALE bumped a horse at the start, sat behind the pace off the rail,
was pushed on by the rider while travelling around the far turn and needed more of a late rally. SHE'S FLASHY was last of a compact field and passed a
tired foe in upper stretch. TENAKEE battled for the lead off the rail and dropped out on the far turn.

took over in the final furlong. R HOUDINI waited till the turn, was asked for run, then closed fastest to take second. FIGHTIN WITH PRIDE lunged a bit and
was bumped at the start, raced last on the outside, was called on for run on the turn, came widest into the stretch and passed faders late. GIVE ME A
CHANCE was bumped at the start, raced toward the rear while on the rail, was urged on the turn and passed faders down the stretch. RIDGE WEST was
bumped at the start, led inside, was asked in upper stretch but had no response. JACK SPARROW bumped a horse at the start, raced up close to mid

Footnotes
DREAMIN' OF MUNNY perfect position to far turn, asked for run and wore down leader. QUIET DAWN pressed pace to far turn, opened up into the stretch,
ran down. MALICED speed to first turn, led to the half, collard there, best of rest. BOURBON BLUSH through after half, dropped back. SKIP AND A HOP
through after half, faded back. ROBOTRON never a menace.

Footnotes
OLIVE U went to the lead outside a foe, vied to the sixteenth pole, put away that one and ran on to hold sway over the closers. NAUGHTY FACTOR raced
back off the pace while off the rail, rallied from inside on the turn and got up late to pass faltering horses. FRANKIE'S GIFT raced mid pack, took the four
path on the turn, and had a mild rally to pass faders in deep stretch. COMPANYS COMING bumped and steadied at the start, duelied off the rail to the
sixteenth pole and faltered. HELGA SHMELGA chased off the leaders, made a brief rally in upper stretch and flattened out at the eighth pole. SPOOFY
DOO stumbled and bumped a horse at the start, came very wide into the stretch and was no threat. TUBE SOX ROCK was between horses early, stayed
toward the back on the turn, and ran on the rail down the stretch.

rail to turn, rallied into stretch for the place spot and best of the rest. GALLOPING HARMONY pinched back after start, rushed off rail, settled for the show
spot while no menace for the top pair. KAYLEE'S HOPE raced evenly while lacking a late kick when needed. IT WILL HAPPEN sharp speed to the lead,
shortened stride quarter pole, empty. PSYCHOANALYST was through early and dropped back. TREASURE WILBURNYA never a factor.

OUR FLAG nursed along on the, shook free into the far turn and ran away as much best while geared down in the final furlong. MAKBULE stuck down
inside to far turn, angled out past the quarter pole while along for the place spot and clearly no match for the winner. STARSHIP FONZY perfect position to
far turn, could not keep up and settled for the third spot. SIR SWAYSALOT rated off leaders to far turn but came up empty from the quarter pole and
retreated. WIND TWIST improved position late while never a threat. RELMBUNKUS SYR no speed from the gate and only improved position late also. JILT
was through early and dropped far back. JUDGE JOHNNY never factored. MAGIC JACK tried to stay with winner to the half and surrendered with no fight
from that point. SEMIFINAL hopped at the start, raced between horses to the backstretch, went bad at the five siteenth pole and was subsequently, vanned
off in distress.

Footnotes
LA COYOTA sharp speed to the front,headed in the stretch and gamely held off challengers to secure the win at the wire. MI BELLA well placed while never
far back to the stretch, dug in late but repelled by the winner at the wire. BEAUTIFUL CREATURE had a terrible start, rushed outside, challenged winner at
the eighth pole but was used up and could go no further and weakened. TEMPERANCE ROAD inside run to turn, angled out while mildly in the stretch run.
LADY DAVID broke well outside, chased pace to the turn and gave way readily. MADAM NOVETZKE with winner to the turn and gave way readily in the
stretch. GLISTENING STAR never factored. NARIZ CANELA reserved to the turn with noting to offer at any call.
