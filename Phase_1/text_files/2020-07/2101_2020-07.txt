Footnotes
CHECOTAH quickly made the lead, led throughout and widened while racing well off the rail under mild urging. STAKES ON A PLANE was allowed to
settle, rallied in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was up for place. NORTHERN HEART was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch and improved
late. MARY ALICE had good position throughout, lacked a bid and went evenly. MARIE FROM PARIE chased the winner until mid stretch ,then tired.
UNIQUE HUMOR close up early was through after a half. TIKA flashed brief foot, then quickly gave way.
