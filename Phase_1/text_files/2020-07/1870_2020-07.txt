SHEZA FINE JUSTICE settled in a stalking position for a half, responded readily when set down, rallied four wide to make the lead past the furlong marker
and drew clear under right handed urging. DOLLY DEAR was in tight at the start, chased the leader while saving ground along the rail, rallied to make the
lead at the top of the stretch then couldn't handle the winner. SOLE FACTOR unhurried early, finished with good courage in the four path.
SWEETALKINGJUSTICE passed tiring rivals. GIFT FROM MOM chased the pace two wide into the stretch, steadied between horses nearing the furlong
marker then dropped out of it. JETTIN PEGASUS was no factor. PISTOL PACKIN BOS broke in front, set the pace in the two path to the top of the stretch
then folded. JEZABEL'S CHARM had brief speed.

with the winner two wide and finished second best. GIZMO JONES stalked the pace three wide, angled out to the six path and was steadily gaining ground
late. DARINGLY BOLD failed to menace. SUPER BEAU was through after a half. SOLAR MAXIMUS trailed.

HIGHLAND PARK HERO chased the leader from the four path, advanced steadily, the rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch, drew on even terms for
the lead past the furlong marker and proved best in a game effort under a strong hand ride. LEWYS VAPORIZER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, set the pace until deep stretch, dug in determinedly but finished second best. RULING EMPIRE trailed into the stretch then closed with a rush in the
six path. PACIFIC IMAGE had a brief early lead, stalked the pace along the rail and went evenly. NATIVE HAWK was no factor. SMALL TOWN HERO failed

pressured the winner until deep stretch then faded along the inside. MISTER MOBIL passed tiring rivals in the four path. WHO DAT MO saved ground and
lacked the needed response. MUSTANG WILLIE close up in the four path into the turn, weakened. POWERS OUT was through early. HOPPER HUNTER

Footnotes
STEPHANIE'S FAITH prompted the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, assumed command, set the balance of the pace, drifted too the five path and
just lasted under strong handling. RACINROSEMARY set the pace along the inside through the first turn, dropped back on the far turn, shifted outside the
winner, dug in while drifting out to the seven path, came on again and just missed. SPRING CITY GAL broke slowly, was outrun into the far turn then found
her best stride late inside. CASCABRIA passed tiring rivals in the two path. PRADO'S TRUST stalked the pace two wide for six furlongs then gave way.
SHINY SURPRISE had brief speed. FLASHY PATCH well placed for six furlongs, flattened out. GENTLE KISS was outrun. SHES JUST CAPITAL was
through after a half.
