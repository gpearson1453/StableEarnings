Footnotes
SHES A TRUE BEAUTY well placed angled out a bit near the half mile pole making a run into the far turn going clear there digging in from the two path
down the lane holding firm under pressure. ALLIE GRACE stalked close up angling inside on the far turn vying near the rail through the stretch saving place
in game fashion. SEEING'N'BELIEVING stalked close up pressing on the backside ceding then chasing rival on the far turn into upper stretch extending in
the three path there staying on to the end. COURTLY KITTY sent clear set the early pace being overtaken into the far turn chasing four wide down the lane.
VAUGHN gave a prompted middle move going evenly through the far turn, in range at mid track late lacked a closing punch. MIDNIGHT LEAP failed to
menace. SILENT SOFIA played no factor. BARONET faded on the far turn. MILLBANK MAGIC gave a prompted middle move then flattened out on the far
turn. SIMPLYIRRESISTIBLE raced second flight tiring on the far turn. Due to a timer malfunction the six furlong split was unavailable.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL B pressed the pace shaking clear along the inside in upper stretch holding under wide pressure late. OLGA AGAIN was boxed and forced to
steady briefly inside the three eighths pole quickly recovering angling out in upper stretch closing in late five and six wide. MATZO BELLA hustled on the
outside pursued losing ground to upper stretch holding position late in the eight path. HELL'S A POPPIN broke well chasing through the turn, weakened
some in upper stretch finishing evenly near mid track. THALIA'S SONG was checked hard on the rail near the three eighths pole. STARRY AFFAIR played
no factor. PRISSY SISSY chased through the turn then faded six wide in upper stretch. CAROL ducked in at the break, was always outrun. LOVELY J T
sent hard led early then gave way to upper stretch. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO AN INCIDENT ON THE TURN RESULTED IN NO ACTION BEING
TAKEN.

lead through the backside wearing out into the far turn. GUEYDAN was always outrun. BALTIMORE COUNTY raced mid pack tiring on the far turn.
