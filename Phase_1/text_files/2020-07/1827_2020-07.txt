STARTTHEBUSGUS came three wide on the turn to engage for the lead was on the outside in a three horse stretch duel and finished best for the win. HEIS
THE MAN showed the best early speed on the inside to carve all the fractions but was outfinished in the final yards. FIVE TITLES steadied a few jumps out
of the gate while in tight quarters raced in the two path on the turn but could not go with the top two late. TOMBI was chasing the leader midway on the turn
and lugged out badly losing all chance and could not recover. SKITTISH raced well off the rail while in the back of the pack and had no rally. SHOT CALLER
was away in good order and was battling for the early lead when taken up and out of the race and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CHEAP O CHARLIE came four wide on the turn took a clear lead when the frontrunners stopped inside the eighth pole and was all out to hold on for the
win. PARLAY PONTI was last entering the stretch came between foes in the lane and just missed in a very tight photo finish. HOT BLOODED SONG came
three wide on the turn to get into contention was right on the lead when the frontrunners tired but could not go with the top two late. CASUALITY showed
good speed in the two path to the eighth pole and then tired badly. SHEPHERD'S PRIDE raced in the two path on the turn and could not make up ground
through the stretch. DURTDOBBR chased the speed for the first quarter but dropped back on the turn and was not a factor. ALL FOR TRUTH was battling
for the lead on the inside and gave way suddenly at the eighth pole.

ARTICULATOR was hustled to the lead to open a lead on the field took a breather on the backstretch then drew clear again on the second turn while not
asked and won as the rider pleased. FIVE STAR KIP raced three wide nearly the entire mile and was clearly second best. A J SAMURAI saved ground the
entire mile and could not make up the needed ground. COWBOY COOL chased the leader in the two path for the first half and then tired.
CHOCOLATEICECREAM made a four wide bid up the backstretch but tired on the second turn. NATIVE CHIEFTAIN trailed throughout and was never a

Footnotes
BONA FIDE IMAGE was up close in the two path on the turn battled for the lead between foes in the stretch and drew clear late. FANCY STOCKINGS
sprinted to a quick lead and held the advantage to the eighth pole but tired in the final sixteenth. FOXY TWIST came five wide on the turn and was
improving her position throughout the stretch run. ATTITUDE AJUSTMENT was three wide on the turn and was outfinished for third in the final yards.
EMMY GOT EVEN raced along the rail the entire race and could not make up ground. TELL IT AGAIN chased the leader on the turn came along side at the
head of the stretch and then tired through the lane. ONE SIMPLE RULE raced mid pack throughout and never mounted a rally. AYE AYE OH was well back
in the early stages along the inside and never mounted a bid. MAYBEA GRAND was pinched back after the start to trail and was not a factor after that.
FOXY GIRL showed good early speed on the inside but faded after the first quarter.
