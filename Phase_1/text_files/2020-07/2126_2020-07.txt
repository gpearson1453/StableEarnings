Footnotes
SUGAR FIX lightly bumped between foes at the start, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until
roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. NEW DAY
DAWNING bobbled at the break recovering inwards and bumping SUGAR FIX lightly, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home while clear for the place honors. LITTLE RED FROG
three wide through the first turn, chased three wide from just off the pace, got set down spinning four wide for home, weakened in the late stages while
along safe for the show honors. LOOKIN DYNAMIC struck the off side stall at the start when breaking outwards then bumped SUGAR FIX lightly in tandem
with NEW DAY DAWNING, tracked the front from the two path, came under coaxing and tucked inside near the five-sixteenths before spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. TONAL VISION three wide through the opening bend, chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and weakened. PUNK ROCK PRINCESS chased along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
paused briefly as LOOKIN DYNAMIC took to the rail in front near the five-sixteenths albeit safely clear, then cornered just off the inside for home and tired.
SUPER TWENTY SEVEN lightly coaxed along the inside, tipped three wide at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung four
wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
UNRELENTING FORCE broke very fast then was hustled, set the clear pace, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole, came under a left-handed whip while extending the advantage outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging.
TRUE PALACE dropped towards the rear while ridden along, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, moved off the rail inside the
three-sixteenths, shifted out while gaining at the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy to just get the place. LORD CAMDEN was urged along off the
pace, drifted out near the nine-sixteenths, went four then three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, dropped in inside the
three-sixteenths and finished with late energy to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. ME 'N SAP broke out then was corrected by the
rider, tracked the pace set by the winner while on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner
into the final furlong and proved no match then lost the show. ROYAL SUSPECT bumped lightly with a rival at the start, settled towards the front, raced
inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide under urging at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked
the needed response. NOT ABOVE ME was ridden along while well back in the field, dropped in behind a drifting foe near the nine-sixteenths, went three
then four wide while put to the whip on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SENRIMA settled on the far outside, dropped from the
five path to the two path early on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch under the whip and was no factor.
MAJESTIC VIEW was urged along towards the front, went three wide early on the turn then floated five wide, spun into the stretch under the whip and came
up empty. DANEGELD bumped lightly with a rival at the start, chased the pace off the rail, dropped in leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
FOXTAIL brushed at the start, sat forwardly placed along the inside, was content to sit the pocket trip until the conclusion of the backstretch, slipped out at
the half mile pole and out-hoofed TULA for position during the initial stages of the run around the far turn, attaining a snug fit in the two path by midpoint,
angled outward and towards the three path heading for the top of the lane, under some encouragement by this juncture,. closed in readily, hitching up to the
runner up deep into the furlong grounds, out-dueled that opponent for the advantage over the course of the next furlong, then dug in gamely to stay in the
clear. ROSEBUD'S HOPE worked out a tuck into the two path shortly after leaving the homestretch, was rated along attending VIP NATION from the two
path, increased her presence as three-quarters was being completed, was asked for more a furlong down the road, gave the desired response to take
charge, only to have the eventual winner bearing down to its right, yielded during the tussle between them followed, had enough left to save second. TEAM
WIN gently pinched after bobbling at the start, took up the chase from the two path, got set down approaching the five-sixteenths pole, was maneuvered into
the four path early during the stretch run, finished with belated energy en route for the show. BEACH DREAMING remained along the inside after the field
had been sent off and running, inherited the pocket after departing the backstretch, was asked to pick it up soon aftewards, got driven two wide into the
lane, tipped one path wider in deep stretch, was outfinished. TULA brushed with TEAM WIN in the shadow of the starting gate, went on to pursue the front
runners from path two, was forced to move wider on the far turn after losing position to the top one, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch,
lacked the needed response. VIP NATION moved over to the rail on the clubhouse bend after establishing the top, showed the way pulling a bit on the left,
with the second place finisher in accompaniment in path two, had that rival draw directly abreast as the third fraction was being finalized, came under
stronger handling a few strides later, kept pace until the three-sixteenths pole before giving way. ANNIE ROCKS saved ground until the end of the second
bend, tipped out two wide for the drive, had no offering and wound up trailing throughout.

Footnotes
OUR LADY OF LORETO dueled in hand from the four path with the more active JA'S MALIBU to her inside, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole and
shook off that rival with seven-sixteenths to go, then tucked along the inside at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under a drive,
drifted out through the stretch to the finish about seven to eight paths despite an off sided stick while edging clear to the finish kept to task. ENOUGH LOVE
three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under a ride three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided
stick and bumped with KEFALIANI at the three-sixteenths, then ran on to secure the place honors. BECKY'S MISSION four to five paths off the inside in
pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up
a mild bid. KEFALIANI chased just off the inside, got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, dug in and was bumped
at the three-sixteenths by ENOUGH LOVE who came in under an off sided stick, then weakened in the final furlong. ROUSEY coaxed from the start,
showed little speed and loped along at the tail of the field two to three wide, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and made no impact. BELLA INVASION hustled from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four to
five wide for home and was never involved. JA'S MALIBU hustled from the start, dueled from the two path lightly coaxed along with OUR LADY OF
LORETO to her outside, had that rival tuck directly next to her half a mile out when taking a narrow advantage, got shaken off once in the turn with
seven-sixteenths remaining and was put to coaxing at that station, faded through the turn, swung just off the inside for home and faltered.

Footnotes
MORE MANGO cut over to the inside after establishing the top, was rated along carving out the pace, attended by an equally-rated KITTEN'S ROMANCE to
the outside, continued along under the same set-up all the way to the quarter pole, stepped into the lane was shortly afterwards put to the test by the
aforementioned rival, desperately clung to the advantage, remained engaged in a fierce fight for the last eighth, stubbornly dug in to preserve the decision.
KITTEN'S ROMANCE secured a forward position during the trip leading up to the end of the homestretch, stepped onto the clubhouse turn three wide,
tucked closer to the rail just prior to entering the backstretch, was held in reserve prompting the winner fraction after fraction, went into the stretch and after
venturing onward for a few additional jumps got called upon, vied with vigour the rest of the way to the finish line inching her way to the front end, proved to
be a game foe, but was ultimately denied. CHECKSANDBALANCES (IRE) sat within striking distance of the front runners from path two, angled into the
third one for entrance into the stretch, whittled away at the deficit, fell short. VALLETTA strung out three wide for three-quarters, got roused springing from
the five-sixteenths pole, went out into path five from upper to midstretch, finished willingly for the last major check. CHEROKEE SONG made it over to the
inside route before stepping onto the first turn, shifted outward and into the two path at the top of the backstretch, was in the same path departing it, angled
four wide into the stretch, altered course into the seven path in the last stages, kicked into her best, but all to late.. HARD WON three then two wide
travelling on the opening bend, chased the pace from path two on the next turn, got steered back into the three path for the drive, mustered up a mild
response. MALIBU ANTHEM was mostly two wide stalking the winner on the first turn, was maneuvered closer to rail and went on to draft behind the top
one, continued to save ground on the far turn, got moved out three wide entering the lane, flattened out. CLADDAGH'S RUN reserved two wide all the way
to the quarter pole, was worked into path three during the initial portion of the stretch, lacked the necessary response. SPRING TO SUMMER rode the rail,
got asked after six furlongs had been rattled off, faltered. MALICEINTHEPALACE reluctant to load, was three wide on the first turn and in path two on the
subsequent one, wandered out towards path six in the stretch while backing away. SHINE LIKE BOBBY underwent a ground-saving journey, was never in it.

FED FUNDS chased inside down the backstretch until tipped out three to four wide at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command seventy yards from home, then inched
away to the finish to prevail. MY MAN FLINTSTONE three wide in aim of the front early on, advanced to take over command half a mile from home and
tucked to the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in
under threat from a pair and was caught seventy yards from the finish but was able to safely preserve the place honors on the wire. DANGEROUS EDGE
chased two to three wide, came under coaxing four wide at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MISTER
BOBBY forwardly placed four then three wide, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive.
POLAR BEAR PETE just off the pace just off the inside, tucked inside once around a backing out ZILLER at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper
stretch in behind the leader, tipped out nudging MISTER BOBBY lightly straightened away and weakened. BIG BOY MO three wide in pursuit, got ridden
along at the three-eighths, continued three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. STARSHIP BUBBA stumbled at the start falling to his face and pecking
the ground conceding three to four lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide for home and was unable to make an impact. ZILLER flashed brief speed along the inside showing the
way until headed near the half mile pole, shortened stride through the turn climbing a bit as the rider grew quiet, faded to the rear of the field and cut the
corner into upper stretch, folded, and was eased through to the finish.

into the stretch, drew off under a strong hand ride into the final furlong then was put to a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip at the

asked outside the quarter-pole, cut the corner into the stretch, moved off the rail under a drive around the three-sixteenths, came in a touch near the furlong
marker which caused PECATONICA to steady and finished with good courage to safely secure the place. PECATONICA was taken back while crowded
against the rail early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved under a tight hold, raced inside on the far turn, waited while lacking room behind horses
from the quarter-pole to the three-sixteenths then was asked some, steadied when a rail opening tightened up coming to the furlong marker then shifted out

bend in the two path, was reserved at the rear of the field, rounded the far turn in the two path, came between horses at the five-sixteenths, moved out from
behind foes in upper stretch, raced between horses under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. GOODBYE BROCKLEY was
carried in early and jostled with a rival then was in tight, raced in the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path,
was asked at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. OUT OF TROUBLE brushed with a rival at the start, bumped with foes on both sides while carried in
early then steadied while pinched back, went four then three wide on the first turn, was rated under a tight hold, moved up inside the five-eighths then
dropped back again, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. BARREL OF DESTINY went
three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside while rated under restraint, went three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. SHORT POUR brushed with rivals at the start, bumped with foes on both sides while carried
in early then was squeezed back, became rank under restraint then checked while lugging out five wide into the first turn, went four to five wide on that
bend, settled on the outside, moved up inside the five-eighths, was asked while four wide on the far turn, dropped back into the stretch and came up empty.
LOVE AND LOVE rounded the first turn in the two path, attended the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. (Rail at 18 Feet)

Footnotes
FUNNY GUY broke on top, had AMUNDSON arrive on the front end soon afterwards and was eased back, assumed the role of primary pursuer, got rated
along prompting the aforementioned foe from the two path, latched on all the while, was cued up challenging in earnest stepping onto the top of the lane,
took charge during the ensuing furlong, was still in possession of a comfortable lead when geared down in the final seventy yards. T LOVES A FIGHT got
set up in the pocket by the end of the chute, was kept on hold tracking the pace until crossing the midway point of the turn, got set down in the vicinity of the
five-sixteenths marker, tipped into the two path entering the stretch, failed to match strides with the winner while rallying with willingness nonetheless to be
along for the place. MY BOY TATE pursued the front runners from the three path, was called upon more for spinning into the lane, got outkicked. BANKIT
guided over to the inside route after the start, cut the corner into the lane, made no impact. CELTIC CHAOS along the outside throughout, chased the pace
two to three wide on the turn, got driven towards path five heading for the three-sixteenths pole, failed to muster up a solid closing punch. PAT ON THE
BACK spotted in the two path proceeding along the backstretch, swung out four wide for the drive home, backed away. AMUNDSON cleared to the top and
over to the inside route a panel into the contest, showed the way tailed by FUNNY GUY, was the first of that twosome to have its pilot commit to a drive, this
occurring a couple of jumps shy of the quarter pole, succumbed soon afterwards and faded to last.

ADIOS AMIGOS coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the stretch to issue a challenge through the final furlong outside a host of rivals, took command in the final
jumps to the finish to prevail. TEMPESTA just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied and was in behind the top pair nearing the sixteenth marker, tipped out nudging BOOM
BOOM KABOOM into FRAT and in turn FREUDIAN ANALYST, surged quickly to take narrow and brief command inside that station before being nailed by
the aforementioned foe in the final strides. DISCIPLANARIAN broke out at the start bumping BRICKYARD, chased three to four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. FREUDIAN ANALYST four paths off the inside
down the backstretch near the rear of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under a ride three furlongs from home, angled out seven wide
into upper stretch following the eventual winner, dug in under a drive rallying and lugged in slightly a furlong out, then chose not to follow the winner angling
in for a brief seam and was bumped and steadied briefly a sixteenth from home due to pressure caused by TEMPESTA tipping out, went back outside and
finished under a tepid hand ride to just miss for the show honors. THREEPOINTNINENINE brushed the near side stall at the start, recovered to duel inside
of FLUENT IN SARCASM, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the lead under
challenge from a host of rivals, got overwhelmed just inside the sixteenth marker and was displaced from command and outfinished in the late stages.
FLUENT IN SARCASM dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide for home and weakened in the late going. BRICKYARD bumped at the start by DISCIPLANARIAN who broke outwards, chased three then two wide
under encouragement from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. BOOM BOOM KABOOM coaxed from the gate, chased
the duel along the inside placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was nudged
and steadied when TEMPESTA tipped his way out a sixteenth from home, brushed with FRAT who in turn bumped FREUDIAN ANALYST, then got
outfinished in the late stages. FRAT chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive and was brushed by the aforementioned foe a sixteenth from home and in turn bumped FREUDIAN ANALYST all due to pressure commenced by
the tipping out of TEMPESTA, then weakened in the late going. JET FOR ANDY brushed the near side stall at the start and came under coaxing, chased
along the inside getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. MIGHTY WIND saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under a ride at the three-eighths, angled three wide for home and made no impact. KAMIKAZE RED chased two to
three wide coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide into upper stretch and trailed.
