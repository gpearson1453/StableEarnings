DOUBLE STAR dueled from the outside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged with STEPHEN'S ANSWER through the drive and inched away
from that one late. STEPHEN'S ANSWER dueled from the inside early, battled through the turn, remained engaged with the winner but could not match
strides. MILTONTOWN chased the early pace outside, made a bid entering the turn but could only hold position. LEADER OF MEN forced the early pace
outside but had no late response. EXTIRPATOR was never a factor. PADDOCK PICK was never close. Six furlong split time unavailable due to a timer
malfunction.

drive but tired late. HAILEY'S DAY chased the early pace and faded. CHAMPAGNERIE was no factor. BELLA MOON forced the early pace and faded.

inside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. RIFLE MAN could only improve position. PURSUIT OF A

Footnotes
BROOK IS GOLDEN dueled from the outside early, remained engaged through the turn, shook loose entering the drive, opened a clear margin at the eighth
pole and was well clear while kept to task. TROPHY DADDY off a step slow, was outrun early, advanced outside through the turn, responded when sat
down for the drive and closed with a rush for the place. MAYAN GHOST stalked the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the turn, responded
when sat down for the drive and was just up for the show. MAYBERRY SALOON forced the early pace inside, remained forward but could not keep pace.
ZENMAN dueled from the inside and tired in the drive. CHROMED HEART went evenly. GASPERGOU chased the early pace and tired. BROTHER DAVID
was no factor. MONEY LUSHKA was never close. JEHU had a steady fade.
