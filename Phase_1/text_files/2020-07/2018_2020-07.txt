Footnotes
ASSUME coaxed from the gate, dueled from the three path with QUANTUM COMPUTING to her inside, assumed command when that rival to her inside got
protected and pulled up inside the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. HANDS UP two to three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch around a troubled rival, proved no match for the top one
while along clear of the rest to be second best. WISHES AND DREAMS five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out
seven wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. VITANZA four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, angled
six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. EMBRACE A NEW DAY chased three then two wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into
upper stretch and tired. SHINE LIKE BOBBY bobbled and brushed the near side stall at the start, got outrun early on chasing four paths off the inside,
tucked inside half a mile from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SCARLET'S SONG chased along the inside under
coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three wide for home, tired in the stretch. QUANTUM COMPUTING bobbled at the break and recovered under
coaxing to duel from the two path with ASSUME to her outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in command, took an awkward step just inside the
five-sixteenths and was placed to a swift and strong protective hold, the rider showing his expertise in guiding his charge to the outside and pulling her up at
the quarter pole after the field had gone by, then was subsequently vanned off.

KINKY SOX settled nicely on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, came between horses at the three-sixteenths,
dropped back to the rail and replaced the tiring pacesetter outside the furlong marker, made a bid along the rail, battled with the runner-up under a
right-handed whip into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. HETTY G. bumped with a rival just after the start, was well placed just off the
pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths then was given her cue, advanced to make an outside bid under a right-handed
whip in upper stretch, took the lead inside the three-sixteenths, drifted in closer to the winner inside the furlong marker then was switched to a left-handed
whip at the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well clear for the place. PARTY IN THE SAND bumped with a rival just after the start then dropped
back while in tight between horses, angled in at the rear then fell well behind the rest of the field under urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into the
stretch under the whip then moved out under a drive, altered in from behind a rival inside the sixteenth-pole and improved position to get the show. HOT
LITTLE HONEY bumped with a foe just after the start then dropped back while in a bit tight, settled last but one, went around the turn in the two path, was
roused at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MOVIE SCORE tracked the pace on the outside,
turned up the pressure on the leader while in the three path on the turn, was asked while taking the advantage at the quarter-pole, came in some under a
right-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths then was straightened by the rider, lost the lead near the furlong marker and weakened. TIZ A KITTEN
bumped with an opponent just after the start, was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond. OVERTIME OLIVIA
was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, was crowded against the rail while
dropping back outside the furlong marker and faded.

Footnotes
PEACEFUL retained the advantage after out-breaking the competition by a narrow margin, got guided over to the rail, arriving there prior to the end of the
backstretch, carved out the pace well rated and with MO ME MO MY in attendance in path two, settled onto the head of the stretch and was switched over
to stronger handling, left the eighth pole in possession of what turned out to be her largest lead, came out a bit late as the runner up was closing in with
good energy down the center of the course, was able to dig in to stay in the clear. SPARKLING SKY got worked towards the two path shortly after the field
had been released, sat reserved towards the back of the pack, flashed some interest tipping to the outside springing from the five-sixteenths pole, was
under a ride swinging approximately four wide entering upper stretch, came home with good energy to procure the place. STOP WAR patiently rated in the
pocket, stepped into the lane, got gradually maneuvered into the two path, finally gaining its coveted spot once MO ME MO MY began to back away deep
into the furlong grounds, failed to dent the margin in the final furlong. WICKED AMBER pinched after suffering contact from both sides right after the start,
chased the pace from the two path during the run around the bend, got steered one wider coming into the lane, altered course into the five path late, made
some headway. VOTING AGREEMENT got bumped in the shadow of the starting gate, displayed no lasting ill effects and went on to pursue the pace from
the two path, firmly rated during the early stages of it, commenced the stretch slightly wider, came up empty. MO ME MO MY pulled away from a bumping
incident occurring directly to her left right after the start, assumed a forward position, prompted the winner from the two path until the top of the lane, gave
way. HENNI PENNY bumped at the start, cut over to the rail, faltered off the subsequent ground-saving trip.

STAY FOND four to five paths off the inside briefly, tucked to the two path in pursuit from the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole to the three or four path rallying to issue a challenge, dug in under a drive
taking command seventy yards from home, then edged away to the finish. BLUNT FORCE six paths off the inside just off a pace dispute up front, tucked
three wide into the turn, had the leader get out carrying out his two main pace rivals at the seven-sixteenths and saw the opportunity to advance coming
under coaxing to issue a challenge for the front at the three-eighths, took over command five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive edging clear to the eighth pole coming under lone threat to the outside, got collared seventy yards from home and was forced to
settle for the place honors. DIRTY BIRD four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY four to five wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under a ride at the
three-eighths, went five wide into upper stretch and improved position in the drive. COLD HEARTED PEARL coaxed from the gate, vied from the three path
with a pair to her outside, got out into the turn floating five to six wide despite correction and carried out COTTON CANDY CUTIE and MALARKEY in the
process while under threat from BLUNT FORCE who took advantage of the scenario to now bid for command, yielded the front near the five-sixteenths
under coaxing, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MISS LOYALTY five paths off the inside briefly, tucked inside six and a half
furlongs from home, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no response. COTTON
CANDY CUTIE vied from the four paths loosely between foes down the backstretch, got carried out five to six wide at the seven-sixteenths as the innermost
of the trio COLD HEARTED PEARL got out at that station, was able to safely tuck in behind that rival to the three path three furlongs from home, placed to
coaxing, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. MALARKEY vied from the five or six path down the backstretch with a pair to her inside, got
carried out a path or two at the seven-sixteenths when COLD HEARTED PEARL got out at that station along the inside of her, came under urging at the
three-eighths, went four to five wide for home and tired.

IRISH CONSTITUTION broke in then bumped with a rival, recovered quickly to dispute the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked
in the four path into the stretch then came under a strong hand ride, drifted in under a right-handed whip nearing the furlong marker, dueled outside of the
runner-up, was switched to a left-handed whip then given one crack inside the sixteenth-pole and gamely prevailed under a strong hand ride to the wire.
PARTY AT PAGE'S disputed the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked late on that bend then turned into the stretch under a
right-handed whip, dueled with the winner, switched to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, continued a spirited tussle with that foe to the wire and was
denied while well clear for the place. SAMBORELLA broke in the air and was off slow, spotted the front several lengths then angled in over heels early,
advanced inside to the two path on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, held a reasonable striking position into upper stretch, was not urged as the
top two pulled well clear from the three-sixteenths to the sixteenth-pole, came back under hand urging late and secured the show. JILL'S A HOT MESS
stumbled at the start and bumped with a rival, settled on the outside, was roused while five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch while put to a
right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker and lacked the needed response then missed the show. GOING GOING GONE was
urged along on the outside in fourth position, went four wide on the turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and had nothing left. RAFFINITY brushed the
inside of the gate at the start then bumped with a rival, dropped back while in tight, moved out under urging midway down the backstretch, lugged out three
wide into the turn, was guided to the two path before the three-eighths, came back out three wide late on that bend then was driven four wide into the stretch
and failed to respond. DOROTHY'S STAR bumped with a rival at the start and stumbled twice, was urged along at the back on the outside, went four wide
on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. BUSTIN SHUFFLE broke in and brushed the inside of the gate then was corrected with a
hard tug of the right rein, established a good position just off the pace, chased three then two wide on the turn and retreated.

LOVELY LUCKY settled into the two path after the start, was well-rated prompting the pacesetter, turned into the lane still abreast of OVERJOYED, arrived
at the three-sixteenths pole and was given her cue, rresponded immediately to take charge, drew off smartly in the final furlong. ELLE M'A SOURI (FR)
patiently pocketed tracking moderate split after moderate split, tipped to the outside late on the final turn, got driven three wide into the lane, proved no
match. COILEAN BAWN shoe-horned itself onto the rail shortly after stepping onto the first turn, resulting in NO MO TEMPER getting checked, kept watch
on the front runners under a good hold, slipped to the outside in the general area of the half mile pole, was still in it spinning into the lane, went on to finish a
non-threatening third. OVERJOYED established control in short order, cut over to the inside, showed the way, well rated, got put to the test by the winner
settling onto the head of the stretch, relinquished readily then wilted in the last eighth. CAP DE CREUS away a length the tardiest, sat parked out three wide
on each and every bend, failed to pick up interest when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, shifted towards path four during the initial portion of the
stretch and folded. EBONY (FR) stationed in the two path and between rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, gave way. NO MO TEMPER got guided over to the
rail prior to departing the backstretch for the first time, checked as COILEAN BAWN was being maneuvered onto the rail with the barest of clearance soon
afterwards, became unsettled for a few jumps afterwards, tipped out into the two path entering the stretch for the first time, stayed there before re-tucking
along the inside route on the third turn, went three wide into the lane, had no rally. HAPPYCREST strung out two wide early, traded paths with NO MO
TEMPER by going over to the inside soon after leaving the first turn, exchanged places once again with the aforementioned opponent by tipping into path
two at the half mile pole, came about as wide into lane, failed to fire.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA'S LADY coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the three-sixteenths and edged away under a drive shying a bit outwards from a near sided stick
near the sixteenth marker before corrected to the finish. SNICKET chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner
roused into upper stretch, got bumped by HEY IT'S TATI straightened away, then ran on to secure the place honors. KAZ'S PRINCESS reluctant to load
prior to the start, broke out at the start and was corrected, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide
for home, dug in under a drive knocking heads with the aforementioned foe, ultimately lost the battle for the place honors by the bob of the head while
keeping on to safely secure the show honors. TOWERING GAZE chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and was outkicked. QUANTITATIVBREEZIN chased two to three wide under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid before flattening out in the late stages. HEY IT'S TATI chased along
the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, went to go back to the rail straightened away and bumped with SNICKET
who had cut the corner, got guided off that rival and weakened through to the finish. CAKE lightly coaxed on the pace just off the inside, tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded under threat from a trio of rivals at the
three-sixteenths and weakened. DELLA LUTE reluctant to load prior to the start, got away to an awkward and slow beginning from the gate conceding six to
seven lengths to the front before able to settle into stride, chased just off the inside detached at the tail of the field, continued in the two path into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TURNED ASIDE popped out of the gate first, albeit by the barest of margin, was allowed to ease back, yet remained forwardly placed nevertheless so as to
press the pace as the widest of three from path three, doing so all the way to the end of the bend, spun into the lane and took over under a confident ride,
responded when asked for more at the eighth pole, then stayed on with good energy in the final stages to prove best. OLD CHESTNUT away without
apparent mishap, was gradually worked towards the rail, getting there by the conclusion of the backstretch, contently brought up the back of the pack, went
outward for the drive home, fanned wider and wider from upper to midlane until approximately five wide, becoming the widest of all, straightened away and
took off after the ones to catch, closed in well, out-fought a pair of opponents to his inside to garner the place. FORE LEFT worked out a tuck into the two
path after the start, sat reserved during the run around the bend, was under a ride stepping into three path for entrance into the stretch, mustered up a good
kick to secure the show. FLAP JACK took up position from just off the inside route, had a good view of the ongoing three-way tussle for the top, began to
angle to the outside under encouragement at about the same time FORE LEFT did, namely springing from the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch
towards path two, fought fiercely down the stretch, came up short. JACK AND NOAH (FR) disputed the pace from path two in between foes until the end of
the bend, faltered. HIGH CRUISE hustled from the gate, failed to kick away to a clear advantage, and instead was forced to argue from the rail as the
innermost of three, came under a drive soon after entering the turn, did battle until the general area of the quarter pole, fell back, then was allowed to fade
away even more.

Footnotes
OPERATIVE just off the pace just off the inside, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and advanced on the front
angled three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to be the outermost of a trio heads apart for command through the final furlong, dueled
through the final sixteenth with BRICCO shaking off MOMMIE'S JEWEL late and prevail gamely on the wire. BRICCO tracked the pace just off the inside
early on, tucked to the rail at the seven-sixteenths, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, rallied between rivals to be heads apart for command
from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker, then dueled through to the finish with the aforementioned foe in game fashion but was bested on the line.
MOMMIE'S JEWEL coaxed from the gate, cleared all rivals to the inside and established the front crossing into the first turn to show the way from the two
path settling into a comfortable rhythm in hand, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch, dug in under threat from a pair clinging to the front until headed a sixteenth out, got shaken off late while clear for the show honors. NERO'S
FIDDLE got clipped behind along the inside into the first turn by AINTITFUNKYNOW, tracked the pace along the inside down through the first turn and down
the backstretch, tipped to the two path through the far turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure
the last major share. BROADWAY JOE struck the near side stall at the start, raced forwardly placed just off the inside, faded through the far turn and came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch brushing with a rival, weakened losing ground to the front through to the finish while
improving position to the wire. FROZEN ACCOUNT three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LORCAN got floated four wide into the opening bend when AINTITFUNKYNOW grew rank under
restraint off the heels of a rival and came outwards after clipping NERO'S FIDDLE in behind, chased three then two wide from near the rear, swung four
wide into upper stretch and offered no response while passing tired foes. SENOR PHELPS got away to an awkward beginning and lost his lane to rivals
crossing over, raced three wide through the first turn before chasing three wide down the backstretch and the far turn from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. YAH HUH just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, steadied briefly off a rival's heels straightened away and tired. AINTITFUNKYNOW grew rank under
restraint along the inside into the first turn when off the heels of NERO'S FIDDLE, clipped that foe in behind and came outwards three wide carrying out
LORCAN to the four paths, settled at the tail of the field along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths now just off the inside, swung three wide
for home and made no impact. MY PRIMO broke a half a beat slow, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for
home and made no impact. GOLDEN IDOL three wide through the first turn just off the pace, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and faltered.
