Footnotes
STEPHANIE'S FAITH settled three wide, responded readily when set down, made the lead past the quarter pole, the rider lost his whip at the furlong marker
and proved best under a strong hand ride. DAWNMINO chased the pace into the far turn, inherited the lead two wide, dug in when headed by the winner but
finished second best. SURE SHE'S GRAND unhurried early, swung wide and rallied belatedly in the seven path. DAME AMOUR trailed, swung wide and
had a mild rally in the middle of the racetrack. QUEENOFTHEKINGDOM well placed, failed to respond. WICKED LOVE was through early. HASTY LADY
sprinted to a large lead on the clubhouse turn, set the pace into the far turn then stopped.

JOSIE'S RIDDLE settled just off the leaders along the rail for a half, shifted out entering the stretch, rallied under a hand ride to make the lead past the
furlong marker, was struck once with a left handed whip near the sixteenth pole and drew off to win in hand. I'M IN A HURRY broke slowly, rushed up two
wide to press the pace before a quarter, dropped back a bit while shifting out in upper stretch, dug in determinedly in the five path and got up for second.
FOREST CHATTER away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside until mid stretch then was outfinished. CLYDE PARK failed to menace. WIZARD
WILLIE stalked the pace four wide and was through after a half. Z J WINS dropped back from a sharp start then trailed.

BUCKET BEAT never far back, circled his field in the four path, made the lead at the top of the stretch and finished full of run under left handed urging to win
as much the best. VISUAL MISSION allowed to settle, rallied determinedly late along the inside and got up for second. JACK BE FAST broke in front, set
the pace to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. ON FIRE had speed along the inside while under a firm hold, dropped back on the far turn, swung
out to the middle of the racetrack and came on again late. SAMMY DA BULL moved up in the five path on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. SUPER
BEAU had speed for a half then folded.

Footnotes
CINNAMON DIVA unhurried near the inside, shifted out to the middle of the racetrack, closed with a rush through the stretch and was along in time.
FACTUM'S REWARD stalked the pace three wide, was forced out five wide by the leader entering the stretch, dug in determinedly late and gained second.
PROUD MAID MARIAN with the second flight, inside, finished with good courage three wide. JILLY FROM JERSEY pressed the pace along the inside for a
half, slipped through to make the lead before the furlong marker, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. STURN DONNA unhurried early,
closed a gap late along the rail. VAPNYARKA away alertly, set a pressured pace in the two path for a half, drifted out four wide then weakened late.
GRADY'S LADY went evenly. TEARS AND ROSES was through early.
