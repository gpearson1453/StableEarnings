gained a narrow advantage into the stretch inside of WYE CROSS and ROMAN STEEL then veered out sharply and held sway. WYE CROSS sat in striking
position from the three path, took closer order leaving the backstretch then was roused drifting wide into the lane, moved up along side ROMAN STEEL
early stretch then steadied deep stretch from a veering LONE PIONEER. ROMAN STEEL set the pace from the two path, was under attack into the stretch
and gave way grudgingly late. PARKING PERMIT trailed the field racing three wide and lacked a bid. QUINTERO saved ground and was done
early.*Stewards Inquiry- The Stewards conducted an inquiry deep stretch and after review the Stewards found no reason to alter the original order of finish
and made no change. **Jockey Objection- An objection lodged by the rider of WYE CROSS against the rider of LONE PIONEER alleging interference deep

TEXAS ALLEY KAT set a pressured pace between foes, drew clear nearing the far turn, was kept to task under encouragement and held safely.
THRILLOFTHECHASE pressed from the two path inside, chased the leader in the final turn, was gaining ground late but was unable to reach the winner.
AXIAL LOAD unhurried early, took closer order approaching the far turn, shifted out to the four path and rallied late for show. ENTITLED STAR tracked
inside, came under a drive at the quarter pole and was edged out late. PHINALYWYN prompted from the four path in the early stages, chased between foes
in the final turn and came up empty for the drive. P G STAR settled in range from the five path, dropped back in the final turn and tired.

INQUISITIVE CAT vied inside for the early lead, dueled for command on the far turn inside of RISING REVOLUTION and drove clear into the stretch.
RISING REVOLUTION pressed the pace three to four wide, moved up to challenge the lead at the five sixteenth pole, dueled outside into the stretch but
weakened and just held on for place. KING KLOVER lagged early from the three path, was prompted to make a steady advance four wide into the lane and
just missed for place honors while closing the gap. TRIPLE LIVE tracked outside, rallied into the stretch while out kicked. FAMILY DAY contended the early
pace between rivals, dropped back into the far turn then faded into the lane. REGAL CANDY stalked the pacesetters from the four path and failed to
threaten.

CHASKA stalked from the two path, chased four wide in the final turn, continued a steady advance into the stretch then narrowly prevailed in time under firm
handling. STORMCHASER set a pressured pace from between rivals in the three path, responded to challenge from ZICATELA at the five sixteenth pole
then dueled for the command into the stretch, inched clear mid stretch and was denied late by CHASKA. ZICATELA vied outside angling in, pressed outside
of STORMCHASER, moved up alongside the fore mentioned prompting action into the lane, dueled for the lead but lacked the rally needed and weakened.
EDDYSHAK reserved off the pacesetters, was in tight into the far turn, gave chased into the lane under urging and flattened. BORN IN A BREEZE last
leaving the gate, hustled into contention and failed to threaten. STAPLETON chased outside and failed to threaten.

PRESS GANG sat in striking position racing four wide under a snug hold, moved up alongside HERE COMES BARNEY to challenge the lead, rallied
outside under urging and inched clear late. HERE COMES BARNEY quickly went to the front to show the way through the backstretch, responded to
challenge from PRESS GANG at the quarter pole then drifted towards the rail under right handed urging, couldn't match the winner's bid in the stretch but
finished clearly second best. ALBERTA BOUND raced five wide into the opening turn, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, chased four to five wide
into the lane and rallied belatedly for show honors. SERAPPY G sat outside from mid pack, rallied into the lane the drifted in showing signs of tiring and
gave way. SUNNY'S BEST trailed the field through the backstretch and showed little interest. KICKEN WEST G. lacked early speed, lugged in hard into the
lane then was eased and walked off.

TACTICAL EDGE sat just off the pace from the three to four path between rivals, fanned three wide into the far turn, was put to a drive into the lane, rallied
determinedly through the stretch and prevailed driving. PRECIOUS NOTES stalked from rail, advanced quickly inside leaving the backstretch then moved
up to challenge the lead in the far turn, rallied two wide entering the lane and was out finished. REBATE SHOP broke readily from the gate, tracked outside,
angled in approaching the far turn, gained closer order into the lane then shifted five wide at the three sixteenth marker, advanced steadily through the
stretch to secure show. PRINCESS PONTI vied from the two path for the lead, set a pressured pace from between rivals, was unable to sustain the bid that
was needed entering the stretch and gave way. SPANISH DIVA hopped leaving the gate then was hustled into contention, was asked for response entering
the lane and failed to threaten in the drive. BETTY DO IT never far back racing five wide and was done early. NORTHERN STRYKER sat in striking
distance outside and tired early. EMERALD CANYON vied outside racing five wide, bore out into the far turn then was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
MASKWECIS broke alertly then stalked off the pacesetters from the four path, was ask to quicken approaching the quarter pole, drove five wide into the
lane racing into upper stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest command in time under firm right handed encouragement. DUNE D'ORO
reserved off the pacesetters from the three path, angled in entering the far turn, was headed into the stretch inside of the pacesetters and was unable to
contain the winner. BARE BACK JACK saved ground early from rail, came three wide into the lane then was roused at the top of the stretch splitting rivals
and continued willingly while out kicked. THIS TIME LUCKY contested the pace from the path, drew clear entering the far turn, was under attack into the
lane and lacked the rally needed. BIG AL'S VISION settled outside, angled towards the rail entering the far turn, bid into the lane but had no final kick.
TRIPLE POWER vied three wide, was unable to move on with THIS TIME LUCKY into the final turn, steadied mid stretch and had nothing left in reserve.
RAIL HUGGER trailed the field and lodged a late bid in vain.

Footnotes
DRAYMAGIC set a pressed pace from the three path, asserted command into the lane, was kept under steady handling and won going away. LONG TIME
DON raced four wide, advanced quickly leaving the final turn, angled inward into the lane chasing the leader and held place. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR sat
outside in range, race wide leaving the backstretch, lodged a late mild rally and was along in time for show. CAPITALISM stalked the pace inside, chased
two wide into the lane and weakened late. MADE FOR SATURDAY stalked four wide, moved up menacingly and faded. THISISMYSTORY tracked outside,
raced in traffic leaving the final turn and offered a mild bid. HORST saved ground and lacked serious bid. SYNNIN never reached contention. TROJAN
prompted five wide, reached the quarter pole and wilted abruptly.

Footnotes
MR. IRRELEVANT well rated to set the pace, responded to challenge from TOO AWESOME leaving the backstretch, was showing signs of tiring into the
stretch and just held under a long drive. RAIDEN trailed outside, advanced quickly through the final turn, split rivals into the stretch drive, was all out and
narrowly missed. DOMENICO lagged early then saved ground inside, shifted outside in the backstretch, circled the field into the lane, drifted under right
handed urging approaching the stretch was under heavy urging and got up in time for show. LONESOME CAT raced three wide into the opening turn, took
closer order into the far turn, fanned six wide at the quarter pole, rallied determinedly between rivals through the stretch and was bested late for show. ALL
MIGHTY BO tracked inside, moved up closer into the far turn, shifted out then went in pursuit of the leader, loomed boldly and came up empty for the drive.
STAR CZAR vied two wide in the opening stages, stalked from the rail through the backstretch and had no response when called upon. REMARKABLE
VINTAGE tracked the pacesetters, waited in traffic in the far turn, came five wide off the final turn and faltered. TOO AWESOME vied three wide for the
early lead, dueled through the backstretch outside of MR. IRRELEVANT, was unable to moved on with rival at the five sixteenth marker and stopped.
BUDDY BOY showed little.
