came through the far turn in the four path and finished evenly. BUFF N bobbled shortly after the start then bore out into the first turn but quickly regained

HERO'S MAN rated a short lead inside then came under riders' pressure approaching the three eighths pole, drew clear past the pole, widened through the
far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. START LINE tapered in and settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then dueled for second inside the eighth pole while unable to gain on the winner. BOASTER saved ground
well off the early pace then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then dueled through the stretch for third. AWSOME FAITH
steadied off the heels of Start Line nearing the three quarter pole then settled off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn
in the four path then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. OPERA NITE closed to contention to stalk the pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole but dropped back past the pole and weakened leaving the far turn. IHEARUKNOCKIN settled off the early pace inside then picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, but, weakened leaving the far turn. After reviewing a claim of foul against the rider Start Line, lodged by the rider of Awsome
Faith, the stewards disqualified the former to fourth place for angling across the path of the latter approaching the three quarter pole.

Footnotes
MASTER YOO saved ground well off the early pace then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted approaching the top of
the lane and left the turn in the five path, took the lead inside the sixteenth pole and held on well. DIXIE'S CROSSING rated off the pace in the two and
three paths then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, steadied between horses mid-stretch and was outfinished the final
sixteenth. DEPUTY BEE rated the pace inside then came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught mid-stretch and flattened stride the
final sixteenth. THREE CHOPT PUNCH stalked the earlier pace two deep then gave chase down the backstretch, came through the far turn in the three
path but flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. BRILLIANT IDEAS raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. LIL SILVER FOX raced off the pace inside and was through early. CRYPTOSONDE raced well off the pace and off the rail the first
turn then came through the far turn about the six path.

Footnotes
JAXBRADENRISHI rated off the pace about the three path then made a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the nod two deep midway on the
far turn and dug in under a determined ride to dissuade the stretch efforts of SILVER CASTLE, who moved to even terms two deep past the half mile pole
and had the nod leaving the seven sixteenths, dueled gamely from that point but reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. MERRY MERRY MOJO raced well
back from early contention while saving ground, eased outward into the backstretch and bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path and steadily improved to take third mid-stretch. MAJOR MEDALLIST rated a slim lead inside and was met at even terms into the backstretch, gave
chase from that point but faded past the five sixteenths pole. BLIMEY LIMEY raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.
GLEN'S CASTLE was not a factor. MIGHTY BOP saved ground off the pace, bobbled and was pulled up lame approaching the seven sixteenths pole, then
walked off.

ULTIMATE JUSTICE raced off the pace inside then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was carried outward on the far turn and entered the stretch about
the six path, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was edging away. MANDY stalked the pace inside then bid nearing the three eighths pole,
drifted outward on the far turn and entered the stretch about the five path, dueled to a slim brief lead mid-stretch but ceded in later yards. GOLD AND
STRIKE rated a slim lead inside, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn then dueled through the
lane for third. SKYLAR'S TRICK broke a bit awkwardly then stalked the pace two deep, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, raced at even terms
midway on the far turn, dueled to a slim lead at the eighth pole then outfinished for third in the stretch duel. FLATTER ME OWEN saved ground off the pace
the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was blocked mid-stretch, angled out from that point and finished evenly.
MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the pace then moved to the outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about
the three path and finished evenly.

Footnotes
CATHERINES WARRIOR raced with the pace and took the lead two deep leaving the first turn, drew clear at the three eighths pole and was steadily
encouraged down the lane to hold on well. BARKER LANE stalked three wide into the first turn and bid toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the far
turn in the three path then had to settle for second best. WAKES UP HAPPY raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole and came through the far turn in the five path then steadily improved to take third later yards. DYNACASTLE settled well back off the rail the
first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished
evenly. CANARSIE PRINCESS rated off the early pace toward the inside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but
drifted into the lane and flattened stride the final sixteenth. VINTAGE GIN was hustled along to a slim early lead but was caught leaving the first turn, gave
chase down the backstretch though faded past the five sixteenths pole. CALCUTTA broke a step slow and raced well back early on then bid only mildly.
ROCKET BUSTER rounded the opening turn about the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. YODEL LADY rounded the first turn in
the five path and raced outside into the backstretch then showed little response. VIOLA'S LEGACY was not a factor.
