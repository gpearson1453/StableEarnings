CAPTAIN CORN away alertly, made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear under a few strikes of a right handed
whip and won going away under a strong hand ride. SCHMULTZY bore in at the start, pressured the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match
while clearly second best. JEDI TEMPLE hopped at the start, bid three wide entering the turn then failed to sustain that bid. CANT LOLLYGAG offered a
mild bid along the inside into the stretch then came up empty. CANDY'S REVENGE had good early speed then faded. HIGH DOLLAR failed to menace.

second. BELTON AVE trailed into the far turn then had a mild rally late along the rail. BLUE MONARCH bore out badly at the start bumping rivals then failed

the late charge of the winner. EXTRA SALSA vied for the lead along the rail into the stretch then failed to offer the needed response. DUSTEM CAROLINA
