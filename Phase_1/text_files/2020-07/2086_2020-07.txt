pack and had a mild gain on the far turn but needed more. WORLD OF PROSPECTS was unhurried early and raced evenly from the inside on the far turn
but was no real threat. RED SEPTEMBER was up close and a factor on the far turn but flattened out. RATFACE MACDOUGALL showed speed from the
outside but was headed on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. TH ORIGINAL SCOTTY was well back and showed

close and forced the pace on the turn but with a slim lead from the four path in mid stretch was outgunned. STROLLING POSSE showed speed from the
outside and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. SPANISH TOWN was off slow and had a bid from the inside
on the turn but leveled off in mid stretch. WICKEN CENTS was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no threat. MAXIMUM SENTENCE had no

Footnotes
DOCTOR UPTOWN broke poorly, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. EASY WEEKEND was unhurried
early, moved up on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for place. THOR'S THUNDER set a pressured pace and had a slim
lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. KYSLIOS'S JUSTICE was in range, saved ground on the far turn and from
the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. AMERICAN DRIVEN showed speed from the inside and dueled on the far turn but leveled off through the
stretch. WALKINAROUNDMONEY was in touch and roused on the far turn but had no response. SECRET ROI was up close early but chased on the far
turn and had nothing left. SEASON HALL was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. DEN OF THIEVES was well back, trailed the field, was pulled up
in mid stretch and walked off.

and gained ground on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. BRONZE AGE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but
had no late kick. OPTIC was hustled early and set the pace, headed on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. ELUSIVE RO
was off the pace and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. WATER POLO showed speed from the outside but
chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch flattened out. STORMY LEO was in range early but lost ground on the turn and was
empty.

and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn but was caught late. CLASSY VISION had no speed and gained ground on the far turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch needed more. PETITE AMIE broke poorly, had a mild gain on the far turn and was the best of the rest. OVERTURNED was off
the pace, saved ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes. AILIS stalked the early leader and was roused on
the far turn but had no response. LINDATALKS was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn and was outrun. SONNY'S DREAM was in mid pack early
but trailed the field on the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUMMER RETREAT set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch prevailed. TALE OF RONIN was in touch, roused on the turn
and from the four path through the stretch gained gradually. UNCLE LOU was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of
the stretch was up for show. DEVIL MAGIC stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but had no late kick. OMAR was in range and raced evenly
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch evened out. R DANCE HALL was well back and closed the gap on the turn but from the four path
at the top of the stretch had no impact. LEO THE RABBIT was hustled early and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. SLEEK IDEA was off the
pace, showed nothing and was never a threat.

Footnotes
OBLIVIOUSLY tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. TRICKERATION
stalked the early leader, raced evenly on the far turn and was second best in a good effort. KLASSY DELIGHT set the pace and had a clear lead on the far
turn but gave way through the stretch. EINSTEIN'S BABE was off slow and gained ground on the far turn but needed more. MARVEL showed no speed and
had a mild gain on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch leveled off. LEGAL IN CANADA was unhurried early, saved ground on the far
turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. WILKO'S LUCK was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and was not a factor. GABBY'S BALLERINA
was in touch and hustled along on the far turn but had no impact. DOODLE DANDY was in range but chased on the far turn and failed to fire.
KEEPANEYEONME was in mid pack early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
