Footnotes
CARTHAGE was hustled along to take over at the five sixteenths pole and dueled clear midway on the turn, then dug in under steady handling to widen.
BRET'S LEGACY angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the five path and finished well, though, had to settle for second best. RAINBOW
RIVER chased the leaders and rounded the turn off the rail then raced evenly through the lane. MAZ'S MAGIC was hustled along with the early pace but
dropped back at the rail midway on the turn and weakened the final sixteenth. JUST GO WITH IT was hustled along with the early pace, raced in the four
path of the turn, entered the stretch outside and showed little more. WHATS THE CHANCES chased the leaders toward mid track then bore out on the turn
and lost all chance. MUSTA NEVER MET U gave chase toward the outside, saved ground on the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF ANYTHING chased the pace outside and raced in the five path most of the turn, was carried to the seven path nearing the head of the lane but
dug in to take the lead in later yards. CASTLE OF CAYLEE gave chase through the backstretch and rounded most of the turn about the three path, but was
carried to the six path approaching the top of the lane then outfinished the final sixteenth. HAPPY FREEDOM chased the pace toward the inside and raced
at the rail on the turn, raced evenly to late stretch but flattened stride nearing the wire. MARLEESBEEBEE hustled clear leaving the chute but was caught
flattening stride the final yards. QUITE SUGGESTIVE chased the pace then saved ground on the turn, but drifted to the five path approaching the head of
the lane and weakened inside the sixteenth pole. LADY SPARROW gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn just off the rail and showed little
more. SUZIE Q SONDE came away a step slow and angled to the outside to give chase, though was not a factor. SISTER HOLLIE gave chase while saving
ground.

Footnotes
THE WAYNE FACTOR rated a slim early lead inside and was met at even terms leaving the second turn, came under pressure from the three eighths pole,
drew clear toward the quarter then drew off under steady encouragement. A TRUE GENTLEMAN settled back off the rail then bid leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in to get second later yards. FRENCH'S QUEST stalked the winner two deep and challenged that one leaving
the second turn, but, dropped back toward the quarter pole and relented second in later yards. SET'EM UP JOE settled back in the three and four paths
then bid leaving the three eighths pole to pass some rivals. CARMELO raced in the five path the opening turn and settled just off the early pace, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, though, weakened on the far turn. EDDY DIRT saved ground and showed little response through the
backstretch. MORNING MUSE settled off the pace and showed little more after the opening three quarters, then rounded the far turn about the five path.

Footnotes
WE LOVE NANNI gave chase and took aim in the four path nearing the head of the lane, moved to the front inside the eighth pole then drew away later
yards. BEST TO BE ME contested the pace and kept the edge at the rail on the turn, drew briefly clear leaving the turn and put What You Own away, but
picked up We Love Nanni past the pole and relented to that one the final sixteenth. IRMA GIRL gave chase and rounded the turn in the five path then
finished well to take third later yards. DAKOTA MIST chased the leaders toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail but flattened out inside the eighth
pole. LIZZIE'S LAST chased the leaders inside but drifted to the five path on the turn and weakened. CLERESTORY gave chase outside, raced in the five
path of the turn then weakened. SWISS THUNDER raced well back. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE was no factor racing mostly wide. WHAT YOU OWN contested
the pace two deep and continued at a close disadvantage through the turn, but dropped back into the lane and gave way.
