Footnotes
RED ROLLIN set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch prevailed. BENADETTE'S LADY stalked the leaders from the inside
and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch just missed. IT'SNICETOBENICE was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the
turn and from the five path through the stretch finished well. HANSEN'S GIRL was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at
the top of the stretch was outfinished. FLECK was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire.
SILLY SIMONE was in touch and roused on the turn but had no response.

Footnotes
FOREHEAD FRED was off the pace, moved up on the turn and rallied in time. SEA ANNA DREAM was up close, a good position on the turn and had the
lead from the four path in mid stretch but failed to hold. VYTRUVIAN was hustled early, had a slim lead on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good
effort. WALKINAROUNDMONEY was in range and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. WILD ABOUT BLUE was
unhurried early and a factor on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch leveled off. NEW NEW YORK was off slow, trailed the field on the
turn and had no impact. GIDEON'S SWORD showed early speed and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had
nothing left. NONIOBUSINESS was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.
