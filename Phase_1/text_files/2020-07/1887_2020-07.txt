BUILDER briefly bobbled to begin but quickly recovered, shifted outside of TOUCHED BY AUTISM and was four wide to the backstretch, pressed that one
to the second turn, rallied four wide to the stretch, was on terms with the runnerup through the final furlong and got the nod gamely. ARCH PRINCE never
far back to the second turn, rallied inside rivals and off the rail to the stretch, collared BUILDER in upper stretch then battled that one through the final
furlong and just missed while easily second best. MANILA MISCHIEF had no speed, trailed for a half mile, offer a bid three wide into the second turn, swung
out five deep nearing the quarter pole but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. TOUCHED BY AUTISM had the best speed, set the pace in the three
path for six furlongs then was overtaken and gave way.

SECRETLY PARANOIDE was in front in the early going then settled off the runnerup's lead, came two wide on the turn, rallied to engage ACADIA FLEET
leaving mid stretch and dug in gamely to prevail. ACADIA FLEET hustled past the winner after a eighth mile, set the pace three wide to the stretch,
responded determinedly in the drive and just missed. STREUSEL chased the pace three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally.
DAIRY KID also was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. CHARMING LASS tracked the
pace early, circled four wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
JAMMERS JUSTICE was a pace factor to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, rallied determinedly in the final furlong and held driving.
BUEN AMIGO was well placed off the leaders to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, had a clear run inside in the drive but could not threaten the
winner. PRAISE LOUDLY was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, circled five wide to the stretch, rallied to mid stretch then hung late.
PEGASUS SPRINT had good speed, was on the pace inside rivals to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, stayed to mid stretch then weakened.
CLARENCE HEADS was allowed to settle for a half mile, raced three wide on the second turn when in good position to the stretch but could not muster the
needed late response. NIL PHET got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch and weakened in the
drive. GALAXY MASTER attended the pace between rivals to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired.
RED STAR was pinched back at the start and raced five wide throughout.

Footnotes
ZELAIA pressed the pace to the turn, came three then four wide to the stretch, responded, battled the runnerup hand, boot and whip to the line and got the
best of that one. ILLAPAWNIE stalked the pace to the turn, was two wide to the stretch, rallied to the front inside rivals in mid stretch, resisted the winner but
was nipped late. YOU WANNA EAR RIP broke slow, had no speed, was fanned four wide to the stretch then did not threaten the top two. GOLDEN
DELIGHT hustled to the lead, set the pace two then three wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. BOOMCHICABOOM also broke slow, was outrun
to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but did not offer a closing response. AWESOME ALESSANDRA was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the
stretch then tired. ALWAYS IN VEGAS was very wide throughout and never prominent.

Footnotes
OUI SAY NO pushed to the front, set the pace to the turn, kicked away to a clear lead to the stretch then maintained that advantage to mid stretch but was
tiring in the late stages and just held on. GO VAIDAGIRL had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch then closed resolutely but too late. HEAT SEEKING
LETA was outsprinted to the turn, bid five deep then shifted out to circle seven wide into the stretch and also closed willingly to the line.
GRAZENBYTHEBAY got outsprinted to the turn, followed the winner three wide into the stretch and finished in a rally. SHAWNEE PASS had no speed, was
caught five then six wide to the stretch and closed the gap to the line. BRITE TAN was chasing early, raced three wide to the stretch then lacked the needed
late response. STYLE AWARD also chased the winner but was caught out five then six wide on the turn and weakened. PACIFIC SILENCE pressed the
pace early but was outrun on the turn and gave way in the stretch. TAHOE BLUE had brief speed only then stopped.
