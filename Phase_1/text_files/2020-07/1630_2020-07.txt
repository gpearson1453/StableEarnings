ZEKE THE STREAK chased the leader into the turn, surged past that one in hand two wide, drew clear readily through upper stretch, was put to a right
handed whip at the furlong marker and won as much the best. BLITZING MARIO away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn, was
shaken up once the winner passed then held on to second under strong urging. TAURUS C trailed early outside and had a mild rally late in the six path.
LEAP BABY LEAP went evenly. BRILLIANT BOY had brief speed inside. CHECKWITHME was through early.

Footnotes
IVORY NOT WHITE never far back, circled rivals with a burst of speed in the four path through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch then widened rapidly
to win as much the best while in hand. AUNT PEG dueled for the early lead two wide, edged clear on the turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was
no match for the winner. BIONDETTA dueled with the runner up along the inside into the turn then faded. BLU HAWAII vied for lead the lead along the
inside and failed to respond. CINS BOSS checked along the rail at the half mile marker while lacking racing room, shifted out two wide, offered a mild bid on
the turn then came up empty. OPEN CHECK BOOK had speed into the turn then gave way. BETTER VIBES was through early.
