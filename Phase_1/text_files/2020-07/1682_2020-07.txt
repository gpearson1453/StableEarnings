DOHENY BEACH stalked the speed quartet from the far outside, went five wide around the turn, rallied under left-handed urging, took control past the
eighth pole and edged clear under right-handed urging late. STAY LEGENDARY vied between rivals, inched ahead around the turn, responded when
challenged from the outside in the drive, fought back from the inside and proved a game second. U. S. DANGER vied four deep early then chased the
leader, bid four wide and three deep into the stretch, flattened late but held the show. WICKED BLUE vied three deep, chased three wide into the stretch,
angled to the inside and finished willingly but missed the show. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE traveled in the two path into the turn, came out entering the lane
and passed a tired rival. JACK COOL off a bit slow to begin, went up inside to vie for command, lost ground around the turn and faded in the drive.

SHAKE N FRIES dueled inside of MALIBU BAY two wide then three wide into the stretch, roused near the three-sixteenths, drifted in a bit past the eighth
pole and inched away in deep stretch. WAR WATCH well placed behind the top pair, stalked a bit off the inside, angled out around the turn, entered four
wide into the stretch, closed from the outside and nailed rival for second. MALIBU BAY dueled for command from the outside, four wide into the lane, battled
down the stretch, outkicked by the winner and edged for second. IRISH BALLAD raced outside a rival then three wide into the turn, four wide leaving the
bend and whittle the gap late. LAKE SHOW angled to the inside, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. FERGUSON traveled in the two path
around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
KIRSCH TRUFFLE vied three deep into the turn, outside a rival around the bend and powered away in the drive. REAL GOOD DEAL stalked off the rial,
angled out on the turn and came five wide into the stretch, produced a mild rally and nailed rival for the place. DURGA tracked four to five wide through the
turn, drifted in late and lost the place at the wire. VIOLENT SPEED chased the top trio into the turn, asked four wide into the stretch, floated in by DURGA in
the late stages and weakened after. DAIRY KID stalked the pace early, saved ground around the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and needed more.
SHARONA SUNSET away quickly from the inside, set the pace under pressure, fought back around the turn and into the stretch and faded. GODDESS
APHRODITE raced outside a rival into and around the turn, went three to four wide into the stretch and faded. FOR MY BROTHER pressed the pace
outside the leader, raced between and came in tight quarters entering the turn, chased into the drive and weakened. PRINCESS BYE threw head and was
off slow to begin, exited the turn four wide and proved no menace. GREAT SALVATION threw head and broke in the air, saved ground into the stretch,
came out in the lane and had little left for the drive.
