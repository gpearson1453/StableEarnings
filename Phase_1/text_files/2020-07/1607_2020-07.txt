winner. GOLD SUPPLY chased the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. EXCESSIVE BELIEF was
forwardly placed from off the rail throughout and finished evenly in the drive. LADY IN GREEN lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not
reach contention. VERAAJ was bumped at the start, press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. CARDS

MISSED THE BOAT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, drifted in with a furlong to run, angled out and was up in the
closing yards. SHAMISEN was away in good order to dispute the pace with BATTLE POINT RED from off the rail, vied with that rival through a prolonged
drive but could not resist the winner from over the top. BATTLE POINT RED was off a step slow, rushed to vied, dueled for the lead with SHAMISEN while
racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. COLEINATOR broke sharply to chase the leaders from the inside and weakened after going
three furlongs. GREAT EAGLE broke awkwardly, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PREACHINATDINNER
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace.

DOCKTARRI was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, responded when challenged by ONLY THE HIGH ROAD nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and by THORN LEGACY in mid-stretch and gamely prevailed over those two through a vigorous drive. THORN LEGACY tracked the
leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, offered a bid in mid-stretch, vied with the winner but could not match strides late. ONLY THE HIGH
ROAD broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied, led briefly
but gave way through the final yards. IRISH TERRIER was forwardly placed early from between foes, angled out into the stretch and gradually weakened.
GOLDEN COWBOY stumbled at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
WINDY POINT was away in good order to press the pace of FOR YOU ONLY while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing quarter,
opened a clear lead into the lane and held that rival safe to the wire. FOR YOU ONLY was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from off the rail,
responded when challenged by the winner approaching the stretch but could not match strides in the drive. O. K. SO FAR was off a step slow, raced
unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. SUDDENLY AWESOME was bumped at the break then forwardly place,
moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. LADY CAMPBELL was never far back while racing from off the rail, angled out approaching
the stretch and finished evenly late. MAGICAL SPELL lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and was not a
factor. FORTY FOUR CARAT broke out, raced off the pacesetters, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
