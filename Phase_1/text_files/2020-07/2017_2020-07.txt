Footnotes
ATILL I CHIME vied inside rivals but off the fence up the backstretch, was joined by an inside foe around the turn going two to three wide and between
runners on that bend, dueled through the stretch and drifted out a bit under left-handed urging but dug in to hold. SPEEDY WILDCAT broke a bit awkwardly
then was mildly encouraged forward inside, bid along the rail on the turn, was even turning for home but held off by the aforementioned following a duel
through upper- to mid-stretch. THE PACESETTER pressed the pace, was outside three to four wide on the turn but proved no match for the top pair.
RAGTIME RYTHM was a bit fractious behind the gate, stalked from outside going five wide on the turn and lacked the needed late kick. FUEGO Y FURIA
broke on top but was soon outpaced, chased from the four path through the turn and failed to rally. JESSICA LEE trailed early, went five wide on the turn
and was never near enough to threaten. ALL STEAMED UP was hard to load, raced just off the fence in the two to three path and was not a factor.
MOMMAS HUNGRY EYES raced a bit greenly off the inside following breaking inwardly, went three to four wide on the turn and was empty in the stretch.

SHAME ON BEA was encouraged forward inside rivals but well off the fence, vied inside a foe nearer the rail on the turn, drifted out leaving that bend and
through upper stretch, regained the lead about a sixteenth out and held. BULLY BABY broke inwardly at the break bothering a rival, vied outside the
aforementioned, stumbled about the three-eighths pole, went three wide on the turn, floated six wide into upper stretch and was outfinished. INDIAN
FIREBLOSSOM broke outwardly just a bit, switched outside from in behind foes about the three-eighths, went four wide on the turn coming five wide into
upper stretch and losing ground on the top two, moved in a path and rallied inside those but was too late. JASMINE BABY chased from outside five to six
wide on the turn and weakened. BEALRIGHT GINGER got loose briefly behind the gate, checked at the start, was outpaced early despite encouragement,
began to advance three to four wide on the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch before shifting in and gained mildly late. FIRE FLING broke outwardly
just a bit, was off the leaders in about the two path on the turn and failed to rally. GIRLSLIKE DIAMONDS dropped back two to three wide on the turn, was
eased in the stretch, walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

FILL THE BILL set the pace from off the inside, went in the three path on the turn, was challenged inside by COMIC HOT TODDY, retook a narrow lead in
upper stretch and dug in to hold sway. COMIC HOT TODDY bobbled slightly at the start, pressed from inside, saved ground on the rail making a bid at the
top of the stretch, was outfinished. CAUGHT STEALING bobbled slightly at the start, switched outside FILL THE BILL about the half-mile marker, stalked
four deep on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. OUR SOARING ANGEL chased in the four path on the turn and failed to rally. RIO SAND DANCER
hopped at the start, went three wide on the turn and was not a threat. QUEEN OF HOLLYWOOD chased from the two path, steadily dropped back into and
on the turn and came up empty. INDIAN SECRET reared at the start, went four wide outside foes on the turn, tired. Following a stewards' inquiry no action

Footnotes
DIGGER'S GOLD shifted in clearing the back, settled in behind in the two path, advanced in that path on the turn, split rivals in upper stretch and exchanged
a light brush just past the furlong marker, took the lead in mid-stretch and held. RIGHT JAB broke in and bumped with a rival then veered out a bit clearing
the gap, chased from inside a rival just off the fence, moved out from the two path to be four wide by the latter part of the turn commencing a move, was
within range but could make no headway on the winner late. MY STORM WARRIOR was bumped early by an inside foe and lightly brushed with the outside
rival, raced outside into the turn going four deep into that bend, moved out six wide past the quarter pole, gained late. DIABOLICAL PACKAGE exchanged a
bump at the start, vied inside a rival but off the fence, went in the two path and edged clear turning for home but weakened in the lane. PUB switched
outside a foe early up the backstretch, moved back in going five then four wide on the turn still with much to do but gained mildly late. QUICK LAUGH was
lightly brushed in the early going while moving in to prompt the pace from outside, went in the four path on the turn while beginning to lose ground,
exchanged a light brush near the furlong marker and came up empty thereafter. DAN WHO tracked from inside, saved ground on the fence through the turn
but was in just a hair tight at the top of the lane, moved out at that juncture and made no late bid. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT bumped the outside rival passing
the gap, dropped back and raced in the three path through the turn and was never near enough to threaten. MISSISSIPPI MUSIC broke a step slowly,
switched out widest and moved forward to chase the leaders, began to drop back in the five path on the turn and faded thereafter.

Footnotes
JORNALERO dueled inside a rival but well off the fence going in the three path and edging away briefly on the turn, was headed in upper stretch but
resurgent a sixteenth out to win going away. AISLE RUNNER pressed outside the winner, went four wide on the turn, bid in upper stretch, was outfinished.
DELBERT TOO tracked the leading pair then stalked into the turn going five then four wide on that bend, moved out a bit in the stretch and kept on well late.
SMOOTH BLUES shifted in, went in the two path on the turn off the leading pair, ran on evenly. CHEESE TRAY tracked inside mid-pack, came out in upper
stretch and needed more. STAY AWAY JONESY broke a step slowly and steadied slightly at the start, was outpaced early having switched out a bit, went in
the three path on the turn, came out five wide into upper stretch and ran on mildly. W F RIP TIDE chased from outside, dropped back six wide on the turn,
drifted in a bit in upper stretch and came up empty. ILIKEROLLIN broke in a bid, went in the two path through the turn and failed to rally. INDIAN GAMBLER
switched out early then moved back in, saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. ZESTY JAZZMAN broke poorly, raced well off the inside and was not
a threat.
