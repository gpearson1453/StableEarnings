Footnotes
BRUTALIZE chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer through the turn, responded to pressure to gain a clear margin and was well clear while
kept to task. OUR LAST SHOT stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded when asked but could not reach the
winner. SOVOL pressed the early pace from the inside, made a bid along the rail entering the drive and rallied late for the show. COME ON ARCHIE forced
the early pace inside, remained forward for the drive but was ouatfinished for the show. SOUTHERN LIGHT chased the early pace outside but came up
empty in the drive. HEREWECOMETOGETYOU was never a factor. DAPPER DAN MAN broke sharp from between foes, gained a clear early margin,
remained clear through the turn then gave way in the drive. FIREMAN SID was never close.

IT'S ALL CASH stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, dueled
through the second turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth pole and was well clear late while under steady pressure. I DONT KNOW EITHER chased the
early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded when asked but was no match for the winner while holding the place.
MAJOR GLADY'S TEAM forced the early pace from the outside, remained forward for the drive but could not keep pace. MISS FUNNY GUN broke sharp
from the inside, gained a clear early margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but had nothing for the drive. BAD GAL
RIRI could only improve position. WHATDUZITMATER could only pass tired ones. DEVASTATING BEAUTY forced the early pace and tired. CYBER
SENSATION was never a factor. PRINCESS SIMONE had a steady fade. HOLY SONG was finished early. One mile split time unavailable due to a timer

between foes early, remained forward for the drive but came up empty. SPRING VALUE could only improve position. ROARING STAR FIRE went evenly.

Footnotes
COACH O'SHEA broke sharp from the inside, quickly gained the early margin, remained clear through the turn, widen the effort at the eighth pole and held
sway. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY chased the early pace outside, remained forward for the drive, responded but could not reach the winner. AMANDAS
LIGHTENING forced the early pace inside, remained forward but was no match for the top two. SHAR'S TREASURE chased the early pace from the
outside, made a bid but was too late. K D STREET was no real factor. BOBBY JR. chased the early pace outside and tired. SMARTY GRIMES was never
close. RIVERS RISING had a steady fade.
