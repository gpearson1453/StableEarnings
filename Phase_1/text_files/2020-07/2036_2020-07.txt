COASTAL STARLITE was chasing to the turn then rallied three wide to challenge the favorite into the stretch, dueled that one to mid stretch then dug in to
inch away driving. TWO BEARS had good speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, resisted the winner leaving, mid stretch then had to hang on
late for second. SECRETLY PARANOIDE pressed TWO BEARS to the turn, got outkicked two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and closed
willingly but too late. SEIZE THE CHANCE also was chasing the pace, circled four wide to briefly loom a threat to the quarter pole but was outkicked to mid
stretch and weakened. SOMARA had no speed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SIZZLING EVENING was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then rallied when set down, battled BABY YOU GOT IT in the final sixteenth and
got the nod. BABY YOU GOT IT was outsprinted early, raced four wide to the stretch, shifted widest for the drive, rallied to get on terms with the winner late
and just missed. RUN HEAT had good speed, dueled in the three path to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch but was tiring late. HONG KONG
COWBOY was also outrun to the turn, came four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. NORTH CROSS was chasing early then saved
ground to no avail. ROCKY ROSES hustled to contest the pace outside of RUN HEAT and four wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and
gave way. DAXSTER also was chasing the leaders while two wide but stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
TOP HARBOR had no speed and trailed to the turn, was three wide to mid turn then swung out six deep into the stretch, shifted widest for the drive and
closed with a strong run to be along in time. TOM'S SONG pressed the pace three wide to the stretch, responded to pressure in the drive, took a brief lead
leaving the sixteenth marker but was nailed by the winner. MY FATHER FOOTSTEP was chasing the pace from the rail to the stretch, shifted out for room
and closed with a rush to just miss second. MANDO had the best speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch, resisted TOM'S SONG to deep stretch
then was tiring late. A LITTLE BIT LUCKY had no speed, raced off the rail to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. DAVID NOSE BEST broke in
a tangle, had no speed, was forced to circle five wide on the turn and finished evenly late. GARDEES WORLD had no speed and was not a factor.
HENDAVID also chased the leaders three wide to the stretch then weakened, was pulled up shortly after the finish line and vanned off. POSO CREEK
stalked the pace early, got fanned four wide to the stretch and gave out in the drive.

Footnotes
POWER TIMES TWO was well placed behind the leaders to the turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch, got on terms in mid stretch then inched clear
driving. CASH MONEY was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide then swung out for room into the stretch and finished willingly for second. SHARON'S
FURY dueled in the two path to the stretch, was overtaken by the winner then could not save second. SIMPLY CHARMING was a pace factor outside of
SHARON'S FURY and three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. HARDY CHISEL tracked the pace two wide to the stretch,
was put to a drive and loomed a threat to mid stretch then flattened out. DOUBLE TIGER was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but
lacked a closing response. CASH LIMIT had no speed and was never a threat. SOUTHEAST ASIA was always outrun.
