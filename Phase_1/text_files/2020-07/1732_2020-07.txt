Footnotes
COPPER NICKEL cleared early while in the two path through the turn, continued on a clear lead while confidently ridden, maintained a clear lead while
others asked for more, widened into the lane under minimal urging, rider peeked back after straightening in the lane then continued to widen while in hand to
the end. WELLINGTON WONDER stalked the winner from the four path through the turns, was asked for more in late turn, could make no headway into the
winner's lead and settled for second best. DONTYOUREMEMBER was in the two path through the turns and into the lane, passed a couple tired ones for
the show spot but was never a serious contender. SHES THE CAUSE pressed the pace then settled back to chase the pace while in the three path, asked
for more in late turn, shifted into the four path for the drive and was empty. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was never a factor while racing in the three or four path
through the far turn. EMILY LANE tracked the pace while along the inside into the far turn, continued a factor until mid-turn then began losing ground and
was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
HONORING MAJOR stalked the pacesetter from the three path into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn, quickly made the lead and cleared,
widened to the eighth pole and was kept to the task to the end while continuing to extend the advantage. TRIDENT HIT was off the rail into the far turn,
moved from the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path, could not make headway into the winners lead but was kept
to the task to save the place spot. PICKFORD stalked the pace from the two path into the turn, could not go with the top two in mid-turn then re-engaged
through the final eighth to close in on the place spot. MISSISSIPPI set the pace along the inside into the far turn then gave way when headed on the far
turn. KNIGHT'S CROSS stumbled badly at the start causing the rider to grab a hold and steadied, advanced along the inside to track the pacesetters into
the turn then was empty after mid-turn. MOON OVER MONTANA was outrun while in the two or three path through the turns. HE TAKES CHARGE was in
the two path into the far turn when near the back and had nothing to give entering the lane. THREE-QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BOYFRIEND MATERIAL pressed then vied for the lead into the lane, dueled from the two path with runner on the inside, was bumped solidly near the
sixteenth pole then continued on to edge clear late. COURTING A KISS chased the pacesetters through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane
from the three or four path then was under a strong drive to just get up for the place spot. I'M CORFU set the pace while along the inside, under pressure
into the lane, dueled with the winner while along the rail, stepped out under left-handed urging and bumped rival, could not keep up with that one late and
lost the place spot at the wire. UNDERCOVER LOVER was unhurried while in the two to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-pack
and moved up while not a threat. CZECHMIGHT was in the three or four path through the turn and finished evenly. ONE FOR RICHIE was bumped at the
start and steadied while passing the gap, raced near the rail and was never a factor. ELZABE'S ON BOARD was along the inside through the turn and into
the lane and tired.

Footnotes
LIBERTYRUN pressed the pace two wide into the turn, asked for more in late turn, cleared into the lane then widened through the lane while under a drive.
PAQUIME was in the four path through the turn when in mid-pack, continued in the five path into the lane and remained steady through the stretch to run
down the place rival while not a threat to the top one. STRAIGHT EIGHT set the pace into the far turn while moving from the three to the two path, was
under pressure in late turn, could not keep up with the winner then could not hold the place runner safe late. NIAGARA CHARLIE was in the two path
through the turn and into the lane then moved up. VULCAN raced in the three to five path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved
up while never being an threat to the top ones. INSOFAR was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor. BARREL PROOF
chased the top ones through the turn while in the three or four path, continued in contention into the lane and was empty nearing the eighth pole. EL
CASADORA was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and tired. BARRISTER TOM was never a factor while in the three path through the turn and
into the lane. PASION AZTECA raced in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane widest and never was a menace. LEMME C UR
VOUCHER was outrun from the inside. SMOOTH MUSIC bobbled at the start then hustled up to be a part of the field, raced in the five to the four path
through the turn and was done.

Footnotes
HERBIES TOYS vied for the lead along the inside from the outset, continued on near even terms into the lane while still along the inside, continued dueling
inside the eighth pole, shook clear nearing the sixteenth pole and stayed. DAY TRIP vied for the lead while two wide through the turns, continued in close
proximity with an eighth to go then could not get past and was all out to save the place spot. STAGE READY raced in the two path through the turn, came
into the lane from the three or four path and finished with good energy to just miss the place spot. AUSTRIAN in the three path through the turns when never
far back, came into the lane as a contender then could not continue the response when finishing evenly. NOT VERY GENTLE tracked the two rival duel
through the turn while never far back, came into the lane with aim on the leaders and between rivals then continued to race between when losing spots late.
TRASHTALKINYANKEE was never a factor while racing in the two path through the turns. FIRERY TALE never made an impact while racing near the rail.
THE THREE-QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

TWO LAST WORDS was unhurried while off the rail, moved through the two then the three path in late turn when gaining momentum, came into the lane
from the four path and steadily gained through the final eighth and just got up while being brushed by the runner-up late. MAI TAI'S GEM raced in the four
path through the first turn, continued well off the inside into the far turn, bid four wide near the three-eighths pole, continued with good energy into the lane to
edge to the front outside the eighth pole, was joined by the top one soon after, dueled from the sixteenth in, came out a bit late to brush the winner then
could not hold that one safe. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK stalked the pacesetters into the far turn while in the three path, bid after mid-turn, gained a short
lead into the lane, dueled with the runner-up after straightening in the lane then could not keep along the inside. NUTTY TRAIN was never a serious threat
while racing in the two path throughout. IDEA MAN set the pace along the inside into the far turn while being pressured from the outside, continued on a
short lead near the three-eighths pole then gave way. DEVIL'S CROSS pressed the pacesetter from the two path into the far turn then could not keep up
and was done nearing the quarter pole. EXPRESSED moved up along the inside approaching the half-mile pole, continued to track the top ones into the
turn then was suddenly done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) chased the pacesetter from the two path through both turns, bid from the two path into the lane, caught the leader near the eighth
pole then edged clear inside the sixteenth and held. HAY DAKOTA chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the
three path and was a serious threat with an eighth to go then could not go with the winner and just got up for the place spot. ARGENTELLO (IRE) set the
pace along the inside into the lane, was under a drive when straightening in the lane, under pressure outside the eighth pole, stayed with the winner for a bit
then could not keep up and lost the place spot on the final head bob. GRAND JOURNEY stumbled outwardly at the start and settled to the back, raced in
the two path through the turns, moved up into the lane, angled out sharply from the two to the four or five path and was gaining momentum quickly at the
end. CULLUM ROAD was in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the three path, was bothered after straightening in
the lane when rival came into his path and finished evenly. FIRST PREMIO was never a serious factor while saving ground through the turns. PEEKACHO
raced in the three path through the turns when never far back then weakened after straightening in the lane.

Footnotes
SHARED SENSE was unhurried while along the inside down the backstretch, continued near the rail into the far turn, slowly angled off the rail when gaining
momentum through mid-turn, continued with good energy when angling four wide near the quarter pole, brushed with MAJOR FED when claiming the four
path, came into the lane form the four or five path and between rivals, straightened and continued momentum to edge past the leaders just inside the
three-sixteenths pole then widened to the wire while being kept to the task. MAJOR FED was in a bit tight at the start and settled to the back, trailed for half
while off the inside, entered the far turn from the three path, moved a bit further off the rail approaching the late turn, was beaten to the four path by the
winner and brushed by that one near the quarter pole, continued in the five path into the lane then chased the top one home. NECKER ISLAND stumbled at
the start, raced four wide through the first turn, continued to chase the pace from the four path down the backstretch, moved three wide near the
three-eighths pole, was a serious threat entering the lane three wide and between rivals, was on near even terms with the winner near the three-sixteenths
pole, could not keep up with that one while stepping in a path near the eighth pole then kept on to be clear for the show spot. EARNER chased then pressed
the pacesetter while two wide, bid in mid-turn and continued to be a serious contender entering the lane, was bothered when rival came down a path then
weakened thereafter. EXTRAORDINARY broke inwardly, tracked the pacesetters from the two path into the turn, lacked a path after straightening, shifted
into the four or five path and lacked a closing response. TAISHAN set the pace along the inside into the far turn, was under pressure into the lane then gave
way after straightening. WINNING IMPRESSION was jostled between rivals at the start, raced in the three path through the turns and was empty in the lane.
BACKGROUND checked entering the backstretch while between rivals, raced in the three path down the backstretch, was steadied when bumped nearing
the seven-sixteenths pole, raced in the four path through the turn and was done. NO GETTING OVER ME was brushed at the start when outside rival broke
inwardly, raced in two path into the far turn and was suddenly done after mid-turn and was eased to the wire. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF #8
MAJOR FED AGAINST THE RIDER OF #5 SHARED SENSE FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER POLE WAS DISALLOWED. The final time of
1:49.46 for the 1 mile and 1/8 was a new track record for the distance at Indiana Grand Racecourse.

ground, bid in the stretch, then was no match. AKAMAI stalked in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole, then was no match. OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS
stalked in the three path but had no late bid. TOTALLY raced inside and passed tired foes outside. FIVE STAR COLONEL dueled inside and gave way in
the stretch. SUNSIGN improved position late outside. STORMY CACTUSA stalked the pace between foes to the far turn and faded. DAAHER STREET was
not a factor. FOREVER A CHAMP stalked inside and faded in the stretch. G AS IN GEORGE faded. JACKSONS GOLD broke outward.
