Footnotes
RIO ALEX unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced four out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly five wide through the final
turn, and closed four wide in the drive to get up in time. POWER OF INTENTION broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first
turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, held a clear advantage into the lane, but was unable to hold off RIO ALEX late, while proving
clearly second best. SCULPTED away early and tracked the leader into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. BAKKEN AND EGGS was bumped from between rivals entering the first turn, before
drifting out midway through the first turn carrying BALDR out with him, held a tracking trip three wide in the run to the final turn, rallied three wide through the
turn, but needed more while finishing four wide in the drive. WUTHERING WIND away well and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out
from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and was outfinished in the drive. BALDR was carried out five wide midway through the first turn, before
racing into a tracking trip three out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, carried on four wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
SIR BREGOVIC broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the pacesetter and quickly assumed
command entering the final turn, and drew clear late. MACHINE tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied two wide
entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner, closed from along the inside late to prove easily second best. HARDENED HEART lagged well off
the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished from
along the rail in the lane to get up for the show spot in the final strides. DISCRETIONARY away well , and bumped repeatedly with a rival in the early going,
before dropping over on COWBOY CREEK, causing that rival to clip heels and stumble badly, raced to the lead entering the first turn, dictated the pace in
the run down the backstretch, was overtaken entering the turn, and faded over the final furlong. MY GRAND VALENTINE away alertly and was allowed to
settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the
drive. JUST MAKE BELIEVE bumped with a rival to his outside in the opening strides, before settling off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. COWBOY CREEK was pinballed repeatedly in
the run away from the gate, before being dropped over on, forcing him to clip heels and stumble badly, trailed well behind the field entering the backstretch
and was never in contention. Following the running of this race there was both a jockey's claim of foul as well as a stewards inquiry into the incident in the
run away from the gate. The jockey of COWBOY CREEK lodged a claim of foul against the rider of DISCRETIONARY for his involvement in the incident.
After review DISCRETIONARY was disqualified from fourth and placed last.

STEVIE'S SONG away well and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, assumed command and quickly opened a clear
advantage midway down the backstretch, held a clear lead into the stretch and was never seriously threatened. MOUSEY MOUSEY away alertly and
tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the
drive to hold the place. OUREVELADY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to just miss the place. BAD AND BOUGIE vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, eased
off a pace duel midway down the backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished in deep stretch. AMORCITO settled off the
early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive.
CONVERGENT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back, and failed to make a late impact. FAST BID (IRE) broke sharply and
stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, held a striking trip to the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. This race was

Footnotes
BAKKEN THE U S S R broke sharply and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to track the leader in
the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prevail. JACK DON'T DRINK bumped at the
start, and settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, began to gain ground in the run to the final turn,
rallied two wide through the turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. STORM BEACH away alertly and raced to the lead from along
the rail entering the lane the first time, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained a narrow advantage into the final turn, and gave way
grudgingly late. FINALLY FANTASTIC away well and tracked the leader three wide entering the stretch the first time, rallied three wide through the final turn,
and finished two out from the rail in the drive. COMMANDER B settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, advanced midway down the
backside, and into the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. AKASHIC settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering
the lane the first time, was always well back, raced two wide entering the final turn, and was never a serious factor. NUMAANYS BOY settled well off the
early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to lose touch with the field in the run down the backstretch and was
eased over the final furlong.

Footnotes
WISE MARKET away alertly and vied for the lead entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, assumed command entering the backstretch and
controlled the pace in the run to the final turn, maintained his advantage into the lane, and held the closers safely at bay late. SQUARE DANCER broke
sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place. SANAWAR away well and was
allowed to settle off the early speed while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, held a tracking trip from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch, was force to await room along the inside in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside entering the turn, and finished from along the rail
in the drive to just miss the place. APPELLANT dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, before easing into a tracking trip
one from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. WILL TO GOLD unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest two wide in the drive. SANTA FE TRAIL settled off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to drop back and lose touch with the field and was pulled up midway through the final
turn, but walked off under his own power. Following the running of this race SANTA FE TRAIL was reported to have bled.

Footnotes
HOME RUN GUY broke sharply and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, and inched clear late. ROBBIE MAC away alertly and raced to lead from along the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied along the rail while continuing to battled for the lead, was unable to match strides with the winner in the late stages, but
battled gamely to hold the place in a solid effort. SET TO SHINE stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, took up the chase two wide
entering the final turn, and finished two wide from between rivals in deep stretch to just miss the place. RANGER UP settled off the early pace while saving
ground along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to finish on even terms
with HE'S RELENTLESS. HE'S RELENTLESS settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the stretch drive to finish on even terms with RANGER UP. RACING RIVER was squeezed at the
start to get away slowly, trailed the field into the first turn, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed from along the rail in the drive. NORTHERN KID
lagged well back in the early going while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, was always well back and failed to make an impact.
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, but faded in the late stages.
