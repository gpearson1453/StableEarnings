Footnotes
CAJUN SHOTS broke toward the front,pressed the issue out of the chute, advanced to duel through the turn off the inside, put the other speed away turning
for home, kicked clear and maintained a daylight advantage to the wire while being kept to pressure. TOSHITA FOREVER broke back, improved position in
the turn, got closest three wide entering the stretch, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, clearly second best. WILD CHARLIE broke on top,
showed the way out of the chute, dueled through the turn inside the winner, could not match that one in the drive or prove a match for the runner up,
comfortably saved the show. SUNDIAL STAR dwelt at the start to spot the field a few lengths, raced back early, improved position off the inside without
posing a serious threat. AUNT JANA pressed the pace early well out in the strip, continued forwardly in the run up the backstretch, began to tire while five
wide exiting the turn, continued to fade through the stretch. GABY VEE was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
VICTORY TRIP away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, edged away from the other speed turning for home, kept that foe at bay through the
stretch under steady handling. RISKEY TRICKEY also away well, dueled inside the winner for three furlongs, could not keep up into the stretch, held sway
for the place. HIGHLY CENTSABLE settled in mid pack toward the inside, continued in the two path through the turn, steered out a bit for the drive, along
for the show late. CLOSING AMERICAN forwardly placed while well off the inside, had little for the two two in the drive, caught late for the show. COMMON
LAW CAT off a step slow, trailed early, four wide into the lane, angled in, mild late interest. SUPERCONDUCTOR made little impact while racing outside.
BEHINDA ANGEL was finished early, trailed home to be well beaten.

CALCULATE forwardly placed while three wide through the first turn, advanced and challenged in the far turn, showed the way into the stretch, drew well
clear while being kept to task. DRAX back early off the pace, advanced to be closest to the winner late in the final turn with a middle move, proved no match
in the drive. RUNCIMAN lacked early foot, steadied slightly behind some traffic with four furlongs to run, began to rally while between horses early in the
second turn, rallied for the show while not a threat to the top two. HOPE FOR CHANGE sprinted clear along the inside soon after the start, set the pace until
headed by the winner late in the final turn and began to weaken. LIGHTNING LEE fell well back after the start, moved out and improved four wide out of the
second turn then flattened out in the drive. CLASSIC EMMETT chased early, began a steady fade before a half. YANKEE CLIPPER settled off the pace,
paced to rally when called on for the drive. IDE B STRANDED forwardly placed for a half, stopped.

Footnotes
ANGEL CAT took back after the start to trail into the first turn, continued to trail in the run up the backstretch, advanced four wide and loomed boldly late in
the final turn, took over and drove well clear. IYATTA dueled early along the inside, chased the leader the middle half, could not match the winner's move
turning for home, took over the place in mid stretch and was clearly second best. BELLA KRISTINA settled off the pace and the inside, finished up best of
the rest. CASUAL COOL broke on top, dueled through the first turn in the two path, clear onto the backstretch, showed the way into the far turn, offered little
resistance to the winner when that one challenged turning home and gave way when headed. ROSECOLOREDGLASSES raced forwardly and three wide
for five furlongs and faltered.

Footnotes
OUR PRINCE away in good order, dueled up front along the inside, put that rival away approaching the furlong marker, was fully extended to hold off the
runner up late. UNBRIDLED HALO off a step slow, made a steady advance three wide through the turn, lugged out then in through the lane while continuing
to close the gap on the winner, was straightened and and finished willingly while too late. GRIP TIGHT broke alertly, allowed the two leaders to go early,
raced four wide through the turn, staged a mild rally to be well clear for the show, no threat to the top three. IDE B A WINNER away well, alternated up front
in the two path outside the winner for three furlongs and began to weaken. TENCENTSUPERHOOP bothered at the start, failed to menace. LONE STAR
CLASS broke out, trailed most of the way and was never a threat. LETITHAPPENLUCKY broke out sharply, was straightened then was used to advance to
be closest to the dueling leaders, stopped in the turn, finished far back.

Footnotes
IRISH PRIORITY broke out but alertly, prompted the pace in the three path up the backstretch, inched closer late in the turn, long drive, wore down rival to
prove best. D'WILD BARONESS broke on top, vied up front while between rivals into and through the turn, narrowly showed the way into and through upper
stretch, proved stubborn to the end, remained clear for the place. GRILLIN settled along the inside, asked along into the stretch after steered out a bid,
dropped back down to the rail for the drive, no match top two late, gained the nod for the show. BLUE RIDGE HEAT off the pace and the inside, came four
out to five wide exiting the turn, closest to the top two a furlong out, lost the nod for the show late. HEY GRACE last away, lacked speed, four wide into the
lane, moved out to best widest for the drive, managed a mild gain down the center of the strip. LUCKY LINZ in mid pack in the run up the backstretch, three
wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. PADDY O'BELLE lacked speed, was five wide through the turn, lacked a kick in the drive. CAJUN
MUSIC vied up front along the inside for a half then gave way in the drive. HALOS STORM fell quickly back after the start to trail, fell further and further
back until eased up stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
THREE RUN HOMER in a bit tight at the break, took control after the start to be clear through the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch while
maintaining daylight, drew off through the stretch under token encouragement to win ridden out. NO PLANS in the second flight in the first turn, improved
along the inside turning into the stretch, could do little with the winner in the drive, held sway for the place late. BUSHIDO SAMURAI also raced with the
second group through the first turn, chased the winner the middle half while continuing outside, also proved no match for the winner in the drive, trying to
come back for the place while narrowly saving the show. SUPER FACTOR broke in to help tighten up the winner, raced back, moved out to race five wide
much of the way, continued wide in the drive, finished willingly while too late for the place midtrack. WHEN I DO raced in the second flight toward the inside,
came three wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch drive. PRAYER BOY last away, trailed for six furlongs, four out to five wide turning for home,
steered out wider, improved position while not a serious threawt. CAJUN CASH chased the winner early, in the second flight the middle four furlongs, four
wide turning for home, tired through the stretch. ACTIF ONE broke out to help tighten up the winner, lacked early foot, failed to rally. JADE STAR was never

Footnotes
LOVE CONQUERS broke on top, allowed the leader to go early, raced closest to that one onto and up the backstretch, collared that rival midway on the
final turn, drew out when straightened for home. LOOKING FOR BULL lacked early foot, continued to lag in the run up the backstretch, moved out, split foes
for the drive, proved game for the place, no threat to the winner. PURIM KING back early, moved closer after a half, came on the outside for the drive, long
drive for the place, outkicked for that position, clear of the other rival. CHAOSMOS sprinted clear to set the pace, continued to hold a daylight advantage up
the backstretch, faltered when headed by the winner late in the final turn.

Footnotes
IT'SUPTOYOUPAL bumped and bothered at the break, behind the first flight while racing outside, advanced and challenged three wide turning into the
stretch, edged clear under pressure. BOURBON REVENGE dueled up front while closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage when the winner
challenged three wide into the lane, proved no match for that rival, held sway for the place. WESTERN STAR dueled up front outside the runner up in the
two path, vied between the top two into the lane, could not match either the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. COACH O off a step slow, moved up
to mid pack toward the inside, went evenly in lacking a closing response. ZIPPIT ZIPPY lacked speed, improved position slightly without posing a serious
threat. WILLY B FAST failed to menace. HEZA FORTUNE broke out sharply, bumped foe, recovered to race forwardly early, began a steady fade before a
half. SMOKEY GAVIN was always outrun while racing wide.
