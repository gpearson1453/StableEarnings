BEAR KITTY stalked the pace, closed four-wide late turn, bid a furlong out and drove clear. MY CANTATA forced the pace from mid backstretch, stalked
from the rail on the turn, challenged a furlong out, dueled, but was outfinished. GIMBALA also forced the pace from mid backstretch, raced two and
three-wide on the turn, bid in earnest at the top of the stretch, dueled, but was outkicked late. MODUS OPERANDI, rated off the early pace, closed to mid
pack still on the backstretch, chased two and three-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. CRY UNCLE set a pressured pace, was engaged at the top of the
stretch then gave way in the final furlong. AFLEET CONNECTION settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn then closed gamely between
foes.

ORBITING THE SKY pressed the pace, dueled on the turn, wore down SAILING BY late turn and held CLAIREESSENCE safe under a drive.
CLAIRESSENCE stalked the pace, closed three-wide late turn, dogged the leader through the stretch but hung late. SADIE IRENE stalked the pace, came
two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. PLUIE D'AVRIL was in range early then hustled three and four-wide on the
turn and finished under a determined drive. BLONDILIKESTODANCE settled in mid pack, chased hard three to five-wide on the turn then chased through
the stretch. MISGUIDED PASSION settled off the pace, angled from the rail to four-wide late on the turn, swung out six-wide at the top of the stretch but
offered no response in the late stages. BLONDE ATTITUDE stalked in hand early, was blocked along the rail late turn then closed with some interest in mid
stretch but failed to menace. SAILING BY showed early speed, shook clear briefly on the main track then set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn, gave
way approaching the stretch and faded.

MAYITO stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn, dueled into the stretch, took command and held sway under a hand ride. A GERSHWIN TUNE
bumped with ATTILIO at the start, settled in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied up late for the place. SUNDANCE HIT, off slowly,
closed up the rail to stalk the pace, chased two-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. THOR'S THUNDER showed early speed, shook clear
onto the main track, set the pace, was engaged late turn, dueled into the stretch and yielded a furlong out. DENMARK raced in mid pack, was hustled three
and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. ATTILIO, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, steadied behind a fading rival late turn and
was through at the top of the stretch. HIGHLAND JAX was well back early, rode the rail on the turn then lacked a rally. CONQUER THE BREEZE settled off
the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. BEAR CUB showed brief speed then stalked the pace, tired late turn, was
eased at the top of the stretch and was pulled up, did not finish but walked off.

Footnotes
CHART moved up to an early lead, set the pace, quickened through the turn then was under a steady drive and just held. WEED BE HAPPY stalked the
pace, chased hard three-wide late turn, gained steadily in the stretch and missed in a photo. ANN OF CLEVES settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on
the turn, chased into the stretch and closed gamely. SEA LILY broke alertly but outward, forced the pace, chased three and four-wide through the turn then
evened out in deep stretch. CEE'S OVERTURE forced the pace, chased along the rail late turn, was all out in the stretch but evened out in the late stages.
CANADIAN MAGIC settled in mid pack, dropped back a bit on the turn, chased into the stretch and flattened out. PIPER'S SKY raced in mid pack, was
hustled four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. FRESH PRINCESS settled in mid pack, came three to five-wide on the turn, was all out in the stretch
then evened out late.

Footnotes
CASSIE'S RAINBOW broke alertly, stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch, gained command a 16th out and held sway
under a drive. CEFALO bumped with HIPPIE CHICK leaving the gate, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, had the lead a furlong out
but failed to stave off the winner while best of the rest. SIX PACK GIRL settled in mid pack, chased four-wide on the turn then closed a gap for show. ANITA
GRIGIO raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. CLASSY N' SILENT sprinted to a long early lead,
set the pace, was under a ride on the turn and was passed a furlong out then chased to the end. HONEY GIRL raced in mid pack, chased hard along the
rail and two-wide on the turn, angled out approaching the stretch but was unable to threaten. MUSKOKA LADY settled off the pace, was hustled two and
three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. HIPPIE CHICK, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn and was all out
in the stretch. RED DANCER settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but tired in the final 16th. ANUT got off slowly and
veered outward, trailed the field and lacked a rally.
