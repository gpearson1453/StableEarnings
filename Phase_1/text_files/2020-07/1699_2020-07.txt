Footnotes
HELP ME OUT chased then pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid entering the lane, collared the pacesetter when straightening in the lane then
drove past and widened. STRONG ILLUSION chased the dueling pacesetters through the turn and into the lane, tipped into the three path for the drive, was
no match for the winner then settled for second best. ANGRY BEE was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and finished a distant third.
RUSHING TIME set the pace on a clear lead into the turn, was under pressure through the turn, continued under pressure into the lane then gave way.
LITTLE MAEMI hesitated at the start and spotted the back of the field about three lengths, raced well back along the inside and was never in it. HOOSIER
PREMIUM was in the two or three path through the turn and tired after entering the lane. PER RULING #IG-2020-2085 FROM THE INDIANA HORSE
RACING COMMISSION, ANGRY BEE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
RICKI chased the early pace while in the three path, moved to the four path and three wide in late turn to challenge for the top spot, gained a short lead
while straightening into the lane from the three path then maintained the advantage until late and inched clear near the wire. WANNA HAVE FUN settled off
the early pace while saving ground into the turn, bid near the three-eights pole along the open rail, led in late turn and into the lane, then could not hold the
winner safe while giving ground grudgingly. BLOODY MARY MORNIN was unhurried through the turn while behind a wall of rivals, tipped into the four path
entering the lane and could not gain inside the eighth pole. BLUEGRASS JUSTICE bid three wide near the three-eighths pole, was near the lead into the
lane then could not keep up. FROSTED JUSTICE was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the six or seven path and was
never a serious threat. LADY SPIDUTES was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a menace. SPRING WAGER set the pace
into the turn then was engulfed by several before mid-turn and steadily lost ground.

MANNFORD pressed the pace while two wide then vied with the leader into the lane, inched up to the lead outside the eighth pole and cleared late. WILD
ABOUT YOU was along the inside to the three path through the turn, continued in the four or five path after entering the lane then gained momentum
approaching the sixteenth pole and finished with a rush. STATESBORO was in the two path through the turn when never far back and turned in an even
performance. BARRY LEE set the pace while under pressure into the lane, continued to stubbornly hold on then gave way in the last fifty yards.
PRESIDENT ELECT was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane widest and under a drive and lacked a response. DOX FOLLY was
always last while along the inside.

Footnotes
TIMELESS ROSE was unrushed while just off the inside, bid from the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path, split rivals
near the eighth pole then drove clear. TEENER chased the pace from the outset while in the three path, continued off the inside into the lane then slowly
made headway to get nearest the winner late and saved the place spot while not a threat to the top one. PEEKACHICA was in the four path into the far turn
when chasing the pacesetters, swung into the lane from the six path and was closing in on the place spot at the wire. HOT N SWEET was in the two path
through the turn when towards the back, swung into the lane from mid-pack and offered a mild gain. BREWSKY set the pace and dueled for the lead
through the far turn, continued to be a serious contender into the lane and weakened through the lane. MATILDAS MAGIC was near the rail through the
turns and turned in an even stretch run. QUEENOFMYDBLWIDE was unhurried through the turn, came into the lane from near the inside, ducked out when
struck left-handed, drifted in and ducked out again inside the sixteenth pole and still offered a mild gain. TO FAT TO FISH raced on the pace through the far
turn while near the inside then gave way. RACE DAY CALI was in the three path through the turns and tired. TOUCH OF BLESSING was in the three or
four path through the turns and was empty in the lane. SILENT DAY was done on the far turn while near the inside. RACE TIMES WERE OMITTED DUE
TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HOPPED UP vied two wide through the turn and into the lane, was in the three or four path into the lane, still on near even terms with an eighth to go then
drove clear. CONRAD IN CHARGE hopped at the start, steadied near the half-mile pole, bid through the turn from the three path, swept into the lane from
the four or five path, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then was no match for the winner when that one was asked. OUR BALDY B set the pace while
under pressure through the turn, dueled into the lane then yielded inside the eighth pole. CLEARING WAIVERS was along the inside through the turn and
into the lane and offered a mild gain. BENNETT chased the pace from the two path through the turn then lacked a response. MY NORTHERN STAR was
along the inside throughout and never was a factor. BOAT WAMPUM was off with a slight hop and was never in it. MARCHOS ran off about an eighth of a
mild before being loaded, raced well back while in the two path.
