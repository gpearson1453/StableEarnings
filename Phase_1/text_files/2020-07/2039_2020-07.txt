Footnotes
NEW ADVENTURE set the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn, edged clear in mid-stretch then held off a late challenger under steady handling.
HIT IT TWICE switched outside everyone in the early going, was forced out about the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide on the turn, gained steadily in
the stretch but needed more. CITYONTHENILE pressed the winner from inside on or just off the fence, yielded grudgingly late. PEACEOUTYOURHONOR
was outpaced early, raced on or just off the rail, gained mildly. WAGES switched outside the leading pair past the half-mile marker, went three to four wide
on the turn and had no extra. ATTILAS GAL broke awkwardly and steadied at the break as the inside rival came out, steadied again in the early going about
the four-and-one-half then yet again near the seven-sixteenths as a stricken rival was being pulled up and coming out a bit, tired. PRECIOUS LOOKER
chased briefly, appeared to go wrong past the seven-sixteenths, was pulled up and vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
VICTORY LANE lacked speed from the gate despite moderate urging, shifted in heading down the stretch the first turn racing in the two to three path
through the first turn, was guided out up the backstretch beginning to advance four wide into the far turn and shifting out gradually on that bend to be six
deep past the three-sixteenths, struck the lead a sixteenth out and edged clear despite drifting a bit. STORM ON raced mid-pack along the rail in behind
runners with a little bit of tightness up the backstretch, switched out past the three-eighths and went two wide on the far turn, advanced into upper- to
mid-stretch but was outkicked by the winner. GET A NOTION tracked in behind the leaders early then rapidly moved up inside those but off the fence one
path to take charge passing the seven-sixteenths, was clear turning for home, overtaken a sixteenth out and yielded. SCOTTY WHO raced outside rivals
four to five wide on the first turn, moved in a hair heading up the backstretch and advanced four wide between runners about three furlongs out, was within
striking distance three to four wide on the far turn but could not sustain the effort. SHIO was caught outside five to six wide in the early going, moved in four
deep heading into the far turn while nearly in striking distance but could only run on evenly. WRAPPED was forwardly positioned pressing the pace but kept
four deep through the first turn, forced the issue a bit putting a head in front about the nine-sixteenths till just outside the seven-sixteenths, gradually
weakened while going five wide on the far turn and in the lane. G M GAGE broke a step slowly, trailed well back early in the two to three path, continued in
the same part of the track on the far turn and passed tired rivals. HAPPY FORTY EIGHT broke a bit awkwardly, went three wide in pursuit through the first
turn, moved in a path by the half-mile marker then to the rail by the far turn, saved ground on that bend and was empty in the stretch. ICED was urged at the
break, set the early tempo racing off the rail in the two to three path on the first turn drifting out five wide leaving that bend before correcting course and
moving back in early up the backstretch, began to drop back two to three wide up the backstretch and continued to fade thereafter. FINAL THUNDER was
kept off the inside in the four to five path on both turns and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TIGHT FITTIN JEANS vied inside a rival but off the inside, moved in a bit to go in the two path into the turn, edged clear leaving that bend when set down
for the drive, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch under left-handed use of the whip then was strongly hand-ridden to hold sway. LAUGHAROO pressed outside
the aforementioned, went three to four wide on the turn, kept on in the lane to hold the place. TWO STEPPER stumbled at the start, raced inside rivals in
among those at the back, continued inside foes but in the two path on the turn, came out three wide into upper stretch and gained show honors. LAST TO
BLUSH broke a bit awkwardly, switched out well off the inside early up the backstretch then moved back in, went four wide and outside rivals on the turn,
came out six deep turning for home and ran on. RECEPTION tracked the leading pair inside, saved ground along the rail through the turn, came out just a
bit into upper stretch and was empty late. SHUGS CHARLIE raced between rivals early, dropped back three wide leaving the turn and failed to rally.
SELFISH WOMAN was outside rivals five wide on the turn, dropped back while moving out several paths turning for home and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SILENT ZENON broke outwardly, moved up inside rivals but off the fence to take the lead after the opening quarter, dictated terms thereafter racing a path
removed from the rail into the turn, began to edge clear on the turn, widened through the stretch and was taken in hand late once safely in front. DRIVE
THRU GARY was bumped and pinched back at the break, thereupon allowed to settle, advanced steadily in the two to three path, moved between rivals a
sixteenth out to capture the place. HUNTER ROCKS broke inwardly bumping a rival, was mid-pack in the early going in the three path, moved in a bit
entering the turn and edging forward but offered no extra in the lane. DIABOLICAL KING vied between runners for a bit up the backstretch then continued to
chase the winner from outside four then three wide on the turn, offered no late bid. SOUTHERN FIRE broke outwardly, was in pursuit outside, went six then
five wide on the turn and ran on evenly. REINING PESOS was well outside mid-pack, encouraged along past the three-eighths, went seven then six wide on
the turn and did not threaten. DAJUDGE showed brief speed, vied briefly outside rivals, dropped back five then four wide on the turn and continued to
weaken. JEDI FEVER came in after the break nearly to the inner rail, saved ground on the turn and passed tired ones. DISCLOSED was in tight at the
break, caught six to seven wide on the turn and needed more. DAPIRATE dropped back heading up the backstretch, entered the turn five wide then moved
in three deep by the quarter pole, failed to menace. HIT A LICK was mid-pack up the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. BILLY
JOE WHO chased briefly, dropped back five wide on the turn, tired.
