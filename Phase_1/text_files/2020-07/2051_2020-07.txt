HELENA BEAT tracked close up inside, then pressed the pace while two wide on the backside, bid on the far turn, dueled with RAZOR GIRL through the
stretch and drew clear late. RAZOR GIRL set the pace on the inside racing with a clear early lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, battled inside of
that rival into the lane, dug in gamely and came up second best. BIG LIZ raced close up on the inside, made a rail bid nearing the far turn, lacked room, was
steadied and shuffled back, then rallied on the rail in the stretch and got third. TONED UP pulled in the early stages, raced four wide on the first turn,
continued four wide on the backside, moved up two wide on the far turn and was outkicked. KAZ'S KITTEN stalked outside early, then between rivals and
faded. WANNA BE REGAL was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. BANQUE DE MARGAUX raced three wide on the first
turn, stalked three wide and gave way.

second. BANGLE GAL chased three wide, raced three wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch drive and was gaining slowly late on the runner up.

Footnotes
CABINET PIK raced close up on the inside, split foes at the half mile marker to contest the pace, took over, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely and
held well late, driving. SADLER BAY raced off the pace inside, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied outside and dug in gamely to the finish. JUAN
PABLO was outrun early, advanced inside, came four wide into the lane, came in bumping NO REGRETS at furlong marker, then rallied mildly outside.
ORBERT raced off the pace, between rivals on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail. NICKI DE NEPHEW vied outside for the lead, chased on the far turn
and steadied slightly at the eighth pole while tiring. NO REGRETS stalked the leaders, raced between horses on the far turn, was bumped hard and
steadied at the eighth pole, then weakened. SYNERGIZED raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. NEXT COWBOY UP was outrun. NOONSIGHT
vied inside for command, dueled briefly with the winner, chased and gave way. After a Jockey's Objection, JUAN PABLO was disqualified and placed sixth
for interference at the furlong marker.
