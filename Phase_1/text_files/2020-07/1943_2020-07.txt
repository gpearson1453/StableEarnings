Footnotes
REA MEA away alertly and chased the leader into the turn while racing two out from the rail, assumed command entering the lane and drew clear late while
finishing one out from the rail. ATLIN BAY chased the pace while saving ground along the rail entering the turn, steadied midway through the turn, shifted
three wide entering the lane, and closed determinedly to get up for the place. REFORMED broke sharply and chased the leader three wide into the turn
before steadied when put into tight quarters, and finished with late interest three out from the rail in the drive. GUNSIGHT away well, and raced to a narrow
advantage into the turn while racing one out from the rail, battled for the lead into the stretch, but was outfinished late from along the rail. DEBATABLE
chased the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the turn, and finished three wide in the drive. PRETTY ARIA lacked the early speed to
contend in the run to the turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to make an impact. COOL CITY was devoid of early pace while saving ground
at the rail entering the turn, and failed to make a late impact while continuing to save ground throughout. Following the running of this race there was a
jockey's claim of foul. The rider of REFORMED lodged a claim of foul against the rider of REA MEA for alleged interference entering the turn. After review
the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish

IRISH LUNA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained her
advantage into the final turn, and drew clear in the lane while being ridden out late. KICK UP THE DUST broke sharply and tracked the leader through the
first turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and while no match for the winner late, finished one out from the rail in the
drive to prove second best. HEART OF TEXAS away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to grab the show position. FIRST AND TEN stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. THE KAT'S
BACK ducked in sharply soon after the start, and trailed the field into the first turn, advanced from along the inside midway down the backstretch to gain a
striking position entering the final turn. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into the actions of THE KAT'S BACK in the run
away from the gate. After review the stewards deemed that the horse ducked in soon after the start, and no change was made to the original order of finish

SYNERGY tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn while continuing to press the
pacesetter, took the narrowest of leads into the lane, but was all out to hold off a determined YO ZACKLY in the final strides. YO ZACKLY broke sharply and
raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and battled gamely from
along the rail in the drive to just miss. CAPILANO CANYON away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. SLEW'S
BAK stalked the early pace into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, advanced four wide midway down the backside, rallied three out from
the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. BAKTURA away alertly and tracked the leader two out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on the top pair through the turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive.
TORINO GRAND was off a step slow, but gained a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive. ABOVE THE MOON stalked the leader into the first turn while under snug restraint, raced two wide into the final turn, and
had nothing to offer late.

STAY FANTASTIC away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to prove best. THE CHANCES R broke sharply and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the
drive, but was second best. EL NOBLE away alertly and tracked the leaders from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along
the rail through the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. SHRUGGY BEAR tracked the leaders two wide from between rivals in
the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. GOTTCHA COWBOY pressed the
pace three wide entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two out from the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, and battled
on four wide in the drive in a solid effort. VOLO VELOCE settled off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
from along the rail entering the final turn, and improved his position late while unable to threaten. DAT DAY stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
being carried five wide, continued with a wide trip throughout, and had little to offer late. SPECULATOR stalked the early pace while being hung six wide
entering the backstretch, continued with a wide trip while racing five wide entering the final turn, and finished four out from the rail in the stretch drive.
REPRIMAND tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong. HARRY'S HAMMER stumbled badly in the opening strides, causing the rider to lose his irons, trailed well behind the field in the run to the first turn,
and was pulled up by the outrider entering the final turn, and walked off under his own power.

SHRUGS LOVE away well and raced to an uncontested lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, fended off a challenge by HONKY TONK WOMAN leaving the turn, and inched clear late. HONKY TONK WOMAN stalked the leader
in the run down the backstretch while racing two wide from between rivals, took up the chase one out from the rail entering the final turn, collared the
pacesetter entering the lane, but was unable to sustain her bid late while proving clearly second best. RUGGED BEAUTY broke sharply and stalked the
leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive.
PEPPERMINT was bumped in the opening strides and carried wide through the first turn, before settling off the early pace three wide entering the
backstretch, rallied one out from the rail through the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the stretch drive. I GOT VISION settled off the early
pacesetter while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the
drive. OMBRE' ROSE stalked the leader into the first turn while drifting three wide, and carrying rivals out with her, held a striking trip in the run to the final
turn, but was outfinished over the final furlong. STAY COOL away alertly, but was allowed to settle off the early leaders while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, struggled to keep up midway to the final turn, and had nothing to offer late. OUR ANJA was low into stride, and ducked in while
leaving the chute to trail well behind the field entering the first turn, and was never persevered with while being eased throughout.
