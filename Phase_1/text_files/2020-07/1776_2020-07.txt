Footnotes
OCTOPUS bumped at the start, squeezed between runners early, steered to the inside, saved ground around the turn and into the lane, rallied from the
inside and got up late. NEXT FLIGHT sped to the front and cleared early, led from the two path around the turn, showed the way through the drive but could
not hold off the winner. HYDROGEN stalked outside the lead, went three wide around the turn and held the show. FOREIGN PROTOCOL settled off the
inside, raced five wide into the lane and finished willingly from the outside. MISTER MCLEAN broke out and bumped OCTOPUS at the start, chased off the
rail, steadied into the turn, traveled outside a rival and two wide into the stretch and never produced a bid. MALAKAI MOXIE stalked outside a rival, four
wide to the stretch and weakened late.

Footnotes
COMMANDER (FR) settled, inside, saved ground around the turn, asked in upper stretch, closed fast and gained command approaching the sixteenth pole,
then edged clear from the runner-up. RESTORING DREAMS prompted the pace outside into and around the turn, headed the leader into the lane then took
control in upper stretch, overtaken by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and held the place. GO TIME stalked inside, came out a bit leaving the turn,
angled out mid-stretch, finished well but missed the place. SHARP WARNING chased near the inside, two wide exiting the bend, angled out in the stretch
and flattened. FINAL FINAL lacked early speed, traveled a bit off the rail, came out into the stretch and finished with a mild late bid. SHOOTIN MONEY
chased between then two wide on the turn and never produced a bid. CARPE VICTORIAM tracked three to four wide around the turn, then weakened in the
drive. HANDSOME CAT raced off the rail, three wide into the lane, angled out upper stretch and lacked a rally. D K'S CROWN set the pace under pressure
to the outside, kept along the rail through the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SAPORI GIRL stalked inside, saved ground into the lane, came out a bit and split foes and surged clear. VIAZAR off a bit slow to begin, went four wide into
the first turn, three deep into the far turn, bid three wide and edged rival for the place. CONSTANTIA chased outside a rival, stalked outside a leader on the
backstretch, bid into the lane and lost the place. LEMON DROP TINI tracked a bit off the rail, swung out into the drive, showed a mild bid but went evenly in
the late stages. STAR OF AFRICA raced off the rail, three wide then angled out four wide into the stretch, came out a bit under left-handed urging and
showed some late effort. ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD broke well then crossed over to the inside, set the pace inside, fought back from the inside in the
lane but weakened late. SURFACE raced two wide then angled in, pulled early on the backstretch, traveled along the inside and steadied briefly near the
five-sixteenths pole, angled out and kept on to the wire. OLIVE YOU MORE three wide into the first turn, two path into the stretch and never responded
when asked. M FAST pulled early, raced along the rail to the stretch and had little left in the drive. MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE pulled early, three wide into the
first turn, continued three wide to the lane and weakened.

GIRTHER off alertly and went to the front, dueled for command outside, shifted in and bumped rival just past the three-sixteenths pole, led through the drive,
bumped by the runner-up near the wire and held on. CROSS INDIAN broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, dueled from the inside, bumped by
GIRTHER near the three-sixteenths, drifted out in the lane and bumped the winner nearing the wire and just missed. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP angled in
and saved ground, showed a mild rally and got up for third. HOT ROD CHARLIE bumped leaving the gate, chased a bit off the rail, came out and entered
the stretch four wide and was nailed for the show. TRIPPLE SHAKE chased off the rail, exited the bend five wide and weakened. MANDREW stumbled
leaving the gate, settled off the rail and had nothing left for the drive. THE STEWARDS REVIEW THE INCIDENTS BETWEEN GIRTHER AND CROSS
INDIAN AND RULED THAT BOTH HORSES CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR PROBLEMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

SPEEDY JUSTICE attended the pace three deep, headed the leader in upper stretch, gained the lead nearing the eighth pole, kicked clear and drew away
under left-handed urging. CAPTURE THE SEA set a pressured pace from the inside, led into the lane, could not match the winner late but bested the rest.
TOROSAY chased off the rail, went three deep into the stretch, finished evenly and held the show. PSYCHO DAR settled off the the rail then angled in,
raced two wide, lacked room and steadied into the stretch, angled out and went willingly to the wire. REEDLEY off a bit slow to begin, raced between rivals
early, angled in on the turn, saved ground into the stretch, shifted in then back out at the gap and summoned a mild rally. SCARTO saved ground, steadied
briefly in upper stretch, angled out and also found a mild rally. SILENT MOVIES raced outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally.
MYSTIC FLIGHT (IRE) stalked from the inside, a bit off the rail in the lane and weakened. K P INDY raced two wide, angled out in the lane and never made
an impact. DUPLICITY pressed the pace outside the leader, chased between rivals into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
LIL SYDNEY stumbled leaving, stalked off the rail, asked around the turn, bid four wide into the lane, cleared with a furlong to go and drew away under a
drive. ALL I CAN SAY raced outside a rival, advanced four to five wide around the turn, loomed into the stretch but could not match the winner in the late
stages. TACO WACO chased off the rail, moved up to press the pace from the outside, gained the lead at the quarter pole, lost command in upper stretch
and weakened. ROGALLO chased from the inside, came out into the stretch, moved out further in upper stretch and kept on. SUANCES SECRET traveled
off the rail, angled in on the turn, kept on along the inside in the stretch and improved position. LUCKY PATRICK stalked outside a rival, drifted out into the
stretch and had little left in the drive. MANTARAY ISLAND off a bit slow, sent for the lead, set the pace up the backstretch, pressured around the turn and
gave way in the drive.

BOB AND JACKIE stalked off the rail, outside a rival on the far turn, chased the leader two wide into the lane, dug in late and got up in time. KIWI'S DREAM
(AUS) set the pace inside, led clear into the stretch, urged right-handed then switched to the left, held command to deep stretch but was nailed by the
winner near the wire. MURAD KHAN (FR) three wide on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch, steered back to the three path around the far turn and
into the drive, finished gamely and held the show. BIG SCORE angled in soon after the start, raced two wide, off the rail on the backstretch, angled four
wide into the lane, closed well and missed the show honors. VOODOO SONG raced a bit off the rail, along the inside into the stretch, finished willingly but
lacked the needed late punch. SOUTER (GB) between foes early then two wide on the first turn, between rivals into and around the far turn and finished
willingly. JASIKAN (IRE) lagged behind early, traveled near the inside, angled around a rival, bumped by inside rival near the three-sixteenths, then came
with a mild bid late. NEW YEAR tracked from the inside, lacked room into the second turn, angled out and bumped rival near the three-sixteenths and could
not rally in the drive. BOLO stalked inside, lost ground around the far turn and faded.

went gamely to the wire. THIS TEA up close, bid outside on the far turn, challenged through the lane and was outfinished by the top pair. SWEET DEVIL
stalked outside a rival, four wide into the stretch and finished willingly four deep late. RED DIAMOND settled off the rail, went three wide into the lane,
angled out and went willingly to the wire. BRISTOL BAYOU settled outside a rival, lacked room and bumped rival into the far turn, moved to the inside
around the bend, angled out and also finished willingly the drive. SURROUND (IRE) chased off the rail, angled in upper stretch and lacked a bid. INTO
VICTORY crowded and checked early, raced two wide then a bit off the rail, rank and altered out into the far turn, two wide into the lane and had little left.
