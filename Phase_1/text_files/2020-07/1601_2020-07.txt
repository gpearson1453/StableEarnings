SHAWNEE KID was allowed to settle well off the leader came through in the three path on the second turn and drew clear in the final sixteenth for the win.
FOREVER THE CHIEF came through along the inside and was up for second in the final jumps. MAXIMUS THE GREAT sprinted to a long lead and opened
up at least 10 lengths on the field in the second turn still held a sizable lead at the eighth pole but stopped in the final yards. BRETT'S BOY came through
along the inside in the stretch and just missed for third. SUPERSTYLE was mid pack for much of the race but could not make up ground when the
frontrunner tired. VANQUISH was well back throughout and never mounted a rally. PRINCE OF PARIS chased the lone frontrunner for the first half and then
dropped back quickly on the second turn.

stretch. JOHN ARNOLD showed the best early speed and was able to get over to the rail was headed at the top of the stretch but hung tough through the
lane in a game effort. CHUCKMATE made his bid three wide on the turn and then was fanned five wide entering the stretch but could never get to the top
pair. JIMBO'S BIZ raced three wide on the turn but was outfinished in the stretch. BEIRUT raced in the two path and could not make up ground in the
stretch. DORCHEAT ZARB came four wide entering the stretch but could not make up the needed ground. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN raced three wide on
the turn and could not make up ground. BOURBON PRIDE was well back and passed a tired foe in the stretch. MR. MATLOCK raced mid pack but faded in
