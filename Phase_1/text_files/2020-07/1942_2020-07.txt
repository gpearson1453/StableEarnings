NOT A HOUSE FRAU set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch proved best. LENCHES GIMME forced the pace, was a
factor on the turn and from the three path through the stretch held place. LIGHT OF CONGRATS had no speed, trailed the field on the turn and from the five
path at the top of the stretch finished well. ROCHE'S POINT was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
needed more. SAVOIA was up close early and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. MOLLYTARA was in
range but chased on the turn and came up empty.

FASHION FLIRT set a pressured pace, had a clear lead on the turn and prevailed. FLAT OUT FABULOUS forced the early pace, was a factor on the turn
and was clearly second best. D'S MULLIGAN was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off.
TARAVILA was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but had no impact. WICKED ACT was off slow and raced evenly on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. CALM IT had no speed, showed little and from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

ROSIEJEWEL DANCER was away alertly, had a good position on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. BABY LUNA was
hustled early and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SEA LILY stalked the leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. WEDDING RING was in touch and roused on the turn but had no
response. CHAIRMAN'S VENOM broke poorly and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
AUNTIE KATHERINE set the pace, had lead on the far turn and with mild pressure in mid stretch proved best. EVIL WOMAN was unhurried early, moved
up on the far turn and had a bid from the four path in mid stretch but was second best. GLIB MARYLIN was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. SNELL FLICKA stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but flattened out
through the stretch. ROMANTIC BLISS had no speed and saved ground on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outrun.
