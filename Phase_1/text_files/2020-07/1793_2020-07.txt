pressured pace, shook clear on the far turn, was engaged approaching the stretch and tired. DANCE ALONG DEDE broke outward and settled off the pace,

backstretch, chased hard on the ,turn, bid at the top of the stretch but could not match strides and flattened out. KATLA'S FURY got away slowly, raced in

MIGHTY HEART broke outward, stalked the pace, came three and four-wide through the far turn, had the lead a furlong out and widened under light
handling. OLLIEMYBOY, left slowly and settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, tipped out six-wide at the top of the stretch and rallied
gamely. HOLYFIELD raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from two to five-wide through the far turn then finished under a determined drive. FORT HOPE
raced forwardly, dueled on the backstretch and the far turn, led at the top of the stretch but was quickly passed and chased to the end. BOLD VICTORY
raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely. FIFTH SEASON was four and five-wide on the first turn then settled in mid
pack, was hustled four to six-wide on the far turn then rallied in vain. DANCERS GHOST, herded outward at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled along
the rail on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. ARTIE MY BOY was prominent early, dueled, yielded upper stretch and chased to the end. KING OF
THE RING stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but lacked a rally. CURLIN'S THRILL raced in mid pack, was hustled two and
three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. FAST THINKING, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the far turn then
flattened out in the stretch.

DESIGNED BY KITTEN led quickly, set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under a hand ride. WAR EMPRESS was hustled from
mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn and was all out in the stretch. MITZI stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn, veered in
upper stretch and finished gamely along the rail. ROTARY broke slowly and settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn, appeared green but
closed with serious interest. PURRSUADE ME forced the pace, chased three-wide into stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. EL VALOR broke slowly,
raced off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but never reached contention. KEYED UP broke outward, was hustled from mid pack, was
roused three-wide late turn but had no response.

settled in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the far turn, angled out approaching the top of the stretch, chased, but lost the place position in the late
stages. MIND THE GAP dueled early, forced the pace on the backstretch, dropped back a bit at the far turn then chased into the stretch and was game to
the end. TIMESKIP raced in mid pack and was three-wide throughout, was steadied late turn and right after that was pinched back at the top of the stretch
but rallied determinedly once clear. PEACE OF EKATI was taken back after the start and moved over to the rail, settled off the pace, encountered traffic late
turn then rallied along the fence. LION'S GOLDENHEART raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response. ALL

finished under a hand ride. RIDE THE WIND stalked the pace, closed and lodged her bid four-wide late turn, had command a furlong out but was passed in
the last 16th. SHANGHAI KIMMY forced the pace from the rail, held a short lead on the turn, dueled into the stretch but gave way a 16th out. MARIPOSA

the pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn then closed through the stretch. NAITAKA showed speed then forced the pace three-wide on the turn,
dropped back at the top of the stretch then finished evenly. ALTERNATIVE VIEW raced in mid pack, came three to five-wide through the turn but lacked a
closing response. FROST DANCE settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. GIANT SONET, in mid pack
early, closed four to six-wide on the turn, tipped out eight-wide at the top of the stretch but lacked a rally. SAN NICOLA STAR broke in the air and angled
outwards, raced from off the pace, chased two to four-wide on the turn and angled out again approaching the stretch but had little left and flattened out. ALL
