Footnotes
ZANDREA'S went up to vie for command briefly up the backstretch, backed off after a half-mile, rebid three wide a quarter-mile out, and wore down
COUPLE OF NIKKIS from outside in deep stretch. COUPLE OF NIKKIS went up to contest the pace between horses early on the backstretch, let EMILIA
STRONG go on with it after a half, rebid outside the latter after six furlongs, edged clear turning for home, stayed on well but yielded to the winner late.
WONDER BLONDY was in tight between horses out of the gate, clipped heels and stumbled behind PASATIME, took closer order approaching the far turn,
swung five wide into the lane, and rallied mildly. HERCULINA was outrun for six furlongs, angled wide off the far turn and improved past tired horses.
PASATIME got clipped behind by WONDER BLONDY at the start, settled in the middle of the field, and failed to factor. LOOKN FINE AS WINE saved
ground to the far turn, and dropped back in the two-path after six furlongs. DAKOTA BEACH sprinted clear early inside, faced a trio of challengers soon after
entering the backstretch, and gave way into the far turn. EMILIA STRONG was four wide around the first turn, went up to contest the pace outside rivals
soon after, cleared off and moved inside to the far turn, and had nothing left after six furlongs. MS. OUTRAJES was squeezed in tight quarters between
horses and took up sharply after the start, and trailed throughout. This race was hand timed, fractional times unavailable.

Footnotes
STAR JUANCHO moved up rapidly outside the leaders approaching the quarter-pole, took over through upper stretch and drew off on his left lead. E J'S
REVENGE dueled for command inside SWAGGER, got the best of that dispute after a half-mile, was no match for the winner through upper stretch, and
held to be much best of the others. TOWN POLICY eyed the battling leaders in the three-path early, got out-moved by the winner late on the turn, shifted
out widest and was up for the show on his left lead. SWAGGER went head and head for the lead outside E J'S REVENGE for a half, and gave way at the
top of the lane. CHARGE CARD brushed the right side of the gate and was slowest away, and never reached contention. GAME DAY DRAMA was no
factor. JAIDEN'S BEST lost his footing briefly at the start, and trailed.

Footnotes
GIVEMETWENTY got bumped by JUSTINTHENICKOTIME at the start and was slowest to begin, went four wide into the first turn, moved up under his own
power after a half-mile, wrested command outside DIAMONDS ENJOY nearing the quarter-pole, moved inside kicking clear, and was driving to the finish.
MONTANA MAN was under a firm hold early, moved up three wide to loom a threat after six furlongs, and finished willingly outside JUSTINTHENICKOTIME
to share second. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME broke out bumping GIVEMETWENTY at the start, went along between horses in range and unhurried for six
furlongs, got set down turning for home and finished with good courage between horses. DOMINATE THEMOMENT saved ground early, remained in the
second flight two then three wide on the far turn, advanced mildly into upper stretch and finished one-paced. CAPTAIN D was forwardly placed early, and
lacked the needed late response. UNCORK THE BOTTLE was outrun early inside, swung four wide approaching the stretch, and could not gain
appreciably. DIAMONDS ENJOY cleared to the early lead inside, got collared after six furlongs and tired.

Footnotes
AMBER PRINCESS grabbed the early lead, rated along inside to the stretch, and dug in late to preserve the decision. NATURELL (ECU) bumped with
BUST OUT LADY at the break, then was bumped a stride later by SUPER HERO WANDA, advanced three wide approaching the stretch, and finished
gamely outside the winner. SURPRISE ARRIVAL stayed in range three then four wide around the turn, and ran on willingly outside the top two finishers.
SIGNING BONUS raced close up inside for six furlongs, and weakened. CRYSTALINA broke out bumping SUPER HERO WANDA into NATURELL, lagged
well back to the stretch, and passed only tired horses. MALAGA was outrun two wide. LET'S GO LUNA was finished early inside. BUST OUT LADY
bumped with NATURELL at the start, prompted the pace to the turn before giving way, and was eased up in the lane. SUPER HERO WANDA got bumped
into NATURELL by CRYSTALINA at the start, dropped back into the turn getting pulled up, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CAPELINE broke out, then continued out several paths from the rail early, moved inside on the first turn, showed the way through an easy half-mile,
maintained the advantage as the cadence quickened on the far turn, and was driving to stay clear. CACTUS KITTEN broke slowly, moved up to prompt the
pace outside, was under a drive by midway on the far turn, could not reach the leader and saved the place despite drifting out in deep stretch. ALL
AMERICAN JEWEL advanced in the two-path coming off the far turn, altered course inside CACTUS KITTEN past the furlong marker and did not have
enough. MARIANNA QUEEN saved ground outrun early, improved position after six furlongs, and gained belatedly through the lane on the far outside.
PADDY KAYE'S WILD entered the backstretch four wide, and could not threaten through an even effort. KREATIVE KISSER was outrun two wide. REINA
CARIBE steadied between CAPELINE and SWANEE BEACH heading to the first turn, and was finished after a half. SWANEE BEACH chased the winner
early, was put to a drive into the far turn, and was empty.

DYNATOWN was unhurried early inside, swung out four wide rallying after six furlongs, swept past the leaders from outside past the eighth-pole and drew
off. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN settled within range two wide, cut the corner into the stretch, came back out with a bid between horses through the furlong
grounds, and came up second best. AMADORA took over outside BAHAMIAN GIRL after a sharp half-mile, moved inside clear around the far turn, and
gave way in upper stretch. YOLANDA'S PRIDE advanced three wide into the backstretch, moved in slightly chasing after AMADORA midway on the far
turn, was under a drive before reaching the stretch, and faded. NIGHT WATCH broke slowly and lagged far back early inside, moved out on the far turn
beginning to find stride, and passed tired horses on the far outside. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE was finished early inside. GHOSTLY BEAUTY moved up
outside early, was under a drive by midway on the far turn, and faded through the lane. BAHAMIAN GIRL sped off early inside, yielded to AMADORA up the
backstretch, and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
BREWMEISTER was allowed to settle off a fast pace four wide, rallied past FENESTRA and PLUM FUNNY from outside entering the final furlong and drew
off. PLUM FUNNY chased outside FENESTRA early, whittled away the lead around the far turn, finally got past that foe approaching the sixteenth-pole, was
no match for the winner and saved the place. SIR KAHN hit the left side of the gate at the start, advanced in the two-path after a half-mile, and finished
evenly while drifting out under left-hand pressure. PAYNTED was outsprinted three wide for a half, and gained mildly without threatening. FENESTRA sped
clear after the start, moved inside setting a quick pace, and weakened on his left lead through the last eighth of a mile. PERLMAN was outrun throughout.
ELUSIVE EDGE was finished early inside.

DANCE TILL DAWN prompted the pace outside DIXIE PRINCESS, turned up the pressure past the half-mile pole and vied around the far turn, took over in
upper stretch and drew away on her left lead. PICASSO MOON saved ground in range to the far turn, waited behind the leaders a quarter-mile out, found a
seam shifting out in upper stretch, and was up for the place outside rivals. LEDECKY trailed inside while not far back for a half, and offered a mild late
response between horses in the two-path. DIXIE PRINCESS set the pace inside, vied with DANCE TILL DAWN through the far turn, and gave way in upper
stretch. POCKET OF CANDY was mostly two wide on the turns, and lacked a rally. LA INCONDICIONAL moved up three wide approaching the far turn,
was asked in earnest approaching the top of the stretch, and came up empty.

BOERNE sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along through a moderate early pace slightly off the rail, came four or five wide off the turn shaking off
COMPENSATE, drifted out steadily through the last furlong despite right-hand pressure, and held on. ESTILO TALENTOSO broke out, stayed in range
early three wide, had aim outside BOERNE turning for home, inched closer past the sixteenth-pole while getting floated further out, and took up behind the
leader nearing the finish. BANKRUPTONTHEBEACH broke a step slowly, was outsprinted to the stretch, and lacked a solid bid in the two-path on her left
lead. DON'T GET KHOZY was outsprinted to the turn three wide, moved inside past the three-eighths, and made no late headway on the rail.
COMPENSATE chased outside BOERNE for a half-mile, and drifted wide faltering off the turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT IN DEEP STRETCH, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ESTILO TALENTOSO AGAINST BOERNE, THERE WAS NO
CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SIR SEAMUS took control after the start, rated along on a clear lead inside for six furlongs, got set down mildly through upper stretch with no challengers in
the vicinity, and was wrapped up late. AMERICAN NINJA broke slowly, raced well back for six furlongs three wide, and rallied mildly outside TWENTY
FOUR SEVEN to get the place. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN broke slowly and was outrun early inside, went four wide around the far turn, rallied into second
leaving the sixteenth-pole, then was outkicked for that spot. RODDICK chased outside SIR SEAMUS from the start to upper stretch, and weakened.
HONEST TO GOODNESS entered the backstretch in the four-path, moved up outside rivals after a half-mile, and went evenly thereafter. PHILO was in tight
and keyed up between FARLEY and PEPPI THE HUNTER first time through the stretch, moved inside and stayed in range to the far turn, and could not
gain late under pressure. HOT AND HEAVY was four wide into the first turn, moved in a bit and faded after six furlongs. PEPPI THE HUNTER was taken
hold of outside a troubled PHILO going to the first turn, stayed out near the three-path and made no impact. FARLEY jostled with PHILO early, chased three
wide for six furlongs and tired. MR. PINOCCHIO saved ground and tired before reaching the stretch.

DOUBLE CROWN tracked outside the dueling leaders for a half-mile, took over near the five-sixteenths, drew clear into the stretch, and held off WITH
VERVE while drifting out. WITH VERVE moved menacingly four wide after a half-mile, had aim outside DOUBLE CROWN through the lane, and edged
closer late while drifting out. OURNATIONONPARADE bumped with POE at the start, stayed close near the three-path to the top of the stretch, moved
outside the leaders and could not get to them with an even finish. CAJUN BROTHER dueled inside POE for a half-mile, and faded steadily through the
stretch. POE bumped with OURNATIONONPARADE at the start, dueled for command outside CAJUN BROTHER for a half, retreated nearing the
quarter-pole, and was eased up through the lane.

AVANT GARDE was bumped by PACHANGA PATROL at the start, advanced four then three wide around the turn, caught CHILL HAZE from outside near
the eighth-pole and drew off on his left lead. CHILL HAZE set the pace off the rail, yielded to the winner entering the final furlong and stayed clear of the
rest. LIGHT FURY saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid closing bid. WINTER AT BASTOGNE broke out bumping PACHANGA PATROL into
AVANT GARDE, chased outside the pacesetter for six furlongs, and tired without a lead change. CURLINGO raced three to four wide around the turn, and
could not gain in the stretch. DR. SAMADI lagged far back early despite urging, moved out widest in the stretch and passed only tired horses. SULTANNES
CROWN was finished after a half-mile inside. PACHANGA PATROL broke open the gate prior to the start, got bumped by WINTER AT BASTOGNE into
AVANT GARDE at the break, and was finished early. ULTRACONFIDENT was shut off at the start behind WINTER AT BASTOGNE and PACHANGA
PATROL, and dropped far back after six furlongs.
