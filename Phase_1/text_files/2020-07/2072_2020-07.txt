Footnotes
JEWEL STREET pressed the pace, gained command into the lane, raced in the three path through the stretch and finished well to be clear late under strong
handling. CATCH THE DEVIL was off slowly, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and finished well late. AIRLINE DRIVE stalked the early pace while
saving ground down the backstretch, moved up to two wide while splitting rivals at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire. R C KISS was allowed to
settle early, raced along the inside nearing the quarter pole into the stretch and had not enough late. FANCY ALL THE TIME was allowed to settle early,
raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. NIGHT N RED SATIN took up sharply nearing the five eighths pole, raced three wide in the lane
and never was a serious threat. TOO MUCH SUN set all the pace and gave way while racing along the inside. CLASSY BLING was unhurried early and
failed to respond. BLUEGRASS DIXIE raced three deep in the stretch and never was a factor. CASH ON FIRE saved ground around the far turn through the
stretch and never threatened. HUNKETTE stalked the early pace from the outside, pulled up and walked off under his own power.

out pressure. CHACHING BLING pressed the leader while racing two deep, dug in gamely through the stretch but couldn't match strides with the winner
near the wire to finish second best. RUNNIN THE RED was off a step slow, saved ground and kept on to the wire. UNBRIDLED POSSE showed good early
speed while racing just off the inside and gave way. PROUD TO SERVE was allowed to settle early and failed to respond.

PURE SPECULATION was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced three deep through the stretch and held gamely to be clear under strong
encouragement. MINE INSPECTOR was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide through the stretch to get up for the place position late. TICK TACK MO
stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide past the eighth pole and had not enough late. THREE TIME CHARMER stalked the leader along the
inside down the backstretch, continued to race towards the inside through the drive and had no final winning bid. ARCHARCH TALE was unhurried early,
moved up seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough. ON TILT stalked the pace while saving ground and had no response. ISTAN WARRIOR
settled towards the rear early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. LILJOE was slow early, saved ground and never threatened.
BRAVURA CREEK raced four deep in the lane and never was a factor. RASSLIN failed to sustain a bid. PER RULING 31838 FROM THE TEXAS RACING
COMMISSION MINE INSPECTOR WAS DQD DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

CYPRESS POINT stalked the early pace, moved up four wide into the land finished well to get up under strong handling. EMMPORT stalked the pace from
the outside, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. BRENDA'S AN I FULL was hustled early, raced three wide in the lane and finished
willingly to the wire. IMAGINARY MUSIC was hustled from the inside to press the leader and weakened through the drive. KONA KATIE dropped back
early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. SWANKY showed good early speed and gave way while racing two deep. BLINGIN'
ROSE saved ground and never threatened.

BOLD LEGEND set all the pace along the inside and held gamely to be clear under urging. TAKE CHARGE GAL stalked the pace from the outside, raced
three deep through the lane and finished second best. GOODNIGHTLOVING was off very slow losing a considerable amount of ground at the break, raced
towards the back of the pack early, moved up five wide through the lane and showed good late interest. WENEEDTOTALK was off slowly, stalked the pace
while saving ground and weakened a bit through the drive. SEVEN VIOLETS stalked the leader along the inside down the backstretch and weakened in the
final stages. EYE ON HARPER was allowed to settle early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. TENTHOUSANDREASONS
stalked the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and weakened late. MELODY ROSE failed to respond. SUNDANCE SEVEN dropped back early
and showed little. BALADERA was pulled up at the half mile pole and had to be vanned off.
