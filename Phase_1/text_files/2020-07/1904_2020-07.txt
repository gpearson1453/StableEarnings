Footnotes
ANI WINEHOUSE engaged in close chase three wide and took the lead leaving the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on under steady
encouragement. WILD CORK gave chase toward the inside then eased outward through the turn and entered the stretch about the seven path, dug in to
finish well and was gaining on the winner. HAPPY FREEDOM pressured the pace toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased outward entering
the stretch and held on for third. THUNDER PUNCH became unruly and unseated her rider leaving the paddock then came away awkwardly, picked up the
chase about the four path and raced evenly the final sixteenth. CEDAR RUN'S FIRE angled in to set a pressured early pace off the rail, was caught leaving
the five sixteenths pole, though, remained close to mid-stretch before beginning to weaken. BASKET GIRL gave chase inside then lost ground on the turn
and entered the stretch in the eight path. CHARITABLE SHOW angled to the outside and never engaged competition. The start of this race was delayed
due to a late change of rider on Charitable Show.

Footnotes
ALLEGHENY DBL LIME settled off the early pace inside then moved to the three path to make a move into the backstretch, took the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, drew clear mid turn and dug in under steady encouragement to draw away. QUICK ENERGY angled in to stalk LIzzie's Last two deep and
challenged that one nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that point but dropped back midway on the far turn then dug in to retain second.
LIZZIE'S LAST angled to the inside to rate a slim lead but was met at even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled from that point while giving up
the lead in the vicinity of the five sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and was outfinished for second. RUNNING PRAYERS saved
ground off the pace then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little more down the lane. HATTA DOUBLE saved ground. GOIN
GANGSTA was never a factor. LADY'S LADY was taken in hand early on and dropped well back.

Footnotes
STERLING FURIOSA rated off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and came through the far turn about
the three path, dug in for the lead later yards and was clear under the wire. CITY PRINCESS tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
nearing the five sixteenths pole, dug in leaving the far turn but was caught in later yards. WORKPANSOMETHINGS settled back off the rail the opening turn
then eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide but dug in to take third inside the sixteenth pole
and was gaining on the top two. THUNDEROUS saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn but
showed little further. BREAK DANCIN stalked the earlier pace three wide then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, but, flattened stride about
the three path of the far turn. CHARITABLE MISS raced well off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn then eased out into the backstretch and
was not a factor. CORKY COWGIRL raced well back early. SHARP'S MISSION steadied at the rail early on then settled off the pace leaving the first turn,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn.

BEST SHOT pressured the pace and took the lead midway on the turn, raced clear toward the head of the lane and just lasted under all out encouragement.
HYPOTHESIS gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path then dug in through the lane and just missed. BENNY CHANG chased the early pace
off the rail then angled five wide nearing the head of the lane and dueled for third later yards. MAJESTIC SEAS steadied inside early on then picked up the
chase toward the quarter pole but was outfinished for third later yards. WINDSORS FOR IT gave early chase outside and rounded the turn about the six
path. SIR MAJESTY stumbled leaving the gate then accelerated to the front and moved to the inside, was caught midway on the turn then faded down the
lane.

Footnotes
HARBOUR TOWN rated a slim lead just off the rail, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole then dug in to the challenge of. ROCKET SOUND to best
that one to the finish, the latter of whom was rated just off the pace four wide, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, challenged the winner
mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. LET'S GET PHYSICAL settled off the pace toward the outside then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole,
came through the turn about the four path and improved steadily to take third later yards. INDIAN WILDFIRE exchanged contact with Hillbilly Pride leaving
the gate then stalked three wide, challenged for the lead nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths and flattened down the
lane. FOREVER TAKES TIME stalked the pace inside then challenged from the three eighths pole, but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and
flattened down the lane. GENESIS G G raced well back toward mid track and raced in the six path of the turn. CESAR AUGUSTO gave chase off the rail,
bid only mildly and rounded the turn at the rail, then weakened. I'MOVERTHEMOON chased the pace outside, raced in the four path of the turn and showed
little more. HILLBILLY PRIDE exchanged contact with Indian Wildfire leaving the gate and was never a factor. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE came away a step
slow then steadied on the chute, moved to the outside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BEARCAT KITTEN chased the pace off the rail and rounded the turn about the three path then dug in down the lane to get up the final yards and just held
on to win the nod. UNNAMED SOLDIER pressured the pace from the inside but steadied while in tight at the rail approaching the turn, then dug in from the
head of the lane to take second in the final yards and just missed the nod at the wire. CASTLE FIVE set a pressured pace about the three path, drew clear
and came in a path nearing the quarter pole, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final yards. ROCK ON gave chase and
raced in the five and six paths of the turn then finished well. WIZARD OF ODDS chased the leaders while off the pace and finished well nearest the rail.
PERPETRATOR gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the eight path and steadily closed widest. SHACKLED chased the leaders from the five path
and finished evenly. GOOD GENES lacked speed while saving early ground, angled four wide leaving the turn and could only close the gap.

Footnotes
GANDARI rated close inside then challenged three wide nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, took the
lead leaving the eighth pole, drew clear mid-stretch then drifted a bit while clear of THE BETTER ONE who settled off the pace in the three path the first
turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out a furlong away then finished evenly,
though steadied late yards. COACH RUBE tapered to the inside to rate a slim lead, was pressured nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage
nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught leaving the eighth pole and flattened stride inside the sixteenth. POWER FORWARD settled off the pace
about the four path, bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but showed little further. IT'SMYINTENSION raced well
back off the rail the first turn and was eased out into the backstretch, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the six path and
passed some rivals outside. LETTS GO TO DIXIES stalked the earlier pace two deep but dropped back past the three eighths pole and faded through the
far turn. UNRULY JULIE raced well off the pace and off the rail. PAINT IT GREEN was through early. ANGLE OF ATTACK settled off the pace between
horses early and showed little response beyond the three eighths pole. After a stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Gandari,
lodged by the rider of The Better One, the stewards found no cause to take action.

Footnotes
NUVE NEGRA settled back inside the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily improved six wide on the far turn and dug in through the
lane to get up the final yards. VENETIAN DRIVE settled close inside the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, lost momentum while boxed in
nearing the quarter pole, came between horses with the lead toward the head of the lane, raced clear a furlong out but was caught the final yards. SHAKIN'
THAT SUGAR settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, angled to the rail past the
eighth pole and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. COLD HEARTED GAL raced well back off the rail the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three and four paths and finished evenly to pass some rivals. HIDE
stalked the pace three wide, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took a slim brief lead midway on the far turn, drifted a bit and gave
up the lead toward the head of the lane and weakened. MANNA FROM HANNAH rounded the first turn in the five path and settled off the pace leaving the
turn, showed little response through the backstretch, came through the far turn about the eight path and passed some rivals. DOVES OUT raced outside
leaving the first turn and showed little response. LADY TOSCANOVA took a brief lead two deep into the first turn and raced close into the backstretch, gave
chase toward the three eighths pole but faded on the far turn. INFINITYPOWERSIWIN sprinted clear and moved to the inside with the early lead then
stalked into the first turn, recovered the edge at the nine sixteenths pole and was rated from that point, came under pressure approaching the three eighths
pole but gave up the lead past the quarter and weakened at the rail on the turn, then eased in the stretch. U R THE LUCKY ONE showed no response
through the backstretch and was eased. This race was hand timed.
