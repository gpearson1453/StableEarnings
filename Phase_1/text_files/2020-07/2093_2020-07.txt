COLONEL TALBOT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns on the two path, bid on that path into the lane, angled widest, made a steady gain and
drew off late. BUGLE BARRY tracked the pace, held position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained a short lead,
then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. SCIENCE TO WIN stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one gaining a short lead
into the stretch, then lacked the needed kick to sustain the bid. PIAZZA DEL CAMPO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when
challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. WANT broke a step slowly from the gate and passed a tiring rival. BAD MEDICINE well
placed and outside, gained position four wide through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
POQUITO ROSE well placed and between rivals, angled in through the turn, got through inside of rivals into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off under
steady pressure. TRUSTY ROLL hopped at the start, was bumped after the start, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the
lane, angled out for clear racing room and edged up for the place. YES IT'S ERIE well placed and three wide, gained a striking position through the turn, bid
on that path into the lane, weakened late and held the show. FAITH FACTOR allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide
into the lane and got up for a share. FRECKLES KAN allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and
flattened out. EMERALD CITADELLE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final
furlong. LOOKIN PERFECT ran evenly, inside. SECRET MILITAIRE broke out, bumping a rival at the start, tracked the pace, angled out to bid three wide
into the lane and faded the final furlong. PANDA POWER was never involved.

needed late kick, while gaining the place. QUEENOFTHEKINGDOM never far back, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the
lane and closed well for the show. RICKEY'S GIRL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
closed for a share. ALEXANDRA KAY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and faded in the drive. LILY'S SECRET ran evenly. COCOLEECHO was

Footnotes
RED CAT (CHI) second flight and inside, looped to position two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained a short lead,
then drew off late under steady pressure. THAT'S BUCKBEAK tracked the pace, moved up on the two path to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
lacked the needed kick and held the place. POLLOCK second flight and outside, angled in to saved ground through the second turn, angled out to bid three
wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the place. HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid
on that path and had a mild gain in the lane. TINTO MESA improved posiiton. AVAST MATEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then had no
stretch rally. DOUBLE RAINBOW was no factor. OUR DOMINATOR bobbled at the start, was well placed and outside, then faded through the second turn.
