Footnotes

alertly pressed a narrow lead through the turn dueling abreast rival down the lane ceding grudgingly at the end. FIRST TALENT a step slow early gave a
mild rally on the turn coming four wide in upper stretch chasing to the wire. PERPETRATOR broke sharply pressuring the pace through the turn weakening
in the three path upper stretch. KING'S RECKONING faded on the turn. LIGHTNING FLASH slow early played no factor. TWINSANITY showed early speed
then faded on the turn. BACKLASH was always outrun.
