deep stretch. RAKASSAH (IRE) broke awkwardly to be last away, traveled outside a rival, swung four wide into the lane, ranged up alongside the winner but
could not match that rival and held second. SEASIDE DANCER unhurried from the inside, lacked room around the turn, came off the rail a bit but was
blocked behind a pair of rivals, angled to the inside, rallied and missed second. ROAD RAGER stalked outside a rival, went three wide into the stretch,
lacked room in upper stretch then came with a late bid. MEAN SOPHIA sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, led clear into the lane, challenged in
the drive, fought back from the inside then weakened in the late stages. SAMSKARA (IRE) away quickly, pulled early then stalked outside the leader, raced

Footnotes
RAYRAY vied between rivals then dropped back to stalk the pace, raced three deep near the half-mile pole, started his run around the turn while two to
three wide, closed outside the runner-up and proved best late. MIDNIGHT MYSTERY vied for the lead from the inside then gained a clear advantage,
showed the way around the turn and into the stretch while keeping along the inside but got caught in deep stretch. CHARLITO unhurried in the beginning,
raced outside a rival, asked three deep around the turn and finished with a good late effort. DYNAMIC DUO tracked off the rail, angled outside rival near the
furlong marker and kept on for a minor award. GARTH mid-pack in the early stages, raced between rivals, angled out near the eighth pole and lacked a
rally. NOTRE DAME vied three deep then chased the pacesetter, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane and faded. CANDY FURY settled along the inside,
roused on the turn but had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
CALI CALIENTE stalked to the outside of the leader, bid alongside HAMMERING LEMON in the lane and wore down rival to prevail. HAMMERING LEMON
set the pace inside, responded when challenged in the drive, battled back and went gamely to the wire. TABLE FOR TEN stalked from the inside to the
stretch, finished willingly and held the show. TROPICAL TERROR raced off the rail, asked around the far turn, angled out into the stretch and gained late.
GAMBINI went three wide into the first turn then outside a rival, moved forward off the rail into the far turn, went outside a rival then finished evenly in the
late. FRAVEL pulled early then steadied around the first turn, saved ground into the lane, shifted out a sixteenth out and lacked a rally. EL DIABLO ROJO
steadied off heels then crowded around the first turn, raced off the rail, traveled in the two path into the lane and came up empty in the drive. JUNGLE
ROAR pulled inside early, came out on the far turn and never responded when asked.

Footnotes
POLAR WIND stalked near the inside, came out into the stretch, drifted in and bumped rival late and got up. RONAMO went three wide into the first turn,
advanced up the backstretch, bid four wide around the turn, gained command near the quarter pole, kicked clear, drifted out and bumped with POLAR
WIND late and got outkicked. ZORICH stalked outside a rival, bid three deep or three wide but proved no match for the top pair. CLAIM OF PASSION broke
well from the inside, saved ground stalking the pace to the lane, came out a bit and kept on for a minor award. MONGOLIAN HERO raced a bit off the rail,
stalked up the backstretch, came out on the far turn, exited the bend four wide and failed to rally. SHOW BUSINESS tracked off the rail then outside a rival,
steadied briefly around the second turn and came up empty in the drive. DIA DE PAGO stumbled leaving the gate, unhurried in the beginning, traveled
along the inside, came off the rail on the backstretch, angled five wide around the far turn and proved no menace. MONGOLIAN LEGEND dueled for the
lead outside a rival to the far turn, lost command and chased rivals into the lane then gave way. BUD KNIGHT dueled from the inside, rank past the
five-sixteenths pole dropped back and faded. The Stewards reviewed the incident between POLAR WIND and RONAMO in deep stretch and ruled that each
horse contributed to the bumping and there would be no change.

MAXIM RATE angled in to the rail in the beginning, saved ground into the lane, split foes mid-stretch, fought with the runner-up in deep stretch and proved
best. TONAHUTU (IRE) traveled along the inside, raced three wide into the lane, closed but got outkicked by the winner. PULPIT RIDER raced a bit off the
rail, four wide into the lane and bested the others. ELLIE ARROWAY controlled the pace near the inside, inched away briefly then dueled with GREAT
RETURN into the drive and flattened in the final furlong. GREAT RETURN stalked outside the leader, bid outside near the quarter pole, dueled into the
stretch and flattened. STRIKE AT DAWN reserved in the early going, traveled a bit off the rail then outside a rival, swung four wide into the lane and needed
more.

ST. JOE BAY pressed outside, headed rival approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely under urging. DREAMS OF VALOR
chased outside a rival, came four wide into the lane and finished well. SILKEN PRINCE off slow to begin, stalked a bit off the rail, moved out into the three
path, made a mild bid into the stretch and held the show. APPRECIATED chased from inside, lacked room and checked nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
angled out with a furlong to go and improved position. MAKE IT A TRIPLE raced off the rail, two to three wide around the turn and lacked a bid. ALLEVA set
a pressured pace, lost command into the drive and weakened. LIGHTNING FAST outside a rival early, went four wide around the bend and never
threatened.

HIT THE ROAD angled to the inside, saved ground to the lane, came out a bit, split foes and surged clear. KANDEREL bumped start, tracked off the rail,
swung five wide into the stretch and closed well for second. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM settled early, raced three deep, found traffic in upper stretch, moved
out and produced a late bid. ROOKIE MISTAKE chased from the inside, angled out in the drive and got edged for the show. I'M LEAVING YOU bumped
broke in and bumped both sides, rank early from the inside, came out into the stretch and further out in upper stretch and finished willingly. MARGOT'S BOY
dueled for the lead from the outside to the lane and weakened late. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO raced two wide then moved further off the rail, went four deep
on the backstretch, four wide into the lane and flattened. HEYWOODS BEACH chased three deep to the lane and lacked room late. SILARDI dueled for
command, fought back from the inside and weakened late. TIZAMAGICIAN chased between rivals to the stretch, impeded and checked approaching the
sixteenth pole and weakened in the drive. EL TIGRE TERRIBLE bumped both sides leaving the gate, traveled between foes and pulled early, raced in traffic
in upper stretch, angled to the inside, forced in by rival near the sixteenth pole and and weakened after. HOWBEIT bumped from both sides at the start,
raced off the rail and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JULIUS hustled to the front, set the pace into and around the turn, drifted into the stretch and drew off. TOBACCO ROAD settled early, split foes around the
turn, came three wide into the stretch, rallied and got up for second. JEN GO UNCHAINED broke well, in range from the outside, came in some then drifted
five wide into the lane, showed a mild response and gained the show. CASTLE GATE stalked outside a rival, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a
bid. RED VALOR tracked off the inside, came out on the turn and six wide leaving the bend and kept on four deep late. KNIFES EDGE mid-pack in the early
going, traveled two wide into the stretch and weakened. LITTLE NO WAY stalked two wide and could not rally. DARK HEDGES chased three wide into the
stretch, tired and was not persevered with late. SEVEN OXEN squeezed soon after the start, angled around a rival, moved to the inside in the stretch and
never threatened. ARTIE B GOOD chased off the rail, angled in and raced two wide, angled out in upper stretch and never responded to urging.
UNBRIDLED'S SKYE saved ground and tired.
