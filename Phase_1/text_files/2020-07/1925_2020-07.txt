Footnotes
SECULAR STAGNATION stalked the pace down the backstretch while saving ground, angled out to the three path nearing the eighth pole and finished well
to be clear late under strong handling. GLOBUS pressed the pace while racing just off the inside, raced two wide in the drive and finished second best.
MAYFAIR HEIGHTS stalked the pace, moved up three wide around the far turn through the lane while racing between rivals and showed good late interest.
REMEMBER ME TONY showed good speed from the inside and weakened a bit through the stretch. DUKE OF ARGYLE was slow in the early stages,
raced along the inside nearing the quarter pole into the lane and had no rally. D C HERO was forced five wide around the first turn, stalked the pace from
the outside and weakened late. REACH THE MOON settled off the early pace, raced four deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. THAT DUDE
failed to sustain a bid. The three quarters of a mile fractional split was unavailable.

towards the inside in the drive and finished second best. NATALIES JOY stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had
not enough late. ZOE'S GOLDLADY was off a step slow, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole, angled in late and never was a serious threat. PAULA'S
PLAYLIST pressed the early pace from the outside and weakened. QUEEN ARCANA was unhurried early, raced along the inside in the lane and never was
a factor. HOLLYWOOD JEWEL dropped back early and failed to have a response. IT'S PERSONAL UN raced far back and never was involved.
