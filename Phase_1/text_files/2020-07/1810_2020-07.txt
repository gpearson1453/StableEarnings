Footnotes
HARDY CANDY settled off the pace, closed along the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied between foes and was up late, driving. BLESSED TWO dueled
briefly, forced the pace into the turn, rebid mid turn, gained a narrow lead mid stretch but was caught in the late stages. FLASH MAN led midway through
the backstretch and moved clear briefly early turn, was engaged mid turn, dueled into the stretch and gave way grudgingly. DEPUTY OF EGBERT bobbled
leaving the gate, closed up up quickly but was pinched back at the turn, chased three-wide into the stretch but was lugging in and evened out. MAJESTIC
MELODY pressed the pace, chased from the rail late turn then evened out in the final 16th. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST settled off the pace, was hustled
four-wide on the turn but finished evenly. CHESTERMERE settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn, launched his rally in the stretch but ran
into traffic approaching the wire and evened out. STORM CHART settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, encountered traffic
approaching the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong.

drive. BOKERMIN set a pressured pace from the rail, entertained a challenge from ORPHAN HALLIE at the top of the stretch, was bumped sharply mid
stretch and was outfinished. HIGHRISEINTHEPEG, away slowly and off the early pace, closed fast angling from the second path to four-wide on the turn,
chased into the stretch but was lugging in then finished gamely. ICOMEFROMDOWNTOWN, in touch, angled off the rail late turn but finished evenly.
YZERMAN, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. ORPHAN HALLIE pressed the pace early, was hustled in range
while two-wide on the turn then finished evenly along the fence. LIQUID LOUIE settled in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn but never
reached contention. SWEEPIN HARD was close early then settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but had no closing response. SEVENTH
WONDER stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn and tired in the stretch. WHIZMO got away very slowly and settled well off the pace, was hustled on
the turn but was not a threat. ANOTHER BREEZE raced in mid pack, chased from the rail on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL

A BROKEN BREEZE settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide between rivals on the far turn, tendered her bid in the final furlong and drew clear to
win under a hand ride. PREFERRED GUEST raced in mid pack, chased along the rail into the stretch, bid in the final furlong but was outkicked.
NOVEMBER FOG pressed the pace, forced the issue into the far turn, took a clear lead but was passed in the final 16th. FAITH OVER FEAR stalked in
hand, chased hard three then two-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. GIZMO'S PRINCESS raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on
the far turn but was shuffled back and failed to muster a strong rally. TEXT ME UP, away slowly and off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn
and never reached contention. NANA SAV settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then lacked a closing response. CURLIN'S TIGER led
into the first turn, set a reserved pace, was headed at the far turn then faded on the rail.

Footnotes
PIONEER MAN bumped with MAGIC TAPIT at the start, showed some early speed but settled on the inside as others hustled to the lead, stalked the pace
duel down the backstretch, came off of the rail as they approached the far turn, looked for racing room rounding that bend, angled to the far outside at the
top of the stretch and finished best. MAGIC TAPIT bumped with PIONEER MAN at the start, was sharp early as he went for the early lead, followed DREAM
MAKER on the opening turn, advanced to commence a duel with that foe down the backstretch, backed off somewhat midway around the far turn, dug in as
they entered the stretch and dueled down the stretch but was outfinished. FARAWAY KITTEN raced two-wide on the opening turn, stalked the pace duel
down the backstretch, was three-wide on the far turn, launched a bid late on that turn, led into the stretch but had to duel as MAGIC TAPIT rebid, was
outfinished by PIONEER MAN and was nabbed for place at the wire. DREAM MAKER was hustled to the front while racing two-wide, dueled down the
backstretch, had the advantage midway around the far turn then gave way after being headed. THEREGOESJOJO dropped to the inside past the wire for
the first time, advanced into the pack midway down the backstretch, angled from two to four-wide late on the far turn and finished evenly. FULL EXTREME
trailed the field in the early stages, was unhurried down the backstretch, came under asking midway around the turn, offered no rally and was vanned off.
AHEADBYACENTURY lacked early speed, raced two and three-wide on the opening turn, made a mild advance down the backstretch, raced four-wide into
the far turn, came under the whip past the 3/8ths pole and came up empty.

ROYAL WEDDING chased the early leader, bid late turn, shook clear in the stretch but was needing the wire. TAPPITTY TAPPITTY settled off the pace,
rallied into traffic late turn then closed fast, but missed. MARCH OF DREAMS settled off the pace, also ran into traffic late turn, swung out and finished a
clear third. RUNWAY DREAMER raced in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn, loomed seven-wide at the top of the stretch, but hung.
SAMARIAN settled off the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn then launched a wide rally at the top of the stretch but was laying in and failed to
menace. COMIC KITTEN chased along the rail, was in range late turn but had no response in the stretch. GOLDEN GARTER led the way, was headed late
turn and retreated down the lane. NIIGON'S SPIN stalked two and three-wide throughout then leveled off down the stretch. HASTALAVISTABABY trailed
throughout and passed a tired foe. I WONDER chased four-wide on the backstretch, fell back midway of the turn And had no response in the stretch.

TWIRLING FAITH stalked the pace, took command mid turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and held MARJORIE'S DREAM safe under a drive.
MARJORIE'S DREAM bumped with ABOVE THE LINE leaving the gate, forced the pace, chased into the stretch but could not wear down the leader.
ROLLING SLOAN showed brief speed then stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. QUEEN'S SPEED settled
off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn, was widest at the top of the stretch and rallied in vain. ARAMON raced in mid pack, was hustled three and
four-wide on the turn then finished gamely. TOO MANY MOUNTANS settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then evened out mid
stretch. GLAMOUROUS GIRL settled in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide late turn but never reached contention. YASINIA broke
alertly then settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. JOAN'S CHRISTINE led on the main track, set a pressured pace
along the rail, was headed mid turn, chased to the stretch and tired. ABOVE THE LINE bumped with rivals on both sides leaving the gate, was hustled
through the turn then lacked a rally. LINDA LOVES LACE, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn but lacked a
closing response. SOCIETY'S STORY showed early speed and was looking for the lead but veered into the rail as she entered the gap, unseated her rider,
hit the fence and was vanned off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.
