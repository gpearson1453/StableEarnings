MISTER STORM raced off the pace, advanced nearing the quarter pole, rallied four wide into the lane, surged late outside and was up in time in a driving
finish. POWERFULLY BUILT dueled outside for the lead, battled with LONG BLADE on the turn, dropped back nearing the furlong marker, then came again
between rivals and dug in gamely to the wire. VENTUS chased inside, rallied three wide into the lane, closed between rivals in deep stretch and was
outkicked. LONG BLADE dueled inside for the lead, battled on the turn, shook free nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely, then weakened late.
CONSTANT KNIGHT raced off the pace, off the rail, came five wide into the lane and finished evenly. VICTORY TOUR was off a bit slow and did not factor.
The five furlong time is HAND TIMED.

under urging and widened the margin. MINEWELLRECEIVED stalked the pacesetter in the early stages, chased nearing the far turn, bid two wide on the
turn, dug in through the lane and was all out to hold the place spot. HONESTA raced off the pace, moved up inside on the far turn, came four wide into the
lane, rallied mildly outside and just missed for second. HERE COMES BUBBLES was outrun early, moved up at the quarter pole and closed belatedly on
the rail. RUNNING GIRL broke outward slightly bothering BIG BOSS LADY, raced four wide early, then cleared off to set the pace, dueled on the far turn
and faded. HOT LITTLE NUMBER raced off the pace inside and did not factor. SUNSHINE JOY raced five wide early, settled two wide off the pace and

YOUR AWESOME BOSS stalked close up early, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled with INSPIRING JUSTICE through a long stretch drive and
wore down that rival to prevail. INSPIRING JUSTICE showed good early speed, set the pace, dueled with the winner turning for home, dug in gamely inside
in the stretch drive and battled to the end. EMBEED chased the pace, raced two wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly late
outside. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT rushed up early into contention, then chased along the rail, angled out at the furlong marker and finished evenly. HIDDEN
STYLE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace between rivals, three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CALEB THE BOSS raced four wide off the
pace and did not factor. VROOM VROOM VRIO raced close up in the early stages, chased between rivals and faded. GARSOON was off a bit slow and
outrun. CENTER CITY was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and had no rally. PHIL THE BANKER chased outside, went five wide past the

GOLDEN BROWN raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, bid four wide on the far turn, dueled with ROYAL URN past midstretch and drew
clear late for the win, driving. ROYAL URN raced close up on the inside, commenced a rail bid nearing the far turn, dueled inside on the turn, gained a short
lead, dug in gamely inside of GOLDEN BROWN in the stretch drive and came up second best. PRENDIMI raced three wide early, steadied slightly on the
first turn, settled off the pace, moved up on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. OPTIC WAY pressed the pace in the early
stages, then stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled and weakened. WALLERCITO forced to check in tight quarters on the clubhouse turn,
then raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally. SHIELD OF FAITH set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled between
rivals on the far turn and faded. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of PRENDIMI against GOLDEN BROWN on the first turn was dismissed.

MADAME TIGER vied inside for the lead, dueled into the lane, drew clear and held well, driving. OCEANO ROSSO vied between rivals early, then chased,
checked and dropped back midway on the turn, rallied late outside and got up for second. HERO FOR HIRE vied three wide for the lead, dueled into the
lane, weakened and lost second at the wire. FOXY MISCHIEF raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally.
MZ. FOO DO raced close up on the inside, chased the leaders into the stretch and lacked a bid. MISS MI MI raced off the rail, off the pace and did not
factor. DISTINCTIVE LADY raced off the pace, did not factor and gave way in the final furlong. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of OCEANO ROSSO
against the winner was dismissed.

Footnotes
LODI set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled with BEE BY THE SEA, edged away from that rival and held well through the final
furlong, driving. BEE BY THE SEA was off a step slow and bobbled, stalked two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely
outside in the stretch drive and battled to the end. SHILOH LANE was outrun early, closed mildly outside and earned the show spot. COOL ASSASSIN
tracked close up inside and failed to respond when asked. NINTH OF APRIL raced three wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn
and tired.
