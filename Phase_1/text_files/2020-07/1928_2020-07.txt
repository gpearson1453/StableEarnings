Footnotes
THAT'S BUCKBEAK moved on pace saving ground through the far turn shaking clear in upper stretch angling to the three path holding firm late.
PALLADIUM slow early lost ground to upper stretch coming on late eight wide. NOBODY MOVE a step slow to upper stretch would respond late four wide
ducking to the rail in the final yards finishing well. DANG IT CASSIE prompted the pace racing between horses through the far turn, ceded a clear lead to
inside rival in upper stretch angling out while weakening late. BANISHMENT slow early early was no menace swinging seven wide late. SAVE THE DRAMA
pressed the pace racing three deep through the far turn then weakened angling out past mid track mid stretch. THOMAS KNIGHT failed to respond. ONE
FLASHY CAT tracked a trio of leaders to the far turn tiring into upper stretch. GUNTHER REPORT was never involved.

DEVILS DAUGHTER prompted the pace carrying a narrow lead to upper stretch being engaged from the rail there proving up to the task. PINKIE PINK
stalked the pace cutting the corner to bid boldly along the rail in upper stretch dueling late being denied at the end. LOOPY pressed the pace dueling
through the turn weakening in upper stretch. MY SWEET PAYNTER slow early trailed through the turn showed some belated interest the final eighth to
improve in the three path. LET'S TWIRL hesitant at the break lagged through the turn giving an even finish near mid track. MY MISS AQUARIUS chased
early then dropped off on the turn. DELIA'S PRIDE was always outrun. PROSPECTIVE MELODY was never involved.

ROCKY DIPLOMAT advanced on the backside taking a short lead on the far turn, dueling abreast foe in upper stretch would edge clear late. FINAL PROOF
pressed the pace dueling through the far turn into upper stretch grudgingly ceding along the rail angling out late. BUMPA lunged at the break hurrying from
the gate, stalked the pace to upper stretch finding little there while holding the others safe. DIG IN gave a modest middle move proving no menace. LIL
PISTOLA was never involved. SIXTY FORTY was always outrun. CHEAP SHOT dueled for a half packing it in on the far turn easing to the wire walking off
after the race.

in upper stretch ceding grudgingly late in the two path. EXPLOSIVE PACKAGE hustled outside gained on the turn then lost momentum in upper stretch
finishing evenly near mid track. SLOWPOKE chased the pace extending into upper stretch finishing evenly. LINDA'S MUSIC pressed the pace dueling to
upper stretch weakening late along the rail. THALIA'S SONG raced mid pack losing ground to upper stretch posing no menace eight wide. PRINCESS KIAH
was bumped checking at the break, played no factor. HERE'S TO YOU was always outrun. WILD WITCH had brief speed then gave way on the turn.
