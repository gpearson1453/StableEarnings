ANECHOIC hustled on the inside would shake clear on the turn racing four and five wide down the lane widening under modest urging. ARGENTIC (FR)
tracked evenly through the turn vying from the inside in upper stretch becoming clearly no match for the winner while securing place in the two path.
CREAKY CRICKET broke well pressing then chasing on the turn, weakened into upper stretch fading near mid track. JUMPN' JAMES was never involved.
EL ALMIRANTE was always outrun. BLUE MESA offered little.

YES DARLIN rallied in bid four wide on the turn pressing abreast rival into upper stretch bearing down late to prevail. GOOD MORNING JACK pressured
the pace taking a short lead on the turn dueling inside of rival to upper stretch battling gamely from the eighth pole. MUNY ME TOO chased the pace
pressing in bid on the turn, no match for the top pair down the lane held the others safe at mid track. FIRST TALENT hustled into the turn was in tight
between horses past the three eighths pole going evenly through the lane near mid track. LAST WOODMAN slow early played no factor. PASS THE RUSH
bobbling at the break would pressure early chasing through the turn wearing out in upper stretch. MAVERICK'S ACE was always outrun. BINDER sent hard
had an early lead then wilted abruptly on the turn. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF FIRST TALENT AGAINST BOTH MUNY ME TOO AND YES
DARLIN FOR INTERFERENCE PAST THE THREE EIGHTHS POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
