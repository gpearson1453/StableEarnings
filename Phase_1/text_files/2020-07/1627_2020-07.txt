COURTLY KITTY set a rated pace along the rail, drew clear down the backstretch and held clear under left-handed urging. FOXY GATOR settled off the
pace two wide, went three wide around the far turn, rallied widest and was up for the place on the wire. CASTLEINTHEMEADOW stalked the pace from the
rail through the opening six furlongs, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, chased two wide in the clear around the far turn, was one-paced in the lane and
lost second in the final stride. LETMESLIDEBYYOU checked early, saved ground off the pace and went evenly. CORY'S CUTIE lagged well back inside,
went two wide around the far turn, tipped further out in upper stretch and lacked a bid. SECRET O'LIFE prompted the pace two wide and tired nearing the
far turn.

BREAK DANCIN pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, seized command near the half-mile pole, drew clear soon after, continued well clear in the
two path around the far turn and drew further off under a drive in the lane. BADS LIL LADY set the early pace along the rail then chased the winner while
continuing to save ground and held well enough to preserve the place. LADYS CROSS FIRST lagged well back inside, advanced three wide around the far
turn and rallied mildly. BELLA FEMMINA stumbled at the start, had some speed three wide between foes and was through after a half.
CRYPTOCROSSING was up close inside early and faded. CHARITABLE SHOW had brief speed four wide around the first turn, angled in down the
backstretch and retreated.

CHINA CAT settled off the pace inside, made a quick rail bid around the far turn, tipped two wide approaching the lane, swept to command in upper stretch
and quickly cleared under a drive. LUCILLE OF TROY raced off the pace two wide, advanced just outside of the winner into the far turn, split rivals near the
quarter pole, angled three wide midway around the turn and rallied for the place. CAMERON STREET lacked early speed while saving ground, made
progress at the rail rounding the far turn, angled out in midstretch and rallied for the show. PAISLEY SINGING set a pressured pace along the rail, was
collared in upper stretch and weakened. SKYLAR'S TRICK bobbled a bit at the break, was sent two wide, pressed the pace and tired around the far turn.
TWO IN THE BUSH settled off the pace scramble in the clear two and three wide and had no response.

RATLTRAP stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the lane, continued on the left lead and drew off under a drive. GRECIAN ADMIRAL set
the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner in the final eighth but stayed on well enough to be a clear second. GENESIS G G stalked the pace from
the rail, tipped two wide near the eighth pole and lacked a rally. BRILLIANT IDEAS failed to menace while racing two wide. MACHEN BETS pressed the
pace two wide down the backstretch then faded three wide around the turn. ASK ME NOT dwelt and trailed inside.

Footnotes
CREATIVE GENIUS was reluctant to load, came in and bumped ONTHESTRAITANARROW into SOUTHERN SAVIOR, stalked the pace three wide, seized
command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly clear and held clear under a drive. BIZ NASTY was off a step slow, raced off the pace two wide, advanced
three wide around the far turn and finished well. TIVANO was fractious in the starting gate, raced off the pace inside, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, angled back in nearing the eighth pole and rallied inside. STEP OUT DANCING lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced three wide around
the far turn, steadied off heels near the three-sixteenths pole, came four wide into the lane and had a mild belated rally. ONTHESTRAITANARROW was
bumped at the start, lagged three wide early, circled five wide around the far turn and failed to menace. SOUTHERN SAVIOUR was bumped at the start,
pressed the pace two wide, briefly led between rivals near the five-sixteenths pole then tired. SWISS SUNRISE set a pressured pace along the rail and
retreated after a half.

Footnotes
EVAN'S CHILE set a clear pace off the rail, drew off around the turn, veered in when hit once right-handed in upper stretch, straightened out and widened
while ridden out from there. MISS WAVE was bumped after the start, raced well off the pace two wide down the backstretch, angled to the rail near the
quarter pole, tipped back out near the eighth pole and finished willingly. GOT ANY saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. IRISH
KNOCKOUT ducked in and bumped QUITE SUGGESTIVE at the start, bumped again with MISS WAVE several strides later, had early speed inside,
chased the winner around the turn and came up empty in the lane. QUITE SUGGESTIVE was bumped at the start, dropped far back and made little impact.
CARSON CASTLE played no factor while racing two wide. SPUNKY ALI CAT had brief speed outside.

Footnotes
FLATTER HYMN raced up close inside while thoroughly boxed in through the opening half-mile, steadied entering the far turn, angled out near the
three-sixteenths pole, came four wide into lane, surged outside and was up late under confident handling. OUT OF CENTS settled off the pace while racing
three wide, made progress outside down the backstretch, bid three wide around the far turn, briefly lead in midstretch, finished well between rivals but was
no match for the winner late. CAYENNE CREEK settled off the early pace while racing two wide, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead nearing the
lane, led to midstretch and was outfinished despite staying on willingly. BROTHER CORBIN tracked the pace inside, went two wide around the far turn and
lacked a rally. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY stalked the pace three wide, took the lead early on the backstretch, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, set the
pace along the rail from there to upper stretch then tired. A IS FOR ARTIST pressed the pace two wide between rivals early, dropped back some down the
backstretch, checked entering the far turn and had no further response. TO THE FRONT set the early pace along the rail and retreated.

Footnotes
LIL MR MATT hesitated at the start, made good progress three wide around the first turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive.
WISH IN THE CASTLE settled off the pace along the inside, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied for the place. ELEANOR'S DIAMOND
saved ground well back, went four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. ASK ME HOW IKNOW pressed the early pace two wide, drew clear
early on the backstretch, set the pace down the backstretch, chased the winner inside around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and
weakened. IGOTITNTHEPOCKET had early speed two wide and steadily faded. PAP'S LEGACY played no factor while racing three and four wide. DIXIE'S
CROSSING set the early pace along the rail and was through early.
