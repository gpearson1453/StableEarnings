Footnotes
FASCILITATOR crowded and shuffled back at the break, advanced from outside to vie for the lead leaving the bend, edged ahead midstretch and shook
free the final sixteenth. COUSIN DARIO broke alertly, set a pressured pace from between horses, gained the rail into the turn, was challenged and gradually
wore down the final sixteenth. SPLASH FOR GOLD forwardly placed from outside, was two wide on the bend, angled outside FASCILITATOR upper stretch
then ran evenly through the stretch. HALO HUNTER pressed from inside, did not keep up on the bend, angled out leaving the turn, moved outside SPLASH
FOR GOLD in the lane and lacked the extra needed. RIVER CACTUS bumped at the start, chased from outside, was two wide on the turn, swung to the
outside leaving the bend and passed a couple tired rivals. GOLDEN DRILLER also crowded at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. NYOMAN
lugged in some shortly after the break, was an early factor but began to yield three wide leaving the turn.

Footnotes
DON'T DALLY emerged with a clear lead from inside with a half mile to go, was roused upper stretch and maintained control under a drive the final furlong.
MIKAYLA ATTACK advanced from between rivals, came three wide into the lane, battled outside PRANCIPANTS for second and edged ahead late.
PRANCIPANTS pressed from just outside DON'T DALLY, fought for second in the stretch, did not have enough late but was clearly best of the rest.
THIRSTY COWGIRL progressed four wide on the bend, advanced to midstretch then leveled off. LAVERNS LASS passed outside tired ones the last two
furlongs. SHRIMP saved ground and was not a factor. MACBU was an early factor, had the rail on the bend, angled out upper stretch and gave way
between foes. FILLY FROM ILLY forwardly placed on the backstretch, gave way two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S HONOR stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, was roused into the lane then steadily opened up under
a drive. HUEY ATTACK prominent early, had the rail on the turn, angled out some for the drive and pulled clear for second late. CREAL WONDER
contested the pace from between rivals, gained the rail on the turn, was no match for MEGAN'S HONOR through the stretch and began to wear down in the
waning yards. LINE OF DENHAMS chased from outside, was four wide taking the bend and was closing in for third late. AGAVE KID displayed early speed
from inside, did not keep up on the turn and flattened out just off the rail in the lane. BIG BAD DOC void of speed, angled to the outside upper stretch and
passed tiring rivals. STOSH was prominent just outside HUEY ATTACK on the backstretch but yielded on the bend. BOB'S BRASS DANCER dwelt at the
start and was never a factor. CHEYENNE VIHO chased from between horses, angled to the outside upper stretch but had little to offer.
AWINBENEATHMYWINGS saved ground taking the bend, angled out for the drive but was empty.

Footnotes
I'VE GOT ISSUES settled well back, picked up her pace from outside on the turn, was all out running widest in the lane and swept past rivals in the waning
yards. MY FOUROONE KPLAN bumped at the break, pressed from between horses, was three wide on the turn, dueled for the lead deep stretch, was no
match for I'VE GOT ISSUES but caught ELIZABETH'S FEVER near the wire. ELIZABETH'S FEVER disputed the pace outside FOGGY KITTEN from the
beginning, edged ahead in the lane but lacked the needed kick in the late going. FOGGY KITTEN vied for the lead from inside to midsretch then began to
yield. BELLAH DOWN came into contention two wide on the turn but leveled off the last eighth. LOGI forwardly placed outside on the backstretch, did not
keep up four wide on the bend and failed to have a significant stretch bid. ORIENTAL LADY broke outward, bumping MY FOUROONE KPLAN, trailed from
off the rail angled out for the stretch run and closed the gap some without threatening. ECO STAR saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
BOOHOO SUE shared the lead inside ARCTIC MUSIC, moved ahead when allowed leaving the turn, was under a steady drive through the stretch and held
sway. HELEN MAE'S SONG was kept close, three wide taking the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch but could not close the gap on the leader in
the late going. BROWN SHOES prominent in close quarters between horses the first two furlongs, was four wide taking the turn, lacked a serious stretch bid
but got up for third nearing the wire. TOUR ON progressed from path three on the bend, fought for third deep stretch but was outfinished in a game try.
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN forwardly placed from outside, failed to keep up five wide on the turn and found best stride too late the final eighth. MAY BE
SUSPECT at the back early, steadily progressed two wide between rivals to threaten midstretch but leveled off in the late going. PINK FOR ME chased from
inside, angled to the outside for the drive and failed to have a significant bid. ARCTIC MUSIC displayed early speed outside BOOHOO SUE, did not keep up
leaving the bend, moved to the rail into the stretch and steadily gave way. PRAISEM moved to the outside early on and was never a factor. LAST
SURPRIZE faded from between rivals early and showed little.

Footnotes
TRAPPE VALLEY rated just off the early speed, went for the lead two wide on the turn, edged ahead into the lane and held on under steady handling.
KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF broke alertly, showed the way just off the rail, was challenged from outside on the turn, lacked the extra needed through the
stretch but was clearly second best. TAP FEVER bumped with LOST IN MANHATTAN at the break then stumbled, was settled, picked up his pace from
inside on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and steadily advanced between horses. CAN'T SAY NO prominent between rivals, was three wide on
the bend, floated out some entering the stretch and gradually yielded. MEXICO MEMORIES in contention from outside, did not keep up two wide on the
turn, regained a striking position between rivals upper stretch but could not sustain his bid late. LOST IN MANHATTAN bumped with TAP FEVER at the
break, was boxed in on the backstretch, swung out to advance widest on the turn, lost further ground fanning six wide into the stretch and flattened.
GIRLOLAMO'GLORY pressed from outside on the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide taking the bend and also wore down for the drive.
BRADDOCK steadily faded from inside.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT rated off the early pacesetter, took over two wide on the turn, floated out some into the stretch and gradually lengthened command under
stead handling. GO LITTLE GERT GO prominent from outside, closed the gap three wide on the bend, fanned out further entering the lane, came to
TRIPLE SCOUT upper stretch, failed to have the extra needed the last furlong but was easily second best. PALAGO void of speed, advanced three wide on
the turn, lost ground fanning seven wide for the stretch run and steadily progressed to gain third late. GHAALEB'S DREAMS trailed from just off the inside,
angled to the outside on the turn, came widest into the lane and passed tired ones. LILLET well placed inside for a half mile, swung out five wide entering
the lane and flattened. WEST GLACIER was checked in traffic as she left the chute, advanced from inside on the turn, progressed to midstretch, then
leveled off. POSITIONEDTODANCE raced in midpack from outside, was four to six wide taking the bend and had no late bid. LEXI SUMMER failed to
menace in a ground-saving trip. RED JERSEY displayed early speed, was challenged from outside on the turn and gave way the last two furlongs. MARYS
LAST SONG was an early factor but began to tire between horses before finishing a half mile.
