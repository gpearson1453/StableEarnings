Footnotes
GRAZIA WHO battled for the lead into the stretch, took charge, turned back a strong bid from the runner up near mid stretch, dug in gamely and proved best
under strong left handed urging. MISS KETTLE ZIP had her head turned at the start, rushed to contention, lacked room behind a wall of horses on the turn,
split foes three wide past the quarter pole, loomed boldly before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. APRIL MARIE vied for lead the lead
three wide into the stretch then faded. WELLOILEDCAT had a mild late rally. THE CALICO LADY failed to menace. SPEAKING VOLUMES trailed into the
stretch then passed tiring rivals. JUDY'S PRIDE dueled for the lead into the turn then tired. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE was through after a half. NUNS
ISLAND was shut off at the start and never involved. ASHLEY'S ENVY was outrun.

CHASING THE STARS stalked the pace for a half, split rivals two wide nearing the far turn, set the balance of the pace and widened under a strong hand
ride to win as much the best. Z J WINS pressed the pace three wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead, gave up the advantage towards the far turn,
chased the winner the balance of the trip and just held on for second. QUEENA ESTHER hopped outward bumping FIGHTING FOR GRACE at the start,
was never far back and finished with good courage in the four path. FIGHTING FOR GRACE was bumped at the start, trailed into the stretch and finished
well in the six path. GOLDEN POINT advanced three wide on the far turn then came up empty. SPANISH ARMADA saved ground and was through after a
half. AMERICAN SPARROW set the early pace inside, had speed for six furlongs then stopped.

STAR MABEE prompted the pace three then two wide, made the lead entering the stretch then finished full of run under a hand ride to win going away.
FORTUNATE GINA away alertly, set a pressured pace into the turn then was no match for the winner while clearly second best. NATURAL BLING never far
back, offered a mild bid in the four path into the stretch then leveled off. ROSETTA GRAY pressed the pace from between horses into the turn then faded.
LAISSEZ FAIRE was squeezed shortly after the start, lacked racing room into the turn, waited near the inside then had no response. MS. MAXIMA had
speed along the inside through the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
WILD TILLIE broke in full stride to set all the pace and maintained her advantage under right handed urging. PERSEVERING HONOR chased the winner all
the way and finished second best. AIKEN APPLE vied for the lead three wide and finished with good courage. GERTIE CAT had good early speed then
faded. DEB'S ALL OUT hesitated at the start and was never involved. PRINCESS EX was always outrun. CAUSE OF LOVE was through early.
