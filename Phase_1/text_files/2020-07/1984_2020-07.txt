Footnotes
LA COYOTA was bumped in a chain reaction involving the whole field at the start, pressed the leader to the turn, cleared off easily and stayed clear while
drifting out late. SHE WANTS MORE was bumped at the start, lost some ground as a result, managed to get behnd the leader, moved up in the three path
on the turn and chased the winner from the middle of the stretch , ending up second best. SKIP AND A HOP was bumped at the start, steadied, veered
inside, then back outside the field, came very wide into the stretch and closed best to grab the show. ROBOTRON bumped a horse at the start as part of a
chain reaction, raced mid pack, steadily gained, was third late but lost it nearing the wire when passed by a fast closer. SANCTUAIRE SPOT was bumped
at the start, lost ground, raced unhurried inside to the turn, moved out four wide on the turn to improve position, then lost position nearing the wire.
DESIREE was bumped at the start, was the speed off the rail, dropped back on the turn and tired in the stretch.

steady pressure but could not last and run down through the final furlong. NAUGHTY FACTOR broke tardy, came widest into stretch and ran on for show
spot with a good effort. LIVE IT UP bobbled at the break, saved ground throughout and improved position thereafter. TARNISH never deemed a real
menace. ALLABOUTAPRINCESS rushed outside and pressured to turn but gave way readily. MORNINGSTARDUST inside run to turn, gave way readily.
MY TEMPLE never a threat.

GODSGIFT chased the leader to the turn, headed that one from the outside at the top of the turn, engaged in a long duel down the stretch and got up to
lead in deep stretch. GRACE D' ART led early off the rail, was confronted by the winner at the mid point ot the turn, dueled inside down the stretch, led at
the sixteeth pole but yielded in the closing yards. SPRING FROST rallied on the turn in the four path and held position down the stretch. TRADITIONAL
ARCHER swerved in and out at the start, waited to the turn for a mild rally while off the rail and ran evenly down the stretch. FIVE O'CLOCK raced back,
took the four path on the turn and came wide down the middle of the stretch. U S S LOIS ran off in the post parade, was off slow, raced very wide on the
backstretch and posed no threat.

Footnotes
SAMOA vied to mid backstretch, cleared off to lead to the quarter pole, was headed by a rallying foe, took the lead again and stayed safe to the finish.
WICKED BETTY was well placed off the dueling leaders, moved up in the three path on the turn, headed the winner at the quarter pole, but was unable to
seriously threaten the leader to the wire. DIXIE MOLL tracked the pace to the turn, took the three path, moved toward the inside in the stretch, got close to
the leaders but evened out. SHE'S FLASHY was well back, gained some on the far turn, then improved position in the stretch while staying even.
TEMPERANCE ROAD angled out entering the first turn, raced widest on the backstretch, got close on the turn, but faltered in the final furlong. THREE
BIRDS ran inside near the back, saved ground on the turn, but was no threat. GLISTENING STAR dueled to upper backstretch and backed out, and came
very wide into the stretch while well back.

FUGIWHARA was bumped at the start, tracked the leader while reserved, advanced in the three path on the far turn and vied with that frontrunner from the
top of the stretch to the wire, getting bumped late and just up. DARBY DART went to a clear lead early at the rail, was confronted at the top of the stretch
and to the wire by the winner, drifted out and bumped that one late,and was beat in a photo. RUN THIS TOWN raced a clear third throughtout. IT'S GAME
TIME was pinched back at the start, ran a clear fourth and stayed even. PRE FLIGHT was bumped at the start, unhurred off the rail, moved out for room on
the backstretch and raced evenly. SWIFTY SAM was always back, saved ground on the turn and was hustled to no avail. HE'S A BRAT was not a factor.
WHO'SYOURFAVORITE ran way back and was no factor.

Footnotes
NORTH ELKHORN sprinted between horses to the lead, drew clear out of the turn and held sway through the final furlong under good handling. YANKTON
had an inside trip throughout while coming on quickly but too late to catch the winner. GET TOUGH speed between horses to the turn but leveled off in the
stretch run while well clear of the rest. TIZABOUTIME was off a bit slow, trailed to the quarter pole, swung wide only to move up while no real threat.
WARRIOR'S MARCH broke sharp, lost position quickly and dropped back. RIPE had an outside chase to quarter pole but could not go on while faltering in
the stretch run.
