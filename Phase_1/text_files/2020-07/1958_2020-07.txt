Footnotes
J M R VICTORY LAP was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
CHESTERMERE forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but with the lead from the three path in mid stretch failed to hold. CAPE DESIDERATO
stalked the leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. JACK BEANSTALK showed speed from the
inside and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way in mid stretch. HEDEMAN had no speed and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no response. WISE CHANCE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor.

Footnotes
HILLTOP HARMONY set the pace, took command on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. CLASSY SCARLETT was
unhurried early and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. COURT REPORTER showed
no speed and trailed the field on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. REBEL LIONESS was settled off the pace and
roused on the far turn but had no impact. PASTURE CURFEW was up close and hustled along on the far turn but dropped back though the stretch.

turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. PRINCESS MORO was well back and saved ground on the far turn but from the four path at
the top of the stretch needed more. MYSTERY DAY was unhurried early and moved up on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled
off. STORMY SUZIE was away alertly, in tight on the far turn and was bumped at the top of the stretch. SILENT CHARITY was off slow and a factor on the
far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. NEW YORK MINT was off the pace, raced evenly on the far turn and checked at the top of
the stretch. MOON ROVER set the pace but was headed on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. A CLAIM OF

Footnotes
RED FROG was away alertly and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. TIME TO DANCE was
in range and a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. DOCTOR UPTOWN was in touch, roused on
the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. UPLIFTING SPIRIT was hustled early but chased on the turn and from the three
path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. ATTILIO had no speed and showed little while outrun. SPARKISH was off the pace and saved ground on the
turn in a dull effort.

Footnotes
I HAVE FEELINGS set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win.
GIOVANNA PONTI was in range, roused on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch just missed. WRITTEN showed speed from the
inside, dueled on the far turn and held show. SHEZTENTHEHARDWAY was in touch, saved ground on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the
stretch finished evenly. HUSH BUFFY was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more.
EXPRESS BANKING stalked the early leaders and was a factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. SECRETARIATS
HONOR tracked the leaders from the outside and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. JACK'S
MEMORY was unhurried early and hustled along on the far turn but was not a factor. SPEEDING STARLET was well back and showed little in a dull effort.
TRULY HONOURED had no speed, chased on the far turn and was empty.
