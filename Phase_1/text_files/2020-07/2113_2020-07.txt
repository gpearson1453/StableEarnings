Footnotes
GUCCISSIMO broke awkwardly, rushed to contention five wide before a half, prompted the pace, was bumped entering the stretch, gained a slight lead
before the furlong marker, drifted out and just lasted under a strong hand ride. WYATTS WARRIOR slow early, closed with a rush in the middle of the
racetrack through the stretch and just missed getting up in time. OBIWAN had speed from the start, split horses four wide to make the lead after a half,
drifted out while setting the pace into the stretch bumping the winner and was outfinished in the final stages. MY FRIEND BUDDY bore in at the start
bumping rivals, prompted the pace three wide then inside into the far turn and faded. IRIE ISLAND MAN was no factor. STARSHIP FONZY was bounced
around and pinched back at the start then failed to reach contention. TRAP away alertly, set a pressure pace for a little over a half, checked along the rail
entering the far turn and dropped out of it. YESUS STAR was bumped hard at the start and forced out into rivals then had brief speed. WINWITHJIMMY
also bumped then squeezed at the start, prompted the pace two wide and was through after a half. PRINCESS POWER bore out badly bumping rivals at
the start, checked near the inside inside on heels near the six furlong marker, had speed for a half thenb stopped.

Footnotes
UMAMI vied for the lead five wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead nearing the furlong marker and proved best in stretch long drive. A
PERFECT SKY stalked the pace along the inside, dug in late and gamely gained second. ANSWER QUIETLY rushed to lead along the rail past the half
mile marker, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the four path, battled with the winner until deep stretch then was outfinished. RIO BO never far back,
closed a gap late in the six path. SHACK'S HAREM pressed the pace two then three wide for a half then faded. A FABULOUS KISS failed to menace.
PUNAHELE was no factor. RUBY TWO SHOES had good early speed four then five wide but failed to respond. LAISSEZ FAIRE set the early pace two
wide and was through after a half. WILD TILLIE had brief speed.

Footnotes
SURE SHE'S GRAND was hustled and put to the whip along the rail soon after the start, checked entering the clubhouse turn while in tight, remained a
forward factor, checked again behind the top pair entering the far turn, waited, altered course to the six path at the furlong marker then closed with a burst of
speed to make the lead in deep stretch and drew off. PURDY BIRDIE away alertly, set the pace into the stretch, the rider lost his whip at the three
sixteenths pole, remained in command until the final stages then was no match for the winner but gamely held on for second. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY
stalked the pace four wide for five furlongs, drew to the leader two wide nearing the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch, drifted out nearing the wire and
missed second. DAWNMINO vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then faded. ORBITAL FLAG pressed the pace two wide into the second turn then
weakened. WICKED LOVE was no factor. TORMENTA DE ORO was outrun. GENTLE KISS was no threat. STURN DONNA had brief speed.

REMEMBER THE STORM hopped at the start and trailed early, circled rivals four wide on the turn and into the stretch, made the lead past the furlong
marker and drew off under mild urging. LONESOME PHIL stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch, set
the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. NILO E C settled inside, angled out entering the stretch and had a mild late rally in the five
path. JUMPED BAIL dueled for the lead tow wide into the stretch then weakened. CATS VALENTINE failed to menace. THE PAPER WAZOO battled for the
lead along the inside into the stretch then gave way. LAST CRUSADER bobbled outward start and had brief speed.

Footnotes
MARKET SUCCESS allowed to settle, circled rivals five wide on the far turn and through upper stretch, made the lead and drew clear to win in hand.
SWEETALKINGJUSTICE unhurried early, loomed boldly three wide while splitting horses into the stretch then finished second best. JEZABEL'S CHARM
chased the pace near the inside, shifted out at drew on even terms for the lead four wide at the top of the stretch then was outfinished. JETTIN PEGASUS
chased the early pace, rallied two wide to make the lead after a half, battled into the stretch then came up empty. GIFT FROM MOM sprinted to a daylight
lead soon after the start, set the pace for a little over a half,gave up the advantage briefly, regained the lead before six furlongs, dueled into the stretch then
tired. UCANTKEEPUP hopped hitting the gate and bobbled at the start then was no threat. SEEKING A JEWEL was no factor.
