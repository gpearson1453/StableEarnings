Footnotes
TACTICAL PRIORITY broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace inside, continued to show the way through the turn, shook clear when straightened for
home, remained clear to the wire under steady handling. THE DEVILS BACK moved up to chase the winner early, crept a bit closer to pressure that rival
from the outside through the turn, proved no match in the drive while drifting out a bit, all out to hold the place. OUACHITA void of early speed, came in the
two path for the drive, rallied between rivals and finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. EATORBEEATEN off the early pace and the inside,
came three wide into the stretch, bothered slightly when the runner up drifted out a bit approaching the furlong grounds, caught late for the show.
MIDNIGHT BAYOU in mid pack for three furlongs, had little for the drive. LA CLEVER within striking distance early, was four wide out of the turn, tired in the
drive.

Footnotes
REDDY TO BET forwardly placed from the start while inside, advanced and challenged along the rail turning for home, edged clear past the furlong marker
and slowly increased that advantage to the wire while under steady handling. RIDE TO THE WIRE away in good order, dueled up front closest to but not on
the inside, allowed the winner the rail turning for home, could not match strides with that one, drifted and came out a bit late, held the place. I RATE FIRST
dueled up front outside the runner up, also could not keep up with the winner through the stretch, floated out by RIDE TO THE WIRE inside the furlong
marker, outkicked for the place by that same rival, lasted for the show. BEAUTY BOY last to leave, remained back for three furlongs while four out to five
wide late in the turn, rallied down the center of the strip to be gaining for the show. BEAUBOUEF settled in the second flight while three wide through the
turn, came up empty for the stretch run. BLACK JUSTICE in a bit tight at the start, lacked speed, failed to muster a bid when called on for the drive. IM THE
BEST I KNOW also in some tight quarters at the start, four wide through the turn when well off the pace, failed to muster a kick in the drive.
LOOKINGFORROSES broke out, raced in mid pack for three furlongs, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
GEMODIXIE back off the pace and the inside, swung four wide into the stretch, made a steady advance while remaining well out in the strip to be up in time.
FANCY MALLORY in the second flight while inside the winner, roused for the drive, could not keep up with that rival late, in a bit tight at the wire, up for the
place. WILDLY GRAND took command soon after the start, set the pace toward the inside, shook clear in the turn, continued to maintain a daylight
advantage past the furlong marker, lugged out under a brisk left handed stick late, faltered to be caught in the final strides. MARQUEE MOMENT settled off
the pace and the inside, continued back off the pace into the lane, lacked a closing punch. THAT'S A SONG reluctant to load, was off a step slow, raced
back in trailing, widest in the drive, some late interest while too late. QUIET TRIP lacked early foot, failed to menace. JOE G'S PAYBACK forwardly placed
along the inside, faded.

Footnotes
TOTALLY GRACE in the second flight for three furlongs outside, advanced into the stretch, drifted slightly when challenging inside the furlong marker,
edged clear then held the runner up safe late under steady handling. INAWIC broke with the leaders, bothered slightly late backstretch, fell back into the
turn, four wide through the bend, continued well wide into the lane, rallied willingly through traffic to split foes late and be getting to the winner. STEPH'S
SPIRIT broke back, quickly moved up to race in the second flight and inside the winner, failed to match strides with that one through the lane, up late for the
show. MA CHER AMIO broke well, chased the leader off the inside, moved out a bit for the drive, closer inside the furlong marker, flattened, nipped late for
the show. GLORYS LEIDY BELLA bothered then steadied at the start to be last away, continued to lack speed the middle part, improved position in the
drive. LOUISIANA'S HOPE away in good order, sprinted well clear, continued to hold a sizable advantage through the turn, drifted out when beginning to
tire past the furlong marker, continued to faltered when headed soon after. BODIE ON POINTE bumped at the start, moved out late backstretch to slightly
bother the runnerup, continued outside, lacked a closing kick in the drive. SHOP AROUND bumped at the start, failed to menace. SMART SHELLEY off
slow, trailed far back.

Footnotes
PEACOCK KITTEN forwardly placed into the first turn while saving ground, moved up the rail to duel the middle half, disposed of the other speed turning for
home, remained clear to the wire under steady handling. KINGDOM WAY void of speed for five furlongs, steered out then was fanned five wide into the
lane, finished willingly to be slowly closing the gap on the winner late. DREWPOWER four wide into the first turn when with the leaders, continued to stalk
the pace while racing outside, three wide through the final turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive to finish best of the rest. VICTOR LOUNGE
(IRE) lacked early foot, asked along turning for home, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve position a bit in the late going. ROSSLARE
HARBOUR showed the way into the first turn, dueled in the two path up the backstretch and through the second turn, gaveawy in the drive. ZYPTO settled
in mid pack for six furlongs, had nothing for the drive. ROYAL ROCKET tired while four wide exiting the final turn.

Footnotes
SHE'S A FAIR CATCH broke in mid pack, raced in the second flight inside, continued to save ground when beginning to advance turn, got through into the
lane, finished with good resolve up the rail to be in time. SALT LIFE ANGEL broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, got clear into and through the
turn off the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner while allowing that one the rail late,
remained well clear of the others. SUDDEN AFLEET broke back, continued to lack speed, came five wide out of the turn, staged a belated rally down the
middle of the strip to be in time for the show. CABO SUNSET broke with the pack, settled off the pace and the inside, three wide turn, continued one paced
through the stretch, caught late for the show. MISSGREELEY'SSONG last to leave, raced back, came four wide out of the turn, improved position, not
enough for the show. SPANISH EXCHANGE in the main body while racing off the inside, proceeded three wide through the turn, improved a bit in upper
stretch then proceeded to finish up evenly. PEACH'S SWAN SONG forwardly placed in the early going off the inside, faded. AMANDASCHIME was finished
before a half. SWEET KARMA pressured the runner up early off the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. GIDDY UP GEAUX trailed throughout in
showing little.

Footnotes
HAVINFUNYET in the second flight while four wide into the first turn, continued back and off the inside, traffic turning for home in the three path, set down
when clear, closed with good resolve to be up at the wire in a well judged effort. LEFTHOOFRIGHTLEFT with the pace off the inside, continued to press the
issue the middle half mile, took over in the second turn, well clear with a furlong remaining, could not contain the winner while holding sway for the place at
the wire. MY LITTLE PRINCESS lacked early foot, continued back far turn, waited behind traffic late in that bend, got clear for the drive, finished willingly up
the rail to garner the show. ZAO'S DREAMS settled off the pace and the inside, steered out in mid pack to be three wide into the straight, showed some mild
late interest to improve a bit late. CONFORMATION broke on top to set the early pace, dueled up the backstretch inside the runner up, continued on equal
terms with that one final turn, weakened in the drive. FETCHING FURY within striking distance for six furlongs, gave way in the drive. STORMIN
CHARLOTTE in the second flight while three wide and inside the winner through the first turn, raced four wide through the second turn, came up empty for
the drive. STAR FORMULA fell back, was never a threat. SALUTE ELLE forwardly placed for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
FREE INDEED broke alertly, was clear out of the chute, given a breather through the turn, maintained a daylight advantage through the lane while under
steady handling. NATEALYZE in the main group while along the inside, continued to save ground while improving into the stretch, proved no match for the
winner in the drive, clear of the others. SONG N A CAT away in good order, chased the winner off the inside, proved no match for that one in the drive,
could not contain the runner up, saved the show. LOUISIANA HERO bobbled slightly at the start to be last away, continued to lack speed, came five wide
into the stretch, some interest midstretch before flattening out late. HERMANO T K within striking distance while racing in the three path for a half, came up
empty for the stretch run. IZZY'S BABY BOY was never dangerous while racing three wide. TEN SILVER PINS trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
RUNNING ROSADO in the second flight while racing three wide, tracked the leader the middle half while remaining off the inside, took over turning for
home, held late. DORI'S BIRDIES off a step slow, raced back, moved out, five wide into the far turn when beginning to advance, brushed with
ORTHODRIVE as that one was checking up in traffic midway on the second bend, continued in the five path into the lane, roused, drifted, finished up
willingly to be getting to the winner late. THINKING OF HER lacked speed, improved inside of traffic in the second turn, moved out a bit for the drive, closest
to the winner a furlong out, flattened out a bit late to be caught for the place. LAURALEE COCODREE headed up the second flight early, fell back in the run
up the backstretch, briefly moved a bit closer with a rebid in the second turn, weakened. CATBALEE void of early foot, improved inside of some traffic
second turn, flattened out a bit in the final furlong. G G HAS A SHOT four wide into the first turn, settled in mid pack, three wide through the second turn,
came up empty for the drive. UNMENTIONABLE broke sharp, sprinted well clear, continued to set the pace, faltered when headed by the winner turning for
home. ORTHODRIVE settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide into the far turn, appeared to come out slightly in some traffic midway on the second turn,
checked up briefly, fell back and did not recover. FLOATIE was finished after a half. BULLETSANDBOURBON in the second group early, stopped after a
half. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE RUN THROUGH THE SECOND TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER
ORTHODRIVE AGAINST DORI'S BIRDIES FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE SECOND TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.
