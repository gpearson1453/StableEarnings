Footnotes
FAUCI dueled for the lead inside of PETIT VERDOT early on, inched away from that foe in upper stretch, then held sway from UNITEDANDRESOLUTE
under driving pressure through the late stages. UNITEDANDRESOLUTE saved ground while midpack into the turn, commenced a rally by splitting foes two
wide at the five sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path turning for home, but was herded out by GYPSY KING at the three sixteenths pole, recovered and
rallied to loom large approaching the furlong pole, but did not have enough to catch the leader and was denied by that foe through the late stages.
RUSTLER stalked from along the inside, came into the lane behind the leaders while under a drive, was blocked when trying to shift to the three path to split
horses approaching the furlong pole, altered course to the five path passing that marker, then kept on to secure show. HABITUS was off a few lengths
slowly, raced far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, then rallied willingly through the lane outside of rivals to miss show. PETIT
VERDOT sparred with the eventual winner from the outside early on, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and yielded late. GYPSY KING
prompted the leading duelers from the three path, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader in upper stretch, drifted out at the three sixteenths pole, then
weakened in the late stages. INCITATUS saved ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail. KING UHTRED saved ground while far off of the pace, but
was no factor. OUR COMMISH tracked from midpack in the four path, but was outmoved by UNITEDANDRESOLUTE passing the five sixteenths pole, and
subsequently weakened. SUPER STOCK tracked from midpack in the three path early on, but weakened into the turn. FROSTED PRAYER was forwardly
placed two wide and between horses, but was outmoved and weakened at the five sixteenths pole. KOBE B was off multiple lengths behind the field, and
was always outurn.

Footnotes
JEWELED PRINCESS tracked the leading group from midpack, shifted to the four path and outside of those rivals down the backstretch, inched forward into
the far turn and made a three wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with inner game rivals in upper stretch before forging a lead at the
furlong pole, then cleared off in the late stages. MALIBU ANTHEM stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail around the far turn to make a two wide bid
between horses at the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick to split those rivals in upper stretch, got outkicked by her outer foe, then kept on to surpass her
inner foe for place approaching the wire. THOMASVILLE set a moderate pace along the inside, dug in inside of a pair of rivals turning for home, held an
advantage to the furlong pole, but was headed there after shifting in from rider correction, and was outfinished for place in the closing stages. MY BETS
trailed early on, took both turns in the three to four path, then stayed on mildly through the lane without threatening. MALIBU MARLEE prompted the pace
three wide, then two wide between horses into the far turn as JEWELED PRINCESS moved along side, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
FLASHING RED was forwardly placed two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those rivals into the far turn, and faded. PRETTI XTREME
saved ground while far off of the pace, but never got involved. TETRAHYDRO bobbled a bit at the start, took the first turn in the four to three path, and never
played a factor.

HOLLY BLAME settled off of the pace early on, advanced in the four path and outside of rivals into the turn, sustained his rally through the lane, and wore
down the loose leader at the wire. MO'S MOJO dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, assumed command passing the five sixteenths
pole after putting away his inner counterpart, built a clear advantage and held that margin inside the final furlong, but was tested late and got nailed on the
wire. COLTONATOR trailed by a distance down the backstretch, shifted to the five path turning for home, then rallied belatedly and was gaining on the
leaders late, but ran out of ground. PYRON stalked in the two path behind the dueling leaders early on, came into the lane in the three path, but lacked a
kick between horses to make a bid, then got outfinished by outer rivals. HOP KAT saved ground from midpack around the turn, shifted two wide in upper
stretch, then stayed on mildly inside of foes through the lane, but failed to threaten. ATMOS dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but weakened at the
five sixteenths pole and subsequently faded. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER vied for the lead three wide outside of the dueling leaders, but failed to keep pace
with then into the turn, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
EMBELLISHER established a clear advantage early on, held his margin through the turns, then widened his advantage in upper stretch under a mild drive,
and was ridden out to the wire. QUARTERBACK DAK was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted off of the rail at the half mile pole, stalked three wide
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch while making a bid for place, and prevailed over an inner game foe for the
position under a long drive through the lane. URBANITE saved ground while far off a pace, squeezed through a narrow opening along the rail at the five
sixteenths pole, gained ground by saving it turning for home to produce a place bid inside of rivals in upper stretch, dueled gamely for that position through
the lane, but was outfinished in the late stages. BAHAMA CHANNEL tracked from midpack two wide, took the far turn in the three to four path, but failed to
produce a bid before staying on for a minor reward. GEMO RAIN pressed the pace setter from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that rival turning for
home, and weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. STEALTH was off slowly, raced far off of the pace in the three path around the turns, but
got rank behind rivals at the five sixteenths pole, steadied slightly, swung to the six path turning for home, then stayed on mildly without threatening.
TAPAGE tracked from midpack in the four path through the first turn, but was floated to the five path around the far turn, was green switching leads in upper
stretch while far off of the pace, and subsequently weakened. TIZ MCNAMARA was forwardly placed three wide, but weakened between horses four wide at
the five sixteenths pole. REVENIO broke outwards and bumped a foe, trailed early on, improved along the inside into the far turn, but waited behind traffic at
the five sixteenths pole, then failed to factor through the lane. DREAMS OF YVONNE saved ground in midpack around the first turn, advanced to stalking
position along the inside at the half mile pole, but weakened two wide and between horses into the far turn. JIMMIE T was bumped at the start, raced far off
of the pace in the five to six path around the turns, and never got involved.

Footnotes
MILITARIST was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, swept past the leaders and drew
away in the final stages. MUD PIE was bothered at the start and raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was up for
place in the final stages and finished willingly but no match for the winner. PINE KNOLL came in at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path
into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive and lost place. ALFONS WALDE (IRE) raced back early on, was off the rail into the
lane and moved up in the stretch run. KING OF FORTUNE was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane, lugged in
during the upper stretch, altered back out and improved position late in the drive. EXULT stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and
faded late in the stretch drive. PINTXOS tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and empty late in the stretch. ALL ABOUT WILL was never a
threat. CONTRACTOR BILL was bumped at the start, set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and folded up in the stretch. ALLEGE was never
involved. OBIWAN was through after three quarters. CHOCOLATE BAR was through after a half.
