JUSTATAPIN stalked, edged clear leaving the turn and held sway in the stretch. SIERRA SUMMER settled well, improved on the turn and stayed on in the
stretch. DIXIE NATION bumped at the start, moved closer on the turn and lacked the needed kick. TRIPLE ENTENDRE broke outwardly bothering DIXIE
NATION, was outrun and finished with late energy. UNEXPECTED STORM gained the early lead, was headed on the turn and gave way. CLEARLY
CLASSY dropped back early.
