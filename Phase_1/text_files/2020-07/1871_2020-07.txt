SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS got away a step slowly but moved up to stalked the pace, pressed the leader on the backstretch and moved outside EZME'SGIRL
approaching the turn, had command quickly and drew clear, turned back SHOW ME THE PRIZE late turn and held sway under light handling. SHOW ME
THE PRIZE broke outward and settled in mid pack, closed up and stalked on the far turn, took a three-wide run at the leader approaching the stretch, could
not get up and chased to the end. MUNCH AND CRUNCH, away slowly and off the early pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but never reached
contention. EZME'SGIRL led early, set a reserved pace, was pressured late on the backstretch and was engaged at the turn, was quickly headed and gave
way gradually. COURT TIME, off slowly, settled in mid pack, dropped back under a ride on the far turn and lacked a rally. TRIPLE SEVENS raced from off
the pace, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the far turn but tired at the top of the stretch.

ALKELINE stalked the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide late turn, bid between foes upper stretch and drove clear. CLOSE IMAGE, at the rear of the
pace in the early going, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. SOEXOTIC pressed the leader in the early
running, closed up and forced the issue on the backstretch, chased two and three-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch but was outkicked and gave up
place in the late stages. DESERT POEM, off slowly and at the rear of the pace early, saved ground, angled out leaving the far turn, showed some interest in
the stretch but failed to menace. BELLA FIGURA set a pressured pace, quickened on the far turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way. CAPOEIRA got
off slowly but settled in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
PIERIAN broke slowly, stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, bid near mid stretch and drew clear finishing under a hand
ride. SHOWBIZ LADY moved up to force the pace, bid early turn, dueled, shook clear upper stretch but was passed in the late stages. WUK UP QUEEN got
away slowly, raced in mid pack, closed fast angling from two to four-wide through the turn then finished gamely in vain. FOREST AT DAWN settled off the
pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn and although unable to menace closed with interest through stretch. ELI'S FORTUNE led quickly, dueled on the
turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way gradually. ONEZY'S DREAM raced from off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn then closed
mildly through the stretch. ECHO LOCATION, off slowly, stalked the pace, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally. SENORITA UNO raced from off the
pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

I AM I SAID bumped with DON'T SMILE LILAH leaving the gate then was pinched back, settled in mid pack, closed two-wide then on the rail on the turn, led
near mid stretch and edged clear under a drive. TANGO DANCER raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn, angled out in the stretch
and rallied outside. SHISHKA stalked the pace, chased four-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. KRZ SOCIETY got away slowly,
stalked the pace, raced three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. SOUP DU JOUR forced the issue, chased two-wide on the
turn, failed with a determined bid upper stretch but was still game to the end. DON'T SMILE LILAH, bumped at the start, showed a quick turn of speed and
set a pressured pace, shook clear into the turn, was all out into the stretch but yielded with a 16th to run. CICIBONNE bobbled just out, trailed the field, was
eased at the top of the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

NIGHT WATCHMAN, in range, closed angling from the rail to three-wide late on the final turn, took command a furlong out and drove clear. LEONARD'S
BAY raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, rallied and got up late for place. TISHINA settled in mid pack, closed late
backstretch, had a short lead three-wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch but was passed but the winner with a furlong to run. CONQUEST ELIMINATR
was prominent from the outset, dueling then stalking, rebid early backstretch but outside COOL GIZMO, forced the issue on the far turn, dueled into the
stretch, was passed a furlong out and gave way. COOL GIZMO dueled early and took command midway through the first turn, dueled on the backstretch,
was headed by TISHINA at the turn and gave way after a brief chased and tired. GIANT MINE, off slowly, settled in mid pack, closed late backstretch, was
hustled four-wide on the far turn but lacked a rally. DUPES, always at the back of the pack, trailed on the backstretch, was hustled on the far turn but failed
to menace.

HITTERS PARK raced in striking range, moved from the rail to the second path late turn, challenged nearing the final 16th and drove clear. SALIERI led
early, moved clear and to the rail near the turn, set the pace then was all out in the stretch but failed to contain the winner in the late stages.
RECONFIGURE settled at the rear of the pack, came three to five-wide through the turn then rallied gamely. MAS CHIKILIN settled early at the back of the
pack, raced two and three-wide on the turn then closed belatedly. ALICIA'S KID, in range, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but
