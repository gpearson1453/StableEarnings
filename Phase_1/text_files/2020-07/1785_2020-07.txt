Footnotes
STIVA sprinted to the early lead, set a clear pace off the rail and was kept under pressure in the drive. WHO U GONNA CALL chased the winner throughout
in a game effort. STATED saved ground the far turn, swung outside in upper stretch and rallied. ANNIE BOO BOO , well placed inside horses to the stretch,
failed to rally. EYE OF THE WILDCAT hugged the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired foes. HEY MABEL circled horses on the far turn and failed to be
a factor. PRINCESS GEORGIA , fractious in the starting gate, failed to rally. GRAND BANKS was outrun. WICKED T lost ground on the turns and
weakened. KEENEASABEAN , three wide the first turn, chased the pace and faltered.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC REASON chased between rivals, advanced five wide into the lane, gained a slim lead to the inside of SILENT MALICE in mid stretch, dueled with
that one from there and dug in tenaciously under left handed rousing to prove best. SILENT MALICE , off slow when hopping at the break, recovered and
raced outside rivals while off the pace, circled six wide advancing into the lane, battled outside the winner through the final furlong, switched to his left lead
late and hung. SUPER HOUDINI , off the pace while saving some ground, was under a hearty ride mid turn, eased out to advance into the lane, steadied off
heels, angled out and continued on with interest. FIRECALL got involved in a duel while saving ground past the three quarter pole, gained a short lead into
the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded late. VALUED NOTION , off slowly, was keen to go and pulled his way forward between runners, stalked
the duelers around the turn, bid three deep approaching the stretch, lugged in past the quarter pole and gave way. GOT YOU BEAT , away well, dueled
outside FIRECALL, held a short advantage past the three eighths, ceded command soon into the lane then tired through the final three sixteenths. DA
MONEY , in close at the break, saved ground and faltered.

Footnotes
TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY worked in the two path between horses on the turn, came out bumping with GO AMANDA when forced to alter course outside
RAPIDASHQUEEN when that one drifted out entering the stretch, closed on her left lead and was up late. HALFINTHEWRAPPER set a pressured pace
along the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch and faded late. GO AMANDA bumped with POLISHED COPPER soon after the break, moved up outside the
winner leaving the turn, bumped with that one in upper stretch and flattened out. POLISHED COPPER bumped with GO AMANDA soon after the break,
circled the turn three wide, drifted out in upper stretch and passed tired horses. ZIG prompted the pace and weakened. LUCKY NINETY NINE saved ground
around the turn and weakened. RAPIDASHQUEEN , two wide on the turn chasing the pace, drifted out in front of the winner entering the stretch then
weakened. Objections by the rider and trainer of GO AMANDA against TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY for alleged interference turning for home were not allowed.

Footnotes
PADRINO'S HEART had speed to the inside of ZIGGY MON, rated back off of that one nearing the turn and stalked inside rivals, eased out for room in
upper stretch, closed in under a drive, moved to command about a sixteenth out and eagerly drew clear. ZIGGY MON sped to the front and handled some
outside pressure, moved clear around the turn, set the pace two wide into the lane, ceded near the sixteenth marker but kept on willingly to the line. HAY
BOY , bumped at the break, raced four wide early, edged up between runners mid turn, chased into the stretch but went evenly late. RAILMASTER , four
wide outside rivals mid turn, pursued into the lane then faded in the final furlong. OHANZEE , stumbled and bumped at the break, found himself well back
into the turn, saved some ground while under a ride into the lane but failed to make a serious recovery. BEAR TREASURE , off the pace while saving some
ground, swung out in upper stretch and failed to menace. BY THE SEY SHORE lacked speed, raced five wide for the drive and failed to respond.
FAREWELL TIME broke a step slow, rushed up between foes, pressed three wide into the turn then tired past the three eighths.

FORTUNATE FRIENDS prompted the pace outside ROMANOFF, dropped back a bit under pressure past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the
lane, came back under right handed rousing, reeled in ABSENTEE heading towards the sixteenth marker, kicked clear and held firm under a drive. HALL
PASS angled out leaving the chute, lagged outside a rival, gathered some steam mid turn, swung six wide into the stretch, straightened and finished well.
ABSENTEE tracked the leaders three wide, quick bid mid turn, took over approaching the stretch, spurted clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths,
could not contain the winner, faded and just lasted for the show. CERULEAN SPRINGS , off the pace while saving some ground, angled out for the drive
and finished with good energy between runners. BOBBY G settled in the clear early on, came under a ride mid turn, circled five wide, made a bit of a run in
mid stretch then flattened out. MOONLIGHT SHADOW , unhurried early, dropped in towards the half mile marker, swung very wide into the lane and had
belated interest. ROMANOFF sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure mid turn, was headed with a quarter to go then faded in the final
furlong. SEANY P pulled his way forward while saving ground past the five eighths, stalked past the three eighths, eased out for the drive and faded.

Footnotes
SAMUI SUNSET hesitated at the break, moved up in the three path leaving the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, closed outside horses and
took the lead late. YES MEANS NO circled the far turn four wide, floated to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. EJE GAMA prompted the
pace outside EMBRACE THE GRIND, drifted out when challenging for the lead near the eighth pole then weakened. SECOND ENCORE , a forward factor
along the rail, altered course when encountering traffic behind EJE GAMA in mid stretch then flattened out. EMBRACE THE GRIND , clear entering the first
turn, angled in, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. FLUSHED lacked speed, circled foes on the turn, was well wide turning for
home and passed tired horse. DAPER'S DRINK chased the pace three wide around the far turn and gave way in the drive. REALLY FELIX was not a factor.
NITE TRIPPER hugged the inner rail around the far turn and lacked a rally. BOB'S GLORY chased the pace, raced in the two path the far turn and gave
way. KING PACAY drifted wide entering the first turn and was not a factor. TRUE CALLING dropped back on the far turn.

Footnotes
GRATEFUL BRED , unruly pre race, broke a bit slow but quickly recovered and sped to the lead to the inside of a rival, handled some outside pressure
before going clear under rating into the turn, opened up after being put to solid hand pressure in upper stretch, wandered out some in the final furlong but
proved clearly best under a steady hand ride. FIRST LAW settled off the rail while not far back early on, raced in the clear heading towards mid turn, angled
five wide approaching the stretch, straightened and closed willingly to just nab the place. JOSEF IS REAL edged up inside and rated forwardly, steadied
awaiting room mid turn, got through to advance past mid stretch then hung a bit late. OUR DESTINY had speed and prompted the pace outside the winner,
gave willing chase as that one got away past the three sixteenths, kept on with effort inside the sixteenth pole but was out finished between rivals.
DESHACKLED dropped in early, was under rating leaving the far turn, raced three wide into the lane, shifted back in and had a mild kick. FLANK SPEED
chased three wide and faded. THE CAIRO KID stalked outside rivals, was under pressure in upper stretch and faded. PERCENTAGE , sluggish early on,
raced five wide into the lane and lacked a bid. JESTFUL failed to menace. JAMAKIN ME RUN flashed speed, angled in around the turn and weakened.

JENNEMILY prompted the pace outside ARTFUL SPLATTER, wrested command in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch and prevailed under urging.
INDY UNION bumped with THREE HAWK leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and rallied
inside horses. THREE HAWK bumped with INDY UNION leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch
and lacked the needed rally in an even finish. UJJAYI , two wide between horses on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally in an
even effort. ARTFUL SPLATTER set the pace along the rail and gave way in upper stretch. AFLEET DESTINY , three deep on the turn, failed to rally.
MONEY FROMHEAVEN was not a factor.

Footnotes
NICK PAPAGIORGIO edged up outside rivals and gained a stalking spot three wide into the backstretch, took closer order leaving the far turn, bid to
engage CAN HE SHINE into the lane, drew alongside with a furlong to go, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged away a bit late under a stiff drive.
CAN HE SHINE drew clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was confronted in upper stretch, battled past the furlong grounds, gave way grudgingly
and just saved the place. MCELMORE AVENUE , four wide within range, was under pressure around the final turn and closed steadily. BENNY HAVENS
had speed to the inside of foes, was shuffled back heading to the first turn, regrouped and was taken to rate while saving ground, angled out nearing the
quarter pole, split rivals in mid stretch then finished up with decent energy between foes. ELEMENTARY settled off the pace and off the inside, raced
between rivals leaving the far turn but lacked a solid response. BOWSPRIT saved ground, edged up nearing the far turn, chased into the lane and faded.
STAND MY GROUND settled well back, moved up two wide approaching the lane, angled out and churned on in the drive. EARNED IT , four wide past the
seven eighths marker, continued well wide but came up empty. BAY BRIDGE settled back off the pace and failed to menace. THE POSER , off the pace
while saving ground into the far turn, was not a factor. GOLAZO moved up between runners nearing the first turn, stalked two wide, was under heavy
pressure past the five sixteenths and gave way. THREETHEHARDWAY , between foes early angled out and lost ground five wide, moved up nearing the far
turn, chased around the final turn then weakened.
