Footnotes
DESHA unhurried early from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a forward position entering the drive, responded when asked and
inched away late. CANDIZAR forced the early pace from the inside, held a forward position entering the second turn, responded but was no match late while
holding the plac. MY BEST SHOT broke sharp from the outside, gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, dueled through the second
turn, remained engaged through the drive, drifted in at the eighth pole bothering MISTER INTUITION then just lasted for the show. After a Stewards' Inquiry
and Jockey's Objection MY BEST SHOT was disqualified for interference at the eighth pole. MISTER INTUITION well placed from the inside, reached a
striking position entering the drive, responded along the rail, was bothered at the eighth pole then went evenly late. AL TAWEEL was never a factor.
BUNYAN'S AXE flashed early speed and faded.
