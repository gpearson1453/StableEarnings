ELI'S FORTUNE showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch was kept to task. KINZUA stalked the
leader, was a factor on the turn and had a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch but was all out. MISS PATRIOT was in touch and raced evenly on
the turn but had no late kick. WISE CHANCE was in range and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
CONFLATION was unhurried early, showed nothing and was outdistanced.

ROCKBARTON set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch proved best. CHARLIE'S GAME was in touch, raced evenly on
the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. CHILLING SECRET stalked the early leader and was a factor on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. KEEP GOING was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and was up for a share. JUDITHS
COUGAR was unhurried early and gained ground on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch flattened out. HARMONY HALL had no speed
and showed little in a dull effort. SPINOS was in range but lost ground on the far turn and had nothing left. MOCAL settled off the pace and had a mild gain
on the far turn but came up empty.

Footnotes
KAIGUN was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch fought gamely for the win. BOLD ANIMAUX stalked the leaders
from the inside, had a good position on the far turn and with the lead from the four path in mid stretch was outgunned. SEATTLE TREASURE forced the
pace, was a factor on the far turn and had the lead at the top of the stretch but failed to hold. PERLARANA was off the pace, raced evenly on the far turn
and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. TINKER RING was up close and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch was outfinished. CONQUEROR GALACTUS (IRE) had no speed and gained ground on the far turn but from the three path through the stretch
leveled off. J. C. INDY set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but dropped back through the stretch. MAX'S LAST was in mid pack early
but trailed the field on the turn and was empty.
