Footnotes
DESERT SWARM off a bit slow to begin then quickly spit foes to gain a clear lead, set the pace in the two path, kept off the rail exiting the turn, drifted in
some in upper stretch, then powered away under steady handling. ROSSMAN in range early, raced three deep then outside a rival, came four wide into the
stretch, could not make any impact on the winner but proved second best. ZIYANAIR broke well then dropped to the back of the pack, came four wide into
the lane and passed a tired rival for third. CHURCH OF MANY stalked outside a rival, a bit off the rail leaving the bend and weakened in the drive. DERBY
STAR bobbled sharply at the start, hustled and chased from the inside, came out on the turn and five wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
LITTLEBITAMEDAL stalked off the rail, swung five to six wide leaving the turn, came out a bit further in upper stretch, rallied widest and dug in late to
prevail. ITALIANO settled while wide early, traveled five deep into the stretch, rallied to the front mid-stretch, fought with the winner late and went gamely to
the wire. CAMBY four wide into the turn, four deep deap entering the lane, bid in upper stretch and held the show. ADENS DREAM bumped start, chased a
bit off the rail, between into the lane, bumped with MORE HONOR at the top of the stretch, and was edged for the show. MORE HONOR bumped both
sides at the start, raced three wide, bumped with rival at the top of the lane and flattened in the late stages. TREASURE HUNTER showed speed from the
inside to set the pace, challenged around the bend, fought back into the stretch and weakened. MASTER JUBA broke in and bumped rival, stalked outside
the leader, bid four wide on the turn and gave way in the final furlong.

AVA'S CHARM settled early, traveled five wide into the turn, six wide leaving, drifted inward in the stretch, moved clear and padded the lead under steady
handling. HOTITUDE sped to the front, cleared at the top of the lane, proved no match for the winner and held the place. ROADRUNNER'S HONOR went
three deep to the stretch and finished willingly. SAINTS PAYNTER stalked outside a rival, four then five wide around the turn, bothered by the winner in
upper stretch and kept on to the wire. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA prompted the pace from the outside, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. MORNING
ADDICTION off a bit slow to begin, traveled between rivals into the lane and failed to rally. INTO THE SOUTH settled early, traveled a bit off the rail through
the turn and proved no menace. MEAN SOPHIA chased a bit off the rail to the lane and weakened in the drive.

CLAYTON DELANEY set the pace a bit off the rail, led clear in the two path around the turn, inched away under a drive and held safely. ZERO DOWN went
three deep and betwen rivals into the lane, failed to summon the needed late punch to threaten the winner but proved second best. SCARY FAST SMILE
traveled a bit off the rail, came out in upper stretch and showed a mild rally to gain the show. ME MACHO up close early along the inside, held the rail into
the stretch, lacked a late bid and missed the show. MAMBA COOL chased between rivals to the lane and weakened. RAWHIDE RAWLINS off slow to
begin, chased four deep through the turn and into the lane and also weakened. PAPA'S HONEY traveled in the two path, drifted out in the stretch and failed
to rally. NAUGHTY CHILD away quickly flashed early speed, outpaced and dropped back around the turn and faded early.
