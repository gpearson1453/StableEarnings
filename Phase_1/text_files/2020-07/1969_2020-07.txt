Footnotes
WARRIOR'S DREAM , well placed near the front runner, passed that leader from the three path on the turn, drifted out and lugged in while under the whip
down the stretch but was clear for the win. CHRISTIANS CITY led off the rail to the turn, lost the lead but was stubborn to hold second against a rival.
VANDROSS bumped a rival hard at the start, was rank on the first turn at the rail, tracked the pace from inside, travelled along the three path on the far turn,
and fought a stubborn foe down the lane, settling for show. STACK EM HIGH stayed back, gained on the far turn in the five path, but flattened out while
improving position. LAGOON MACAROON was bumped hard at the start, stayed close up but faded in deep stretch. COMIN' ROUND raced back, moved
up wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
PRIVATE BEACH was the speed off the rail to the stretch, drifted out at the eighth pole bumping a challenger, drifted out and bumped that horse again
nearing the finish, and just lasted. EXTRA EFFORT was off slow, raced well off the pace, quickly shifted out for room nearing the far turn, rallied in the three
path, moved up to challenge the leader in the stretch, was bumped by that one at the eighth pole and again nearing the wire, and just missed. DESIGNING
raced mid pack, moved up to split horses on the turn, and gained the show spot late while finding more to hold aff a closer. BEAUTY DAY sat off the leaders
to the stretch, was moving well late but needed a bit more. I WAS LOOKING UP swerved out wide at the start, went wide on the first turn, was out in the
middle of the backstretch, came very wide into the stretch and drifted out while improving position. SCAPE was urged for more on the backstretch, drifted
out in the stretch and posed no threat. SHELLEY'S GEM pressed the leader and gave way late.After a steward's inquiry and objection by the rider of EXTRA
EFFORT against the rider of PRIVATE BEACH alledging interference in the stretch, the first place finisher was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
SWING WEST good outside speed to the front, led all calls and proved much the best through the stretch run. PLAYFUL HUNTER was very reluctant to
load, broke well and chased winner to no avail while holding the place spot late. CHILLIN OUT good position to the half, dropped back down the backstretch
and far turn but came again for show from outside. HEY RAY raced evenly with no response when needed in the drive. TIMING raced outside most of way
with no late kick. TEMPUS never a factor. HAPPY GO LUCKY had a wide trip and no threat. DIAMOND DREAMER was never close.Race was hand timed
and only the final available.

Footnotes
REDHOT KATIE led outside a foe early, got clear to move inside on the turn, dueled a foe down the stretch and was clear late for the win. VORTICES was
bumped at the start, prompted the leader early, backed off to track the lead, moved up to duel down the stretch but came up short in a game effort. LITTLE
MATILDA was well placed in third up the backstretch, chased the top pair in the five path on the far turn, then fought on with good energy late, though
unable to catch the leaders. TRAUMARAMA raced mid pack and held position throughout the race. PORTRAIT OF EMMA never threatened but held
position. HOLY COOKIE was slow away and no factor. MAJESTIC BOLD raced unhurried and tired in the stretch. The fractions for the race were
unavailable due to a timer malfunction but the final time is correct and timed electronically.

Footnotes
BRINK POINT broke slow, rallied to the turn, drove past in the stretch, came over when clear to hold sway to the wire. SPURS ADDICTION close to the
pace throughout, rallied and drove up rail for place spot late. TRUST AND OBEY good position to turn, rallied in the stretch, checked late and held the show
spot. KARAMEL CORN raced evenly with no late kick when needed well off rail. JACKSTRAW could not keep up to turn, settled into the stretch and moved
up late. WESTERN LOVE sharp speed to the front, led to stretch but faltered willingly in the lane. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR rushed between horses early
while used up and faded back from turn. VOLUME ON TAP was through early and dropped far back. R HOUDINI never menaced. After a stewards inquiry
and riders objection by TRUST AND OBEY, for interference in the stretch run the stewards took no action and results stayed as posted.
