Footnotes
COWGIRL KIMMIE rated on the outside, was five wide taking the bend, put to urging once straightened for the drive and swept past GHAALEB'S APPEAL
nearing the wire. GHAALEB'S APPEAL pressed SCARLET POSITION from just outside, was all out in the stretch, led briefly with less than seventy yards
left but was outfinished in a game try. SCARLET POSITION was sent to set a pressured pace from inside, battled through the lane to hold on but slowly
wore down through the waning yards. COUNTRY ASSETS was kept close toward the outside, four wide through the turn, began to yield upper stretch,
lugged in under right-handed pressure inside the furlong marker, was straightened and finished evenly. R U FORREAL in contention from inside from the
beginning, lacked the needed late bid. LIL BIT TIPSEY was hustled along to stay close between horses, came three wide into the lane, began to wear down,
was steadied when her path was taken inside the eighth pole and also finished evenly.

Footnotes
DIAMOND MAXIMUS settled off the early speed, waited for for just off the inside on the turn, got through three wide into the stretch, engaged the leaders
inside the last furlong and edged ahead late. BEEMIE AWARD contested the pace from outside, was two wide on the bend, moved ahead leaving the turn,
was challenged again from outside upper stretch, gradually drifted out the last furlong and was outfinished. STALLONE prominent from outside, advanced
three wide on the turn, vied for the lead in the lane, was gradually forced out the final furlong and lacked the needed late kick. B SALTY disputed the pace
from inside, began to wear down leaving the quarter pole and gradually angled out the final furlong. JUST RUN failed to menace in a wide trip.
RAMBLINGRUDYRAGS displayed brief speed between horses, did not keep up nearing the turn, angled to the outside and continued to fade. MIDNIGHT
JOKER showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
CREAL DREAMER broke on top and inward, bumped hard with HIDDEN FIGURE shortly after leaving the chute, was rated off PLACATI, roused leaving the
turn, swept past the latter with a sixteenth left and was drawing away. PLACATI forced into HIDDEN FIGURE at the start, soon recovered and sprinted to
the lead, did not have enough left the final furlong but was unchallenged for second. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE in contention early inside, did not stay with
the top pair on the bend but proved easily best of the others. HIDDEN FIGURE was bumped at the break and again by CREAL DREAMER after leaving the
chute, clipped the latter's heels, progressed between horses leaving the turn then leveled off. COUNTRY JO chased from midpack, was widest taking the
turn and had no late bid. MISS SWAMP TALES saved ground and was never a factor. POSITIONEDTOWIN showed little. The rider of HIDDEN FIGURE
lodged an objection claiming interference from CREAL DREAMER leaving the chute. After their review, the stewards disqualified CREAN DREAMER and
placed her fourth for that interference.

Footnotes
LADY WARRIOR broke on top, showed the way in hand staying off the inside, drifted out to path five entering the lane, responded to a steady drive and
held sway. WOOD NOT MIND reluctant to load, was settled early, gradually progressed on the backstretch, came into contention four wide leaving the
second turn, took over second midstretch then could only pull away for that position late. ALLEY 'O MALLEY pressed LADY WARRIOR from just outside
from the early going, was just off the inside entering the stretch and gradually wore down the final eighth. TAPNFIRE settled well off the early pace, was
three wide on the second bend, floated to the outside into the lane, rallied through the upper stretch, leveled off in the late going but was easily best of the
others. TOUR ON stumbled inward, starting a chain reaction of bumping, recovered to help press the pace, moved inside LADY WARRIOR on the
backstretch, gradually wore down after five furlongs, floated out into the stretch and continued to yield between rivals. WILDWOOD SCAT bumped and
forced into LADY FURBEIN at the break, gradually progressed from inside, came off the rail some for the stretch run and improved position without
threatening. DANCING HIGH bumped and forced into WILDWOOD SCAT at the start, chased from outside and failed to menace. REJOICE AN BE GLAD
moved to the inside early on and gave way after a half mile. LADY FURBEIN bumped at the start, steadily faded once on the backstretch, stayed well off the
inside taking the second turn and coasted through the lane.

Footnotes
CATANIA stalked the early speed, commenced her bid two wide on the turn, took over inside the last furlong and drew away under a mild drive.
COMMANDING MIDAS showed first and set a pressured pace inside rivals then gradually wore down the last furlong. BETTER ANGELS advanced along
the rail on the bend, angled out upper stretch, drifted out further nearing the eighth pole, was straightened, drifted out again inside the last furlong, was
corrected, lugged in late but was easily best of the rest. LADY DI pressed COMMANDING MIDAS from outside, did not keep up as she floated out some
through the bend then continued to gradually drift out as she tired through the lane. MUFFINS REVENGE dwelt at the break then only passed inside tired
ones through the stretch. TEMRIK chased from between horses, was two wide on the bend and had no late bid. PRINCESS MANDII four wide taking the
turn also lacked a stretch rally. RUNNING SCARED gave way from inside on the turn, angled out with two furlongs left and had little for the drive. B
APPRECIATIVE was bumped shortly after the break and showed little racing just off the rail. EQUALLY EVEN stumbled then bumped B APPRECIATIVE
shortly after the start and was never a factor.

Footnotes
YOU'RE KILLIN ME in contention early from outside, angled to the inside on the turn, waited for room leaving the bend, got through along the rail upper
stretch, rallied and edged ahead inside the last sixteenth. SUNNY'S STORM helped prompt the pace from between rivals, was four wide taking the bend,
edged ahead upper stretch but was outfinished in a game effort. GREAT SCAT prominent while toward the outside, lost ground five wide through the turn,
loomed a serious threat with a furlong left but leveled off instead. HELLOFAGUY without early speed, lost ground staying well off the inside through the turn,
angled outside GREAT SCAT upper stretch and found best stride too late. PEACOCK MAN pressed the early pacesetters, went for the lead three wide on
the bend then gradually wore down the final furlong. FORT RAMSEY disputed the pace inside horses from the start, came off the rail some at the top of the
lane and began to tire. SERIOUS TALK was an early factor from inside, faded on the turn, angled out some for the drive and failed to have a significant bid.
GREEN MEANS GO was hustled to vie for the lead outside FORT RAMSEY then began to tire between rivals with two furlongs to go.

Footnotes
PETEIZUM rated from outside, angled in to be two wide on the bend, moved out five wide for a clear path upper stretch, was all out and got up in time.
MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET advanced from inside on the turn, fanned out some entering the lane, was steadied when MUTAKDDIM ROAD angled in nearing
the eighth pole, altered in, boxed in behind the leader after that, forced his way out some in the waning yards and caught VIRGA for second. VIRGA kept
close, took over three wide on the turn, angled in leaving the bend, widened his lead upper stretch but began to wear down in the late going. TRUE TEN
vied for the early lead outside MUTAKDDIM ROAD, was overtaken from outside on the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, came again inside the
final furlong but was too late. AMAROQ was checked when his path was taken nearing the bend, weaved around traffic to advance on the bend and rallied
belatedly four wide in the stretch. MUTAKDDIM ROAD contested the pace from inside, was also overtaken on the turn, floated out into the lane, lugged in
some upper stretch and could not make up any ground in the late going. TABADDOL soon trailed angled out widest upper stretch and improved position
without threatening. SUMMER DISCO bumped and leaned on briefly at the start, chased from outside, swung out six wide for the stretch run and made up
ground belatedly the final furlong. INGE was not a factor in a ground-saving trip. GUARD YOUR GRILL stumbled outward, bumping SUMMER DISCO,
chased from between rivals then gave way after three furlongs.
