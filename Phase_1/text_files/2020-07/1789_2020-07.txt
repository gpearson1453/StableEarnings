MY LUCKY MARK pressed the leader to the turn, was fanned out to the five path into the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down SADDLE BAR late.
SADDLE BAR set the pace while well off the rail, raced three then four wide to the stretch, responded in the drive but could not stall the winner. CANADA
had no speed, was four wide into the turn then circled six wide into the stretch and was gaining late. VASTLY DEEP was outsprinted early, raced off the rail
to the stretch then could not make an impact in the drive. NEPTUNE'S SPEAR tracked the pace outside the top two, was five wide into the turn, shifted
down to the three path into the stretch but weakened in the lane.

MY MAN DRAYMOND was unhurried and lagged to the half mile pole, offered a stout run two then three wide on the second turn, took over in upper stretch
and held driving. SPIDER RICO was allowed to settle four wide to the half, bid three then four wide on the second turn then finished willingly to easily be
second best. PEPPER SINGS contested the pace two wide for five furlongs, inched away on the second turn then could not stall the winner into the stretch
and weakened. TYPHOON HARRY had no speed, settled to the second turn, raced four then five wide to the stretch and was not a threat in the drive.
HARDY CHISEL attended the pace outside of PEPPER SINGS, remained a threat for five furlongs then gave out.

Footnotes
MIME was unhurried to the second turn, circled five wide while rallying to the stretch, caught the runnerup in mid stretch then edged clear driving.
OVERWHELMING LOVE was outsprinted to the backstretch then pushed up to press the leader to the second turn, bid four wide to get on terms for the
lead into the stretch, resisted the winner to mid stretch then was never in danger of losing the place. HAPPY ROAD was squeezed between CONNIE'S
PROMISE and MOON OVER MAG BAY and took up up sharply after the start, trailed to the half, advanced four wide on the second turn but had little to
offer in the stretch. STARS IN THE SKY (GB) had no speed, settled for a half mile, was three then four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and
tired. MOON OVER MAG BAY broke inwards and crowded HAPPY ROAD, attended the pace three wide for six furlongs but tired and gave out in the lane.
CONNIE'S PROMISE broke out and also crowded HAPPY ROAD, had brief speed then gave way on the second turn and stopped in the stretch.

PROMOTE (IRE) was on the pace outside two others and three wide to the stretch, responded to inch clear to mid stretch then edged away under steady
pressured. GOTHAM DESIRE was used for speed and dueled between rivals and two wide to the stretch, had the rider drop his whip at the three
sixteenths, got outkicked to mid stretch then had enough left to hold second. REGINELLA was outrun and trailed to the turn, came three then four wide to
the stretch and closed in a mild rally to grab the show on the wire. VRONILLA PARFAIT got outsprinted early, circled five wide to the stretch then was
outkicked in the final furlong and tagged for third. SPRING HEAT was pushed along early to contest the pace inside, got outkicked on the turn and tired in
the drive.
