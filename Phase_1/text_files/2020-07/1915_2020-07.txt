Footnotes
SWEET YARE N DIRA led quickly, set the pace, quickened on the turn then held sway, driving. SUMMERLAND moved up to press the pace into the turn,
chased two-wide then finished under a determined drive and was gaining late. VEIL, off a step slowly, settled at the rear of the pack, was hustled along the
rail and two-wide in mid pack on the turn then rallied gamely outside. FACT CHECKING stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the turn then finished
gamely. SUBZERO PLUS, at the rear early, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. IMA BEAST stalked the pace along
the rail, was roused at the top of the stretch but lacked a response when asked. KA GEE GEE stalked briefly then settled in mid pack, raced two-wide and
then along the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF DREW broke inward but showed speed to gain contention, chased the leader into the stretch, led quickly and widened under a hand ride.
CARPE HORSESHOE led midway through the backstretch, moved clear through the turn, was passed upper stretch and chased to the end. CONZIP, off
slowly, was pinched back early turn, chased two-wide into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. MORE SAVVY, in range, was hustled four then
three-wide on the turn but finished evenly. NORTHERN CROSS lost her path at the outset when DREAMING OF DREW broke in front of her, chased from
off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn but failed to threaten. FOR MY ELBI broke inward, raced in mid pack, was steadied at the turn, chased
three-wide and was unable to muster a gain in the stretch. BLU SKY SUNRISE, in mid pack early, dropped back early turn and lacked a rally. MARTINA'S
GALS showed brief speed the pressed the pace to the turn, faded along the rail and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
REVIVALIST led early, battled early turn, drew clear then widened through the stretch under a hand ride. CORA stalked the pace, came two-wide through
the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. SEAMIALAUGH bumped lightly with SWEET BOB BOB at the start, raced in mid pack, came
two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. DID I STUTTER was off slowly, raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to
three-wide on the turn then closed with interest in the stretch. SWEET BON BON, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, saved ground on the turn then
finished gamely. TWOMANYSHOTS, in range, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and offered a mild rally. LAXMI broke
alertly the settled and stalked the pace, chased three-wide late turn but lacked a closing response. COULD BE FATE moved up to challenge late
backstretch, battled briefly but was no match for REVIVALIST, chased to the stretch and tired. LA BESTIA raced in mid pack, was hustled five and six-wide
on the turn, came widest into the stretch then failed to menace. LETTER ROLL broke poorly and settled well back, was hustled on the turn but never
reached contention. MRS. DEL stalked the pace from the rail, was pinched back at the turn then lacked a closing response.

CLAYTON stalked the pace in hand, closed two to four-wide on the far turn, took command and led into the stretch and finished under a hand ride.
ELUSIVE KNIGHT, away slowly and off the early pace, closed four-wide on the far turn, finished under a determined drive and was clearly best of the rest.

rode the rail throughout and finished gamely. TRUEBELIEVE set the pace along the rail, dueled on the far turn, was passed by another rival near the pole
and evened out in the stretch. AUBURN HILLS showed brief speed, stalked the pace in hand, moved up again and dueled on the turn, was passed near the
1/4 pole and evened out as well. GREEN GROWTH settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but was never in contention. SEE
FOREVER raced in mid pack, was hustled five then four-wide on the final turn but lacked a rally.

LADY GRACE settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, angled out approaching the top of the stretch, rallied and was up late under a
drive. EYEINTHESKY raced in mid pack along the second path, chased three-wide into the stretch, loomed dangerous and confident as she launched her
rally and she got the best of the pacesetter but was outkicked by the winner. BOHEMIAN BOURBON stalked the pace, dropped back near the turn, saved
ground, was blocked upper stretch, angled out and rallied gamely between foes. CHARMAINE'S MIA, rated off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide
chasing on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied outside. SISTER PEACOCK led early, set the pace, was all out in the stretch but failed to
sustain her drive. FOXXY BELLE stalked the pace from the rail, launched a determined drive but evened out in the final 16th. SUMMER SUNDAY stalked
the pace, pressed the leader into the stretch but there was no response when asked. GAMBLE'S CANDY stalked the pace, came three-wide through the
turn, chased four-wide into the stretch and flattened out.

Footnotes
SARARENDA raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, rallied while lugging in and was up late.
TRAIL BLAZING ESSA stalked the pace, came three to five-wide through the turn, angled out upper stretch and bumped CAPTURE THE MOMENT then
finished gamely. TACKLE THE NORTH broke alertly but outward, dueled briefly then forced the issue, chased three and four-wide on the turn, bid at the top
of the stretch, got a short lead a 16th out but was caught in the final yards. STARONTHEHORIZON was prominent early, gained a narrow lead early turn,
was engaged at the top of the stretch and gave way grudgingly in the late stages. NAKED ILLUSION, off slowly, moved up to stalk the pace, chased from
the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied on the inside. CAPTURE THE MOMENT was taken back at the start and raced in mid pack, angled from the rail
to three-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch, was bumped sharply a furlong out but showed some interest in the late stages. BOATLOADOFNERVE
led mid backstretch, was headed early turn, forced the pace then tired upper stretch. SWEET SOCIETY, in mid pack early, trailed on the turn but lacked a
rally.
