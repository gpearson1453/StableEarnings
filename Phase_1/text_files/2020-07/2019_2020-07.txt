Footnotes
LUCKY STREET settled in mid pack, chased hard angling from two to four-wide through the turn, rallied outside, and was just up, driving. KILKENNY
PROSPECT dueled on the backstretch, gained a short lead, set a pressured pace through the turn, was joined at the top of the stretch, dueled, outfinished
his rival but was nailed on the wire. A GERSHWIN TUNE raced in mid pack, closed four then three-wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, dueled, but
hung. MAZINAW LEGEND stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn, launched a determined drive but was outkicked. CHAIRMAN FIFTYFIVE broke
outward and was steadied, settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn then finished evenly. SCHIMMEL was pinched back at the start and settled
well off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn and was still game and gaining in the late stages. CEPELINAS bumped with FRACTION at
the start, showed brief speed then forced the pace, backed away late turn and lacked a rally. FRACTION bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed,
gave way near the turn, faded quickly and was eased in the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
STRIKING MOON dueled on the backstretch, gained a short lead along the rail early turn, shook clear into the stretch, widened then held under a drive and
was taken in hand late. KID FORESTER stalked the pace, angled out closing from the rail to three-wide on the turn then gained through the stretch. BET
ALPHA, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but failed to menace. EMBRACE MY UNCLE raced from off the pace,
chased two and three-wide on the turn then finished evenly. PAPA TONY settled off the pace, chased three then two-wide on the turn but never reached
contention. SILENCIUM dueled early, forced the pace on the turn, gave way near the top of the stretch and retreated.

CAT'S WHISPER, rated off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, rallied outside and got by the leader in the final 16th. VICTOR'S DESTINY
had brief speed then forced the pace, bid upper stretch and drove to the lead, was passed in mid stretch but held place. STOPVICTIMIZINGME stalked the
pace, chased three-wide late turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and finished under a determined drive. CAUSE FOR ALARM stalked the pace,
challenged along the rail upper stretch, was game but failed to sustain the bid. CAPTAIN VINNIE settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide through
the turn, swung out for the drive and rallied willingly. RADIO NOWHERE dueled from the rail, yielded upper stretch and gave way. SILENT EMPIRE stalked
briefly then dropped back, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace in the stretch. HOPE VISION stalked early the fell back to mid
pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn but had no rally. A VIKING MORNING raced off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was hustled along but
lacked a closing response. CHARLES STREET dueled two-wide, gave way at the top of the stretch and faded. SATIVA was rated off the pace, was hustled
moving inwards from four to two-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

chased through the stretch. SAMUEL H settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the far turn and finished all out in the stretch. RANGE OF
MOTION, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, was still game in the but was never contentious. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS
settled in mid pack, chased hard five-wide late turn and finished gamely to no avail. ARCHIE'S LINK was pinballed by rivals from each side leaving the gate,
moved to the rail near the back of the pack but was worse than rank running into the first turn and wound up six-wide, angled from three to six-wide closing
on the far turn and was still game to the end. CREATIVE FORCE settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then tired in the
stretch. KUDURO stalked the pace, backed away three-wide on the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
VELOCE stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch and stormed to the lead, drew away and held sway under a hand ride. DR. GREEN raced in
mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn then rallied determinedly and got up late for place. DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES, away slowly and off the
pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then closed gamely outside rivals in the stretch. PERSONAL JOURNEY raced in mid pack, chased hard
three and four-wide on the far turn then finished all out through the stretch. FINAL ECLIPSE settled in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn
then closed with good energy through the stretch. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON pressed the pace, bid into the far turn, gained a short lead, shook clear into
the stretch but was quickly passed and gave way grudgingly to the late runners. KING OF GYPSIES raced in mid pack,was hustled angling from the rail to
three-wide on the final turn, finished gamely and led the second flight home. PICKHIMUPSUP bumped CAPTURE THE RIDE leaving the gate, stalked the
pace, failed with a bid early on the far turn but forced the issue to the stretch and tired. CAPTURE THE RIDE was bumped at the outset then stalked the
pace, chased four-wide on the far turn but flattened out in the stretch. FAST THINKING reared at the start and lost all chance, raced well off the early pace,
chased on the far turn and passed a tiring rival in the stretch. L'ETAT (GER) had speed, set a pressured pace,was engaged at the far turn and retreated.
