Footnotes
ZABAVA bobbled at the break, pulled close up early on, then stalked two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, rallied in the three path in the lane and prevailed
late after a long drive. SIDEREAL pulled early, rated the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, dug in gamely in the two path past midstretch
and yielded grudgingly at the end. SCATNAP tracked on the inside, saved ground on the turn, rallied on the rail, lacked room nearing the sixteenth pole and
was forced to check, then dug in late to get third. CODRINGTON raced off the pace inside, bid three wide entering the far turn, was outkicked and
outfinished late for the show spot. HERE COMES JACKIE raced three wide early, settled two wide off the pace, bid four wide entering the far turn and was
outkicked. O'MALLEY raced off the pace, had an inside trip and lacked a rally. STEFANIE ON FLEEK raced three wide early, then two wide off the pace
and had no rally. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Jockey Objection by the rider of SCATNAP against the top two finishers, the result was declared official.

lead at the furlong marker, dug in, then weakened in the final sixteenth. MONONGAHELA tracked close up on the inside, was asked on the far turn, raced
on the rail while chasing the leaders into the stretch and lacked a winning bid. HARPERS FIRST RIDE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved three wide on

Footnotes
AUTHENTIC broke sharply and quickly took charge, set the pace racing a bit off the inside, showed the way into the far turn, widened the margin on his own
in upper stretch, responded when roused at the furlong marker, dug in gamely late under some right handed urging and held on. NY TRAFFIC raced close
up while two wide, stalked AUTHENTIC on the backside, was set down and chased two wide on the far turn, lost ground in upper stretch, then responded
willingly at the sixteenth marker, came again gamely outside and surged at the wire to just miss. DR POST raced off the pace inside, was asked to pick it up
nearing the far turn, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside but did not threaten the top pair. JESUS' TEAM
tracked the pace racing on the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and weakened. FAME TO FAMOUS raced three
wide early, trailed the field and never factored. LEBDA raced two wide off the pace, then three wide and gave way. ANCIENT WARRIOR raced two wide off
the pace, between rivals and faded.

HOROLOGIST raced three wide early, stalked close up outside a rival, commenced her bid on the far turn, rallied outside of OUR SUPER FREAK in upper
stretch, wore down that rival, took over and drew clear under urging. OUR SUPER FREAK dueled two wide for the lead, battled with WRONG COLOR on
the backside, shook free nearing the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and then yielded grudgingly. ROYAL FLAG tracked close up on the
inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. SWEET SAMI D bobbled at the break, raced off the pace between
rivals, moved up inside past the quarter pole and rallied mildly for fourth. QUEEN NEKIA was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, went three wide on the
far turn and tired. VAULT raced three wide on the clubhouse turn, settled two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and tired. SHE'S A JULIE raced off
the pace inside and failed to respond when asked. WRONG COLOR dueled inside for the lead, battled on the backside and gave way entering the stretch.
