SHOOTERS ALLEY engaged for the lead from the outset in the two post cleared the field with a move on the turn and held the margin for the victory.
SNEAKY MEEK raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive and was finishing well but could not get to the winner. REAL HEAT raced four wide
on the turn to get into contention lost a bit of momentum at the head of the lane while wide but came again for third. COWBOY DON was not away from the
gates quickly but came through on the inside to engage for the lead at the first call dropped back a bit on the turn then came back while others went wide
and tired late. MINER'S NOTION raced five wide throughout and could not make up ground. DURTDOBBR raced three wide while up close to the lead but
faded after the first quarter. BLUESBERRY BEAU raced along the inside but never mounted a rally. MUSIC GIANT came very wide entering the stretch and
could not make up ground.

ADAPTATION stayed just off the pace along the rail and when the leaders drifted out entering the stretch came through along the rail to take the lead and
held to the wire. DEL ARGENT came three wide on the turn to take a brief lead but could not match strides with the winner in the stretch. MAJOR PERFECT
raced in the two path on the turn behind the pace came wide entering the stretch and was finishing with interest. FISHEL was well back early and raced
along the rail came through on the inside and passed tired foes in the stretch. MIDNIGHT MAVERICK showed good speed in the two path drifted out at the
head of the stretch and tired. ZERO SUM GAME broke awkwardly to be in the back at the start trailed to get out entering the stretch but offered no bid and
was not a factor. STUCK ON GEORGE showed the best speed along the rail drifted out entering the stretch and tired.

ROB'S GOLDEN TOUCH was hustled to the lead from the outset to get the rail and was challenged every step of the way but was able to prevail in a long
stretch battle. FOREVER THE CHIEF was in the two path just outside the winner every step of the way but could not go by that one while holding second.
MATRICULATE was along the inside until entering the stretch came out for the drive but could never go by the top two. EXCESSIVE KID was five wide on
the first turn then three wide for much of the rest of the mile and could not make up ground. BEIRUT was four wide on the first turn and could not make up
the needed ground in the stretch. REVERSALOFFORTUNE was three wide and could not make up ground. C C EXPRESS raced one off the rail and tired
after three quarters. BILLIE D was well off the pace and never mounted a bid.

Footnotes
TIENE TUMBAO was along the inside throughout and took the lead going into the turn and steadily increased the margin and drew off to win handily.
WASTING MONEY raced in the two path just off the pace could not match strides with the winner but was second best. OCTOBER WON was well off the
pace along the inside came through turning for home and was closing best to get on even terms for third. FRAN'S EMPIRE raced mid pack for much of the
race moved into third in the stretch then was caught at the wire to finish on even terms. KONTRARY KATE raced wide and never mounted a serious rally.
ELIZABETH'S MUSIC was up close to the lead on the turn while wide and tired in the stretch. ZIBO raced wide and could not make up ground. FORT
DODGE RD raced in the middle of the pack for the first quarter and faded. MY FINE YACHT popped the gate and had a quick length lead on the field could
not get to the rail and tired after the first quarter. LA BELLE AURORE was always well back and not a factor. TAKARA QUEEN raced wide and never
mounted a rally.
