Footnotes
SKY'S NOT FALLING settled off the pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, continued on his left lead in the lane, closed steadily under
left-handed urging and was up and clear late. SAN ANTONE stalked the pace two wide, bid in upper stretch, vied outside of WAIST DEEP to deep stretch,
won that battle but could not withstand the winner late. WAIST DEEP was reluctant to load, set the pace along the rail, continued on his left lead in the lane
and weakened late. GAMING JACK lacked early speed, checked nearing the three-eighths pole, raced three wide around the turn and improved position.
NO ONE TO BLAME broke slowly, raced two wide and never threatened. TOWN OF GOLD was off slowly, raced four wide and failed to menace. BEAVIS
had early speed inside and retreated.

Footnotes
TIZ SAMURAI set a clear pace in the two path, drew off around the far turn and held well clear while ridden out. GREEK GOD chased the winner from the
three path throughout and was clearly second best. PENDRELL MOON was devoid of speed while racing two and three wide and was along for the show.
SIR DOUGLAS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SHOTMASTER was outrun while racing two and three wide. BANNON played no factor
while racing three wide. PRIME TIME MAN chased the pace two wide and tired around the far turn. THE MONEY TRAIN was rank early, saved ground and
was done after a half.

RULING set a clear pace inside and held clear under a drive. READY TO RUN stalked the winner in the clear two wide, could not reel in that foe but held
well to be a clear second. STUCK UP settled off the pace while racing two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and was along for the show. KAMEHAMEHA
chased the pace three wide and lacked a rally. MCCLURE chased the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN was slammed at
the start, raced four wide and never threatened. TAPPIN HONOR failed to menace while racing three wide. CHRISATUDE broke outwardly, saved ground
and never threatened. STORM STRUCK was outrun while racing four wide. DRAMATIZED played no factor while racing two wide. WOWZA MAN was
slammed at the start, raced three wide and made little further impact. MATHEW'S CHARM was fractious in the gate then had only brief speed two wide.

ELEGANT GAL settled off the pace four wide, bid three wide around the turn, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. SARAH'S
TREASURE broke sharply but quickly dropped back to last, saved ground well back, swung widest turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane,
had the rider lose the whip in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. BREAK CURFEW set the pace along the rail, was no match for the winner
but held well enough to save third. BRUT ROSE saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. COMBAT
QUEEN pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch then faded around the turn. OLIVE KAT was bumped at the start, had some speed inside and
steadily faded. STARS FOREVER was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes near the five-sixteenths pole and tired in the lane.
