Footnotes
DUBNATION worked his way to the front on the first turn, maintained his advantage into the stretch and held sway thereafter under vigorous handling.
SHELL FIRE awkward at the start, was settled, lodged a four wide bid into the far turn to reach contention and stayed on in the stretch. PAINTED CANYON
saved ground, remained inside for the stretch run and managed a mild rally. STACCATO raced forwardly while four wide and lacked a rally. HEISFANCY
outrun early, advanced while four wide on the far turn and flattened out. BEST TRICK YET forced the pace and retreated.

maneuvered off of the rail approaching the sixteenth pole and kept on. WHOLEHEARTED chased while three wide, moved four wide into the stretch and

well three wide, entered the stretch three wide and finished well. ROCK MOVES chased while four wide, moved closer on the turn and stayed on in the
stretch. NEW GOSPEL forced the pace and dropped back leaving the turn. MAHOMES outpaced early, moved four wide into the stretch and lodged a mild
rally. GINGER RULES was always outrun. LAUNCH THE POSSE failed to threaten. HE'S A BIG DILL bobbled at the start and was no factor. WOKE UP IN
