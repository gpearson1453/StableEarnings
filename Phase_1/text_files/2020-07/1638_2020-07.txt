Footnotes
JACI'S ROYALTY unhurried early, moved closer after a half, roused while off the inside entering the straight, kicked down the leader under continued brisk
handling. CALCULATE last away, used a bit to advance to a forward position past the wire the first time, took control before a half, shook well clear in the far
turn, continued to show the way by daylight into the stretch, could not contain the winner, well clear of the others. SPECIAL BINGO settled in mid pack while
saving ground, continued inside the middle half, went one paced to the wire and while clear of the rest, was no threat to the top two. BORODINO void of
early foot, moved to the outside far turn, improved position with some mild late interest. SECRET VISTA three wide in the first turn, dropped inside far turn,
saved ground into the stretch to no avail. CHROMED HEART dueled early inside the runner up, gave way after four furlongs. BING BING broke back,
advanced to within striking distance before a quarter, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
WILDLY GRAND broke alertly, soon sprinted clear, continued to lead by daylight through the turn, drew out through the lane under steady pressure. ROSE
RUNNER away in good order outside, raced closest to the winner up the backstretch, continued to pursue that rival through the turn, could do little with that
same foe in the drive, remained clear for th e place. MADISON'S PLACE settled in mid pack while off the inside, improved slightly into the lane, proved best
of the rest. ANTE VERA last away, void of any early speed, came four wide into the lane, also improved slightly while not posing a serious threat through the
stretch. GLADS LOVE CAT broke well, raced forwardly in the run up the backstretch, fell back a bit in the turn and had little for the drive. MY LITTLE FIRE in
the second flight early, failed to respond when called on for the drive. SHOULDACOULDAWOULD broke with the leaders, off the pace outside, four wide
into the far turn, tired in the drive. BINDS FAIR LASS fell back to trail after the start and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
ATCHATA broke alertly, fell back off the pace, swung four wide when advancing on the leaders exiting the turn, challenged on the outside and drove quickly
and strongly clear. MARQUEE MOMENT settled off the early pace and the inside, came four wide and behind the winner turning for home, could do little
with that foe in the run to the wire while finishing up willingly to be clear for the place. PREEMPTIVE forwardly placed early outside, vied three wide into and
through the turn, briefly showed the way into the straight then proved no match for the top two, comfortably saved the show. ITSNOTMYJOB went one
paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. RULE TAYLOR RULE off a bit slow, lacked speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to improve position slightly,
never dangerous. GEMODIXIE off a step slow, trailed, also passed a couple of tiring foes well after the issue had been decided. JOE G'S PAYBACK vied
early closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage late in the turn then gave way in the drive. I SEE YOUDEAUX broke out, was straightened to race with
the early pace, vied between horses into the turn, also faltered with the real running began at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
GO GET THAT within striking distance while three wide in the second flight, moved a bit closer late in the turn, challenged on the outside soon after, drew
well clear the final furlong while under steady handling. NEWYORK GIANT light bump just after start, also raced in the second group early while inside the
winner, crept closer in some traffic late in the turn, in tight when attempting to split foes inside the furlong grounds, bumped, got through, no match for the
winner, proved game for the place. RISKEY TRICKEY dueled up front for three furlongs off the inside, larger lead entering the stretch, offered little
resistance to the winner when that one challenged soon after, outkicked late for the place. GOLDEN PALACE last away, lacked early foot, moved out to be
widest for the drive, improved position. SUPERCONDUCTOR dueled up front closest to the inside, was weakening in mid stretch when exchanging bumps
with the runner up, continued to fade. WESTERN DAYS lightly bumped with the runner up just after the start, settled in the second group just off the inside,
came up empty for the drive. LUKE THE DRIFTER lacked early foot toward rail, moved out to race four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally in the
drive.

Footnotes
INCA WARRIOR broke back, lacked early foot, moved closer into the far turn, three wide into the lane, set down, challenged on the outside inside the
furlong marker, bumped with the runner up, edged clear under firm handling. MY TY FU PEG pressed the early leader, fell back off that one onto the
backstretch while under restraint, continued to race forwardly, bid, took over into the lane, clear a furlong out, bumped with the winner when that one
challenged afterward, could not match strides with that one late, fully extended to saved the place. STANDING MAN lacked early foot, raced in the main
body outside the winner, in some traffic as that one angled out late in the final turn, dropped inside when straightened for home, lodged a bid inside the top
two with less than a furlong remaining, also could not match the winner late, outkicked for the second spot. LAST NITE OUT behind the pace in the two path
early, fell back the middle half, roused while saving ground in the second turn, improved position while not a serious threat to the top three at the end.
IBEAM moved up to force the issue before a quarter, continued to prompt the pace the middle four furlongs, floated out when the winner steered out turning
for home then had little left for the stretch run. GRAND LITTLE MAN forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, continued outside, fell back while
once again four wide through the second bend, lacked a response in the drive. SHAQ JACK remained back in failing to threaten. FAZIO broke on top, got
clear to set the pace before a quarter, vied the middle part then gave way. TIGER ROAD was always outrun while racing outside.

Footnotes
AWISHFORGREELEY broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, put the other speed away
when straightened for home and drove well clear. RARE ONE pressed the winner early from the outside, dueled through the turn while remaining in the two
path, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. MYLIE IDEL in the second flight while racing outside, had little for the top two in the
drive, well clear of the others. SHAKETHAHATERSOFF broke out, settled in the two path, went evenly in lacking a late kick. CARLENA went one paced
while racing in the middle of the pack. I AM THE FIRE failed to menace while racing outside. GIDDY UP GEAUX broke in the air and awkwardly, trailed well
back, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. MORE CLEVER remained back while racing wide. BERNICE D'WILDCAT chased the top two
early and began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
SASSY CAMILLE broke well, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, held a narrow advantage early in the turn, headed soon after, continued to vie
past the furlong marker while narrowly behind, battled back in the late going under firm handling to prevail in game fashion. JERRY'S LEGACY forwardly
placed outside, advanced and put a head in front midway on the turn, continued to show the way into and through upper stretch, outkicked in the late while
while holding the place. PRAY FOR LISA broke back, lacked early foot, moved out, four wide out of the turn, rallied and was slowly getting to the runner up
late, clear of the others. ORTHODOX BEAT bumped soundly from both sides at the start, recovered to race in mid pack, came five wide out of the turn,
displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve a bit. PEACH'S SWAN SONG dwelt at the start, trailed well back, three path into the lane, moved out
further and improved with some mild interest down the middle of the strip. MISSBUDLITELIME broke in, soundly bumped foe, made little other impact.
SWEET KARMA broke out, bumped foe, mid pack, tired in the drive. MARY'S WISH within striking distance early, steadily faded. QUEEN LEDA dueled up
front outside the winner, gave way in the drive, pulled up in distress late, vanned off.

Footnotes
ALLIACEOUS slight hop at the start to break back, raced unhurried early, moved closer from between rivals far turn, challenged three wide when
straightened for home, strongly clear under steady handling in a solid effort. MY LITTLE JEN also outrun in the early going while saving ground, moved a bit
closer in some traffic far turn, shifted out for the drive, finished willingly to be clearly second best, no match for the winner. XAIRO within striking distance
early in the two path, closer into the far turn, challenged late in the second turn, raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch and past the furlong
marker then could not keep up, no match for the runner up as well. KRAFT'S RATE forwardly placed early behind the two leaders inside, fell back before a
half, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. SAY YES AGAIN away in good order, dueled into the first turn in the three path, shook clear
before a half, showed the way into the second turn, gave way when headed entering the stretch. DA DUE RUN RUN settled in mid pack, three wide, failed
to respond when called on for the drive. FILM STUDY vied early in the two path, chased the leader up the backstretch, briefly moved closer late in the final
turn, faltered in the drive. ONETWOMANYROCKETS last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SI FAMILIA broke back, outrun early, began a steady advance after a quarter, four wide through the turn, challenged nearing the furlong grounds and
finished with good energy to win going away. WABASH CANNONBALL back off the pace, asked along in the turn, traffic into the lane, switched out to be
widest when straightened for home, finished willingly midtrack to be in time for theplace. DANCEHALL JACK closest to the leader, went after that one to
challenge into the lane, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, caught late for the place. ACTIF ONE void of speed, continued back through the
turn off the inside, four wide into the stretch, improved position. DRY WOOD CREEK last away, lacked speed, improved slightly in some traffic turn, went
evenly in the drive in lacking a further response. FANCY THIS in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, fell back from between foes early in the turn,
no response in the drive. INDIUM broke alertly, was asked to clear before exiting the chute, showed the way into the far turn, gave way when headed
turning for home. CANYON FIRE within striking distance off the inside, had little to offer for the drive. BWANA GO forwardly placed for four furlongs,
stopped in the drive.
