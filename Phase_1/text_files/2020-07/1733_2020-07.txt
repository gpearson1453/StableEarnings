Footnotes
WARTIME HERO stalked the pace from along the inside, advanced to track from the pocket just behind the leaders around the far turn, cut the corner
turning for home before shifting three wide approaching the furlong pole, rallied late, and just got up at the wire. BEAVER HAT pressed the pace setter from
the outside, vied two wide around the far turn, dueled with his inner game rival in upper stretch, forged a narrow lead inside the final sixteenth as WARTIME
HERO ranged along side, but was nailed on the wire by that foe. CERNAN set a pressured pace along the inside, dug in to hold an advantage at the furlong
pole from multiple rivals, but was outfinished by those foes inside the final sixteenth. CAN'TBETEMALL was forwardly placed three wide between horses,
but failed to keep pace with his inner foes into the far turn, and subsequently weakened. AMERICAN HUMOR raced far off of the pace two wide, stayed on
through the lane, but failed to menace. LOAN SHARK was off slowly, saved ground while far off of the pace, but was no factor. MAJORITY RULES was
forwardly placed four wide, but weakened at the half mile pole, and was eased around the far turn. TIZ THE JOURNEY failed to get involved.
SHESGONEMOVEON raced far off of the pace three wide, and never got involved.

Footnotes
HEAVENS WHISPER stalked the pace setters from along the inside, saved ground around the turn before shifting to the three path in upper stretch, surged
through between horses approaching the furlong pole to forge a lead passing it, then drew off through the late stages. CHARGE IT JENN pressed the pace
three wide and between horses, inched closer to make a bid at the five sixteenths pole, but shifted to the four path turning for home, which allowed racing
room for the eventual winner in upper stretch, sustained his bid through the late stages, and reached place at the wire. SUNSET PAULA JO vied for the lead
two wide between horses, dug in gamely between horses in upper stretch, but was no match for the eventual winner at the furlong pole, held place through
the final furlong, but was nailed at the wire for that position. TAKE CHARGE ERICA set a pressured pace along the inside of multiple foes, but was headed
by those rivals in upper stretch, then gave way through the final sixteenth. STELLAR STILETTO was forwardly placed four wide, made a four wide bid for
the lead turning for home, but shifted to the five then six path in upper stretch, and flattened out outside of rivals at the furlong pole. OVER THE BLUES
trailed throughout, failed to keep pace with the field in upper stretch, and was no factor.

Footnotes
PUYE TIMING prompted the pace setter while kept in the three path by her inner counterpart, failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch due to
hanging on her left lead, lugged in, then back out, when encountering correction from her rider, found stride inside the furlong pole, quickened to make a
rebid, and just got up at the wire. PATTY H set the pace inside of PUYE TIMING while staying a path off of the rail, drew clear from that foe in upper stretch,
but tired inside the final furlong, and was caught by the aforementioned rival at the wire. SPUN D'ETAT was forwardly placed three wide, inched forward to
be in range of the leaders turning for home while in the four path, but failed to make headway on those foes and finished up evenly. COCONUT COTTAGE
was forwardly placed along the inside, but was outmoved by multiple foes into the turn, saved ground from midpack around the bend, shifted two wide
between horses turning for home, then finished up willingly along the inside for a minor reward. SA FORADADA was taken back at the start due to an inner
foe shifting outwards, trailed the field early on, gained and split foes four wide in upper stretch, but flattened out through the final furlong. TETE A TETE was
outmoved by an outer rival while two wide and far off of the pace around the turn, shifted to the six path to be widest of all in upper stretch, but failed to
threaten. TEMPER TIME advanced mildly in the four path turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. FADED MEMORIES was forwardly placed two
wide between horses, but failed to keep pace while along the inside at the five sixteenths pole, then weakened further in upper stretch. NAUGHTY NELLIE
saved ground into the turn, shifted two to three wide turning for home, but weakened and was no factor. PRETTY IN PINK weakened from the second flight
early on to trailed the field at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
I HEAR YOU shifted five wide turning for home from midpack, rallied to the leader to make a bid at the furlong pole, and drew off through the closing stages.
FATE FACTOR stalked two wide, inched closer to reach the lead at a five sixteenths pole, built a clear lead in upper stretch, but was worn down by an outer
foe passing hte furlong pole. FORTY ZIP stalked along the inside, shifted three wide between horses turning for home, but was outkicked. FLYING THE
COLORS saved ground while rating off of the pace, waited for racing room around the far turn, came into the lane among traffic, but was outkicked, then
kept on. ELKE DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) was forwardly placed two to three wide, came into the lane four wide and between horses, but was outkicked by an
outer foe in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead. COUNTRY TIME raced far off of the pace along the inside, took bumps to her hind quarters when
BEAUTIFUL MORNING steadied at the three furlong pole, then came into the lane in the three path, drifted in before shifting to the five path at the furlong
pole, but failed to factor. PORTOFINA established a clear advantage into the first turn, but was headed at the five sixteenth spole and weakened in upper
stretch. WAR FOR PEACE was reluctant to load, then was forwardly placed three wide, but got rank into the backstretch, faded down it, then lugged in in
upper stretch. BEAUTIFUL MORNING raced far off of the pace in the three path, steadied hard between horses into the far turn, then was no factor.
TWITTERPATED had a rank start, and was always outrun. MAGIC MOTION took up mildly between horses passing the wire for thr first time, raced two
wide between horses in midpack, but weakened around the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
SAVVY advanced with a swift rail rally around the far turn, but was blocked behind the leaders from the five sixteenths pole to the quarter pole, shifted to the
four path passing the three sixteenths pole, then blew past the leader at the furlong marker. LUCKY ASSET was outsprinted after breaking midpack, saved
ground far off of the pace, advanced turning for home before tipping three wide between horses at the furlong pole, then stayed on to prove second best.
DARK WEB dueled for the lead inside of a rival, dug in in upper stretch after being headed, fought on gamely, but gave way at the furlong pole. UNCLE
STEVE had an awkward start and was off very slowly, advanced around the turn, swung to the seven path to be widest of all in upper stretch, and rallied
mildly for a minor reward. SILVER QUARTERS was bumped between horses at the start, trailed the field by a distance in upper stretch, and rallied belatedly
outside of foes through the lane. INIS GLUAIRE was forwardly placed along the inside while staying a path off of the rail, but was shuffled back between
horses turning for home, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but failed to make a bid. SEARING CHASE was forwardly placed two wide, swept past the
leaders four wide turning for home to forge a lead approaching the quarter pole, but was headed at the furlong pole, brushed by an outer rival, and
weakened. PROUD VETERAN was fractious in the gate, raced far off of the pace in the two path before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked
room between horses, shifted inwards, and rallied between horses mildly. FUGITIVE was blocked while midpack turning for home, shifted to the five path at
the quarter pole, but lacked a bid and weakened on her left lead. CARMICHAEL swung to the six path while far off of the pace turning for home, but was no
factor. FULL AUTHORITY was forwardly placed three wide, inched forward to bid for the lead turning for home, but weakened two wide between horses in
upper stretch, then took up while fading at the furlong pole, and stopped. HOOF PRINCE dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses
turning for home, and stopped.

GREYES CREEK raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, began a rally in the upper stretch, was carried out a bit by drifting out foe while
flying down the lane and drove past the leader in the final stages. MY AMERICA set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, drew clear in the stretch
but was ran down in the late stages. MANTRA chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, altered out once in the stretch, began a rally, drifted out
and was gaining in the final stages. ANDESITE stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and finished willingly in
the late stages. ELUSIVE RULER stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and finished willingly in the late stages. CAVALRY CHARGE raced
back early on, was in the five path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. LAKE NAKURU was in the six path into the lane and improved position.
ATTORNEY TIM was never a threat. BEE CATCHER was never a factor. EL AHIJADO tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded in the
stretch drive. SEA OF HOPE chased the pace from the outside early on, was in the three path into the lane, bothered in the upper stretch and empty late in

Footnotes
NAUGHTY PRINCE chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid three wide down the lane, edged clear and held off rival in the final
stages. WHISKY MAN came in at the start and raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied very wide down the lane and did not have
enough in the final stages. SECOND LINE DAVID dueled early on, was off the rail into the lane and yielded late in the stretch run. THE FALCON stalked the
pace early, was in the four path into the lane, inched ahead in the stretch but yielded late in the drive. BOSS LIFE dueled early on, was in the three path into
the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. EASTERN SYMPHONY chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and flattened out late in
the stretch run. MY NAME IS PHRED was a bit slow at the start and raced back early on the inside, was in the three path into the lane with some gain in the
stretch drive. ITASCA was never a threat. CAPTAIN BILLY ROY was done early. CAROLINA AIRNESS stumbled at the start and was through after a half.
STOP MAKING SENSE was bumped and bothered at the start. LITCHFIELD had early speed then folded up.
