Footnotes
MARIES MELODY bumped with SPENCE heading to the first turn, vied outside G T'S BLUE SQUALL early, shook clear on the far turn, dug in when
challenged by JEANIE'S ANGEL in the stretch, and held on while drifting out and brushing with that rival. JEANIE'S ANGEL bumped with G T'S BLUE
SQUALL heading to the first turn, stayed close early, loomed outside MARIES MELODY while drifting out several paths at the top of the lane, bid through
the furlong grounds, and could not get by while brushing with the winner. ALOHA KITTEN got bumped between MILLIE and SUMMER SHORE and bobbled
a bit at the start, lagged well back despite urging into the far turn, moved out in the stretch and got going belatedly. TERRIBLE TARA saved ground early,
advanced mildly in the two-path approaching the stretch, but lacked a solid closing bid. MILLIE broke out bumping ALOHA KITTEN, raced two wide in the
second flight for six furlongs, and improved position while never a threat. CALLMESENORITA was no factor passing tired horses. SPENCE bumped with
MARIES MELODY going to the first turn, settled in midpack for six furlongs, and had no rally. INEDATEQUILA raced four wide around the far turn, and
made no impact. HONOLUA BAY tracked three wide for six furlongs outside the leaders, and tired. G T'S BLUE SQUALL bumped with JEANIE'S ANGEL
approaching the first turn, vied inside MARIES MELODY, and was finished on the far turn. SUMMER SHORE bumped with ALOHA KITTEN at the start, and
dropped far back in the stretch.

Footnotes
SPECIAL INCLUSION dueled inside MY GLORY early, shook clear on the turn, and was all out to hold on late. HEART OF GOD raced far back in the
two-path on the turn, moved inside rallying through upper stretch, came back out approaching the sixteenth-pole and just missed outside the winner. MY
GLORY dueled outside SPECIAL INCLUSION before getting shaken off, drifted out several paths into the stretch, and finished one-paced. DARK BLUE
FLAME saved ground on the turn, and lacked a solid response in the two-path through the lane. DIAL A LADY bumped with C'EST PARTI at the start,
tracked three to four wide to the stretch, and tired. NAG NAG NAG broke in bumping SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER, chased four to five wide to the stretch,
and tired. C'EST PARTI bumped with DIAL A LADY at the start, was five wide into the turn before moving in a bit, and never got close.
SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER got bumped by NAG NAG NAG at the start, and was finished early. WATERMELON SUGAR broke slowly and was outrun.
KITTEN'S DREAM trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
THRESHOLD was forwardly placed early inside, moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, bid outside KUNAL turning for home, and prevailed after a
long drive. KUNAL tracked outside INDY'S JEWEL early, turned up the pressure through the middle stages, took over after six furlongs, battled inside
THRESHOLD through the stretch and yielded grudgingly. MAKABIM saved ground early, was under a drive early on the far turn, moved out in the stretch
and gained too late. INDY'S JEWEL set an easy pace inside, yielded after six furlongs, and tired. CARDIAC KID raced between horses for six furlongs, and
made no headway late on the far outside. STRONG ENDING was unhurried early three wide, and faded approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
BLOSSOM BOW pressed the pace outside FIAMMA MAMMA, took over approaching the five-sixteenths, moved to the rail and widened under pressure.
UPSY DAISY DO moved out to the three-path rallying into second after six furlongs, could not threaten the winner and was much best of the rest. ABARRIO
FOREVER broke out, was outrun to the stretch two wide, and rallied mildly for the show. KAUFY FUTURES saved ground advancing into the far turn,
moved out three wide after six furlongs, and flattened out on the far outside through the lane. MIA'S BOBTAIL tired three then four wide approaching the
stretch. FIAMMA MAMMA set the early pace inside, and yielded before completing six furlongs. RED KITTEN lunged and followed ABARRIO FOREVER out
at the start, and was through early outside.

NOTHIN BUT NET saved ground in range early, moved out three wide rallying off the turn, caught VALID EXCHANGE from outside in deep stretch and
edged away. VALID EXCHANGE chased outside FIFTY CENTS, collared that one in upper stretch and drew clear, but could not hold off the top one late.
COLD WARRIOR cut the corner advancing into the lane, loomed along the rail past the furlong marker but did not have enough. NOBLE NEBRASKAN
broke out bumping KING OF ROCK at the start, moved up after three furlongs in the three-path, and gained mildly for a share. KING OF ROCK got bumped
between NOBLE NEBRASKAN and COLD WARRIOR and took up after the start, raced far back early, and posed no threat widest in the stretch. UNCAGE
THE CAT got bumped into COLD WARRIOR by FIFTY CENTS at the start, was forced out early on the turn outside the spill four or five wide, and passed
tired horses. CHURCHILLS VICTORY checked sharply outside a fallen rival early on the turn, and did not recover. SILVER CONNECTION got clipped from
behind by AUGER early on the turn, and dropped back. FIFTY CENTS broke in bumping UNCAGE THE CAT into COLD WARRIOR, sped clear and moved
inside, and gave way through upper stretch. AUGER was hard to handle from the get-go, got sent up into heavy traffic unruly into the turn, clipped the heels
of SILVER CONNECTION and fell past the three-eighths, was apprehended and escorted off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
ON THE TURN, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BOURBON IN MAY settled in the second flight early, came three wide rallying off the far turn, outdueled PONT DU GARD through deep stretch and edged
clear outside. PONT DU GARD saved ground tucked in off the early leaders, came through an ample opening on the rail in upper stretch, reached a short
lead a furlong out but was outkicked to the wire. RULE YOURSELF bumped with COLONIST at the start, raced three wide at the back early, moved in on
the far turn, came back out and rallied mildly on the far outside. MY POINT EXACTLY stalked outside ROBINTAKINCHARGE for six furlongs, bid past the
quarter-pole, but faded through the drive. MR WRENCH IT saved ground on the turns, moved off the rail in deep stretch and was one-paced between
horses. ROBINTAKINCHARGE crossed over with the lead through the stretch the first time, established an easy early pace, and folded up in the stretch.
COLONIST bumped with RULE YOURSELF at the start, stayed in range for six furlongs, and came up empty. SURF SHACK was always outrun. SHIDOSHI
was no factor inside.

R MERCEDES BOY pressed the pace inside, got through on the fence rallying into the stretch and kicked away, jumped back on his left lead leaving the
eighth-pole and had enough to stay clear. MEADE bumped with CREATE AGAIN at the start, checked between horses and was shuffled back past the
half-mile pole, rallied on the rail and was up for the place. GEONOSIS hit the left side of the gate at the start, stayed in striking range near the two-path for
six furlongs, and gained mildly outside late. ALLURSTRA waited inside entering the turn, opted to move out five wide after six furlongs,and rallied mildly
outside. AEQUOR raced close up three wide to the stretch, and tired. CREATE AGAIN bumped with MEADE at the start, set the pace in the two-path, got
headed by the winner after six furlongs, and gave way through upper stretch. ICE TEA advanced to loom a threat in the four-path at the top of the stretch,
but flattened out.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN BEAT sped to the front at the start, went along in the two-path dealing with outside pressure from DON V., and had enough to hold off APACHE
late. APACHE raced three wide losing ground to the leaders around the turn despite urging, moved further out in mid stretch, surged late outside the winner
but ran out of ground. DON V. broke out several paths at the start, rushed up outside chasing after BAHAMIAN BEAT, had aim in the four-path turning for
home, but weakened late. SIR AGGRAVATOR lost his footing at the break and was last away, steadied near the half-mile pole, advanced a bit between
horses early on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly outside for the last major share. DILIGENT raced forwardly inside to the
stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. HALO'S DANCE was no factor four wide. CARSON AND I was outrun three wide. SEAGAR retired early.

SAYONARA BABY hustled up on the rail early, stayed close around the turn, took over on the rail at the top of the stretch and kicked clear under a drive.
BARGAINAIRE loomed menacingly four wide after a half-mile, idled through upper stretch outside, and finished willingly too late. BACCARAT FASHION
was slow away from the gate, shifted out three wide late on the turn, moved back inside rallying through upper stretch, swapped back to her left lead outside
the sixteenth-pole and flattened out. J'S INDIAN CHARM set the pace in the two-path, lost the advantage after a half-mile, and faded through upper stretch.
TREVESS was under a drive three wide midway on the turn, challenged for command a quarter-mile out, then gave way once straightened away for the
drive. TAKECHARGE MIRELLA trailed inside.

Footnotes
MONEY HOUSE dueled inside BIG'S GRAY DAY, kicked clear in upper stretch and was not threatened late. O DRISCOLL raced two wide around the turn
losing ground to the leaders under urging, got going in upper stretch but could not reach the winner while clearly second best. TRINNI DANCER advanced a
bit four wide after three furlongs, drifted out slightly in upper stretch, and offered a mild response to pick up the show. LAST JET OUT came five wide off the
turn, and improved mildly on the far outside. NOBODYKNOWSNOTHIN had aim off the battling leaders three wide near the quarter-pole, but faded through
the lane. NIT PICK dropped back four wide on the turn. BIG'S GRAY DAY rushed up after the start, dueled outside MONEY HOUSE for three-eighths of a
mile, and tired. CHANELIN saved ground to no avail. SWINGIN ON A STAR stumbled badly and unseated the rider at the start, was apprehended after the
race and escorted off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. AS WELL, AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF LAST JET OUT AGAINST TRINNI DANCER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS QUICKLY
DISMISSED.
