Footnotes
CURLS AND BOWS chased the pace early, rolled up to the leaders while three wide nearing the lane, took over command near the three sixteenths pole
and drew away late under a steady drive. COULD YOU set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, overtaken near the three sixteenths pole and no
match for the winner in the final stages. KISSES FOR HEIDI steadied along the backstretch from the inside, was in the five path into the lane and moved up
in the stretch run. MEDIA MENDACITY raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch drive. BEACH HOUSE pressed
the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. SLAINTE was never a threat. FREE raced a bit keen early on while chasing
the pace, was on the inside into the lane and empty down the lane. BOBINE DE FIL broke slowly from the gate and trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
EMPIRE OF WAR saved ground in midpack around the first turn while inside of MOROCCO, left the rail into the far turn to pass a tiring inner rival, shifted to
the three path turning for home while still inside of his counterpart, rallied along with that rival through the lane while hanging on his left lead, and outfinished
his stablemate to the wire. MOROCCO was reluctant to load, settled in midpack outside of EMPIRE OF WAR, advanced along with that rival while in the
three path around the far turn, came into the lane in the four path, sustained his rally to bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole simultaneously with his
stablemate, but was outfinished by that foe in the late stages. KAZIRANGA saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, commenced a rally in the
four path around the far turn following MOROCCO's move, advanced while chasing that rival through midstretch, shifted to the five path to attempt a bid
passing the furlong pole, but did not have enough to make any late headway on the leaders. CELERITY trailed the field early on, saved ground around both
turns before shifting to the two to three path in upper stretch, then stayed on willingly to surpass tiring rivals in the final sixteenth. SABADOR (FR) set the
pace between horses into the first turn before clearing those foes around that bend, opened up to a clear advantage down the backstretch, held his margin
around the far turn, but began to tire in upper stretch, clung to an advantage in midstretch, but was caught at the sixteenth pole and faded. LOST IN LIMBO
vied for the lead three wide around the first turn, took back to track the leader into the backstretch, chased that foe around the far turn, but failed to produce
a bid and weakened at the furlong pole. CHAPS vied along the inside of a pair of rivals early on, took back to stalk around the first turn, but continued to lose
ground down the backstretch, then failed to menace thereafter. BIRD'S EYE VIEW was restrained at the start after breaking well, race far off of the pace two
wide, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
MARKET RUMOR tracked the leading duelers from multiple lengths off of the pace down the backstretch, moved forward into the far turn as TORMENTA
moved along side, shifted off of the rail to make a three wide bid between horses at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command turning for home, and drew
off under driving pressure. HEAVENLY SIS trailed the field early on, saved ground around the turns, commenced a rally to cut the gap on the leaders
around the far turn, squeezed through a very narrow opening along the rail turning for home, but had many lengths to make up on the leader, and only
proved second best. JUST A LOOK pressed the pace setter from the two path around the first turn, inched forward and dueled for the lead two wide at the
five furlong pole, vied into the far turn before inching a narrow advantage with a quarter mile to go, but was simultaneously engaged by MARKET RUMOR,
proved no match for that foe turning for home, then weakened between horses through the lane, but held show from her outer rival. TORMENTA raced far
off of the pace in the two path early on, advanced outside of rivals into the far turn and made a four wide bid for the lead with a quarter mile to go, but failed
to keep pace with MARKET RUMOR shortly after, flattened out turning for home, and failed to achieve show from a tiring foe. FLATOYA set the pace from
the onset while inside of JUST A LOOK, dueled with that foe after that rival made a bid with five furlongs to run, continued to vie around the far turn, but
weakened two wide and between horses in upper stretch. AUNT DOROTHY broke through the gate before the race, tracked from midpack in the two to
three path, but weakened into the far turn, was eased turning for home, then jogged across the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
FIELD PASS stalked from midpack along the inside through the first turn, advanced steadily to be in range of the leaders two wide and between horses into
the far turn, shifted to the four path while still between horses turning for home, drove forward to make a four wide bid for the lead at the furlong pole, dueled
with inner bidding foes through the late stages, and just prevailed at the wire. STREET READY stalked along the inside while right behind the early leader,
rated while waiting for racing room around the far turn and into upper stretch, shifted inwards at the three sixteenths pole as the leader drifted out allowing
for ample racing room, bid for the lead inside of multiple rivals at the furlong, dueled gamely through the late stages, but just missed. FANCY LIQUOR
pressed the pace setter from the two path, held position turning for home before making a bid for the lead in the three path passing the three sixteenths pole
while between horses, dueled courageously between rivals through deep stretch, but was outfinished by them. CITY MAN tracked from midpack in the three
path around the first turn gained mildly in the four to five path around the far turn before swinging to the six path turning for home, commenced a rally
outside of rivals, but shied from SPANISH KINGDOM when that foe shifted out at the furlong pole, but kept on and sustained his rally through deep stretch,
but did not have enough to catch the leaders. SPANISH KINGDOM pursued the pace three wide, held striking position in the four path around the far turn,
but was floated to the five path turning for home, leveled off in upper stretch before shifting out a bit at the furlong pole, then failed to make late headway,
and got outfinished for a minor reward. BAMA BREEZE saved ground far off of the pace around both turns, shifted to the three to four path at the furlong
pole, but rallied to be behind the leaders, and finished up under a mild drive while among traffic through the late stages. IRISH MIAS swung from the three
to the seven path turning for home while far off of the pace, but lacked a kick to get involved. VINTAGE PRINT saved ground while off of the pace, but came
under a drive into the far turn, shifted to the four path turning for home, but failed to menace. KINENOS broke a bit slowly, trailed, took the far turn in the four
path, swung to the seven path turning for home, but failed to make an impact. JUGGERNAUT set the pace along the inside, dug in while shifting off of the
rail in upper stretch, but was swallowed up between horses at the furlong pole, and stopped.

Footnotes
C Z ROCKET hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, advanced along the inside while in hand into and around the far turn, loomed large while shifting
off of the rail and forcing his way to the three path inside of foes turning for home, split rivals and produced a rally as COPPER TOWN kicked clear, but
sustained his grinding advance to wear that rival down in the final sixteenth. COPPER TOWN dueled for the lead outside of FACT FINDING through the
early stages and around the turn, drew clear from that foe and multiple outer foes in upper stretch, but met a challenge from CZ ROCKET at the sixteenth
pole, and was worn down by that foe in the late stages. TRUE TIMBER prompted the leading duelers from the three path, was floated to the four path
turning for home while between horses, switched leads at the three sixteenths pole, then leveled off and chased the leaders home without making much
headway. NITROUS trailed early on, shifted to the three path into the turn before swinging to the six path turning for home while still far off of the pace, but
only produced a mild kick and failed to threaten. BORRACHO broke outwards to open space, took the turn two wide and far off of the pace, then stayed on
through the lane, but was no menace. MR. MONEY stalked in the three to four path around the turn, but was floated to the five path turning for home, and
weakened at the furlong pole. TWO THIRTY FIVE saved ground while far off of the pace, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but failed to get involved.
MOJO MAN tracked from midpack in the four path, but came under a drive to keep pace into the turn, then weakened in the six path in upper stretch. FACT
FINDING was sent in the early stages to duel for the lead inside of COPPER TOWN, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then weakened
further at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
ZULU ALPHA was bumped between horses at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, commenced a rally in the three to four path around the third
turn, shifted five wide turning for home, sustained his charge after flopping back to his left lead at the furlong pole, making him drift in slightly causing a
brushing chain reaction, bid inside the final furlong, then swapped back to his right lead inside the final sixteenth to secure the victory. POSTULATION set a
tepid pace along the inside, shook loose from the field turning for home and built a clear margin in upper stretch, but was worn down in the final sixteenth.
NAKAMURA settled off of the pace in the two to three path, advanced around the third turn to be in range four wide and between horses in upper stretch,
produced a bid at the furlong pole, but was brushed by an outer rival, then brushed an inner rival, and got outfinished. JAIS'S SOLITUDE bumped an inner
foe at the start, stalked the mild pace from along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, produced a bid between horses, but was brushed by an
outer foe passing the furlong pole, causing him to brush an inner foe, and got outfinished late. RY'S THE GUY vied for the lead outside of POSTULATION
through a tepid pace, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, then was brushed by an outer foe passing the furlong pole, and gave way.
ARKLOW settled far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turns, came into the lane six wide, but lacked a kick in upper stretch, then stayed on
mildly to surpass tiring foes without threatening the leaders. OSCAR DOMINGUEZ (IRE) was off slowly and trailed the field around the first turn, swung from
five to seven wide turning for home, but was no factor. HE'S NO LEMON raced far off of the pace in the two path, but failed to factor. APRECIADO was
forwardly placed along the inside early on, retreated to midpack into the clubhouse turn, but was shuffled behind HENLEY'S JOY into the third turn, and
failed to make an impact. HENLEY'S JOY was forwardly placed in the three path, but raced a bit keen around the second turn, lost position down the
backstretch, attempted a rerally by saving ground turning for home, but weakened at the furlong pole. HELLORHIGHWATER tracked from midpack two
wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.
