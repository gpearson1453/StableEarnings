Footnotes
LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke alertly, continued to race forwardly in the run up the backstretch while off the inside, advanced to duel through the bend,
disposed of that rival entering the stretch, kicked clear, kept to task. SECRET VISTA last away, trailed early, continued void of speed in the turn, followed
ROYAL GALAXY through along the inside into the stretch, outkicked that one late for the place while not a serious threat to the winner. ROYAL GALAXY
well back off the early pace, in some traffic along the inside late in the turn, got through along the rail, steered out for the drive, some late intrest while
outkicked for the place late. YES BAB dueled up front in the run up the backstretch closest to the inside, put that foe way while joined by the winner for the
run through the turn in the two path, began to weaken turning for home, chased the winner past the furlong marker and continued to weakened to lose a
couple of positions the final furlong. SAILING JETT back off the early pace well out in the strip, lodged a middle move to advance while four wide in the turn,
flattened out in the drive. DEWEY'S LITTLE JOE settled in mid pack, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive. LUCKY BIG DADDY raced in
the second flight along the inside, had little for the drive. LAST APPEAL dueled early off the inside, gave way before a half. FLASHBURN in the main body
up the backstretch, shuffled back early in the turn, moved out to be five wide into the stretch, trailed home.

Footnotes
DREAMY ART prompted pace, three wide in the turn, challenged into the lane, edged away late under steady handling. VERONICA'S DREAM raced back,
moved closer in the turn along the inside, in tight, steadied late in the bend, got through and challenged nearing the furlong marker, briefly dueled with the
winner, could not match strides with that one late, held the place. MEMORY MAGIC back off the early pace, steered out five wide turning for home, roused,
displayed some late interest down the middle of the strip to be getting to the runner up. KRIS T. pressed the issue on the outside in the run up the
backstretch, began to gradually weaken late in the turn, continued to fade stretch. EREBUNI broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch,
briefly garnered a larger advantage late in the turn, then faltered when confronted for the drive. LADYGOGENTLY remained always back. HEART OF SOUL
with the early pace in the two path, gave way from between rivals and inside the winner midway on the turn, continued to back up in the drive.

Footnotes
MOCITO ROJO settled in the second flight toward the inside, continued to be firmly in hand up the backstretch, two path through the final turn, shifted out
nearing the furlong grounds, late bid, fully extended to be up in time. STEPHEN'S ANSWER narrowly showed the way through the first turn in the two path,
garnered a slightly larger advantage after a half, vied between horses into the stretch, headed by SPEEDLY FELLAR past the furlong marker, battled back
to regain the advantage late but could not hold the winner safe in the waning strides. SPEEDY FELLAR broke on top, rank, pulled hard early into the first
turn, continued to race closest to the leader the middle half, rebid along the rail turning for home, narrowly showed the way past the furlong pole, outkicked
in the late going, well clear of the others. NATE'S ATTACK in the second group outside, ranged up to briefly challenge three wide turning for home, then
gave way in the drive. MILTONTOWN last away, trailed throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BUCK DUANE moved up steadily in the run up the backstretch while inside, second flight through the turn, slipped through a small opening turning into the
stretch, quickly clear when straightened for home, kept to task while increased advantage. GO GET THAT back off the early pace while racing outside,
loomed a threat while five wide exiting the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. WHISKEY'S GONE broke outward but with
the leaders, raced forwardly and three wide into the turn, vied through the bend, had little for the top two in the drive, remained clear of the others. FLAT
OUT LOVE last away, moved up to race in mid pack, came four wide out of the turn, improved slightly while not a serious threat to the top three. DERBY
DOG broke alertly, narrowly set the pace toward the inside, allowed the winner the rail turning for home then began to weaken soon after. CHIMNEYVILLE
void of speed after breaking back, six wide out of the turn, improved position slightly while remaining widest in the drive. DISTINCT QUALITY made little
impact while racing off the inside. SEAHAWK WAVE remained back in failing to menace. MIKEY'S MOUSE lacked closing bid. GREELEY CAN WIN
forwardly placed, vied between rivals through the turn then gave way in the drive. LITTLE RED KID was never close to be always outrun.

Footnotes
AW ITE void of speed for three furlongs, swung four wide into the lane, displayed some late interest to be up for the show late. BOSTON REPO with the
pace from the start, dueled along the inside into and through the turn, pulled away from the other speed once inside the furlong grounds, held the runner up
safe late under steady handling. CAJUN CHAOS settled in the second flight, two path into the lane, dropped to the inside and came empty in the late going.
PURE VALOR with the pace off the inside early, dueled outside the winner turn and upper stretch, continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong
marker, faltered late. CHEERS TO BERTI raced off the pace outside, three wide through the turn and into the lane, set down, rallied and was slowly getting
to the winner late while holding sway for the place. JAKE THE BAND MAN forwardly placed early while outside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
LOULEIGH asked along while in the second group into the turn, came three wide into the lane, roused for the drive, closed with good energy to be going
away at the end. BOBBYSFAVORITESONG broke alertly, cleared from the outside into the turn, dueled into the stretch and past the furlong marker, proved
no match for the winner late, game for the second spot. APRIORITY GIRL forwardly placed after an alert break, challenged outside the leader in the three
path turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker then hung late to be outfinished for the place. SENORITA TSUNAMI bothered at the start, void of
speed for three furlongs, came four wide out of the turn, found best stride too late while finishing up willingly. PERFECT PEACH within striking distance, into
the stretch off the inside, finished up evenly in lacking a late punch to lose a couple of positions late. ABIGAIL G void of speed, came five wide out of the
turn, displayed some interest outside while too late. LOUISIANA'S HOPE forwardly placed early along the inside, began to fade late in the turn. WHO DAT
GREY broke in, bothered foe, remained always back. KAITLYN'S COURT off a step slow, between rivals when racing back in the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
SNOWBALL outrun for a half while racing toward the inside, steered out from between horses entering the stretch, late surge well out in the strip to be clear
late. PLAY UNIFIED also well back off the early leaders, three wide exiting the turn while behind the winner, also shifted out a bit for the drive, finished
willingly to be in time for the place. TENSAS THOUGHT pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, took over turning for home, clear past the
furlong marker, led late, could not contain the top two. YES GORGEOUS within striking distance while racing outside, continued in a forward position
through the turn, lacked a winning response in the drive. SAINTS N MUSKETS broke back, moved up to race in mid pack toward the inside, also was found
lacking when called on for the drive. TIZ THE FAITH broke alertly, raced forwardly and outside in the early going, began to fade before four furlongs.
ECHOESOFTIME moved up to take control just after the start, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the inside then gave
way in the drive. SUZIE'S DREAM off a step slow, raced wide while always outrun.

Footnotes
GEAUX GOLDEN broke outward but alertly to put in tight and bother outer rivals, dueled up front off the inside, narrowly showed the way into the stretch
and past the furlong marker, shook clear then was kept to task with the run to the wire. RHETT'S RACER in the second flight early while between foes, fell
back a bit through the turn, came again for the place late, no real threat to the winner. ROSE RUNNER away in good order, alternated up front inside the
winner, could not keep up with that one inside the furlong grounds, caught late for the place. MADISON'S PLACE void of early foot after being in tight and
bothered at the break, came six wide into the lane, displayed some mild late interest down the middle of the strip to improve position. STANG IT in the
second group off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. ABLE CATCH in mid pack while racing
outside, came five wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. SANDY'S WAGER void of speed for three furlongs, improved position by passing mostly tiring
rivals. JOZZY BELL was never a serious factor. MISS INVADER off a step slow, had nothing for the drive. SASSY CAMILLE settled in the second flight
while between horses off the inside, gave way in the drive. FICKLE FLASH bothered at the break while being pushed out into outer rivals, raced back and
six wide, failed to muster a rally. SHE'S A PENALTY bothered at the start, remained always back.
