Footnotes
ODD GAL dueled inside of CAWAJA TIME while racing in the two path, drew clear in upper stretch and edged ahead under a drive. CAWAJA TIME dueled
outside of the winner in the three path to upper stretch, could not quite match strides with the winner from there and held well for the place. DIAMOND
NEWS lacked speed while racing three wide, came five into the lane, continued on the left lead and rallied for the show. FRONTIER WOMAN stalked the
duel in the four path and came up empty in the lane. AMPHITRITE chased the pace five wide, bore out leaving the quarter pole, quickly straightened out
and faded. CALINAS SONG chased the pace inside and weakened.

Footnotes
SARATOGA STYLE prompted the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, bore out near the quarter pole, lost significant momentum,
continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside and was up in the final strides. PRINCESS PALOMAR settled off the early pace four wide, bid four wide
around the far turn, was forced to steady off heels and angle in near the quarter pole, quickly went clear as SARATOGA STYLE continued to get out,
remained clear to deep stretch but was nailed in the final strides. CANOOCHEE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace four wide and lacked a rally.
THERE GOES MY GIRL failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SPLENDOR GAL broke in the air, saved ground around the first turn, advanced
inside down the backstretch, bid inside nearing the three-eighths pole then faded. VESTED VENTURE stumbled and bumped a foe at the start but still
broke on top and set the pace in the two path and gave way near the three-eighths pole. Following an inquiry and an objection from PRINCESS PALOMAR
against SARATOGA STYLE, the latter was disqualified from first and placed second for interference near the quarter pole.

pole, bid three wide in midstretch, drifted out, vied outside of the winner and was outfinished. MULTITUDE raced in range three wide and was one-paced in
