Footnotes
LA PAQUITA gained a short lead on the main track, set a pressured pace, shook clear nearing the turn, rode the rail then widened under a drive in the
stretch and was taken in hand approaching the wire. BOSSALINA stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and
finished under a determined drive. DAD'S MISSY, rated in range early, steadied slightly when FIVE DAYS IN MAY who was running alongside her clipped
heels and unseated her rider near the 5/8 pole. DAD'S MISSY was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, launched a rally but evened out in the late
stages. GIZMO FLASH stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. TOY SHOW
forced the early pace, prompted the leader on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. FIVE DAYS IN MAY, rated close to the early leaders, clipped heels
near the 5/8 pole and unseated her rider then walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT WITH DAD'S MISSY LEFT THE RESULTS AS
POSTED.

Footnotes
NOT ORBINARY, pinched back at the start, stalked the pace from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, led quickly and drove clear then held sway
under light handling. LIL'S TURN was herded inward leaving the gate, remained unhurried early then was hustled along the rail on the far turn, loomed
dangerous upper stretch but evened out late. CAPE MIST broke inward and settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, was blocked
behind traffic upper stretch then posted a mild late rally between foes. LADY BELLA raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but lacked a
closing response. GLIB MARYLIN settled in mid pack, chased three to five-wide on the far turn but although determined, failed to gain in the stretch.
SHAMRUCKUS, herded inward at the break, showed speed, set a pressured pace,shook clear on the far turn, led into the stretch, entertained a challenge
but failed to match strides with the winner and gave way. SHEZTENTHEHARDWAY forced the pace, dueled briefly on the backstretch, pressed the leader
on the turn, chased into the stretch and tired.

BLOCKBUSTER stalked the pace, came three and four-wide through the far turn, bid upper stretch, drew away and finished under a hand ride. ICE BLUE
raced in mid pack, rode the rail throughout, was hustled on the far turn, angled out a bit upper stretch and finished gamely. GHOST ISLAND set a pressured
pace from the rail, was headed upper stretch and gave way. SAN NICOLA BREW raced in mid pack, chased two to four-wide on the far turn, was game in
the stretch but failed to menace. DYNAMITE KARMA pressed the pace, forced the issue two and three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.
CHARLES STREET broke outward and was steadied sharply, raced from off the pace, was hustled through the far turn but failed to be a threat. CLEARLY
SEEN settled off the pace, saved ground but lacked a rally.

pack, chased from the rail late turn then rallied gamely. BLACK SAGE stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn and finished with a determined
drive. WARNING BELLE settled in mid pack, came three then two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and raced gamely to the end. ROSE RING
settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, angled out upper stretch and finished gamely. FRESHIEINTHEFOREST raced in mid pack, was
hustled four-wide on the turn then tendered a mild rally outside the field. READY'S PRINCESS settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the
stretch and showed some interest in the straight. BONNIE SCOT emerged with an early lead, set a pressured pace, was headed mid turn, chased to the
stretch then faded. J M R BOLD VISION stalked the pace five-wide, lost ground at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. TOUGHING IT OUT showed

Footnotes
RED QUEEN'S COURT showed early speed and set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch then held SIMPLY A ZOOMER safe under a
drive. SIMPLY A ZOOMER stalked the pacesetter, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, rallied through the stretch and gained steadily. PARABLE
forced the issue, put serious pressure on the pacesetter on the turn then chased through the stretch. LOST CORSAGE, bumped between foes at the start,
settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then showed a mild late close. SKY DRAGON was taken off the pace from the beginning, was
hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. CAPTURE THE MOMENT broke outward and bumped LOST CORSAGE, stalked the pace,
chased four-wide late turn but failed to menace. PASTEL EMILY raced in mid pack, came along the second path and the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.
CEDAR VALLEY was bumped at the start, raced in mid pack early, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then tired upper stretch.

Footnotes
DR. GREEN raced in mid pack, closed fast three and four-wide on the turn, came in under left-handed urging upper stretch while taking the lead and drew
clear ending on the rail and still under left-handed encouragement. MATINEE raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the far turn, altered course to avoid traffic
upper stretch and quickly regained the rail then rallied gamely for place. DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on
the far turn then rallied outside. LOVE OF MINE stalked the pace, bid three-wide on the far turn, dueled, came in upper stretch then shortly after making the
lead lost his path and evened out. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the final turn, encountered traffic upper
stretch, got clear and rallied in vain. RANGE OF MOTION settled in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn and finished evenly. SAMUEL H set a
pressured pace, was engaged midway through the far turn, dueled, gave way approaching the top of the stretch and tired. KEEP YOUR WORD settled in
mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but flattened out in the stretch. KUDURO pressed the pace, bid two-wide mid turn, dueled into the
stretch inside LOVE OF MINE, was forced in by that one then had to check when LOVE OF MINE was herded further inwards ultimately shutting KUDURO
off and who was then through. LOOKIN' FLY hit the gate leaving and was steadied then trailed throughout. CLAIMS OF FOUL LODGED BY LOVE OF
MINE AND KUDURO AGAINST DR. GREEN FOR INTERFERENCE UPPER STRETCH RESULTED IN DR. GREEN BEING DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST
AND PLACED NINTH.

Footnotes
WAVE WARNING settled in mid pack, was steadied behind traffic mid turn, angled out and closed three to six-wide, chased into the stretch, rallied and got
up in the final yards. WILD ABOUT BLUE stalked the pace, closed two-wide late turn, dueled into the stretch, battled to the wire but he and his rival DARK
ALE were passed as they approached the finish. DARK ALE stalked the pace, bid three-wide late turn, dueled through the stretch but was passed in the
final yards. HEAD KITTEN hit the gate leaving, settled in range, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened
out. DATA BOY raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. SEIFERT was
steadied at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide through the turn but failed to menace. STONEAWAY raced in mid pack, was hustled two
to four-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. SUNKA WAKAN showed speed, led into the turn, was pressured and ultimately joined near the
top of the stretch and tired. BIG MATTEO settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SPANISH TOWN
raced in mid pack, came three to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, but tired. MANNY shied inward from HEAD KITTEN at the start, settled
off the pace, saved ground but lacked a rally.
