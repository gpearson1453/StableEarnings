Footnotes
UNCLE KICK was unhurried while off the inside, advanced into the far turn from the four or three path, moved three wide near the three-eighths pole,
cleared into the lane and drew away while being ridden out. CIELO AZUL chased the pace along the inside through the turn, was a serious contender in
mid-turn then could only follow the winner home while saving the place spot. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY pressed the pace three wide into the far turn, continued
two wide and in the three path in mid-turn, was no match for the winner in late turn then could not gain the place spot. MARQUEE THUNDER was under a
strong hold through the first turn and into the backstretch, pulled to near the leaders near the half mile pole, was asked for more in mid-turn and was wore
out. SIR JOHN VINCENT was put in tight and steadied at the start, raced well back and in the two path and was never in it. DODGER set the pace into the
far turn and was suddenly done in mid-turn and it was subsequently revealed that a bridle malfunction caused the bit to slip that resulted in being pulled up
and walked off. Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MACI'S JAMMING pressed the pacesetter two wide through the turn, moved to duel with that one through the turn and into the lane, was joined by another
on the outside, was passed by that one inside the eighth pole, came again and gamely inched up late. WILD TAPIT chased the pace from the two path
through the turn, bid three wide after entering the lane, appeared to put her head in front inside the eighth pole and seemed to be a winner then could not
hold the top one safe. KATIE'S DAY set the pace while near the inside into the turn, was under pressure into the lane, dueled with the winner to the eighth
pole, was still a serious contender until late and yielded. MY GIRL LEXI raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and turned in an even effort.
MISS INHOFE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and and never was a factor. YOUAWAKEMYSOUL never
a factor while racing near the inside. SHES MY TREASURE was close up early while along the inside into the turn and faded. Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
TAP N TWINE was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn, gained momentum three wide into the lane, came over a bit and brushed the
runner-up, continued under right-handed urging while clearing and dropping to the rail then widened to the end. PERFECT JUSTICE vied for the early lead
along the inside, cleared before mid-turn, raced near the rail into the lane while remaining clear, was under pressure from the winner and brushed by that
one near the eighth pole then was no match while settling for second best. WICKED WAYS was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from
the three path and moved up for the show spot while not a serious threat. EXPRESS LADY vied for the lead from between rivals early, chased the pace
through the turn then weakened in the lane. STARGAZER LILY was never a serious factor while chasing near the rail. JULIPS HOLD never made an impact
while racing through the turn from the two path. SALTY SOLUTION vied for the early lead three wide and between rivals, chased the top ones into the lane
and was empty. KEE SHE pressed the pace four wide into the turn, continued to chase while in the four path and was done near mid-turn.

Footnotes
IDEA MAN was unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide through mid-turn, cleared after straightening in the lane, continued with a clear lead to the
sixteenth pole then was under a strong drive to hold the runner-up safe. VICTOR'S DEAL in the three path into the far turn when unhurried, gained
momentum in late turn and into the lane, raced in the three or four path through the lane and finished with good energy to be closing in at the wire. BLACK
SPARTACUS chased the pacesetter into the far turn while in the two path, bid before mid-turn, gained the lead but was joined by the winner soon after,
raced with that one into the lane but could not keep up although keeping on to save the show spot. FEVER TEMPLE was in the two path through the far turn
when towards the back, came into the lane from the four path and offered a mild rally and missed the show spot. MILLION DOLLAR RED was near rail
through the turns, came off the inside into the lane but lacked a closing response. ALTERNATE NIGHTS raced in the four to the three path through the turn,
raced widest and in the seven path through the lane and never was a menace. PROUD N FAMOUS chased the pace while along the inside and tired.
TOPPING set the pace into the far turn and was done nearing the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
LAVALIER off with a very alert start, was pressured through the first turn and into the backstretch, shook clear in late turn, continued to widen into the lane
and was kept to the task. IVORYSGOLDTREASURE was without urgency while racing along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, continued with good
energy through the stretch run and gained the place spot while coming out a path late. STACK SHACK pressed the winner from the two path, continued
closest to the winner into the lane, was no match for the winner while battling for the place spot between rivals and just lost the place spot late. ANGEL
FACE was in the two path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the four path after entering the lane then
offered a mild gain. SEEKING VIOLET was bumped at the start and settled back, raced in mid-pack while in the two or three path through the far turn ,
came into the lane from the five or six path and gained mildly to miss the next to spots by a neck. HAPPY SONRISA raced near the rail into the lane, came
off the rail for the drive, was looking to split rivals nearing the sixteenth pole when path closed, steadied and was not a threat thereafter. COCO CABALLO
was near the rail through the turns, still a contender into the lane then weakened. IRREVOCABLE TRUST was stuck out in the four path through the turns,
came into the lane from the seven path and weakened. LIL HITCHHIKER was in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the seven path
and finished near the ten path. PRINCESS LUCKY broke inwardly and bumped rival, raced in the three path into the backstretch, moved to press the
leaders into the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. DERBY PRINCESS was in the three path through the first turn, continued off the rail into the far
turn and was always outrun. LADY ELSA was done after going a half from the two path.

TEZ was unrushed early, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, circled the field and was clear late under mild urging. HARDLY A SECRET tended to the
pace in the three path, bid at the three-eighths pole and stuck his head in front briefly, but then couldn't hold off the winner. CHARLIE'SARCHANGEL dueled
outside of MISSISSIPPI but the pair couldn't last. HOUSE LIMIT stalked inside but had no bid. SOCIAL AFLEET stalked in the three path but faded in the
stretch. GIGGING improved position late. HOMBRAZO saved ground to no avail. ALTITO bobbled at the start. MOON OVER MONTANA was off
awkwardly.Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MARKET GARDEN sat off of the loose lead, rallied at the three-eighths pole, nabbed the lead midstretch and held sway under mild urging. TRAFFIC STOP
was unrushed early, saved ground, rallied in the three path on the far turn but couldn't get to the winner. WAZZUP CHUCK saved ground, bid at the quarter
pole but couldn't close late. ENGLISH SECRET drew clear early, then was reeled in through the stretch. He was then pulled up after the finish and vanned
home.HAY BO saved ground to no avail. SUGAR DOG FOX raced in the four path and had no late bid. TEMPLE BAR was not a factor. PRADAR stalked
the early pace before giving way. THE HALF MILE TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.
