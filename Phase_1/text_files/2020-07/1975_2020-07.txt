Footnotes
SHACKLELACKALACKA chased the pace through the turn while in the three path, bid after straightening in the lane, slowly inched up inside the eighth
pole, continued to inched up through the final sixteenth and edged up late. DA HIGH COMMISSION set the pace from the two path from the outset, ridden
confidently into the lane, was shook up nearing the eighth pole then could not hold the winner safe while clearly second best. GINORMOUS was in the three
or four path through the turn and into the lane, continued in the five path near the eighth pole and gained the minor share late. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP was
along the inside through the turn and into the lane then lacked the needed response. HYPNOTISING was in the two path through the turn, came into the
lane from the three or four path, was still in contention with an eighth to go then lost spots late. BRIBE never a factor while racing through the three path in
the turn and finishing near the eight path at the wire. VIVIAN stumbled at the start and spotted the back of the field about three lengths, trailed into the lane
and was never a threat. TWO CARROT RANSOM made little impact while racing along the inside.

Footnotes
LITTLE ALEX set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn, continued on a clear lead through late turn, was put under pressure after straightening, repelled
challenger inside the eighth pole and re-cleared late. PAQUIME chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn, bid when straightening in the
lane, loomed a serious threat with an eighth to go, could not stay with the winner and settled for second best when well clear for the place spot. TEXAS
GANO was unhurried while racing along the inside, came into the lane from the three path then moved up for the minor share. DIRTY DEEDS was slow
early while racing off the inside, angled into the six or seven path for the drive and moved up while never a threat. BEER CAN MAN chased the pace from
the three path through the turn and into the lane then weakened. LEMME C UR VOUCHER ducked into the gap and had to be redirected back to the
backstretch, raced in the four path through the turn and into the lane and tired. PASION AZTECA saved ground through the turn and was empty entering the
lane.

Footnotes
WALLAWALLABINGBANG gained the lead soon after the start, raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane while widening the advantage then
continued to increase the lead to the end while being kept to the task. ELITE ATTRACTION chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was
asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, continued under right-handed urging into the lane then could only chase the winner to the wire while second
best. YESTERDAYS KISSES tracked the pace while near the rail through the turn, was asked for more near the quarter pole, continued under a drive into
the lane then could not keep up with the top two. NATTY NORA was in the four path through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing response. WHO
WANTS WHAT was in the two or three path through the turn while in mid-pack, shifted into the six path just inside the eighth pole and was never a serious
threat. GLOWED was along the inside through the turn when not far back then weakened. UNDERTHECHERRYMUNE was in the two or three path through
the turn, came into the lane from the four path and passed tired ones. SECOND EXCHANGE was steadied soon after the start when lacking room raced
near the rail through the turn and never was a factor. DOWNDELANE never was a factor while in the four path through the turn. SHE LIKES CASH was
outrun while racing well off the rail through the turn. DYNAH MAC was checked between rivals near the five-eighths pole, raced in the two path through the
turn and faded.

Footnotes
LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE settled off the pacesetters down the backstretch, moved into the far turn from the three path, gained momentum after mid-turn,
moved to the leaders flank while coming into the lane, was under urging and not gaining on the top one until inside the eighth pole and surged late to edge
to the front. BEHOLD pressed the pacesetter two wide down the backstretch, moved to the front before the half-mile pole, continued on a clear lead while in
the two path through the far turn, was still clear inside the eighth pole while feeling pressure from the top one and could not hold that one safe while well
clear of the others. WANNA HAVE FUN unhurried while off the inside, moved through the two or three path in the far turn, came into the lane from the three
path and moved up for the minor share. ARIAN RAE set the pace along the inside into the backstretch, relinquished the lead before entering the far turn,
continued to chase the pace through the turn and tired in the lane. SASSY ZEEMAN was along the inside throughout and was finished near the quarter
pole. Race was hand timed

FIVE GRAND settled off the early pace while off the inside, bid four wide in mid-turn, continued momentum into the lane from five path, caught the leader
nearing the sixteenth pole and edged up. SACRED KIKI BIRD set the pace while under pressure into the turn, cleared into the lane, remained clear with a
wall of rivals approaching near the eighth pole, drifted out a couple of paths in deep stretch and yielded to the top one. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was
pressing the pace down the backstretch when steadied between rivals, settled back along the inside, raced in a pocket through mid-turn, stayed along the
rail and stayed on well while along the rail late. STILL CHIEF moved up from the four path to contend through the turn, continued as a top flight contender
after straightening in the lane, lost his path late when rival drifted out and finished close up. PENTIMENTO angled from the rail to the four path into the lane ,
continued in the six path and offered a mild gain. ROOSTER was never a factor while along the inside. UNBRIDLED BOILER pressed the pace two wide
early then faded through the lane. GIFTED JUSTICE was done early while in the two to the four path.AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #6 STILL CHIEF
AGAINST THE RIDER OF #1 SACRED KIKI BIRD FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH RESULTED IN THE DISQUALIFICATION OF #1 SACRED
KIKI BIRD FROM SECOND TO FOURTH.
