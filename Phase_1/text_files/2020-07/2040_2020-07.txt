Footnotes
A LITTLE FAITH broke out then was corrected by the rider, stalked the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole,
made an outside bid under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, took the advantage into the final furlong, battled outside two foes into the final sixteenth
and proved best under strong urging. SPEIGHTSTOWN GAL moved up after the start to take the lead, showed the way under pressure to her outside, vied
along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, battled with two opponents under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed
whip while headed near the furlong marker, fought into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. ELEGANT ZIP came away in
front, showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked while between horses outside the quarter-pole, came
under a right-handed whip while fighting between horses in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker and was out-kicked while
able to get the show. JC'S SHOOTING STAR dropped back after the start, settled at the rear under some urging, saved ground on the turn, was roused
coming to the three-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths and improved position. FIRST APPEAL settled nicely off the
pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide late on that bend, was roused while four wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed kick. LOVELY LA LA was urged along towards the rear, went three wide for most of the turn then moved to four wide, was carried five wide into the
stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SURPRISE sat in range of the front runners racing three wide, crept up as the half was being completed, challenged in earnest at the
three-sixteenths pole, took over, edged away to a comfortable advantage before getting geared down in the final stages. BANKERS DAUGHTER pursued
the pace from the three path, was under urging tipping one wider for the drive home, had a good finish down the center of the strip to garner the place.
VIVAZANO tracked the pace from the pocket, was moved into the two path coming up to the top of the lane, lacked the needed late response.
MONIFICENT vied for the top from along the inside route for a half and gave way. THEODORA GRACE four wide departing the backstretch, was slightly
closer to the rail at the head of the stretch, had no rally. BARBARA'S BANK got hand urged into a prominent position after bobbling at the break, sparred for
control from path two, wrested away the lead right around the five-sixteenths pole, only to have the winner poised to strike, was indeed put to the test by that
rival a sixteenth down the road, succumbed,. backed away steadily in the last eighth. NEW YORK SUPREME fought fiercely on the bit appearing unsettled
during the trip on the backstretch, stepped onto the turn from the two path, was somewhat more professional thereafter although pulling on the left, went into
the three path for the drive home, made no impact. LUCKY GIRL spotted along the inside route at the half mile pole, got driven four to five wide into the
stretch, had no offering.

Footnotes
STARSHIP JUBILEE brushed the off side stall at the start then got corrected inwards, grew a bit rank early pulling on the bit when under restraint as
NORTH BROADWAY sauntered off to the front still a bit unsettled by the start before settling in hand just off the inside through the first turn, raced two to
three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, came under urging nearing the five-sixteenths, advanced on the leader and angled five wide into upper stretch,
took over command straightened away, dug in under challenge through the final furlong and held gamely to the finish. CALL ME LOVE (GB) bobbled at the
start and recovered outwards, raced forwardly placed under rating along the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch leading the main flight
behind a spurting away leader, advanced on that rival in tandem with the field into the far turn, tipped out to the two path remaining in hand nearing the
quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and was set down for the drive straightened away, dug in rallying latched on the aforementioned
foe through the length of the stretch fighting on gallantly but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire in a good effort. SISTERCHARLIE (IRE) brushed the off side
stall at the start, settled near the rear of the compact field just off the inside through the first turn and down the backstretch, tipped three wide through the far
turn put to urging three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive willingly through the stretch briefly on the wrong lead
until a sixteenth out while offering up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BRAMBLE QUEEN saved ground at the tail of the field, came under
encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the furlong grounds and was outkicked through to
the finish. NORTH BROADWAY lightly coaxed from the gate, established the front and spurted away in command along the inside in hand, widened away
down the backstretch, remained along the inside through the far turn as the field took closer order, came under light urging near the quarter pole, spun just
off the inside for home, yielded the front straightened away and tired.

Footnotes
SPANISH POINT moved in while showing good speed on the inside, showed the way while joined on the outside by GONE GLIMMERING outside the
half-mile pole, vied inside to the two path on the turn, shook clear while cutting the corner into upper stretch, responded well when put to a right-handed
whip outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a brisk hand ride in the final sixteenth
while much the best. LADY C jostled with a rival in the early going while brushing lightly with another foe, settled off the pace, chased three wide on the turn,
was put to the whip in upper stretch, chased the winner on the outside under a drive and was second best. GRACETOWN showed speed then pressed the
pace on the inside, chased along the rail on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch under a drive, chased the winner under the whip into the final furlong and
weakened but was clear for the show. CAPE COD DIVA bobbled at the start, brushed lightly with a rival early, settled at the rear of the field, saved ground
on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch then was put to the whip and lacked the needed response. GONE GLIMMERING bumped hard with a rival at
the start then bobbled while last away, moved out then rushed up on the outside, made a bid outside the half-mile pole, vied in the four path on the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. WEDONTBELIEVEHER bumped hard with a foe at the start, jostled with foes while carried in some early,
settled between horses, brushed with a foe near the half-mile pole, was urged along while four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and
failed to respond. OK HONEY was hustled from the start then brushed with a rival early, jostled with a foe while carried in some outside the five-eighths,
settled on the outside under some urging, brushed with a foe near the half-mile pole, went five wide on the turn, drifted in near the furlong marker and also
failed to respond.

THREE OUTLAWS away without apparent mishap, secured a forward position proceeding along the backstretch, entered the turn, sat perched two to three
wide with a good view of the ongoing pace dispute a short distance up ahead, moved when ready departing the five-sixteenths pole, tipped into the three
path spinning onto the head of the stretch, responded when given his cue in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, emerging at the eighth pole as
the new leader, drew out to lead by approximately two and a half lengths at one time, then stayed on well thereafter to stay in the clear. SIR ALFRED
JAMES worked out a tuck along the inside route after stepping onto the turn, kept an eye on the front runners from midpack, picked up interest getting
maneuvered to the outside approaching the quarter pole, fanned out wider and wider for optimal racing clearance, found it in the five path by midstretch,
displayed good energy rallying down the center of the course for the place. STANDUP pursued the pace from the three path on the turn, completed the run
around the bend, was worked into path six during the stretch run, finished with willingness, missed out on second. UNPRECEDENTED settled in midpack
after the start, chased the pace two wide on the turn, angled four wide for the drive home, battled to the end, had to settle for the final significant slice of the
purse. OUR TROUBADOUR took the inside route, suffered through the briefest of waits as SIR ALFRED JAMES was getting steered to the outside past the
five-sixteenths pole, tipped out into the three path in upper stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. BIG WONDER dueled for the lead from along the rail until
the three-sixteenths pole, faltered. DUBAI BOBBY cut over to the rail, got asked to pick it by midway on the turn, cut the corner into the lane, was making
some headway until forced to get taken in hand and idle behind another at the furlong grounds, failed to regain any interest. COOLBOY sparred for the top
from path two until the three-sixteenths pole, backed away ready springing from that station. INK SPLOTZ squeezed at the start, made it over to the rail by
the end of the backstretch, swung out three wide entering the stretch, failed to close ground, then went on to wander out into the six path late to no avail.

SKYLER'S SCRAMJET three then two wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, got let out near the quarter pole and swung just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive steadily wearing down the leader to take over in the last jumps inching away to the finish. ARISTOCRATIC showed the way in
hand just off the inside, tucked inside near the half mile pole, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive under threat through the final furlong and was caught in the final strides to the finish. MOJOVATION bobbled at the start then got bumped by
MALPAIS who recovered outwards from a stumble, conceded three lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased five then four wide
advancing under coaxing through the latter portion of the turn, went four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors.
COLTANDMISSISSIPPI four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
and paused as SKYLER'S SCAMJET drifted out slightly near the eighth pole awaiting AMOJOVATION to clear outside, tipped out to the outside of that rival
and kept on to the finish under a drive but was outkicked. PREAMBLE chased along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, weakened in the
drive. SEETHISQUICK chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home, offered no rally, then got pulled up after the
finish and cooled down with a hose and bucket of water before walking off under his own power. AUTOSTRADE chased just off the inside under a ride from
the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. MALPAIS stumbled badly at the start recovering outwards and
bumping MOJOVATION conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
DON JUAN KITTEN settled in second position in the two path while far behind the runaway leader, gained on that tiring foe in the two path on the far turn,
swept to the lead while three wide into the stretch then drifted in while kicking clear, drew away under a right-handed whip into the final furlong, swapped
back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole then was switched to a left-handed whip and maintained a save advantage under steady urging. LONESOME
FUGITIVE (IRE) brushed with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, moved closer while inside on the far turn,
waited behind horses from outside the quarter-pole into upper stretch, shifted out while asked at the three-sixteenths then came under a drive, bumped with
KINGMEISTER near the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to get the place. KINGMEISTER brushed with a rival at the start then bobbled ever
so slightly, was taken under a tight hold early then reserved on the inside, came under urging while moving closer on the far turn, pursued the winner under
a drive into the final furlong, bumped with the runner-up near the sixteenth-pole and missed the place while able to get the show. PERJURY TRAP went two
then three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, steadied
briefly off the heels of the stopping pacesetter at the three-sixteenths then shifted out and improved position. MAROON MANIAC brushed with a foe at the
start then was taken under a very snug hold early, saved ground under restraint on the first turn, moved out inside the five-eighths, was roused in the two
path on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. ARITHMETIC went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was
urged along while moving closer in the three path on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. PROVEN
STRATEGIES broke out then brushed with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled in third on the outside, was asked while three wide and moving
closer on the far turn, chased into the stretch and tired. MONTAUK DADDY was hustled to the lead, sprinted clear at break-neck speed, opened up a huge
advantage on the inside while setting a blistering pace, shortened stride on the far turn, was collared into the stretch and faded. (Rail at 9 Feet) HALF-MILE
FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO THE SENSOR BEING TRIPPED EARLY

Footnotes
PRIORITIZE guided over to the rail early on the clubhouse turn, patiently tracked the front runners during the initial stages, was switched over to a drive
leaving the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch from the two path, rallied in tandem with MONEY MOVES, closed the gap enough so as to spark off
a three-way tussle beginning in the neighborhood of the sixteenth marker, poked a head down in front with approximately a seventy yards to go, dug in
stubbornly for the few remaining jumps left to the wire to preserve the decision. MONEY MOVES made contact with LEITONE after bobbling to the outside
at the break, got going soon afterwards, underwent a two to three wide journey to the quarter pole, being more the latter on the far turn, angled three wide
for the drive, hooked up with the winner as they narrowed in on the one to catch, hitched up to the leader right around the sixteenth pole, vied as the widest
of three until deep stretch, saw the top one claim the top first, fought onward, but wasn't able to go by. LOCALLY OWNED away quickly from the starting
gate, dove into the two path coming up to the end of the homestretch, was rated along prompting the pacesetter, that being PARSIMONY, kept the pressure
on all the way to the quarter pole, challenged in earnest at the head of the stretch, claimed the advantage several strides later, left the eighth pole holding its
largest lead but with the top twosome both posing a threat to his outside, was forced to fend each off beginning from the vicinity of the sixteenth pole,
relinquished for good in the final seventy yards and weakened into the show slot. DYNAMAX PRIME took the inside until the conclusion of the backstretch,
was let out a notch tipping into the two path at the half mile pole, angled out four wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response for the last major check. I
LOVE JAXSON cut over to the inside right after departing the homestretch, slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch two to
three wide, made no impact. PARSIMONY established the top in short order, went over to the rail, showed the way attended by LOCALLY OWNED to the
outside, initially rating kindly and then while being lightly hand urged on the far turn, was put to the test by the previously-mentioned foe in upper stretch,
gave in, then steadily backed away. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE sneaked over to the rail on the first turn, remained along on the backstretch and turn two too,
got maneuvered into the two path at the top of the lane, had no offering, then was allowed to fade away in the final furlong. LEITONE (CHI) underwent a
three wide journey after bumping lightly with the second place finisher, lost his speed abruptly as three-quarters was being completed, got pulled up after
being eased, subsequently walked off the track.

Footnotes
TURBO DRIVE got placed in tight between foes at the start and was paused, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under light coaxing near the
quarter pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and found himself a large usable seam down the middle of rivals as traffic went to the inside and far outside
like a parting sea, rallied on through to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish
kept busy to the end. SANCTUARY CITY just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying in tandem with STEELERSFANFORLIFE to his inside, had that rival drift and was brushed nearing the sixteenth
marker while offering up a mild kick to secure the place honors. JIMMY JAZZ three wide through the opening bend, chased four then three wide from mid
pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the front, swung four wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths,
dug in under a drive under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, then kept on to preserve the show honors. STEELERSFANFORLIFE a bit fractious prior
to the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge
through the final furlong, drifted out brushing with SANCTUARY CITY near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in the late stages. MO READY a bit
fractious in the gate prior to the start, tracked pace just off the inside getting bumped early on with seven and a half furlongs remaining by BARLEEWON
when getting position into the first turn, settled just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace in behind a trio vying for command upfront, came under light
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and was stymied in behind the three former pace makers as they fizzled in front unable
to tip out on pause until nearing the sixteenth pole, tipped out once able and was roused to finish with interest to the wire. JO'S BOLD CAT coaxed from the
gate, raced three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into
upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. ALBIE broke in at the start leaning on CORAGESCONTENDER, vied along the inside of a pair coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong.
CORAGESCONTENDER got leaned on at the start by the aforementioned foe who broke inwards, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, lacked optimal clearance at the three-sixteenths while under light coaxing, gained some room and was
unable to move through the seam when weakening in the final eighth. SIMPLY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing spinning just off
the inside for home, went to tip out and thought better of it taking to the rail near the three-sixteenths and was stymied in behind foes attempting to tip out
and becoming further entrenched near the eighth pole and was on pause through to the sixteenth marker, then once extracted could not make an impact.
BARLEEWON bumped with MO READY seven and a half furlongs from home, vied between foes from the two path coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. STANHOPE three wide through the first turn, vied three wide outside
a pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and tired. CURLIN'S LEGACY saved ground detached at the tail of the
field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
VOLATILE came away in good order then angled in while in front, was well rated while setting a tepid pace, controlled the action while inside to the two path
on the turn, was given his cue coming to the quarter-pole, responded well under a vigorous hand ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed whip at the
furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip at the sixteenth-pole and held under a strong hand ride to the wire. WHITMORE became fractious in the gate
then broke through the front, was brought back around and reloaded after a neighboring foe acted-up and was scratched in the process, brushed with a rival
at the start, was taken under a tight hold when VOLATILE crossed in front early then rated under stout restraint on the inside, drafted inside while still under
a tight hold on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, went to a right-handed whip while chasing behind the
winner at the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then moved to the outside and finished with good courage for the
place. MIND CONTROL stalked the pace on the outside then two to three wide on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed whip
while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, switched to the proper lead near the furlong marker and was out-kicked but determinedly earned third.
FIRENZE FIRE brushed with a foe at the start, settled on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was roused at the top of the stretch, came under a
right-handed whip around the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and was also out-kicked then missed third.

TIMELESS JOURNEY found refuge along the inside route during the first stages of the run around the clubhouse bend, patiently tracked the front runners,
git cued up spinning into the lane, was gradually maneuvered into the two path, attained it by midstretch with optimal clearance for the asking, split rivals
and closed in with good energy on the one to catch, struck the front end in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, kicked clear before switched over to a light hand
ride for the last few jumps. MICROMILLION well held in the two path proceeding along the first turn, travelled three to four wide on the subsequent one,
came into the lane being roused, launched a four wide from the eighth pole to get up for the place. HERWAZE was rated along prompting PEERLESS from
the outside, led the field onto the top of the lane, got overhauled with approximately a sixteenth to go, weakened into the show slot. EIGHTY SEVEN
NORTH quickly sent over to the rail, rode it to the quarter pole, was under encouragement spinning to the outside into the stretch, attempted to follow the
same route taken by the winner, mustered up a milder kick after splitting rivals herself in midlane. MIZZEN THE MARK saved ground until the conclusion of
the backstretch, was worked into the three path from the top of the far turn to its midway point, went into the lane, flattened out. BROVIA strung out three
wide on the first turn, was two wide and in between rivals on the backstretch, ventured onward in path two after departing it, got sent out back into the path
three during the initial portion of the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. MOLLY'S NIGHTHAWK underwent a two to three wide trip to the quarter pole,
fanned out into the six path during the stretch run, made no impact. PEERLESS showed the way from along the rail, shadowed by HERWAZE to her
outside, released the advantage somewhere around the quarter pole, steadily backed away down the stretch. TORNADO CROSSING four wide on the first
turn, took up the chase from the three path on the next one, had no rally. FRENCHIE FROU FROU sluggish saving ground until the half mile pole, moved
into the three path coming up to midpoint, arrived in the stretch, made no impact. BABY GIRL hung out three wide on the opening bend, was about two wide
on the far turn, launched no bids. GO ZAPPEM mostly two wide in pursuit of the pace, steadied while tiring at the five-sixteenths pole, came into the lane
and readily retreated.
