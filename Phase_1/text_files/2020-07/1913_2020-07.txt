Footnotes
COWBOY TOBY broke inwardly and exchanged a brush with a rival, raced forwardly and outside runners, went four then three wide on the turn, drifted out
a bit leaving that bend then continued to drift out while clear through the stretch. KEATON was forwardly-positioned between runners early, dropped back
late up the backstretch, pursued in behind the leaders three then four wide on the turn, moved out six deep into upper stretch then a bit further as the leader
drifted out, could make no headway late. INDY MOON raced in the back half well off the early leaders near the inside, went in the two then three path on the
turn and asked for run early on that bend, swung out seven wide turning for home and having gained ground, drifted out under a left-handed whip and
evened out late. BLAZING THUNDER was between rivals near the lead into the turn, continued to vie from inside a foe but in the three then two path on that
turn, drifted out four deep leaving that bend and continued to weaken. SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE lacked early speed despite encouragement, switched out
heading up the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn and improved position while running evenly. TRUCKSTOP AFFAIR exchanged a hard bump
at the start, showed brief speed from between runners, dropped back leaving the backstretch going in the four to five path through the turn before moving
out eight wide turning for home, was empty in the lane. SUN TREADER broke a bit awkwardly and steadied in tight quarters, raced on or just off the rail
through the turn and was never a threat. NEXTPORTOFCALL stumbled at the start, moved forward inside to vie for the lead, dropped back entering the turn
and came up empty. PAIN FOR GAIN exchanged a hard bump with inside foe and minor one with outside at the start, was far back in about the three path
into and on the turn and made no bid. Following a stewards' inquiry as well as objection by the rider of KEATON against COWBOY TOBY alleging
interference, no action was taken.

Footnotes
FLAXY LADY tracked from between the second flight going two to three wide, came out four wide out of the far turn commencing a bid, struck the lead by
the top of the stretch, drew clear. STORMY WORLD dueled outside a foe early going three wide, dispatched that sparring partner on the far turn but was
challenged by the aforementioned, proved no match but held the place from HUNKA BULL, who was outside the second flight three wide early then four
wide on the far turn, flattened out in the lane. RHYTHM'N SONG was inside the second flight tracking along the rail, began to move out near the quarter
pole, was four wide and under urging by the top of the stretch but faile dto rally. MISS DOMESIUS dueled inside a rival but off the fence, weakened.
NORTHERN FERN raced off the inside in the two to three path on the first turn, was a bit wider going three to four deep up the backstretch and on the far
turn, failed to produce a bid. STORM SHAKER was fractious in the gate then broke slowly while hopping, encouraged along early racing in the two path into
the first turn, drifted out briefly then came back in on that bend, moved out up the backstretch, went five wide on the far turn, tired in the lane.

Footnotes
KRIS WHO was quickly clear of rivals and shifted in, went into the turn just off the rail, widened leaving that bend into upper stretch still on or just off the
fence, held sway. SIDNEY'S HOPE tracked from inside, saved ground on the turn before coming out three wide into upper stretch, chased the winner home
but was second best. MEGA SOURCE was in a bit tight after the break, raced well back early, began to advance in the two to three path on the turn then
continued to gain mildly in the stretch to get up for show honors. E BAR GOLD steadied slightly at the break, raced inside in the two path into the turn but
soon moved out, came four wide past the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed late kick. KARAOKE CAT was bumped into a rival and pinched back at
the start, spotted the field several lengths heading up the backstretch, shifted in and saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn, gained late inside.
CAMINETTO switched outside the eventual winner entering the turn and chased that one three wide then weakened. THE GHOST OF DIXIE chased from
outside, dropped back in the four path on the turn and came up empty. MEMORY TAKER was bumped at the break, raced mid-pack going five wide on the
turn and failed to rally. TAMMY'S SHADOW shifted in entering the turn going in about the three path through much of that bend in the back half of the field,
came out leaving that bend and was never near enough to threaten. MR. FEARLESS bumped the inside rival at the start, was wide into the turn moving in
from seven deep to about five wide early on that bend, was not a threat.

Footnotes
SHANGROYAL forced the pace from outside, went four then three wide on the turn, edged clear into upper stretch then extended the margin while being
kept to task. CATS SURFIN stalked mid-pack, went four wide on the turn reaching striking distance by the head of the lane but could not kick on late and
shared the place with LONS OXBOW, who was forwardly-positioned between runners, went three wide on the turn just off the winner, began to weaken late
on that bend but kept on enough to share second. ANOTHER BROTHER broke a half-step slowly, was caught five wide on the turn, moved out seven deep
into upper stretch and ran on. DONTPREACHTO DARCY was mid-pack just off the inside, went two then three wide on the turn, came out four wide into
upper stretch, offered no nlate bid. FLY FIRST CLASS chased briefly from between runners, dropped back, went in the four path on the turn and continued
to weaken. GOLDEN BAND stumbled at the start then was urged forward pressing from inside foes but in the two path into the turn, moved nearer the rail
on that bend and came up empty. MR VIEW switched out in the early going, kept wide in the four to six path on the turn and wider still for the drive, failed to
rally. OFF THE WAGON trailed early, went in the two path on the turn before coming out in upper stretch, was never a threat.

Footnotes
BLUE BEES was coaxed forward inside foes to take command past the half-mile marker, dictated terms from the two path, drew away under steady
handling. MORO MAN exchanged light brushes early, was between runners early then chased inside moving to the rail entering the turn, was no match for
the winner but held the place. CHET WHO broke outwardly, settled mid-pack inside, shifted out midway on the turn going four deep past the quarter pole,
improved position in the lane. S S DIAMOND hopped and steadied at the start, was unhurried near the inside, went into the turn in the two path, angled five
wide leaving that bend and evened out in the drive. KABULL attended the early pace then continued to chase from outside rivals, went five wide moving in
three deep on the turn, weakened. SIXTH GEAR was not a threat racing five to six wide on the turn. CAUSING CHAOS brushed the inside foe at the start
then exchanged brushes with a different rival early while pursuing from between runners, went four wide into the turn then moved in a bit to be two deep
later on that bend, came up empty in the stretch. F S GOLD chased the pace, went three wide and was floated out five deep on the turn while dropping
back, continued to fade. GIVE IT AWAY was brushed at the break and urged along while shifting in early, went in the two path far back into and on the turn
and was never a threat. CROWN N RUBY refused to break and walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.
