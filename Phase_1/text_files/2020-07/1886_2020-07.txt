LOOP THE LOOP chased two wide and closed a gap under strong urging through deep stretch. INSPIRED GEM sped to a clear lead just after the break,
angled to the inside, remained clear into late stretch but couldn't last. DOCS WAY raced along the rail while inside the winner for over a half then couldn't
keep up late. MARY ELIZABETH stayed inside early, ran out leaving the turn, lugged in soon after and made up some ground. TONIGHT MAYBE was slow
to settle, stayed inside around the turn, angled out in midstretch and finished willingly. OVER THIRSTY raced two wide, was carried wide into the stretch
and gained mildly. WISFULL DRINKING was no factor. ROSES FROM HEAVEN trailed after a slow break. Off time was delayed 12 minutes after DOC
MEEKS dropped her rider and ran off before being loaded.

made a run along the rail into the stretch, angled out then in to the rail in early stretch, moved closer inside the winner in midstretch then flattened out.
PHILOSOPHY settled early, raced the two path around the turn, gained mildly through the lane and was eased up late. MOE TROUBLE ducked in sharply
while slow leaving the gate, lagged into the stretch then made a belated run. MORGAN S. came out into ADMIRAL ABE soon after the break then wasn't a
factor. An objection by Gonzalez against the winner was not allowed. AMBLIN MAN chased the winner two wide between horses to the stretch then tired.

JANE was unhurried, rallied two wide around the final turn then closed a gap from the outside through deep stretch. STICK UP drew out to a lengthy lead
under confident rating, was put to urging inside the final furlong, remained clear into deep stretch but couldn't last. OFFERYOUCANTREFUSE lagged early
then made a belated run. LIL SURVIVOR stayed inside early, came out entering the stretch and lacked a closing. SANSA chased the early leader then tired.
REYANA REYA DREAMS was no factor.

ROMAN BELLA was unhurried, began a run two wide on the turn, closed quickly through the lane and was along in time. FAST INTENTIONS was sent on a
strong three wide run into the turn to vie, took over midway on the bend, held a short lead under pressure to the final yards but couldn't last. SUNDAY IN L B
C showed speed outside from the start, angled to the rail on the turn and continued with good courage through the lane. BANK ROLLIN wasn't far back
early, raced the three path around the turn and lacked a rally. NEARLY MISSED lagged and found best stride too late. MOON HEIST dueled along the rail
into the turn and was finished before a half.

HIDE THE RANSOM stalked in hand outside the early leader, eased to the front in the three path midway on the turn, drew out entering the stretch and won
off with plenty left. TYLER advanced inside on the backstretch, couldn't gain on the winner but was clearly second best. MUNSOOR wasn't far back outside,
was put to whip three wide on the turn then tired in the lane. LORD WINSALOT broke slowly, angled out on the turn, circled into the stretch and passed tired
ones. GADAGO was slow early then came inside tired ones in the lane. LOON was hustled to the front at once, stayed out from the rail while with the pace
for just over a half then stopped. HANDSOME BOY swung wide between horses into the stretch and tired. START CASHIN was close up between horses
into the turn, raced two wide into the stretch and stopped.

GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was content to lag early, rallied the rail around the final turn, remained along the inside into the stretch and drew out under urging.
BIG BLIND settled, rallied into tight quarters two wide between horses leaving the quarter pole, was squeezed between horses entering the stretch and
proved second best once clear. IMPOSSIBLE MISSION was slow early, circled into the stretch to get closer then flattened out. AWESOME TRACKER
made the pace along the inside for just over three-quarters, ran out some entering the stretch then tired. TWO RED CENTS was caught four wide around
the first turn while with the pace, remained prominent two wide into the stretch then stopped. NORMANDY BEACH wasn't far back early, raced three wide

Footnotes
SUNNY HOLLY was rated in good position inside, ran clear leaving the furlong grounds then lasted. TWO FOR TEN broke slowly, stayed inside and closed
a gap too late. STEADY ROCK was slow early, sharply angled out nearing the stretch to be wide into the lane then made up ground outside. MERROW
ducked out leaving the gate, recovered to make the early pace out from the inside and faded late while drifting badly. TORNERO made a mild two wide run
into the stretch then flattened out. LUNAR STAR was outrun. MARLEE'S MAGIC pressed outside in the three path to the stretch, stopped and was eased
up. TALLULAH DARLING wasn't far back in the four path to the stretch then stopped.
