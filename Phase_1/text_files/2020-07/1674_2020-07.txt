Footnotes
MOSIENKO four to five wide in pursuit, advanced midway on the turn in tandem with LA NEGRITA to overthrow the top pair five-sixteenths from home,
swung five wide into upper stretch placed to light coaxing, edged clear under a hand ride and was shown the stick to the off side, then got taken in hand
near the finish safely in front at the wire. LA NEGRITA coaxed from the gate, chased three then four wide advancing on the top pair in concert with the
aforementioned foe midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a mild kick to be clear of the rest for the place
honors. QUEENDOM grew a bit fractious prior to the start and broke through the gate going for a short stroll before being reloaded, got away to an awkward
start bobbling to the near side, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved
position for the show honors. CHASING LOSSES broke out a step at the start and came under hustling, showed the way in hand just off the inside under
some pressure from GIPSEY SORCERESS to the outside, got displaced near the five-sixteenths by the eventual winner, spun just off the inside for home
and tired. BARBARA P chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, made no impact. GIPSEY SORCERESS
pressed the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RIVENDELL took up residence in midpack after the field had been sent on its way, was well rated stalking the front runners from the two path, waited behind
others coming up to the quarter pole before having the pilot commit to the outside, angled sharply five wide into the stretch, straightened away and kicked in
with good energy, went past duelers with approximately a sixteenth remaining, then edged away, ridden out in the final seventy yards. TOO SEXY unhurried
keeping an eye on the pace combatants while stationed in the two path, got cued up for the drive home, crept up, altered course over to the rail after
splitting foes in midstretch, with it worth noting that this occurred right after KEMBA had shifted inward prior, vied with vigour as a duel between those two
commenced, got reeled in by the top one in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, fought on hard to procure the place. KEMBA sparred for control from the two
path, turned slightly wider into the lane in front by a slim margin, moved back into the two path just as TOO SEXY began to loom boldly, saw a duel between
ignite, remained engaged with that opponent after RIVENDELL had inhaled them, fell short of saving second. JASMINESQUE along the outside throughout,
pursued the pace three wide on the turn, got sent out into path six during the initial portion of the stretch, becoming the widest of all, mustered up a mild
response sufficient enough to claim the last major check. RISK MODEL tucked into the two path before departing the backstretch, sat within range of the
front runners, went four wide into the lane, got outkicked. SING ME HOME (GB) stayed along the inside route after the break, was sighted travelling on the
turn being hand urged, got steered into the two path at the head of the stretch, came up empty. MORALITY CLAUSE disputed the pace from along the rail
until the quarter pole before giving way.

FED FUNDS broke a half a beat slow and awkward bumping into LORENZEN, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, went three wide into upper stretch, angled in to the rail at the three-sixteenths and rallied up
the inside to take command near the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. HEIGHT four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. TRI SAINT
LORENZO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand from the three path under some pressure from WARFRONT FIGHTER to the outside, tucked to
the rail into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home, dug in under threat and came out just inside the
three-sixteenths bumping WARFRONT FIGHTER while clinging to command, got displaced at the eighth pole by that rival and kept on knocking heads to
the finish to procure the show honors. WARFRONT FIGHTER five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch latched on the leader, tucked three wide
through the turn and steadily increased the pressure while patiently handled, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in and was
bumped just inside the three-sixteenths as TRI SAINT LORENZO came out, took over narrow and brief command a furlong from home, got displaced near
the sixteenth pole and weakened in the late stages. CORKMAN broke in at the start forcing HAPPYANDIKNOWIT to be taken in hand in behind, chased
four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. LORENZEN coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside from just off the pace, got ridden along at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going.
LITTLE MAZZY five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened.
HAPPYANDIKNOWIT got taken in hand at the start as CORKMAN crossed directly in front, chased two to three wide from the tail of the field, came under a
ride at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. UNION CHARM a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased
just off the inside coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
BRAY away without apparent mishap, raced three wide on the clubhouse bend, tucked closer to the rail prior to arriving to the next turn, flashed some
interest seeking passage to the outside as three-quarters was being completed, checked off the heels of MANDATE at the five-sixteenths pole, gained
access to path three right afterwards as HALSTAAT began to call it day, got roused angling farther to the outside into the stretch, wound up in the
neighborhood of path six a furlong later, forged to the front with under an eighth to go then dug in well to preserve the decision. MANDATE was mostly three
wide on the turns taking up the chase, swung five wide into the stretch, had a good finish down the center of the course en route for the place. CATORAT
rank at many intervals of the contest, took up the chase from path two for three-quarters, was still rankly fighting the pilot coming into the lane, got steered
out seven wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, as well as being positioned out of harm's way for any of the others, rallied for the show.
KILRONAN made contact with SNEADS in the shadow of the starting gate, was eased back as RIVER KNIGHT was assuming control on the first turn,
loosely drafted behind that foe for a spell before tipping to that opponent's outside midpoint on the backstretch, prompted the leader from path two on the
turn, was more in the three path challenging in earnest at the head of the stretch, fought well, but couldn't claim the top, weakened late. TORRES DEL
PAINE off the inside throughout, travelled three wide on the second bend, commenced the stretch slightly wider, continued onward for another furlong as a
prominent factor before flattening out. MY SACRED PLACE at or near the two path in pursuit of the front runners, was under a drive spinning into the
stretch, lacked a kick. RIVER KNIGHT cut over to the rail after establishing the top on the opening bend, was coaxed along showing the way on a
loosely-contested lead, felt an uptick in pressure as the third fraction was being finalized, was turned loose, got overhauled in midlane and backed away.
SNEADS bumped at the start, was towards the rail during the early going, got steered into the two path at the top of the lane, came up empty. HALSTAAT
strung out four wide on the first turn, raced two to three wide on the subsequent one, folded. BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE was guided over to the inside route,
stepped onto the far turn in tight quarters, had the rider lose the whip appearing to bump into the rail a sixteenth down the road, continued to save ground
while nearly trailing throughout. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on CATORAT for an incident at the top of the far turn, the result was allowed to stand
and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
KID CHOCOLATE coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide
into upper stretch, angled in straightened away then tipped out near the eighth pole, dug in under a drive rallying to tackle the top pair inside the sixteenth
pole, then inched away to the finish. DARING DISGUISE prompted the pace from the three path down the backstretch and then vied between foes from the
two path through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head and took narrow command a
furlong out, dueled through to the sixteenth marker, got overhauled in tandem with his main pace rival and kept on to preserve the place honors. FREUDIAN
ANALYST broke out at the start brushing BLESSED HONOUR, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from DARING DISGUISE to
the outside before coming under threat from a trio through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and was headed a furlong out, fought on knocking heads to the sixteenth marker before backing away in the last jumps while clear for the
show honors. NERO'S FIDDLE four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and stayed on
one paced to the finish. UNLIKELY chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved
position by tired rivals. BLESSED HONOUR brushed at the start by FREUDIAN ANALYST, who broke outwards, chased along the inside and was under
restraint off the heels of the rival briefly making contact with the rail five and a half furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and tired. ANYONEELSEBUTYOU chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, made no impact. WELL IN TUNE got off to an awkward beginning conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three to four wide down the
backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LONG
ISLAND CITY broke open the stall door prior to the start, raced four wide in aim of the leader before advancing to vie three wide between foes through the
turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SNAPPY CAT five to six wide in range of the front, advanced to vie
four wide through the turn outside a trio under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
RIKEN gained the advantage shortly after the start, moved over to the inside route, extended the margin while on cruise control during the run around the
bend, waited until the three-sixteenths pole before getting turned loose, even though the closest pursuers were all being urged along in varying degrees late
on the bend, saw the runner up whittle away at the deficit, managed to hold sway. MISTER BOBBY bumped with FEVOLA shortly after the start, went to
track the winner from the pocket, was set down to an all out drive at the five-sixteenths pole, slipped into the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch,
failed to cut the deficit during the ensuing furlong, ventured onward under strong handling, came out a bit with approximately a sixteenth to go, closed late.
BIG BOY MO gradually made his way to the rail, getting there just shy of the half mile pole, bided time in midpack, got angled out three wide into the lane,
wound up getting placed behind several others, with no promising clear paths for the asking, had the pilot take hold and alter course back to the rail in the
general area of the three-sixteenths pole, launched a mild rally for the show. CRYPTOGRAPHER travelled two to three wide on the turn, got sent out six to
seven for the stretch run, had some gain. VENTUS off a half length the fasted, saw the top one grab control in short,order, ran three wide on the turn, was
about as wide into the lane, lacked the needed response. FEVOLA bumped with the runner up right after the start, appeared unsettled while between rivals
early, departed the backstretch from path two and no longer quite so much amongst others as before, stalked the top one from path two, got set down as
the half was being completed, gave way. COACH VILLA three wide onto the turn, was four wide exiting it, failed to fire appreciably. TAPIZEARANCE
chased the pace from the two path, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
CHALEUR (GB) three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down continuing just off the inside for home, rallied to take command a furlong out,
inched away briefly before digging in under late threat to hold on and prevail over a pair. STONE TORNADO (GB) just off the inside near the rear of the
field, tucked inside half a mile from home, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied in behind rivals and spied a slight seam inside the eighth
pole, bumped MADELEINE MUST twice to open a lane for herself near the sixteenth pole and surged on through to miss at the finish. SHE'S GOT YOU
(GB) three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive surging late to miss
outside the top pair on the wire. MADELEINE MUST (FR) three then two wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive tepidly threatening through the final furlong, got bumped twice from the inside as STONE TORNADO opened a lane for
herself near the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished in the late stages. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL established the front and showed the way in hand along
the inside under attendance from MADITA to the outside but facing little pressure, had that rival begin to apply pressure five-sixteenths from home, got
headed at the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command when overtaken by the eventual winner a
furlong out, weakened in the late stages. MADITA (GER) attended the leader from the outside three then two wide, began to apply pressure at the
five-sixteenths, got set down taking over command at the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, dug in heads apart for command before being
displaced by the top one, then weakened in the late going. DARK ARTIST tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
TALE OF THE UNION bumped at the start, went on to attain a forward position before the first fraction could be rattled off, accomplishing the goal with the
pilot applying a snug grip on the reins, sat perched three to four wide pressing the issue, spun into the lane while continuing to be confidently-ridden along,
shifted in slightly, resulting in the second place finisher forced to venture onward behind traffic, was asked for more poking a head down in front at the
three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear, then gradually extended the margin, kept busy to the end. BIG THICKET took up the chase from the two path, would up
in traffic after stepping into the lane, idled along, had its path widen just enough in midstretch, was given his cue, got staved off but won the battle for place
honors. QUICKFLASH squeezed at the start, had the rider resort to a feverish ride to get the mount going, departed the backstretch three wide, tipped into
the four path for the stretch drive, failed to keep pace with the winner in the final furlong then wound up on the short of the photo for second too. KID D'ORO
took up the chase from path two on the turn after being bumped at the start, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, made no headway. LEAP TO
GLORY put to an abbreviated brisk hand ride from the gate, established the top, was switched to a rating hold and guided over to the inside route, showed
the way, tailed by the top one to the outside, with a couple of lanes of space separating them, got asked for more coming into the stretch, relinquished in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole and backed away. TEN TWENTY NINE saved ground to no avail.

FRONT RUN THE FED three wide in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command a furlong from home, edged away under a drive kept to task. DELAWARE (GB) tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile
from home, had MAI TY ONE ON come in slightly just past the five-sixteenths and had to pause and then steady off the heels of that rival briefly getting
slightly shuffled before tipping off the inside to spin three wide into upper stretch now set down for the drive, dug in under a drive through the stretch
between foes and was just up on the wire in a blanket finish among a quintet on the wire to grab the place honors. CHEWING GUM brushed the off side
stall at the start, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, ran on under a drive to be
among a host in a blanket finish and got his nose on the wire for the show honors. PULSATE three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a
ride at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish and just lost the bob for the place and
show honors among a quintet. PENALTY bobbled at the break, recovered to chase just off the inside from the tail of the field, tucked inside half a mile from
home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to be among a blanket finish at the end.
TELEKINESIS two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got let out spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive among a host of rivals
latched on near the finish but was outfinished in the final jumps. MAJESTIC DUNHILL saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. VICI showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a
mile from home, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was displaced near the eighth pole, weakened in the final furlong.
ISOTHERM chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MAI TY ONE ON three
then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and tired.

Footnotes
SANCTUARY CITY was rated along taking up the chase from the three path for the opening half, got cued up spinning into the stretch, closed in on the
ones to catch during the upcoming eighth, maintained the momentum, split rivals late then continuing onward with good energy wrested away the advantage
in the final seventy yards to prove best. MORE LIKE IT underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, angled five wide into the lane, came home willingly down
the center of the course to be along for the place. SILVER TOKEN took the inside route along the backstretch, flashed some speed proceeding to get
maneuvered to the outside leaving the half mile pole, wound up in the four path by the five-sixteenths marker, got sent out into path six from upper to
midane, finished with good energy to secure the show. SMITE cut over to the rail holding a narrow advantage, showed the way while racing some
resistance from MAJESTIC VIEW one path farther off the rail, got put to the test by that opponent as they settled onto the head of the stretch, edged away
after putting away the challenger, came under fresher pressure soon afterwards, relinquished in the final seventy yards and weakened. BOOM BOOM
KABOOM pocketed, weakened in the final furlong. EVERY MINUTE loped along one-paced two wide for the opening half, got driven out towards path five
for the drive home, made some headway. FLUENT IN SARCASM three wide onto the turn, was in the path four exiting it, flattened out. MAJESTIC VIEW
pressed the pace from path two, was one wider challenging in earnest entering the stretch, got held off then steadily backed away. SPIRITUAL KING guided
over to the inside prior to arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, went three wide into the lane, indicated having little left a sixteenth later and was
allowed to fade away. STRIKING CAUSEWAY tracked the front runners from just off the rail, turned into the lane and had no response. THE REVENGER
chased the pace from path two in between rivals on the turn, made it into the stretch and folded.
