QUEEN OF SCHMOOZE dueled outside, took over into the stretch and edged away remaining safe from closing threat..TOP HAT TIZZY lacked speed,
advanced inside on the turn and closed well too late. ENIGMATICA vied along the rail to the stretch and continued willingly. TRUE UPGRADE well placed
off the leaders inside, proved empty in the stretch. RISQUE EXPRESS lunged at the start, saved ground and was no factor. INITFORTHELONGHAUL
urged outside off the pace and lacked a rally. DEAN'S TICKET broke slowly, moved wide on the turn and was never in contention. TRAPPE ME LATER
chased wide and gave way readily.

Footnotes
DIAMOND SETTER bothered at the start, rated inside, rallied strongly into the stretch, was brushed from the inside then lugged in forcing rival to take up
then drew off quickly. BRIDGET'S BIG LUVY prompted the pace outside, took over near the quarter pole, came out in the stretch under a left handed whip
brushing rival then was taken up when that opponent lugged in under right handed pressuire. QUALITY ASSET ducked in at the break, raced far behind
then rallied well outside. WILD ABOUT DEB chased outside, was asked for run on the final turn and had no response. KID MAC COOL hustled to clear lead
for half a mile then gave way. WORTH HIS SALT settled just off the pace inside and stopped into the far turn. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection
by the rider of BRIDGET'S BIG LUVY, DIAMOND SETTER was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
GOSSIP ISLE, fanned in after the start, was two wide early, continued between rivals on the turn, took the lead leaving mid stretch and edged away under
mild handling. VOLODINA, reluctant to load contributing to a delay, raced three wide, challenged leaving the turn, stuck her head in front near mid stretch
and gave way grudgingly. SKOOKIE saved ground in second flight and held on tenaciously. ATLANTIC AVENUE broke slowly, saved ground early, moved
out four wide near near and weakened late. BAAQEYA ,racing two wide, failed to be a serious threat. WOMAN FLYER came in after start causing crowding,
set the pace two wide then gave way. LITTLE NECK took up after the start, raced wide and failed to be a threat. MAD MARY, racing four wide and just off
the pace, fell back leaving the turn. ELISSAS SECRET raced wide and showed little. REIGNING FIRE saved ground and tired.

SNOW FORECAST broke alertly and set a pressured pace, repelled rivals throughout and edged clear in a determined effort. LA PIU BELLA urged close up
early inside, slipped through into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. BLUE SHINE chased three wide just off the leaders and
continued willingly. STREET APPEAL prompted the pace outside, drifted out into the stretch and weakened. AMERICAN ALI came over in the opening
furlong, was in tight near the far turn and faltered. HOLY MOSEY dropped well behind and was never in contention. TUFFGIRLSDONTCRY taken up inside
and shuffled back in the opening furlong, had no further response. ROCHELA lacked speed and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
INFURIATED came in a bit entering the first turn causing crowding, set the pace just off the rail, held a clear lead racing into stretch, lugged in mid stretch
and won driving. CAPTAIN THUNDER, between rivals on the backstretch, moved to the outside into stretch and gained place. JAMMINWITHBRANDON
was bumped racing into the first turn, saved ground just off pace and finished willingly. OVER SENSUAL saved ground while outrun, drifted out through
deep stretch and passed faders. LAWYER ROY chased while two wide then tired. STORM FACTOR took up sharply in tight entering the first turn, saved
ground and had no response. MY FRIEND FRANK, who needed a shoe repair in the paddock, raced wide and failed to menace. MOON GATE WARRIOR
steadied briefly off heels entering the first turn then was no factor. TRILOGY, wide and just off the pace, tired.
