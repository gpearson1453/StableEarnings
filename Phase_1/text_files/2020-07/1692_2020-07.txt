Footnotes
SATELLITE, held up last in the opening stages while angling to the rail, stalked off the first flight inside a rival to the far turn, shifted out nearing upper
stretch to bid three deep between foes while exchanging some light contact with MONEY BROKER entering the lane but edged clear under firm handling.
MONEY BROKER, in touch with the leaders between foes in the opening stages, switched out racing into the first turn to track off the first flight outside the
eventual winner, was prompted to advance in tandem with that foe while exchanging light contact racing four wide into upper stretch and proved no match
late. HERBIE joined the pace outside foes in the opening stages, continued to press the issue outside a rival on a narrow advantage to the far turn, dueled
between foes into upper stretch but yielded in the drive. LOGAN'S LEOPARD, urged inside foes disputing the pace into the backstretch, dueled through the
far turn, gave way into upper stretch and was gathered up late.

CANDY WOMPUS broke readily, angled to the rail disputing the pace inside a rival on a narrow advantage to the far turn, turned back NO BOUNDARIES
leaving the midstretch, shifted a bit under left, then right handed pressure in the closing stages but held safe the challenge of WHATA SHOW OFF under
strong handling in a game effort. The latter tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch
advancing to challenge, shifted inwards leaving midstretch, then adjusted course while being floated out slightly in late stages but was outkicked. NO
BOUNDARIES, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave way in late stages. COURTING MOONLIGHT,
reserved near the inside in the opening half, swung outside foes racing into the far turn but offered no rally. LISTEN TO ROSE tracked off the first flight
outside a rival racing to the backstretch and gave way into the far turn. DRAMA IN DANUBE stumbled at the start dislodging his rider but walked off the
course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION. THE
TRAINER OF WHATA SHOW OFF LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH BUT THAT
CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

LILA'S LUCKY LADY, reserved last in the opening half, circled foes four wide nearing upper stretch to gain the advantage and drove clear. DOUBLE BEE
STING was rated along the inside tracking off the second flight to the far turn, shifted out to bid three deep between foes nearing upper stretch, was shuffled
out of close quarters entering the lane, switched out racing through the stretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors on the wire. MADISON'S
QUARTERS tracked the pace inside foes in second flight, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, split rivals just off the inside entering the lane,
couldn't match the winner's kick and just missed for second. GOOD MONGOLIA, urged to dictate the pace along the inside on a narrow margin to the far
turn, lost the advantage entering the lane and gave way midstretch. RAGING GOLD DIGGER tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages,
was urged to advance three deep racing into the lane to strike the front between calls but lacked the needed final kick. CASHMERE BLISS, in touch with the
pacesetter prompting the pace to the far turn, gave way nearing upper stretch.

FACING NORTH broke readily, disputed the pace inside foes on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shook clear entering upper stretch and was kept
to firm encouragement. ROSES FOR DOUG tracked off the first flight from out of striking distance along the rail racing to the turn, switched out entering the
lane and continued with interest between foes to narrowly prevail for the place honors. BABY GORDITA, urged between foes pressing the pace from the
outset into the turn, ducked inwards entering the stretch losing position to the winner and weakened late while finishing on even terms with a rival for a
share. DREAMING OF BLUE, off slowly, was prompted to advance nearing the lane while shifting out three wide and found her best stride late to finish on
even terms with a rival for a share. GOING RUNNING TOO settled between foes in the opening stages, angled out four wide racing into the stretch and
gained some position while making no impact. BIRDS VIEW dropped out early. GIVE EM SHADE pressed the pace three wide from the outset into the turn
and gave way leaving the midway point of the turn.

ACERTIVE MISS angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking the pacesetter, continued under patient handling conceding some position racing into the
turn, angled out four wide entering the stretch, moved to challenge in that path leaving midstretch and wrested the advantage under firm handling while
appearing to have something left. CAUSIN MISCHIEF ducked inwards at the start crossing a rival's path, tracked off the second flight along the rail through
the backstretch, shifted out splitting rivals on the turn to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch but was collared in late stages. TANGO'S KITTY broke
sharply, angled to the rail dictating the pace in the opening stages, dueled for command racing into the turn lost ground to the leader midway through the
bend but continued with a steady second effort to dispute the issue inside foes into the lane while outkicked by the top pair. UNDECIDEDCERTAINTY,
urged to terms pressing the pace outside a rival after the opening quarter, kicked clear midway through the turn but failed to sustain that momentum.
RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH, off slowly, then cut off momentarily at the start, was hustled between foes pursuing the leaders into the turn but proved empty in
the drive. SARJENALLI settled last while switching outside foes early but offered no rally.

GINGER ROSE tracked the pacesetter between rivals as part of the second flight in the opening half, continued with a steady bid to wrest command leaving
the quarter mile marker and kicked clear under firm encouragement. FIRST HUNTER tracked the leader three deep as part of the second flight, was fanned
four wide racing into the stretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors. DEPUTY DORA was rated along the rail tracking off the
second flight racing to the far turn, then shifted out to gain position three deep between foes while prevailing for a share. MORNING REPORT, held up
avoiding tight quarters in the opening stages, raced four wide through the first turn tracking just off the second flight to the backstretch, swung five wide into
the lane and continued with an effort to gain some position. FRIENDLY AND KIND angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight,
shifted out nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid between foes but had no final kick. BENTLEY'S DREAM was rated between foes tracking off the second
flight to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the lane but had no late response. HISSY MISSY settled last early and failed to menace. PARTY LIGHTS,
urged clear of the field while angling to the rail in the opening stages, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, then gave out once headed racing into
upper stretch.

WATER PATROL took up a position tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing the far turn to bid three deep between foes,
shifted inwards once gaining the advantage entering the lane and kicked clear late under firm encouragement. VIX VISION, caught four wide racing through

the winner late. ALOO GHOST tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the far turn, shifted out three wide racing through the lane and continued
well enough to gain a share. FIRST TO THE WIRE settled off the second flight while switching outside foes racing to the backstretch, raced four wide
through the far turn into the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. HERO OF FIRE settled along the inside dropping out last racing to the
backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but passed only tiring foes. SAVAGE WARRIOR was roused to gain a forward placing while
shifting inwards racing to the first turn, pressed the pace between foes through the backstretch into the far turn and gave way racing into the lane. CLASSY

Footnotes
SMOKIN HOT MOMMA, caught in tight quarters at the start, angled to the rail racing to the first turn while being rated off the second flight, steadily
advanced along the rail to challenge inside the pacesetter racing into the far turn, went clear into upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure.
NORTHERN ALLIANCE stalked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight, switched off the inside nearing the far turn, was urged to challenge
for command three deep nearing upper stretch, continued in pursuit of the winner between foes but proved only second best. LOOKIN ATA RUNAWAY
angled inwards to track off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing through the lane and continued to improve
position. SEYNATAWNEE, prompted to a forward placing, tracked the pacesetter outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening stages, angled to
the rail racing into the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. SILVERA ducked out at the start exchanging contact with
FRANCES ANNA, was held up along the inside to the far turn, angled out racing into the lane and gained some position while making no impact. CAUSE
TO WONDER settled well off the leaders to the far turn, was fanned six wide into the stretch but had no rally. GABBY'S HALF tracked off the second flight
three deep to the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the lane but offered no rally. FRANCES ANNA, bumped at the start, was hustled to the lead
along the inside to the backstretch, set the pace shifting just off the rail racing into the far turn and came up empty once headed. SAUCY AT MIDNIGHT
broke slowly, was settled last and trailed throughout.
