LOOKIN FOR A SCORE settled well, advanced on the far turn, kept on, responded late and was up in the final stride. BEACHHEAD gained the early lead,
was challenged on the far turn, edged clear in the stretch, hung badly late and was caught. LITE SWITCH was outpaced along the inside and kept on.
MINGO BORN never menaced. DELIGHT SURPRISE leaned out at the start and was void of speed. OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN swerved out badly at the start,
forced the pace and faltered.

COOL CATOMINE dueled throughout, was headed briefly on the far turn, fought back gamely and edged clear under solid handling. XTREME LYRA forced
the pace, gained a narrow advantage on the far turn, proved no match and kept on well. BIG HEARTED FACTOR chased the pacesetters and lacked a
rally. I AM READY AGAIN forwardly placed, was urged on the far turn and offered no response. ALL ABOUT ASHLEY took no part.

to the front on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. CAESARTHERULER led briefly, was headed on the turn and yielded. HIS GIANT stalked the pace
