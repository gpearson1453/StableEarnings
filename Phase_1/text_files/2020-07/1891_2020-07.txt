Footnotes
TOWER WAGON broke outwardly but recovered to for the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, asked for more by the quarter pole and responded
by first edging away then widening the margin. CURRENTLYMYPROBLEM pressed the aforementioned from inside but off the fence, moved a bit nearer
the rail on the turn, was no match but second best. LEIGH WHO raced outside the second flight moving past rivals leaving the turn having gone four to six
wide on that bend, kept on in the lane to get show honors. W F LA VENADA chased the leaders in behind two to three wide up the backstretch into the turn,
lost show. TELLINGLY settled well back racing about in the two path into the turn, came out four wide in upper stretch and improved position. BET IT ALL
broke a bit awkwardly, raced in the back half of the field going three wide on the turn and failed to rally. REDHEAD STRONG broke a bit awkwardly and
steadied at the start then immediately switched out widest up the backstretch, went six wide through the turn coming eight deep into the stretch and passed
tired rivals. SHESAFASTCRICKET was toward the back early, went five wide on the turn, moved out seven deep into upper stretch and was never a threat.
CANCAN chased from inside, saved ground but came up empty. OMI'S PARTY showed brief speed then steadily dropped back in the three to four path
through the turn.

Footnotes
ARCH CITY stalked from inside a rival but off the fence in the three path early, bid two wide on the far turn taking the lead at the five-sixteenths, edged clear
into upper stretch and held under steady handling. BUCA SARABI settled off the leaders in the three to four path early, advanced between rivals into the far
turn continuing in the three then four path on that bend, came out five wide turning for home, ground away but could not make headway on the winner late
and held the place from TRUST N PRAYER, who broke a step slowly, settled inside, began to advance mildly on the far turn still saving ground on then just
off the rail, angled seven wide into upper stretch, surged late but missed second. TRACTOR MAN broke on top and moved clear early setting the pace in
the two path through the first turn, moved nearer the rail into the far turn while being overtaken early on that bend, kept on evenly in the lane to preserve the
minor award. EYE FORTY stalked from outside four wide early, continued three wide on the far turn, made a brief and mild bid at the top of the stretch but
flattened out thereafter. AIR PATROL saved ground mid-pack along the inside early, encouraged along in the two path on the far turn, steadied just slightly
on heels near the three-sixteenths then shifted six deep and failed to rally. WAY OFF COURSE brushed the outer rival lightly at the start, settled well back
outside three to four wide on the first turn, went four deep into the far turn still well back and moved out six wide by the latter part of that bend, passed tired
rivals in the stretch. INDY WAY hopped and bobbled slightly at the start, raced outside a foe two wide and far back early, advanced past some rivals three
wide moving out five deep on the far turn but could not kick on thereafter. MALUSITA'S HOME was lightly brushed at the break, shifted in heading to the
first turn going two to three wide on that bend and in pursuit of the leaders, steadily dropped back still two to three wide and came up empty. WAR PAINT
BRAVE chased briefly four to five wide and outside a rival up the backstretch, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
A GREAT VICE was bumped twice at the break but still away alertly, vied inside but off the fence up the backstretch moving in a bit into the turn, began to
edge away coming past the quarter pole, was asked for run past the three-sixteenths and responded to draw away in a sharp effort. SHEZA DANDY R F
bumped the inside rival and bothering others at the start, pressed the winner from outside going two to three wide on the turn, was no match.
IMGOINOUTTONIGHT shifted in up the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn dropping back a bit between foes near the three-sixteenths but kept
on in the lane. BABY ROSE bumped in the inside rival then was bumped into that one again shortly after the break while being pinched back at that
juncture, chased under some urging going in the three to four path on the turn and failed to kick on late. MEENA'S MAGIC raced outside mid-pack going
four to five wide on the turn and ran on evenly. BUOYANCE chased from inside early, lacked the needed late kick. LAKE MARY was bumped into the inside
rival at the start then exchanged another bump with that one while being forced in a bit, was ridden along early, went three to four wide on the turn and was
not a threat. EASTER DREAM raced in the back half early, went two to three wide on the turn and between rivals and failed to rally. TOUCH ME ILL DANCE
saved ground and failed to threaten. ROBTHEQUEEN steadied slightly near the half-mile marker when in tight, switched out after that, went four to five wide
and outside rivals on the turn, failed to menace. Following a stewards' inquiry, SHEZA DANDY R F was disqualified from second and placed fourth behind
BABY ROSE for interference just after the start.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL COWBOY set a pressured pace racing just off the rail, dispatched foes on the far turn, drew off under a drive. IRISH POLO was bumped at the
break, stalked the leading pair going four wide on the first turn, encouraged along four then three wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner but held
the place. BELLAMY BLING was allowed to settle racing four wide, dropped well back heading up the backstretch, began to pick it up four wide on the far
turn passing rivals coming out of that bend, swung seven deep into upper stretch and gained too late. RIVER HEAD settled in behind the leaders mid-pack
racing in the three path early, moved out and advanced past rivals five then four wide on the far turn, evened out in the lane. HUSH'S STORM was bumped
into a rival and squeezed back at the start, thereupon settled in the two path in the back half, advanced past rivals early up the backstretch, continued on or
just off the rail through the far turn but could not kick on late. MR. DIGGER was relatively close heading into the first turn going five wide, continued to
pursue mid-pack from outside into the far turn moving in from the six path to the four path on that bend, failed to rally in the stretch. KEEP ON ZENON ON
raced outside foes five then four wide in the early going, dropped back and shifted in near the three-eighths going in the two to three path on the far turn,
failed to threaten. HOLY FRAZIER was outrun racing mostly in the three path on the turns. MY BULL bumped the outside rival at the start and was urged
forward, pressed the winner three wide till approaching the far turn then dropped back and faded. DEVON'S IRON GIANT broke a step slowly, saved
ground but was outrun.

AUSSIE YOU LATER stalked from outside, challenged four wide on the turn, struck a narrow lead a sixteenth from home and held. LEADING PROSPECT
was in just a bit tight at the break then allowed to settle, advanced on the turn in the five then four path on that bend before moving out six wide into upper
stretch and having lost a bit of ground, kept on to surge late and narrowly miss. AMOR N PASION contended between runners up the backstretch into the
turn, continued to vie inside a foe two to three wide on that bend, was outfinished. QUICK N QUIET settled toward the rear outside, went in the five path on
the turn, picked it up coming out of that bend and swinging seven wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly for a minor share. YES ITSA STAR stalked up close
from outside up the backstretch, was forced six to seven wide on the turn coming out a bit further into the stretch and offered no late rally. HUNTER ROCKS
broke a half-step slowly, settled toward the back, went three wide on the turn and ran on evenly to improve. MR MOO bumped the inside rival at the break,
chased briefly on then just off the rail, steadily weakened. PACK 'N GOLD contested the early lead from just off the inside, shifted nearer the rail into the
turn and gave way. BACK SEAT HERO was bumped at the break, switched outside rivals moving in just past the half-mile marker then again near the
three-eighths, went in the five to seven path on the turn, was not persevered with late and was vanned off.
