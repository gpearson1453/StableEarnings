Footnotes
ON FIRE broke in front, set all the pace, drifted to the six path entering the stretch while opening a clear advantage, swerved through the final furlong and
lasted under strong handling. THIRTYSILVERPIECES stalked the pace from the four path into the far turn, dropped inside entering the stretch, dug in
determinedly and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. SHAKEDOWN trailed into the far turn, swung wide and closed fast in the seven path
through the stretch. KING VALERO found his best stride late widest in the eight path. CHASING THE STARS was bumped and stumbled a few strides out
of the gate, settled well within striking distance then failed to offer the needed response. ANGEL'S KNIGHT bumped at the start and was no factor. STORM
PEAK chased the pace along the inside for six furlongs then wilted. STEVE CAME THRU was through after half, stopped and jogged to the wire.

determinedly late and just lasted under strong handling. NICK CAN FIX never far back, rallied through the stretch in the five path and just missed. URBAN
RENEWAL allowed to settle, offered a mild bid into the stretch, drifted to the seven path losing some ground then leveled off. CANT BUY COOL dueled for
the lead two wide into the stretch then weakened. CIELO LINDO contested the lead along the inside for a half then was used up. TRUE APPEAL was
outrun. LAVACA stumbled badly unseating his rider at the start. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

mild urging. I RECALL allowed to settle, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and finished second best. SWINDLE broke in front, set the pace until deep
stretch then was outfinished. CHECK OUT LINE well placed, drew on even terms for the lead two wide before the furlong marker then failed to sustain that

Footnotes
NICE RIDE prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead at the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace and drew clear under right handed
urging. I GOT THE TIME stalked the pace along the inside and finished second best. DANZIG RAINBOW stalked the pace in an even effort. I FLY FIRST
CLASS was hustled up to set a pressured pace for a half and weakened in deep stretch. TORMENTA DE ORO had good early speed then faded.
CINNAMON DIVA was through after a half. MEADOW JOY trailed.
