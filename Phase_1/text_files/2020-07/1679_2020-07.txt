Footnotes
SKYRAY moved up inside after a half-mile, shifted out three wide to go after the leaders midway on the turn, took over after six furlongs under a drive, and
was geared down the last sixteenth of a mile. GLOBAL VISION took over inside OXBURGER after a quarter-mile, battled inside GUACO and SKYRAY
around the turn, was no match for the latter and ran on second best. GUACO lodged a mild bid between horses on the turn, weakened after six furlongs
while shifting out in the track, and steadily lost ground on his left lead. OXBURGER was sent for the lead well off the rail, yielded readily to GLOBAL VISION
after leaving the chute, and was finished by the far turn.

Footnotes
WINTER'S WONDER saved ground in easy striking range early, was guided out three wide to challenge outside DISCREET TUNE and CONCORDE'S
DREAM turning for home, reached the front in midstretch and drew clear. MONY was held up early at the back, advanced around the far turn in the
two-path, stalled in traffic behind the leaders in upper stretch, altered out for clearance and finished well. CONCORDE'S DREAM fought rating in the
three-path early outside DISCREET TUNE, settled down a bit better through the middle stages, bid between horses after six furlongs, weakened past the
eighth-pole on his left lead and just saved the show. LUCIDUS had his head turned just before the start and was off several lengths behind the field, ran up
into traffic along the rail a half-mile out, angled out for the drive and offered a mild response. DISCREET TUNE controlled a moderate pace inside for six
furlongs, and folded up through the lane on the wrong lead. SINISTER spent much of the race in the three-path, and was not a factor. JUST LIKE MIKE was
four wide heading to the first turn, moved in a bit and was finished after six furlongs.

STORMY BOSS was never far back, challenged for command between horses approaching the quarter-pole, took over and moved inside in upper stretch,
and widened under a drive. PAYNTER FEST brushed with DARLINDIVA after the start, was a bit sluggish dropping back through the run up the backstretch,
began to get going coming off the turn, and finished well without threatening the winner. DARLINDIVA brushed with PAYNTER FEST after the start, vied
briefly outside MISS MARLU leaving the chute, prompted the latter from outside through the middle stages, bid mildly outside horses a quarter-mile out, and
faded steadily from there. KINDHEARTED KOTA gained some ground on the turn three wide, but made no further headway in the stretch on the far outside.
MISS MARIU vied inside DARLINDIVA early on, moved away after a quarter-mile, came under attack from two challengers late on the turn, and was done at
the top of the stretch.

HARBOUR MASTER (GB) began moving on the far turn three wide, bid between horses through upper stretch, and was all out to edge THUNDER RIDE
after a long drive. THUNDER RIDE rated along through an even pace for six furlongs, faced a pair of challengers turning for home, dug in gamely inside
HARBOUR MASTER through the last eighth of a mile and just missed. GOLDEN DECISION trailed early inside, moved strongly four wide approaching the
quarter-pole, loomed outside the top two in upper stretch, but flattened out late. STIRLING DRIVE was forwardly placed early three wide, briefly loomed a
threat outside THUNDER RIDE after a half-mile, but gave way approaching the stretch. FRENCHMEN STREET saved ground early, and tired after a
half-mile. SHINY COPPER PENNY chased outside THUNDER RIDE early, and was finished into the far turn. Run-up distance unavailable.

Footnotes
SUNSET EMPIRE vied innermost of four in an early scramble for the lead, shook clear around the turn, and was driving on the rail to stay in control. FIBER
OPTIC tracked behind a four-way battle up front, moved through in the two-path to take over second turning for home, and held that spot while unable to get
near the winner. THUMP lagged far back to the stretch, found her best stride late and was just up for the show inside. GLORY ROLL argued the early pace
four wide, and weakened outside late giving up third. SOLARTE vied up front three wide between horses early, and tired after three furlongs. SUZ vied in
the two-path between rivals early, and yielded on the turn.

LOVE NEST tracked the early leaders three wide, took over quickly from outside approaching the three-eighths, and widened steadily while kept to
pressure. DEXTER ROAD raced four then three wide rallying into second around the turn, and ran on best of the others. CONGRATS THIS advanced in the
two-path after six furlongs, and finished evenly to be clear for the show. STARSHIP ARAMIS raced four wide around the turn, and was finished near the
quarter-pole. TOTONO vied inside STREET CODE for a half-mile, gave way on the turn, and dropped far back. STREET CODE contested the pace outside
TOTONO for a half-mile, and faltered.

Footnotes
YOUNG RAYMOND stayed in range four wide to the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly outside rivals and edged away in the last 70 yards. I'M MORE
READY raced in the three-path through most of the turn, shifted in a bit splitting horses in mid stretch, and finished gamely inside the winner. CAPTAIN
DUKE pressed the early pace outside CONGRATS THAT, wrested the lead five-sixteenths out, edged clear briefly through the furlong grounds, then
weakened between the top two. CONGRATS THAT led early inside, fought back when confronted by CAPTAIN DUKE on the turn, stayed on to upper
stretch, and gave way. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN moved inside approaching the stretch, and tired. INDIRECTLY was outrun three wide. JUPI'S LIGHTNING
hit the left side of the gate at the start, and dropped far back after three furlongs while drifting wide.

Footnotes
BELLE LAURA saved ground unhurried for a half-mile, advanced around the far turn, shifted to the two-path challenging between horses a quarter-mile out,
and drew off decisively under pressure. GREAT SISTER DIANE was slow into stride and well back for a half, took closer order moving to the two-path late
on the far turn, moved back inside for the drive and finished well. MIDNIGHT SOIREE was outrun early inside, gained while moving off the rail approaching
the stretch, and did enough between rivals late to secure the show. ROSA STAR led early inside, deferred to DANGEROUS CURVES on the first turn,
moved out with a rebid three wide at the top of the lane, but weakened through the late stages. BIENVILLE STREET lagged well back early two wide,
swung out to the four-path rallying mildly turning for home, and finished evenly. ISLA ROAD got clipped from behind by ZARINA entering the first turn,
advanced mildly after six furlongs two then three wide, and flattened out. KELSEY'S CROSS was strung out four wide throughout, and made no impact.
ZARINA clipped the heels of ISLA ROAD and stumbled entering the first turn in the three-path, and was outrun. PICARA stayed in range near the two-path
to the far turn, and faded steadily after six furlongs. DANGEROUS CURVES broke a step slow, rushed up outside intent on making the lead around the first
turn, was well clear through the backstretch run, and had nothing left after six furlongs. CROWN AND SUGAR was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
PAPETU brushed with THE ICE BEAST after the start, tracked the leaders three wide, took over from outside after three furlongs, drew off through upper
stretch, and remained clear under a drive. PRINCESS SECRET took the worst of a hard bump with FAMOUS GENT at the break and was off slowest,
moved inside entering the turn, came back out four wide past the three-eighths, rallied willingly through the lane and narrowed the gap outside the winner.
FAMOUS GENT bumped solidly with PRINCESS SECRET at the start, trailed in the four-path to the end of the turn, and rallied mildly outside to go clear of
the rest. PALADIO dueled in the two-path with early pressure from both sides, could not stay with PAPETU late on the turn while going clear of the rest and
moving inside, and faded through the stretch on his left lead. THE ICE BEAST bobbled two strides from the gate and brushed with PAPETU, stayed close
two then three wide to late on the turn, and tired. HEAVENLY BLESSING was three wide into the turn, moved inside being outsprinted past the
three-eighths, and remained outrun. EXCHANGE DAY dueled early inside PALADIO, could not keep pace after three furlongs, moved out through upper
stretch and dropped far back.

PAY ANY PRICE loaded without the rider, sped clear after the start and moved inside, turned for home in the two-path facing challengers from both flanks,
and withstood a late surge from AMBASSADOR LUNA to take a hard-fought decision. AMBASSADOR LUNA broke out, recovered quickly and chased
outside PAY ANY PRINCE for three furlongs, lost momentum lugging in and having to be pulled off PAY ANY PRICE in midstretch, regrouped and came on
again to narrowly miss. KRSTO SKYE stayed close behind the pacesetter while kept in around the turn by AMBASSADOR LUNA, loomed along the rail
after straightening away for the drive, but weakened slightly late. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR was outsprinted early, had a clear shot outside the leaders in the
stretch, but could only gain mildly. FROSTED GRACE was outsprinted to the stretch, and gained belatedly on the far outside.

Footnotes
DOLL COLLECTION brushed with RED VENUS at the start, moved to contention after a half-mile four wide, took over from outside PRINCESS CORO and
TARA at the top of the stretch, drew well clear through the furlong grounds, then was all out to hang on. TIZ ENOUGH was a step slow at the start, settled
well off the pace two wide, moved out for the drive and was gobbling up ground late outside the winner. PUPPET MASTER was outrun three then four wide
to the stretch, and found her best stride late outside. TARA pressed the pace outside PRINCESS CORO, bid between horses five-sixteenths out, could not
go with DOLL COLLECTION into the stretch, and faded. PRINCESS CORO set the early pace slightly off the rail, moved in coming under fire from TARA
and DOLL COLLECTION after a half-mile, and weakened on the rail through upper stretch. LADY BOSS saved ground behind the leaders early on the turn,
moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, and came up empty. SCAMPER ALONG broke slowly, raced wide and never got close. RED VENUS broke
awkwardly and brushed the hind end of DOLL COLLECTION, and was outrun throughout.
