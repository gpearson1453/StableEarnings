SING HIM A SONG broke well, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under right handed urging. KING DADDIO chased the winner from the four
path, shifted in towards the rail through upper stretch and finished second best. BEAUTIFUL GAME never far back, advanced along the rail into the stretch
then leveled off. KATALOX chased the winner from the inside down the backstretch, shifted out to the three path on the turn then faded in the final furlong.
HICKORY HILL broke slowly then failed to menace. CANTANKEROUS BOBBY trailed.

BOATSWAIN was bumped at the start, moved up steadily three wide through the turn, drifted out to the seven path, surged late and was along in time under
mild urging. SCARED WARIOR pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path, made the lead then couldn't handle the late charge of the
winner. IDOWHATIDO away alertly, set the pace near the inside into the stretch, drifted to the four path and weakened in the final stages. BAR CAT had
good early speed three wide then faded. EXCHANGE FEVER broke outward bumping the winner at the start and was no threat. NILO E C was no factor.

late rally three wide near the five path and finished second best. CRAZYCANTBERIGHTED never far back, finished with good courage near the inside HIJO
DE SHELTOWEE settled mid pack, dropped back on the turn, swung wide and came on again late in the eight path. LIME AND TEQUILA pursued the
winner under strong handling and faded in the stretch. LITTLE BLAKER was no factor. RIDGE DEFENSE was outrun. GRAND KITTEN showed little.

Footnotes
SWINDLE prompted the pace while on near even terms for the lead along the rail, checked entering the turn, fought back gamely in a stretch long drive and
got up in the final stride to finish on even terms with DANCIN' ROSIE at the wire. DANCIN' ROSIE set a pressured pace two wide, dug in determinedly
through a prolonged drive and refused to lose. I RECALL never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path through the stretch. DRUMBEG stalked the
pace and went evenly. SPEAK LIGHTLY failed to menace. VICTOR STORY was no threat. SWEET CHELSEA was outrun. SHACK'S HAREM had speed
into the turn then flattened out. HEIDI'S BACK had brief speed. THE RIDER OF SWINDLE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
DANCIN' ROSIE FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

CHOLMONDELEY away alertly, battled for the lead two wide into the turn, took charge, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under a
strong hand ride to win as much the best. TIZ WHAT IT TIZ delayed the start while reluctant to load, was well placed and went evenly in the five path.
KENDALIN allowed to settle swung wide, and rallied late in the seven path. AWESOME MACHINE trailed, drifted entering the turn causing her rider to
check hard then passed tiring rivals. HOPES AND PRAYERS failed to menace. GONE ASTRAYING battled with the winner along the inside into the turn
then stopped in the stretch. PRINCESS MAGDALENA had speed into the turn and also stopped.
