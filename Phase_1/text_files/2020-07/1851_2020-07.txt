Footnotes
DOX FOLLY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid in mid-turn, gained a short lead in late turn then drew away through the lane while
being kept to the task until late. BAHNKE set the pace while near the inside into the far turn, was no match when challenged by the top one in mid-turn,
continued on through the lane and finished well clear for the place spot. MR. CREATIVE was near the rail through the far turn and moved up to be a distant
third. DARKNSTORMYTIME stalked the pace from the two path, pressed the leader near the half-mile pole, continued in close proximity while remaining in
the two path through the far turn then weakened. BOURBON N LIME stumbled badly at the start and spotted the next to last rival at least three lengths,
raced well back and was never in it. RHINESTONE ROMEO was in the two path through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
MARTIAL EAGLE was unhurried while trailing into the far turn, moved through the three or four path through the far turn, came into the lane three wide,
dueled with another from the three-sixteenths pole to the wire and just stayed up. MAJESTIC JOHN'S vied for the lead along the inside with another into the
far turn, shook that one off in late turn but was joined by another when straightening in the lane, dueled with that one from outside the eighth pole, rider lost
his whip just outside the sixteenth pole, continued on under literal right-handed and left-handed urging and just was not good enough. DEVIL'S RULE
checked when put in tight entering the backstretch, continued to chase the pace from the three path through the far turn, was attempting to split rivals near
the eighth pole when path closed, shifted to the four path and gained mildly. CLIFTON PARK was along the inside through the turns and into the lane, was
well placed turning into the lane and lacked a closing bid. GET ALONG stumbled at the start, rushed up four wide through the first turn, dropped in entering
the backstretch to the three path, continued to move closer to the inside to duel with another, was losing momentum in late turn and was empty entering the
lane. MARKET GARDEN tracked the pace from the two path into the far turn then was done in mid-turn.

CROWELLA was unhurried while in the two path through the turns, gained momentum after mid-turn, angled into the four path with pace, caught the leader
nearing the sixteenth pole and edged clear. YOUENS chased the pace from the two path, bid in late turn, gained the lead once straightened, cleared with an
eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. FIGHTING ZELDA was unhurried while near the inside, continued near the rail into the lane and moved up
for the minor share while not a threat. DATA LADY vied for the lead along the inside, inherited the lead when leader bolted, was joined by runner-up soon
after, chased that one into the lane then faded. BAYTOWN EMMALEE chased the pace from the three path, was asked for more in late turn then was empty
after entering the lane. GRAN CONFUSIONE set the pace down the backstretch and into the far turn, bolted after entering the turn and eventually ended at
the outside fence, continued along the fence into the lane, angled into mid-track and finished well back.

SECRET INTEREST vied for the lead along the inside, repelled dueling challenger entering the lane and was joined by another soon after, dueled with that
one through the lane, appeared to lose the lead near the eighth pole then gamely dug in inside the sixteenth pole and just stayed up. RUH ROH RAGGY
stalked the two rival duel through the turn while perfectly spotted, waited to ask for more until outside the sixteenth pole, was shaken up and gained a
narrow lead, dueled with the winner through the final eighth and was just denied. D'ARK FLATTER was in the three path through the turn when never far
back, swung into the lane from the four path and gained the show spot while not advancing on the dueling top onesq. CORBIN was unhurried while in the
three to the four path through the turn, bid from the five path into the lane and moved up while not a serious threat. JUSTICE IN VEGAS was along the
inside through the far turn and never was a serious factor while finishing evenly. CHIEF RED BULL was in the two path through the turn and lacked a
response. BRIGHTWORTHY vied for the lead two wide through the turn then was finished turning into the lane.

ENGLISH CHALLENGE was unhurried while in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path, gained momentum inside the
eighth pole, continued with good energy while closing in on the leader, came in a bit in deep stretch, bumped and was judt up. PLEASECALLMEBACK
chased the pace from the three path, came into the lane from the two path, shifted into the three or four path, was gaining on the top ones in deep stretch
when put in very tight and missed. MERLIN'S SONG chased the pace into the far turn, bid two wide in mid-turn, gained the lead and cleared, drifted out
three paths late under left-handed urging, bumped hard with the winner and put the runner-up in very tight then was guided back to the inside. MILBURN
was in the four or five path into the lane and finished with good energy. LUCKY BODE vied for the lead into the lane, was tiring a bit along the rail when
bothered late. OUR FLAG vied for the lead from the two or three path and weakened in the lane. HAVE A PLAN was never a factor while in the two path.
THE STORY BEGINS was off with a slight hop and put in tight at the start, raced along the inside and was done entering the lane. NOD TO PERSIA chased
the pace from the two path and was done near the three-eights pole. A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER AND RIDER OF

ADDITIONAL CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #1 MERLINS SONG BY THE RIDER OF #4 LUCKY BODE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS
