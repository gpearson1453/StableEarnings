Footnotes
TRAUMARAMA raced at the back of a tight group, saved ground on the far turn, came up the rail in the stretch and drew clear at the sixteenth pole. QUEEN
OF CORONA raced up close, moved between horses on the far turn, was asked for more at the top of the turn, dueled a stubborn foe down the lane and
just got up for second. HERO OF THE BEST brushed a horse at the start, tracked the lead in hand, got the lead on far turn, led to the eighth pole and
dueled a game foe for place, just missing second. FASHION ENVY was at the rear of a bunched group, made a five wide middle move on the far turn, and
flattened out late. PROM THEME led off the rail but faltered in the stretch. MALEFICENT QUEEN was up close early and dropped out on the far turn.
SWEET ROCK was brushed at the start by a foe and trailed.

Footnotes
BIG IRON saved ground to far turn, snuck thru a narrow opening in the late stretch to edge clear under good handling. CALIFORNIA SUN went clear quickly
outside, could not contain the winner late while gamely holding the place spot. CAUSE FOR PARDON no speed to far turn, advanced three wide with a mild
gain late just missing the place spot. SURGE PRICING chased leader to the half but could not go on with a wide trip. MOON LAUNCH good position to half,
switched outside to finish evenly with no gain. CHUCKLES CANDY raced between horses to far turn with nothing left for the drive. UNITY never a real
menace with a ground saving trip and pushed along with no response in the far turn. J Z'S LAST TRY between horses to the turn but faded back with little
resistance. BEAST MODE never a threat while far back at all calls.

Footnotes
CATAPHRACT prompted the pace to the turn, moved just outside to take the lead in hand, was challenged at the top of the stretch and responded to whip
urging, drawing clear and staying safe to the wire. DA DUDE closed a gap nearing the turn, chased the leader three wide, headed that one at the top of the
stretch, was rebuffed but stayed on gamely for second. CAT'S RHYTHM was brushed at the start, made a wide middle move on the turn, came very wide
into the stretch, had energy but needed more past the sixteenth pole. RANSOM THE BULL was off slow, took the rail and raced evenly. TIGER TRAIL raced
between horses at the rear of the field and came up empty in the stretch. KASAMOUNT had an awkward start, led to the top of the turn, then folded up in
the stretch.

Footnotes
CRAZY SEXY MUNNY raced between leaders up the backstretch, angled out and took over nearing the turn, then widened the advantage late. WAR
EAGLE'S LOVE backed out of a duel on the backstretch, rallied in the two path on the far turn, chassd the winner evenly past the eighth pole, drifted out but
was good enough to hold second. KIMBERLEY DREAM was wide up the backstretch, rallied wide on the far turn, then was best of the rest down the stretch.
FLASH N' DANCE raced inside on the first turn, stayed mid pack, lost ground on the far turn, then re-rallied to retake fourth late. SPEARETTE was urged
while racing well back on the far turn, and had a mild gain to improve position. FUN SUCKER was away in hand off the rail in the first turn, was competitive
for three quarters but backed up down the stretch. CORA ANNE was off slow in a dull effort.

Footnotes
CAZMAN tracked leader to turn, roused to take the lead in the stretch and draw clear through the final furlong. WICKED WEDNESDAY good position
between horses, raced inside on the turn, split horses into the stretch for the place spot. KOBE BEACH rushed to contend on the turn, came four wide into
stretch with a bid but settled for show. IN THE KISSER had a compromised start and lost best chance but ran on on wide to improve through the stretch.
MAKE ROOM bore in bothering SARDONIC SMILE at the start, rushed up but emptied out. SARDONIC SMILE was bothered at the start, angled in through
the stretch and could not go on fading. HOUSE KEY through early inside and backed up quickly. TAKECHARGECOMANCHE good speed from inside to the
stretch but stopped to a walk. LUCKY ROMEO never a menace.

FAN FAVORITE steady run for the half mile pole, took over and ran well clear. NOBLE COMPANION no speed to the half, advanced steadily wide for place.
SAMMY AGAIN inside trip throughout with no late kick when needed. MR SUPERB inside speed to far turn, gave in through the stretch run. BIRD KEY
unhurried early, ran on outside from the half. ONDALOVE (FR) back of the field to far turn, improved position in the stretch r. SNAPY TWELVES up close
early on with a steady fade backwards thereafter. HE'S RECKLESS checked back out of first turn, never recovered. PRICE TO PAY good speed to the half,
gave way readily thereafter. BOURBON NATIVE through after half from outside. SPORTSTER never a factor. DODGE CITY KID outrun.

Footnotes
SEGURO good speed outside, pressured turn, shook free, hand urging to stay clear under good handling. LONESOME SOUND steadied badly start, way
back to the turn with a steady gain for the place in a good effort. PRESS SNOOZE unhurried to the turn, rallied at least six wide into the stretch run for the
show money. EL PIQUIN no speed to the turn, rallied in stretch while altering course in in mid stretch. CANDY MOVER good position from outside to turn,
made bid in the stretch but came up, empty. ARMADA inside run to the turn but could not go on in the stretch run and flattened out. TIZ A BIT LUCKY well
placed early on, rallied four wide past the quarter pole with a mild bid into the stretch but could not go on and folded. GRAND DEAL off a bit slowly, and only
improved position in the stretch. MOW MOW THE GRASS showed good speed to the turn, used up and faltered in the stretch. LITTLE EMPIRE never a
menace while widest into the strertch run. NOPICKINONCHARLIE was off slow and never threatened.

Footnotes
BIONIC ROSIE prompted the pace, dueled on the turn, took the lead at the top of the stretch, dueled another foe while inside down the stretch, and won a
head bob at the wire. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE raced near the front, dropped away a bit entering the turn, steadied at the top of the turn while starting a
rally, engaged outside the leader in a stretch long duel and missed in a photo. HER GOLD MINE raced in the second flight, came seven wide into the
stretch, had momentum to take dead aim on the leaders but evened out late. FINAL TRUTH was off slow, near the rear early, and waited until the stretch for
the best running. ABSTAIN raced well back on the rail, steadily improving before flattening out late. MISS EMMA'S SONG was unhurried, rallied eight wide
on the turn and had late gain. THREE SPRINGS ROAD steadied after the start, was unhurried and improved a bit in late stretch. BIZBY was off slow,
moved steadily up the rail to contend but falterd in deep stretch. K FOR KATHY tracked off the lead group but tired in the stretch. NUTTIN BUT RUNNIN
stalked outside just off the pace, went five wide on the turn, but had no rally in the lane. WHODUNNITANDRAN was off slow, and outrun. PRESI PLAIN
JANE led off the rail to the top of the stretch and backed up.
