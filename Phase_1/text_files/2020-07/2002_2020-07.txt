Footnotes
FLASHY SISTER pressed the pace racing three wide, dueled outside of INBETWEEN US in the final turn, gained the lead approaching the stretch and
drove clear. CHATTY GAL last to leave the gate, was under a snug hold behind the leaders through the backstretch, swung out three wide in the final turn
then went to a drive and rallied well but was no match for the winner. SECRET PROPOSAL vied between rivals for the early lead, was unable to move on
with FLASHY SISTER AND INBETWEEN US leaving the backstretch, kept on only evenly through the drive. HI DREAMIN raced at the back of the pack
from the two path and bid belatedly. INBETWEEN US contended the early pace inside, match strides in the final turn inside of FLASHY SISTER but came
up empty for the drive. BYRE DECREE broke well outside, raced five to six wide into the backstretch, chased into the final turn along the rail and failed to
threaten. PLAY FOR HONOR reserved off the pacesetters racing five wide through the backstretch and had no response when called upon.

SHIMS SHADOW raced three wide into the backstretch then drifted brushing OUR MONEY CAT, prompted the pace from the three path, moved up
alongside PRINCE AFLEET at the five sixteenth pole to challenged the lead, was put to a drive gaining the lead and held sway. JOHNNY RUNNER raced
wide leaving the chute, angled quickly to the rail in the backstretch, tracked inside, chased into the stretch under steady urging and got up for place. OUR
MONEY CAT brushed into the backstretch, tracked outside from the four path, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole then drifted in, rallied determinedly
outside and was edged out late. POOR RUBEN lagged early and passed tiring rivals. PRINCE AFLEET broke sharply then went quickly to the front,
contested the lead from the two path, rallied mildly into the lane and gave way. LUTE settled outside early, chased in the far turn and failed to threaten in the
drive.

SOMEONE ELSE broke alertly then vied from the three path, contended the pace leaving the backstretch inside of LIA'S ON TUNE, asserted herself on the
lead into the lane, responded gamely to a challenge from PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE into the stretch, rival took a slim lead and battled back in the final
strides refusing to relinquish control. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE attended the early pace then was in close quarters between rivals in the backstretch, sat in
striking position into the far turn, took advantage of the rail opening up into the lane, rallied determinedly inside at the eighth pole, gained a narrow lead mid
stretch under heavy urging and was bested in the final strides. MUSIC AT WORK tracked outside racing five wide, took closer order approaching the quarter
pole, fanned four wide into the lane closed determinedly outside gaining ground on the leaders but needed more late. LIL OL FLATTER reared hitting the
side of the gate, trailed through the backstretch, chased in vain into the lane and evened out. LIA'S ON TUNE pressed the pace racing five wide, brushed
PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE in the backstretch, was unable to keep pace with the eventual winner and faded into the lane. SUSIE DERKINS reared breaking
out into the gate, then was hustled into contention outside and was done early.

Footnotes
IRISH TRICK vied for the early lead from the three path, set a pressured pace through the backstretch, drew clear into the lane and held sway.
PROVOCATIVE PRINCE pressed the pace from the two path, pressed the issue at the three eighths marker inside, was unable to sustain the bid that was
needed into the lane, was closing ground on the leader late stretch and held for place. RYANWATER reserved off the pacesetter early, moved into striking
distance leaving the backstretch, drifted outward leaving the final turn then brushing TINY TYCOON, closed under steady encouragement and missed out,
settling for show honors. LANNY MAC raced in second flight from the three path, shifted out then steadied lacking a clear path leaving the backstretch,
angled to the rail then circled wide into the lane and offered a late bid through the stretch but was unable to improve contention. TINY TYCOON prompted
outside from the four path, dropped back through the far turn, was brushed into the lane and yielded. BRING HOME STANLEY dwelt leaving, launched an
all out bid in the final turn but have nothing left in reserve and tired. RED CHOCOLATE saved ground early, took closer order leaving the backstretch and
faltered. **RED CHOCOLATE was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled.
