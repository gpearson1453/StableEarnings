Footnotes
PROFESSIONAL, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, kicked clear leaving midstretch and was
kept to firm right handed pressure. BLUE DANCER, in touch prompting the pacesetter racing to the first turn, pressed the issue through the far turn to upper
stretch but proved no match late. WHY GOD, reserved last while pulling a bit along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the
lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. GOT EVEN SMARTER tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance racing into the lane but lacked the needed late response. HARD TO PARK, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off
the leaders to the far turn, faded into upper stretch. ALOHLOUYA tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening half and gave way racing into the far
turn.

Footnotes
BINDING TIME broke readily, angled to the rail stalking the pacesetter as part of the second flight under light rating, shifted out to split foes entering the
lane, then took over and went clear under firm handling. HADDY UP sprinted to the lead along the inside, held sway on a narrow margin to upper stretch but
proved no match when confronted by the winner. BOOZIN AT BOZOS, off slowly, then bumped at the start, settled into stride shifting off the inside, split
foes three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain position. FLASH FLOOD tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes in
second flight and faded into the stretch. TIMEINTHETAVERN tracked off the second flight five wide in early stages but lacked the needed late response.
SHAY'S GLORY, shuffled back out of close quarters in the opening stages, never gained contention. MY MISS MARILYN, urged to a forward placing
prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SPEEDING PASSION proved no factor.

DEFEND THE ROSE broke sharply, angled to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin racing into the turn, widened the margin racing into the lane and
held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC raced four wide in early stages, angled in tracking the leader outside a
rival in second flight and continued with a steady effort to close the gap on the leaders while edging a rival for second late. HOTASAPISTOL angled to the
inside in the opening stages tracking just off the pacesetter, saved ground to upper stretch and weakened late. GREY WAVE tracked off the second flight
along the inside and continued evenly into the stretch. ARRESTING settled last and never gained contention. TEMUJIN LADY tracked off the second flight

Footnotes
WEEKEND RIDE, bumped at the start, switched outside the leaders in the opening furlong, was prompted to press the pace three wide racing to the bend,
forged clear entering the turn while shifting inwards and held sway on a safe margin under firm encouragement. MYNAMEIS PRINCE stumbled at the break
bumping the eventual winner, was taken up to drop out last in early stages, angled to the rail entering the turn and continued with a steady effort to gain the
place honors late. PUBLIC SAFETY tracked off the second flight near the inside racing into the turn, gained position inside foes racing into the lane but
lacked the needed late kick. LIL' NINJA, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, was held up conceding some position racing into the
turn and steadily faded. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY, held up in the opening stages, switched outside rivals to make brief pursuit four wide through the turn but
flattened out nearing the lane. RASMUS broke sharply, angled to the inside disputing the pace into the turn but gave way nearing the lane. YOU SAY SO
tracked off the second flight between foes and dropped out early.

Footnotes
FIRSTMATE angled to the inside early, tracked the leaders along the rail, came through inside foes to challenge for command midstretch and narrowly
prevailed in an all out drive. READY TO RUNAWAY, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, switched out nearing upper stretch to
bid for command three deep through the lane to strike the front late but just missed. HONEY'S SOX APPEAL tracked the pace outside a rival in second
flight, split foes nearing upper stretch to bid four wide in the lane but was outkicked. CLICKBAIT settled into stride off the inside, then gained position
between foes racing through the lane in a mild bid. MAYWOOD HOPE was guided to the inside while settling in the last flight, saved ground to upper stretch
but had no late response. CARRIAGE, urged to the lead racing to the backstretch, held sway to the far turn and gave out between foes late. ARI GIA,
forwardly placed three wide, gave way nearing the lane. Due to a timing issue internal fractions were omitted and are under review.

CINCO STAR, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and gamely
prevailed in an all out drive. DROP OF GOLDEN SUN, in touch attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the pace on the far turn into the lane, gained
a brief advantage late and just missed. FIREMAN OSCAR tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted out three deep
midstretch and edged a rival for a share in late stages. HOT SHOT KID angled to the inside stalking just off the first flight under rating, was prompted to
advance along the rail racing into the lane and was held up avoiding close quarters late. A P IS LOOSE was rated off the second flight racing to the turn and
offered no closing bid. TWOKO BAY settled outside a rival in the last flight, angled out racing into the stretch but offered no rally. WHERE'S JORDAN
settled last and never seriously menaced.

MADISONIAN broke readily to track just off the first flight racing to the turn, steadily advanced three deep racing into the lane and wrested the advantage
under pressure to go clear late under firm handling. STYLIN N PROFILIN, urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command inside foes into upper
stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner late. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, pressed the
issue outside a rival racing through the bend to upper stretch and gave way late. MS KELA TIME broke slowly, settled near the inside, swung out four wide
entering the lane and improved position late. IMMINENT THREAT tracked off the second flight between foes, angled to the inside on the turn and continued
evenly. SOBER PEACE tracked off the first flight while angling inside early and steadily faded nearing the lane. HUNTER'S HELLCAT, off a bit slowly, raced
four wide into the turn and offered no rally. SHINE MY BADGE dropped out early. MARLEY BE GOOD retreated early. UNBRIDLEDMOONLIGHT, urged
between foes prompting the pace, gave way midway through the turn.

Footnotes
TEE EM EYE was rated along the inside racing to the turn, advanced along the rail steadily gathering momentum nearing upper stretch, shifted out three
wide entering the lane and took over in the final sixteenth to go clear under firm handling. SOME SAY SO, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter into the
turn, gained the advantage racing into the stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. SUPERSTAR BEA, reserved off the second flight
outside foes racing into the turn, angled to the inside nearing the stretch, then shifted out late improving position to the end. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE,
urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command inside a rival into upper stretch and gave way. SASSY SENECA, urged to a forward placing four
wide racing to the turn, steadily faded into the stretch. SIMRAN, reluctant to load, was shuffled back out of close quarters at the start and never gained
contention. BRECHIN'S COMMAND angled to the inside pursuing the leaders racing into the turn, was fanned four wide entering the lane and proved empty
in the drive. FULL OF GRACE was a brief factor three wide between foes pursuing the leaders to the turn, but faded into the stretch.

Footnotes
KING OF THE COURT, urged between foes pressing the pace, angled inside entering the turn disputing the issue, then forged clear through the stretch
under firm handling. TRAPALANDA, lost his path momentarily at the start, tracked off the first flight along the inside and continued with a steady effort to
edge a rival for second nearing the wire. SERMON BY THE SEA swerved just after the start bumping ASTRONAUT OSCAR, was checked off that rival,
switched out while being urged three wide through the backstretch pressing the pace, couldn't match terms with the winner in the final quarter and was just
outkicked for second. SPEEDING KID settled last, swung out five wide entering the stretch and made some belated progress. ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke
readily despite being bumped in the opening stages, pressed the pace inside foes in the opening quarter, was eased outside the leaders on the turn while
being prompted to make a second effort but lacked the needed final kick. MAN U tracked the pace between foes off the second flight and lacked a rally.
NORTHCUT dropped out early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQURY INTO THE INCIDENT JUST AFTER THE BREAK
AND DISQUALIFIED SERMON BY THE SEA FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM FIFTH.

Footnotes
PEACOCK COWBOY, urged disputing the pace inside rivals on a narrow advantage, shifted out entering the lane to race in the three path contesting the
issue grudgingly and held gamely under brisk handling. BLUE ECLIPSE, urged pressing the pace between foes from the outset to the lane, exchanged
bumps with GREAT SKY in late stages but continued willingly to prevail for second. SATURDAYS HANGOVER, off last, settled into stride, split foes three
wide gathering momentum entering the lane, shifted inside the leaders midstretch and was going well late. DAD'S A GAMBLER tracked off the second flight
outside foes, advanced six wide on the turn to upper stretch and continued to gain position to the end. GREAT SKY, urged five wide, then four wide into the
turn advancing on the leaders, drew on terms with the leaders in upper stretch, exchanged bumps in late stages and gave out. MONDAY CONFESSION
angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, lodged a brief bid along the rail entering the lane but soon flattened out. OHTANI tracked the leaders four wide
in second flight, was shuffled back racing into the turn and had no rally. OH BROTHER JACK, urged three wide between foes pursuing the leaders into the
turn, gave way in the drive. VOW OF FRANCIS flashed brief pace three deep in the opening quarter and gave way abruptly entering the turn.
