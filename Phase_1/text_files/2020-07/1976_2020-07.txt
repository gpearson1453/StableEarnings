Footnotes
VAYA CON DIOS set the pace along the inside of a pair of foes around the turn, kicked clear of those foes turning for home, and widened his advantage
through the lane under mild pressure. CARRIES MAN was forwardly placed early on, settled in midpack while saving ground around the turn, surged
through a rail opening in upper stretch to forge place at the furlong pole, but was no match for the winner. COWBOY RIDGE lied close up to the pace early
on, settled in midpack two wide into the turn, shifted three wide turning for home before swinging to the five path in upper stretch, but only produced a mild
kick, and got outfinished by an inner rival for place. WATERWILD stralked from midpack in the two path, came into the lane in the four path, but found mild
traffic approaching the furlong pole, shifted to the six path, then kept on. HIGH NOON TYPHOON rushed to prompt the pace setter two wide and between
horses, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader turning for home, then weakened in the final sixteenth. FLYCATCHER broke out many paths, recovered
and rushed to prompt the pace three wide while staying in the four path around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader turning for home, then
weakened through the late stages. NATHANSMIMSY was forwardly placed two wide, but lacked a kick to split foes to make a place bid in upper stretch,
steadied approaching the furlong pole, then lacked a rally thereafter. TEN HURDLES was off slowly, trailed early on, took the turn in the four path, and failed
to factor. BARGEMAN had a slow start and was outrun. ACTING SCRAPPY saved ground far off of the pace, but was done early.

Footnotes
BEBOP BABY chased while close to the pace along the inside down the backstretch, angled to the three path into the turn to stalk outside of the leader
around the bend, produced a three wide bid for the lead approaching the furlong pole, forged a narrow lead passing that marker, then inched clear in the
late stages while holding COSMETOLOGY at bay. COSMETOLOGY was forwardly placed in the four path around the turn, failed to keep pace with the
inner leaders turning for home due to ground loss, but kept on through the lane, produced a rally in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch the
leader. MISSISZIPPY BLING set the pace in the two path, cleared off into the turn, but was met challenges from rivals on both sides turning for home, was
headed by her outer foe at the furlong pole, drifted out slightly from left handed pressure passing that marker, then weakened late and was nailed on the
wire for place. CLIPPER COVE broke sharp, vied along the inside of MISSISZIPPY BLING down the backstretch, stalked into the turn before rebidding for
the lead along the inside turning for home, but weakened at the furlong pole. REBECCA'S MUSIC stalked the pace in the two path, and finished up evenly
without producing a bid. MS. ANGELICA raced off of the pace along the inside while a few paths off of the rail, came into the lane in the four path, but failed
to threaten. MORO PROBLEMS had a slow start, trailed early on, then passed tired foes through the lane without factoring. TIMELESS STAR raced in
midpack in the four path around the turn, but was never involved. NOW TO NEXT was crowded at the start and never got involved. ADELE'S BLING took
the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and was done early.

for home and through upper stretch, then held sway under driving pressure. SPORTY FLYER raced inside of foes in midpack down the backstretch, was put
to tight quarters into the turn by an outer foe, came into the lane behind that rival with traffic in front of her, shifted to the three path passing the three
sixteenths pole, and produced a rally inside of rivals to prove second best. SILVER AND ACES was forwardly placed four wide while in the five path, then
kept on through the lane for a minor share. ON THE HONOR ROLL was forwardly placed pressing the loose leader in the four path around the turn, but
proved no match for that foe turning for home, held place to the sixteenth pole, but weakened late. JOMO tracked from midpack in the five path around the
turn, came into the lane in the six path between horses, but failed to produce a bid. FLYIN' EASY was caught widest while tracking the pace in the six to
seven path around the turn, then drifted out through the lane while keeping on to vie for minor rewards, but was outfinished. LIL CAPO CADDY pressed the
leader from the outside early on, backed off to tracked from the three path between horses around the turn, but weakened turning for home. KING BLING
was crowded early on, trailed by a distance around the turn, then passed tired foes through the lane. AUGUSTUS MAXIMUS was outrun. DOC'S GOLD
tracked from midpack four wide and between horses early on, angled inwards while clearing inner foes at the seven sixteenths pole, advanced to striking
position while shifting to the inside into the turn, but weakened turning for home, and stopped through the lane.

GIOBLAST set the pace inside of a pair of foes into the first turn, cleared off down the backstretch, held her margin in hand turning for home, then held sway
while hanging on her left lead to the sixteenth pole, then switched leads at that marker to secure the victory and to win going away. BREEZY BEE saved
ground far off of the pace around the first turn, advanced between horses, but was held up among traffic into the far turn, cut the corner with lengths to find
turning for home, shifted to the three, then four, path passing the furlong pole, and rallied late to achieve place. CASA BONITA split horses into the far turn
and advanced in the three path around that bend, cut the corner turning for home, and sustained a rally inside of foes through the lane, but was outfinished
by an outer foe for place. LIGHTNING BUG vied two wide between horses into the first turn, pressed the pace setter down the backstretch, came under a
drive turning for home to produce a bid, but failed to achieve even terms through midstretch, then failed to keep pace at the sixteenth pole, and was
outfinished by rivals on both sides approaching the wire. FLASH N GO tracked three wide, held striking position turning for home, then kept on through the
lane, but was outfinished by inner and outer foes. TEMPLE TOWER tracked along the inside, but was shuffled behind a tiring foe to trail the field into the far
turn, then stayed on along the inside through the lane stages. WEEKEND MADNESS trailed early on, slightly gained ground in the four path around the far
turn, but failed to produce a bid. SOUTHERN CENTS advanced four wide around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch, and weakened.
SHESMYBROKER vied for the lead three wide while in the four path into the first turn, but steadily faded thereafter. DAME OF THRONES tracked two wide
and between horses from the second flight, but weakened at the seven sixteenths pole, and rapidly faded into the far turn.

DIRECT DIAL stumbled at the start tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer turning for home to produce a three wide bid for the lead in upper
stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. LULLABY BLING dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage turning for home, but was headed by an
outer foe at the furlong pole, then held place. TRUMPS REVENGE tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but took up in to the turn, then
stayed on late between horses. WONDERS OF HISLOVE dueled for the lead along the inside, but was headed in upper stretch, kept on, but weakened late.
J C'S NIGHTCAP stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail in upper stretch while right behind the leaders, but failed to produce a bid and was
outfinished for minor rewards. MORO APPEAL trailed early on, took the turn in the five path, and failed to factor. AFFLUENT GENTLEMAN was off a bit
slowly, rushed to chase the pace four wide, but weakened turning for home and stopped through the lane.

ISLAND SUN prompted then vied for the lead three to two wide, forged a narrow lead turning for home, then edged clear through the final furlong. POLICY
LIMIT settled off of the pace inside of foes, shifted to the six path passing the five sixteenths pole, rallied outside while hanging on his left lead and drifting in
through the lane. CARBON STRYKER tracked from midpack four wide while in the five path, inched closer turning for home, hung on his left lead in upper
stretch and drifted in, but stayed on for a minor reward. IMPERIAL FLYER set the pace inside of pressing rivals, was headed by the eventual winner turning
for home, and weakened through the lane. K C TIZ MORO chased the pace two wide, but was outmoved by wider foes in upper stretch, and finished up
evenly. APPEAL GUY tracked from the three path in midpack around the turn, but was no factor. G DON'T KNOW was forwardly placed five wide early on,
vied three wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with inner foes turning for home, then weakened between horses on his left lead. A HUNK OF
HEAVEN steadied early on, trailed the field by a large margin around the turn, then passed tired foes through the lane. MY BLARNEY STONE chased the
pace along the inside, but weakened turning for home. GREY ROGUE was off slowly, then took the turn in the five to seven path while far off of the pace,
and failed to factor. CRESSON shied inwards at the start, then failed to make an impact.

GREAT AFFECTION dueled for the lead inside of SWIFT RED BIRD, began to prevail over that foe in upper stretch, kicked away at the furlong pole, then
held sway safely through the late stages. THATSALOTOFBLING was forwardly placed two wide, but steadied slightly between horses at the five sixteenths
pole, cut the corner turning for home, then shifted three wide and stayed on late to get up for place at the wire. SWIFT RED BIRD dueled for the lead
outside of GREAT AFFECTION, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, weakened through the final furlong, and got nailed on the wire for
place. NOT ENOUGH BLING stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path at the quarter pole, but drifted to the five path turning for home, then
continued to drift out through the lane before greenly flopping back to her left lead in the final sixteenth. TRINITY QUEEN hopped inwards and bumped a foe
at the start, then saved ground while far off of the pace, and produced a mild rally, bu failed to threaten. MISSHEARTBREAKER bumped with an outer foe
at the start, vied for the lead three wide down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with inner foes into the turn, and subsequently weakened.
CRESCENDO BLING trailed the field early on, and failed to factor. SOUNDSLIKEAWINNER raced in midpack in the three to four path around the turn, but
was done early.

Footnotes
CORLUNA was forwardly placed along the inside around the first turn, shifted two then three wide around the far turn while between horses and just off the
leaders, produced a three wide bid for the lead in upper stretch, then kicked away strongly passing the furlong pole. HERBS LOVE settled off of the pace
along the inside around the first turn, rated in hand into the far turn while waiting behind the leading group, remained blocked to the quarter pole,
commenced a rally turning for home before splitting foes four wide approaching the furlong pole, and prevailed for place while no match for the leader. GEE
SHE SPARKLES trailed the field in the three to two path around the first turn, commenced a rally in the latter half of the far turn, circled rivals six wide
turning for home, and rallied outside of foes for a minor share. SHES OUR FASTEST raced off of the pace while stuck in the five path around both turns, but
kept on through the lane for a minor reward while getting outfinished. AVERYS MISS prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, inched forward and
forged a lead at the half mile pole, drew clear of her inner foe, then dueled for the lead inside of BRAZOS ANGEL around the far turn, dug in to hold an
advantage in upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong pole. BRAZOS ANGEL stalked the pace two wide in the three path around the first turn, made bid
for the lead into the far turn and dueled outside of AVERYS MISS around that bend, but then weakened between horses turning for home. VEILAZIG set the
pace along the inside around the first turn, but was headed at the half mile pole, and steadily gave way thereafter. EATON'S MEMORY was forwardly
placed in the four path, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.

SCARLETTSBLACKJACK edged clear of inner foes into the first turn and set the pace along the inside, kicked clear in upper stretch, and held sway through
the lane under driving pressure. CARLOS SIXES saved ground around both turns from midpack, inched forward to produce a bid for place along the inside
turning for home as the leader kicked away, dueled inside of CARIBBEAN (AUS) for that position through the lane, and prevailed. CARIBBEAN (AUS)
prompted the leaders three wide, failed to keep pace with the inner leader turning for home, but dug in stoutly for place as CARLOS SIXES made an inner
bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of that foe, but was outfinished. TOP DRAW was off a bit slowly, was caught in the five path around both turns, and
weakened at the quarter pole, then fended off foes for a minor reward. EL SUPREMO tracked from midpack in the four path around the first turn, then two
wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. MAGIC MICHAEL trailed early on, took both turns in the six path, and failed to produce a
bid on his left lead through the lane. TRUSTWORTHY pulled between horses to vie for the lead two wide around the first turn, but weakened at the five
sixteenths pole, and subsequently stopped.
