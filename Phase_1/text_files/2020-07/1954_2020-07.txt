HI HO CHEERIO tracked the pacesetter outside a rival under light rating racing to the turn, steadily advanced on the leader nearing upper stretch to wrest
the advantage leaving the three sixteenths marker, shifted to the three path nearing midstretch and responded when challenged to hold DINNER AT
CRUMPIES on a safe margin under firm handling. The latter, a bit slow into stride, tracked off the second flight along the inside, angled to the four path in
upper stretch, moved to challenge leaving midstretch but proved only second best. FRANK THE MAYOR tracked the pacesetter as part of the second flight
racing a bit off the rail through the backstretch into the turn, was urged to bid between foes while inside the winner nearing midstretch but was outkicked by
the top pair. CHAMPS SUCCESS sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail, set the pace to upper stretch and gave way. GRAPHYTE settled outside foes
in early stages and failed to menace.

CYNICAL GIRL, urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the turn, shifted out nearing upper stretch and edged forward under firm encouragement. BLUE
LIZZY, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, was fanned three wide into the lane and couldn't match terms with the winner
late. LETS PARDI MARTI tracked off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted four wide into the lane while being urged to advance and made mild progress to
prevail for a share. MIZZANNA settled last racing to the turn, shifted out and improved position between foes in late stages. GOTHAM CITY QUEEN,
forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid.
INTHEMISTYMOONLITE forced the pace three deep racing through the backstretch, bore out to the six path on the turn and faded into the lane. HOT
BRANDI, off a bit slowly, settled along the rail and trailed the field into the stretch.

HOTASAPISTOL angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, shifted out three wide on the turn, advanced in that path racing past
midstretch and wrested a clear advantage late under firm hand urging while her rider flashed the whip right handed. A ROZE AND WINE vied between foes
for command in the opening stages, was eased outside rivals conceding some position nearing the turn, was urged to challenge for command midway
through the bend, gained a narrow advantage racing into the stretch, couldn't contain the winner but continued with a grudging effort to prevail for the place
honors. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL broke sharply, angled inwards forcing the pace outside foes to gain a narrow advantage racing into the turn, shifted to the rail
entering the bend, dueled inside the top pair into the lane and weakened late. MADISONIAN, forwardly placed along the inside prompting the pace in the
opening stages, tracked just off the leaders along the rail into the lane but had no late kick. ALL NATIVE switched well off the inside early tracking well off
the first flight, swung four wide racing into the lane but made no impact. BINDING TIME settled outside a rival in the last flight early, angled out to the three
path, then four wide into the lane but had no closing bid. ORTS DREAM settled along the rail and soon trailed.

CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR broke readily to gain terms with a rival attending the pace in hand racing to the turn, was prompted to go clear entering the lane and
widened late under mild urging. MUWAAN MAT tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch
while being prompted to advance, shifted inwards under pressure but proved only second best. GRADED ATTITUDE, urged to dispute the pace racing a bit
off the rail from the outset into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way while prevailing for a share. MIZONEY settled along the rail in the opening
stages, angled out four wide racing past midstretch and continued to improve position. JAKEALINA tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the
turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane but had no late bid. DAT GIRL tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the turn and faded into upper
stretch. QUEEN ISABELLA settled last and failed to menace. STUNNED tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the turn and gave way after a half.

THEALLIGATORHUNTER, off a step slowly, was hustled up the rail to gain a narrow advantage after the opening sixteenth, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin into the turn, then to upper stretch, ducked out under some left handed pressure in late stages but was immediately righted and remained clear
under firm encouragement. FITZPATRICK, off a bit slow, recovered quickly to race between foes just off the second flight, shifted to the inside entering the
turn steadily gaining position, shifted outside the pacesetter while moving to challenge in the closing stages but was steadied momentarily nearing the wire
and couldn't gain even terms. KID'S INHERITANCE, off last, settled into stride splitting rivals, angled inside on the turn and continued to make steady
progress gaining position to the end. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE, reserved last in early stages, was prompted to advance five wide racing through the turn and
gained some position in an even effort. C D THUNDER broke readily, was urged three wide between foes in pursuit of the winner into the turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch. HISMUDDAWASAMUDDA tracked off the first flight outside foes, made brief progress four wide on the turn but flattened out in upper
stretch. COLONEL GRAY settled between foes early and failed to menace. FIFTHTOWNFLUSH dropped out early. PASSTHECAT flashed brief pace inside
foes and gave way racing into the turn. STAY MY FAYVORITE urged four wide through the backstretch pursuing the pacesetter to the turn, gave way early.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF FITZPATRICK LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN LATE
STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

TWO BE ROYAL, reserved last in hand to the backstretch, circled foes with an early move four wide through the far turn to gain a clear advantage in upper
stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. TRENDY NEVE tracked just off the first flight between rivals racing to the backstretch, exchanged
some bumps when caught in close quarters midway through the far turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch to pursue the eventual winner and
just lasted for second. LILA'S LUCKY LADY broke readily, was prompted to a forward placing along the inside, stalked just off the first flight inside foes
under firm rating racing to the far turn, was held up in close quarters racing into the lane when lacking a path from which to advance, then switched outside
foes in the closing stages to make belated progress while just missing for second. DREAMING BIZ tracked off the second flight along the inside, was held
up in tight quarters racing into upper stretch, then switched outside foes to gain some position late. SHOT OF WINE raced three wide into the first turn, was
urged to gain a forward placing three deep racing just outside the leaders into the backstretch, exchanged some contact midway through the far turn, was
urged to press the issue while shifting inwards racing into the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. GREY WAVE was urged to gain the lead along the
inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating racing to the far turn, then faded into the lane. HELEN'SPHOTOFLASH, in touch with the
pacesetter prompting that rival racing to the far turn, was caught in close quarters midstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HUNTER'S HELLCAT, held up out of close quarters at the start, was rated outside foes tracking off the second flight in the opening stages, commenced a
steady four wide advance on the turn to challenge for command in tandem with SPEEDING LADY racing into upper stretch and went clear late under firm
left handed pressure. The latter gained a position just off the first flight racing through the backstretch, was urged to bid for command three deep between
foes nearing upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the winner. SHAY'S GLORY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn, switched out
entering the lane and continued with an even effort to earn a share. CHARMING FURY broke slowly, angled inside racing through the backstretch, shifted
out to split foes entering the turn and angled out entering the lane gaining position while no real threat. TOP SHELF SARA settled off the second flight
between foes early and never seriously menaced. UNBRIDLEDMOONLIGHT angled inwards prompting a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, edged
forward between foes on the turn but gave out once headed by the top pair entering the lane. BLUE MOON BELLE, urged to the lead while angling to the
inside, dueled for command into the turn and gave way nearing the lane. MZ JACKIE was a brief factor between foes in second flight but gave way early.
PILOTS STAR proved no factor. GIVE EM SHADE tracked the pace inside foes in second flight nearest the rail and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HOIST YOUR GLASS tracked the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out to split foes four wide midstretch and
edged forward to prevail under firm handling. MISCHIEVOUS MO tracked off the second flight while shifting out four wide to the backstretch, was prompted
to advance on the far turn, was fanned six wide into the lane and prevailed for second. SEMI CHARMED DAY angled to the inside early tracking off the
second flight, saved ground to upper stretch, was urged to advance in tight quarters inside foes midstretch, then shifted out to prevail for a share on the
wire. LITTLE INSTIGATOR, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival into the backstretch, edged clear into upper stretch but failed to sustain that momentum.
SLIGHTLY CRAFTY settled outside foes racing to the first turn, was prompted with an early move to gain a position just off the leaders racing three deep
into the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane while making a brief bid but quickly came up empty. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK settled along the inside
racing to the far turn, swung out entering the lane but had no rally. UNCLE TAP, urged prompting a rival's pace through early stages to the far turn, gave
way into upper stretch while bumping a rival. CINTAROSA RANCH, pulling against restraint along the inside tracking just off the first flight, was urged to
advance in close quarters in upper stretch, was bumped by UNCLE TAP and quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
COURTING MOONLIGHT, reserved last near the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum along the inside on the far turn, altered
course twice racing into upper stretch, then shifted five wide in the closing stages to prevail under firm handling. DIRECT IMPACT settled near the inside
racing to the backstretch, steadily gained contention nearing the lane, angled four wide in upper stretch to bid for command but proved no match for the
winner. YOU SAY SO, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset into the far turn, dueled inside foes past midstretch but yielded late. BYE
BYE BENNIE was rated off the first flight near the inside, shifted three wide after a half, moved to press the pace in that path on the far turn and faltered in
upper stretch. WINTERS RUN, in touch between foes in the first flight racing to the first turn, was taken back nearing the backstretch to track off the second
flight, angled out five wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no rally. BRANDY CHASER, urged along the rail disputing the pace from
the outset to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. MAS TAKELA, caught five wide racing into the first turn tracking off the leaders, continued in brief
pursuit four wide through the backstretch but gave way on the far turn. CAPTAIN OF SUMMER, caught four wide into the first turn while being prompted to
contention, was through after a half.
