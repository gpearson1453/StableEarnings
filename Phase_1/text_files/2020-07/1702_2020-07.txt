Footnotes
ELWOOD'S ADVICE moved on pace putting a head in front on the far turn, digging in from the three then two paths down the lane held on gamely. MY
OWN LANE unhurried early advanced on the far turn bidding gamely abreast rivals from the three path down the lane. THE CATMANCAN stalked the pace
looming into upper stretch extending in the four path lacking late punch. THAT'S BUCKBEAK hustled up early was worked on pace dueling from the rail to
upper stretch ceding grudgingly in the final yards. LOYALTY SPIRIT stalked the pace chasing to upper stretch hanging late in the three path. PENCE angled
out on the backside making a wide push through the far turn wavering in the eight path upper stretch. BOLD CHARMANT played no factor. LAST
CONFESSION chased the pace through the far turn before weakening in the four path upper stretch. MIND MAGIC failed to respond.Due to timer
malfunction six furlong split was unavailable.

Footnotes
RED CAT (CHI) slow early advanced on the far turn looming seven wide into upper stretch surging steadily to arrive in time. DRAGUNOV stalked the pace
bidding three deep near the quarter pole clearing in upper stretch angling from the three to the six path to meet a wide challenge ceding in the last yards.
REPLAY off slowly lagged to the far turn, angled six wide in upper stretch ran past the others. BLACK CIRCLE slow early gave a mild move to upper stretch
finishing evenly in the three path. UNCLE DAVE tracked evenly through the far turn extending from mid track in upper stretch weakening under a drive.
TREE FIRE away alertly pressed the pace dueling through the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. RUOTE played no factor. WAR OR PEACE sent clear
set the pace dueling on the far turn wilting in upper stretch. PLEASANT OUTLOOK chased early then faded into upper stretch. Due to timer malfunction six

INVOCATION slow early saved ground to upper stretch splitting horses late in the two path to prevail. BIRD CALL chased the pace bidding between horses
the final sixteenth just missing. POLISHED STEEL gained on the turn vying four wide down the lane being right there at the end. A DIFFERENT STYLE
veered in leaving the gate, lost ground to upper stretch rallying under a brisk drive closing in from the seven path. NICAMORE raced mid pack through the
turn coming from the four path in upper stretch being in range late needing a finish. OUT AT EIGHT pressed the pace dueling on the turn cutting the corner
to shake clear along the rail in upper stretch being caught late. ZEN PAPA slow early raced eight wide down the lane showing some late interest. THE FAZZ
MAN pressed the pace dueling briskly through the turn before giving way in upper stretch. STARSHIP THOR gave way on the turn.

cleared in upper stretch angling in then back out trying to tighten rival to no avail. COME ON CALLIE tracked the pace through the turn coming five wide
down the lane lacking surge while holding the rest well safe. SHIPMANS MAGIC raced mid pack angling six wide in upper stretch finishing evenly. PENNYS
FROM HEAVEN slow early lagged through the turn, mustered a minor response down the lane picking up tired ones. LIGHT HEARTED played no factor.

playing no factor. SWISS DOT gave way on the turn.
