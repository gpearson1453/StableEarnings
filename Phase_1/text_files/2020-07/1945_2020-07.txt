Footnotes
BOBBY BRINKLEY vied for the lead from the inside, built a clear lead into the upper stretch and was well clear late under strong handling. SR. BI BI stalked
the pace, moved up along the inside into the stretch but was no match for the winner. WINGS FOR ENO stalked the early pace, raced three deep through
the lane and had no late response. REDBIRD'S INTEREST was slow to begin, veered in nearing the eighth pole while racing four wide and never was a
serious threat. FEARLESS BLING was hustled along to press between rivals and tired. STRAWSUPONREQUEST raced up close early, raced four wide at
the quarter pole and weakened through the drive. VICKSLINCOLNLAWYER settled off the early pace, raced three wide in the lane and had no response.
FLYING THE REDEYE dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. LORD IS MY VICTORY was shuffled back at the
break and trailed throughout.

SUPER HUMOR set all the pace from the inside and held gamely to be clear under steady handling. SOARING NOW was off slowly, moved up five wide at
the eighth pole and gained ground in the final stages. POTRA LIZA settled off the early pace, moved up four wide through the stretch and had not enough
late. FROZEN HANNAH tracked the leader while racing two wide and weakened in the drive. BOATHOUSE VIEW stalked the pace, raced along the inside
around the far turn through the stretch and had no response. SPUN LINE settled towards the back in the early stages and failed to respond. BOLD REY
failed to sustain a bid.

MULA WILD stalked the early pace along the inside, lacked room just past the quarter pole to the eighth pole, found room along the inside and finished
gamely to get up under strong handling. SOLAR CITY stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. GOLIATH RIDGE
pressed the early pace while racing between rivals and tired in the final stages. FIRST BUMP RIDGE was allowed to settle early, raced four wide at the
quarter pole, angled to the inside through the stretch and had not enough late. RED ECLIPSE pressed the pace from the outside and gave way. WITTNESS
THIS settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. WEST TEXAS SONG failed to respond. OUTFOXED SE was
slow early and never threatened. PROUD TO SERVE showed good speed along the inside and tired readily.

IMPACT PLAYER pressed the early pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and weakened a bit late. RESTORING HOPE stalked the pace while racing
three deep, raced along the inside through the stretch and had no final winning bid. LEROY settled off the early pace, raced three wide at the eighth pole
and had no rally. DOUBLE BARREL MAN failed to have a response. NEW COLOSSUS was slow early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was
a factor. TUMBLING SKY stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide just past the quarter pole and tired.
