ANISSA settled off the loose pacesetter, bid on the final turn, led into the stretch and held rival safe following a long drive. I'M THIRSTY quickly sprinted
away, was collared at the quarter pole and continued gamely to the finish. DESCARADO stalked the leaders three wide and flattened out through the
stretch. PRETTY COOL CAT saved ground far behind and was never in contention. RESONATE saved ground, was put to urging on the final turn and gave
way. SYDNEY TIME trailed throughout while losing ground.

GAMBIT quickly took control, repelled a challenge on the final turn then eagerly pulled away under a brisk hand ride. MY MAN ELVIS rated inside early,
angled out on the final turn, rallied but was no match for the winner. PROUD AND FURIOUS chased wide throughout and came again for the show in the
final furlong. MUNTAHEZ broke sluggishly, angled inside, made a brief rally on the final turn then faded. CATAPULT JACK pursued the winner to the far
turn then gave way readily.

Footnotes
WATCH YOUR WORDS vied for command two wide, fought back while drifting out under right handed pressure and got the nod. TRULY A MOON SHOT
was four wide, drifted out badly under left handed pressure when taking the lead but couldn't last. RINGS OF JUPITER saved ground, also drifted out
through stretch and had no late kick. A J'S WAY, between foes, steadied between foes in the opening quarter, moved out through the stretch and rallied.
ROANIE vied for command in the three path then tired. SUNRISE SATURDAY saved ground and failed to menace. STORM TALES broke slowly, raced
wide and was outrun. HE'S GOT TALENT, three wide, failed to menace. SAMADI SKY vied for command three wide then gave way leaving the turn.
MALIBU HIGH, very wide, showed little.

Footnotes
BIRD TYCOON saved ground, angled out rallying into the stretch, inherited the lead a sixteenth out gamely lasted. DYNAMIC MISS settled inside, swung
wide into the stretch and closed well but could not get to the winner. LAYLA'S VOYAGE raced close up outside, faded on the final turn then came again for
the show while no threat. LOYAL AFICIONADA prompted the pace outside to the stretch then came up empty. ART FORM lagged far behind, moved wide
on the final turn with a mild bid. PASS IT ON lacked speed and was never in contention. SWEET REBELLION offered a wide middle move after the half mile
then gave way. GO METRO GIRL dropped back early and lacked a rally. ANGEL RAPHAEL prompted the leaders three wide then stopped through the
stretch. LADY LUCY LU set a measured pace, widened in the stretch, drifted into the gap then ducked in under a right handed whip and went through the
rail at the sixteenth pole. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident in the stretch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
J J LOVES BILLY, in the four path, tried to split foes and was caught behind a wall of horses on the turn turn and waited briefly, moved out and went three
wide on the turn, eased out wider into stretch, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and drew off driving. LADY VALENTINA chased the pace two wide, took
the lead leaving the turn but then was no match. GODDESS OF CASH, two wide, fell back on the turn, eased out and was no threat. SMARTY PI broke
slowly, was hustled up along the rail to race just off the pace then tired. HAY BUCK, just off the rail while outrun, passed faders. IT'S A SHAW THING threw
her head up at the break getting off a bit slowly, recovered quickly and was sent to set the pace inside then had little left. BAYLEAF raced three wide while
not far back, tired. NANCY B was wide and failed to menace.

AFTERBURNER settled off the leaders, bid inside to the lead at the top of the stretch and edged off under steady handling. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF set a
clear pace inside, was collared on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. STRONG BREEZE saved ground close up, vied on the final turn and
continued willingly. QUICK LEARNER stalked the pacesetter three wide then proved empty in the stretch. FOREST RIVER dropped back along the inside
and showed some late energy. FINGLAS raced well behind and was never in contention. TUFFY'S LUCKY lagged far back then passed fading rivals.
GILDED WARRIOR broke slowest and was always outrun. DIAMOND SQUARE was under firm restraint trying to bear out on the first turn and again in the
stretch and was being eased. KRAKOV lacked speed and gave way readily. Due the rail being out 22 feet fractional times were hand-timed.

Footnotes
SOLID GOLD DANCER didn't break sharply, was wide into and through the first turn and then was steered to the rail, set the pace in three path, edged
clear on the final turn, drifted out badly under left handed pressure through stretch, impeded MAGICALLYDELICIOUS in deep stretch and lasted. BELONGS
TO BABE, never far back in four path, moved to the rail on the backstretch, steadied along in traffic on the far turn, angled out into stretch, also drifted out
through stretch and just missed. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS,, three wide and just off the pace, drifted out near mid stretch but was straightened away then
took up when impeded in the late stages. JUMPINTOACTION, just off the rail and just off pace, drifted out and tired. ELIANA'S MISSION, far back early,
closed too late along the rail. BELVA LOCKWOOD broke slowest, raced wide and stopped suddenly. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A CLAIM
OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MAGICALLYDELICIOUS, SOLID GOLD DANCER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
MINISTER'S STRIKE trailed early, advanced along the inside, led passing the eighth pole and kept rivals safe late. GOTTA GET AWAY controlled the pace
inside, was collared into the stretch, and continued gamely. SMALL HOPE settled off the pace near the inside, swung wide into the stretch, reached even
terms but was outfinished. FLAT BILL dropped back early then passed rivals without menacing. SPIDER JORGENSEN moved closer inside on the final turn
then came up empty. MARTINI KID prompted the pace outside for three quarters and faltered. TRICKED UP raced close up three wide to the final turn and
stopped.

Footnotes
MANOLETE was bumped then bobbled slightly leaving gate thirty-four minutes past scheduled post time, split rivals rallying on the turn, moved out racing
into stretch and was along in time. HEY JABBER JAW set the pace just off the rail, drifted out though stretch and was outfinished. KING'S HOUSE saved
ground just off the pace and held on gamely. DODDSPRIVATELABEL, two wide while outrun to stretch, swung out very wide and rallied. DRAXHALL
WOODS broke slowly, raced in the three path while outrun, drifted wider and passed faders. TRUE WISDOM, very wide and well placed early, dropped
back. JACKS A WARRIOR was outside and just off the pace, faded through the drive. ASK CHUCK came in and bumped winner leaving the gate then
drifted out, was two wide and never a serious threat. OFF DUTY, just off the rail and just off the early pace, tired. UNDER THE GRAYDAR came out leaving
the gate then raced very wide. INCENSED, fanned wide leaving the gate, failed to menace. E J'S REVENGE prompted the pace outside, lost his action and
stopped suddenly near mid stretch, was quickly pulled up quickly just passed the wire, walked back to the unsaddling area and then walked off on his own.
THE STEWARDS LITE THE INQUIRY SIGN CONCERNING E J'S REVENGE IN THE STRETCH BUT THEY TOOK NO ACTION.
