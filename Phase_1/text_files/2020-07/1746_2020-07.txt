Footnotes
DAVID NOSE BEST was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off
with complete authority. LIBERTY'S FINALE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, moved up for a striking position from
his stable-mate but could not gain on that rival in the drive. GREY POINT hopped at the start, pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and
gave way to that foe after the opening quarter.

OMACHE KID raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards. MITCH AND JOHN
E was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run, opened a clear margin but could not
resist the winner from over the top. REDROCK TRAIL broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, drifted slightly in mid-stretch while retreating
and continued to give way. ITS ALLABOUT JERRY bobbled at the start, dropped far back early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with some
late run. CREST DRIVE was away in good order to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after a half. HOTNTHIRSTY lacked early foot,
raced off the rail through the turn and did not reach contention. BULLET EXPRESS raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened.

moved four-wide through the turn, checked into the stretch and weakened in the drive. UNSOLICITEDOPINION broke sharply to duel for the lead from the

Footnotes
WINDRIBBON sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with little need of urging. TIZ MANNY was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but was no match for the winner in the drive. VIOLENT
BEHAVIOR lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. MOJAVE showed no early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and passed tiring foes late. CODE CHARLIE chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.
RACE OFFICE broke sharply, showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
SMARTY JEANS was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held sway to the
wire. DRAGON LADY broke in to bump rival, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and
finished with good late energy. LIVING LEGEND bobbled at the start then was forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the
drive. DATCAT was bumped at the break, chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. CLONGIFFEN
broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after the opening quarter. STAR FUSION lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. VIA ALPINA hopped at the start and was bumped, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the
quarter and did not menace. MY GIRL COCO was off a step slow, raced off the pacesetters early, weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ROCKET POWER settled off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down LOCHNESS in
the closing yards to be going away late. LOCHNESS set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, drifted out in mid-stretch and gave way grudgingly to the
winner late. R B EYE raced unhurried early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and again nearing the sixteenth pole and
finished with good late energy. FREESTONE pressed the pace while racing four-wide, bumped with LOBANESS into the stretch and gave way in the drive.
NORSKI lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the quarter and finished with some late run. WILSON TO LOCKETT raced
off the pacesetters from the inside throughout and lacked the needed rally. LOBANESS was away in good order to press the pace of LOCHNESS while
racing three-wide, bumped with FREESTONE into the lane, angled in with a furlong to run and gave way. ZOOMBIYA broke awkwardly, showed brief
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
FORTUNE'S FREUDE broke out to bump rival, raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch, responded
to aggressive handling and was up in the final yards. PERFECT BLOSSOM press the pace of SUNSHINE EMILY while racing three-wide, moved up to take
command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin into the stretch but could not resist the winner late. LITTLE DANCER was reserved just off the leaders
early, saved ground into the lane, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly late. FIERY CAUSE was away in good order to press
the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. JERRE TO CARRIE was bumped at the break, lagged early, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. SUNSHINE EMILY was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going a half.
GUARDIAN ONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.
