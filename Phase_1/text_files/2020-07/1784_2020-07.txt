Footnotes
LOOKING AT LIBERTY bobbled slightly at the start, tracked from midpack in the three path around the first turn, advanced to make a three wide bid for the
lead at the half mile pole, forged an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, met TWENTY TWICE's bid turning for home, dug in inside of that foe in upper
stretch, repelled that rival passing the furlong pole, and drew away. TWENTY TWICE raced far off of the pace in the four path around the first turn,
advanced in the four path with a rally under mild encouragement through the far turn to produce a bid for the lead in the three path turning for home, dueled
for the lead in upper stretch, but was repelled by the leader passing the furlong pole. ROGUE ELEMENT pressed the early leader from the outside while out
in the three path, vied for the lead into the far turn while between horses as LOOKING AT LIBERTY made a three wide bid, failed to keep pace with that foe
and his entry mate approaching the quarter pole, then dug in inside of DYNACHARGE in upper stretch, and kept on through the lane to hold show.
DYNACHARGE rallied in the three to four path around the far turn to bid for show in upper stretch, but leveled off and was outfinished for that position. MAU
MAU bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed early on, swung from the five path to the seven path turning for home, and offered a mild rally outside of
tiring rivals, but failed to threaten. COPPER KING broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, settled far off of the pace two wide and between horses,
saved ground around the far turn, but was forced to the six path turning for home, then failed to make an impact. KID SHELLEEN stalked the pace from
along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders at the five sixteenths pole shifted to the two to three path turning for home, but weakened between
horses. CIVIL SERVANT set the pace while staying a path off of the inner rail, met challenges from multiple foes into the far turn, but weakened at the five
sixteenths pole, and subsequently stopped. WOLFHAND was forwardly placed in the two path, but came under a drive into the far turn, darted outwards
turning for home forcing a foe wider, and weakened, then failed to return to the winner's circle to be unsaddled, was untacked near entrance to the
clubhouse turn gap, and walked off. TWELVE ROCKS saved ground from midpack, but was done early, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
THERIDEOFALIFETIME broke sharply and quickly established an advantage, set the pace without pressure while staying a path or so off of the inner rail,
kicked away from chasing foes in upper stretch when called upon, and widened his margin under driving pressure through the lane. SWILL was forwardly
placed two wide and between horses, inched closer in the latter part of the turn to make a two wide bid for the lead in the three path approach the quarter
pole, but delayed his lead change in upper stretch causing him to fail to keep pace with the leader, drifted in slightly, switched leads at the three sixteenths
pole, then kept on to achieve place. SHELL SHOCKER broke a bit inwards, stalked the leader from the inside while close to the pace, but failed to keep
pace with that foe in upper stretch, then was outfinished by an outer foe for place. SNAKE DOCTOR raced far off of the pace in the four path through the
turn, angled inwards turning for home, then stayed on mildly along the rail for a minor reward. PALAZZI was urged along from midpack while two wide,
shifted to the four path in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly without threatening. CATIPARI was off a step slow, shifted from the two to the four path
turning for home while far off of the pace, then lugged in through the lane. DIRECTIONAL was forwardly placed four to three wide into the turn, but failed to
keep pace at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. LITTLE ALEX was forwardly placed three wide between horses early on, but took
back at the nine sixteenths pole to track from midpack, shifted to the four path around the turn, but weakened in the five path in upper stretch. LEBLON
shied a bit inwards at the start, was urged along throughout while midpack along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. PLONDER was off a
step slow, and was outrun while saving grond. MR. BRUTUS was off slowly and broke inwards, the trailed the field throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
MUNDAYE CALL stalked three wide early on, pulled forward to bid for the lead at the half mile pole, vied two wide around the turn before assuming
command in hand approaching the quarter pole, then kicked away to build on his advantage through the lane. PERFECT HAPPINESS rushed along the
inside early on to be close to the pace two wide and between horses at the half mile pole, held position among traffic through the turn, inched place in the
two path turning for home while the leader cleared off, and proved second best. SHE CAN'T SING rallied in the four path between horses in the latter part of
the turn to produce a bid for place in upper stretch, but leveled off and was outfinished for that position. REMANDED rallied in the five path and outside of
rivals to produce a bid turning for home, but drifted to the six path in upper stretch and flattened out. SENSE OF PLACE set the pace two wide early on,
cleared to the rail while meeting a challenge from MUNDAYE CALL, held a narrow advantage from that foe around the turn, but was headed by him at the
quarter pole, and gave way through the lane. GOLDEN CURL tracked from midpack in the four path, but was outmoved by multiple foes at the five
sixteenths pole, shifted to the six path turning for home, but failed to factor. CROWN JEWEL broke a bit inwards, raced in midpack in the two path and
between horses around the turn, but was no factor. TIPSY GAL saved ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail. NAYIBETH vied along the inside
early on, but stalked the leaders from the inside into the turn, shifted to the two path in upper stretch, but weakened. LETTERS TO BELLE was forwardly
placed four to three wide, but was swallowed up between horses turning for home. TORTUGA hesitated at the start, then trailed throughout, and showed
little.

Footnotes
ENOLA GAY stalked the pace along the inside, rated through the far turn before tipping off of the rail in upper stretch, shifted to the four path at the furlong
pole with multiple lengths to find, produced a strong late rally with a swift turn of foot through the final stages, and just got up to catch the leaders at the wire.
WALK IN MARRAKESH (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide around the first turn, inched forward following ALMS' move into the far turn, stalked that foe
and EVIL LYN from the three path around the far turn, produced a three wide bid at the three sixteenths pole, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong pole,
battled with his inner game rival through the late stages, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging foe. ALMS prompted the pace setter from the
two path, inched forward to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, vied between horses at the three sixteenths pole as her inner counterpart dug in and
WALK IN MARRAKESH (IRE) ranged up along side, was headed by the latter at the furlong pole, fought on gamely through the late stages, but failed to
regain even terms with that foe while getting outfinished by an outer oncharging rival. EVIL LYN set the pace along the inside while tugging under a long
rein, dueled for the lead inside of ALMS at the five sixteenths pole, dug in in upper stretch inside of that foe and WALK IN MARRAKESH (IRE), but yielded
at the sixteenth pole. PASSION FACTOR settled off of the pace two wide around the first turn, took the far turn in the three path, but failed to menace
through the lane. MARIAFOOT (FR) trailed the short field along the inside, shifted to the two path into the far turn, inched forward to be between horses at
the five sixteenths pole, angled inwards off heels at the quarter pole as her inner foe cleared and angled out, then failed to menace along the inside through
the lane.

Footnotes
GUARANA set the pace along the inside from the onset while feeling pressure from MIA MISCHIEF off of her right flank, vied inside of that foe while holding
an advantage around the turn, shifted to the two path turning for home while digging in, but was headed by her counterpart in upper stretch, battled on
courageously through the late stages, regained even terms inside the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage approaching the wire. MIA MISCHIEF
pressed the pace setter from the outside, vied for the lead two wide around the turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, failed to kick away from her inner
foe in midstretch as that foe battled on, and was outgamed by that rival through the late stages. BELL'S THE ONE stalked two wide and between horses,
but waited for racing room around the turn, lost position passing the five sixteenths pole as others made wide moves, shifted to the three then four path
turning for home, stayed on between horses to forge show at the three sixteenth spole, then held that position to the wire without gaining on the leaders.
WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY was forwardly placed along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home, then chased those foes evenly
through the lane. SALLY'S CURLIN bumped with a foe at the start, then was slow to get going in the early stages, took the turn in the five path while trying
to mount a rally, but tried to lug out through the latter part of the turn, and failed to factor. UNIQUE FACTOR tracked from midpack, shifted to the three then
four path around the turn, commenced a rally at the five sixteenths pole, but drifted to the five path in upper stretch and flattened out. AMY'S CHALLENGE
stalked the leader three wide while a bit keen from restraint, but weakened between horses in the four path in upper stretch. DIAMOND CRAZY trailed
throughout and was overmatched.

four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, had a late kick and was gaining in the final stages. EXTRAVAGANT KID was off a tad slow at the start and

Footnotes

the three path entering the lane, continued on down the lane, collared foe, drove past her near the eighth pole and won going away in the final stages.
SWISS SKYDIVER came out at the start, pressed the pace early on, took over command entering the backstretch, was off the rail into the lane, asked once
collared near the eighth pole but gave in and was no match for the winner in the final stages. RUSHIE broke in at the start and raced back early on along the
outside of the field, made a three wide bid near the five sixteenths pole, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.
ENFORCEABLE was unhurried early on, raced along the seven path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. ATTACHMENT RATE was bumped
and bothered at the start, raced along the four path into the lane and improved position down the lane. MR. BIG NEWS chased the pace early on, was
shuffled a bit along the backstretch, raced along the four path into the lane, came again and improved position in the stretch. FINNICK THE FIERCE threw
his head at the start and broke a bit slow, raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane while making a rally, bid down the lane but was empty in
the final stages. TIESTO was never a threat and vanned off after the race. HARD LIGHTING was done early. BASIN was bumped at the start and through
after a half. SHIVAREE set the pace from the outset, was on the inside into lane and folded up in the stretch run. HUNT THE FRONT was never involved.
