Footnotes
BRAZEN set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path through the turn, dropped closer to the inside into the lane, was under a drive nearing the
eighth pole and widened to the wire. ROB THE RICH chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, appeared
a serious threat with an eighth to go then could not keep up while settling for second best. FASTLY floated into the gap after the start, was in a bit tight when
re-entering the backstretch, steadied slightly, continued in the two path through the turn and into the lane then was by far best of the rest. SIR JOHN
VINCENT was in a bit tight early when FASTLY moved back into the running lane, raced well back through the turn while along the inside then moved up
while well back. OCEANIC was never a factor while near the inside through the turn. LOUP was in the three path through the turn and was empty after
entering the lane. DEFIED tracked the pace while saving ground through the turn then was done in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FIRE MARSHALL BILL raced three wide and between rivals while dueling for the lead into the turn, continued in the three to the two path through the turn
while remaining on near even terms for the lead, stayed in the duel through the stretch and gamely dug in late to prevail. TIME HEIST dueled from the
outset while in the four path into the turn, continued in the three path through the turn and into the lane, was on near even terms inside the eighth pole and
was just denied. SIT TIGHT bobbled and was bumped soon after the start, hustled up along the rail to join three others near the eighth pole when dueling for
the lead, settled back to chase the top two through the turn and into the lane while saving ground and settled for best of the rest. YOU'RE IN COREY dueled
between rivals past the half-mile pole, was checked sharply near the seven-sixteenths pole when put in tight, chased the top three through the turn from the
two path and was not a threat through the lane. BOURBON BRYCE stumbled at the start and settled to the back, raced near the inside through the turn,
angled widest into the lane and moved up while not a threat. SUPER THOR raced wide and in the five or six path through the turn, continued in the six or
seven path into the lane, drifted into the five path and was bumped solidly near the eighth pole, continued on exchanging brushes for the next sixteenth and
was never a menace. THORNISH was in the two path through the turn, drifted into the five path and bumped rival near the eighth pole then continued on
while exchanging brushes with another to inside the sixteenth pole. GINSBURG was outrun while in the two path through the turn.

Footnotes
STRONG TIDE tracked the pacesetters while near the inside into the far turn, angled off the inside and bid three wide into the lane, cleared outside the
eighth pole then held while under right-handed urging to the wire. COMES N THREES was unhurried while off the inside, advanced through the three path
on the far turn, shifted into the five path outside the eighth pole and finished with good energy to just get up for the place spot. FEVER TEMPLE was
unhurried while near the inside through the turns, came into the lane from the three path when gaining momentum, moved closest to the winner near the
eighth pole and just lost the place spot at the wire while well clear of the others. VICTOR'S DEAL was in the three or four path through the far turn, bid into
the lane from the four path, loomed a serious threat near the eighth pole then weakened late. MILLION DOLLAR RED was well back while near the inside,
angled widest into the lane and moved up belatedly. MAJOR SPARKS raced in the three or four path through the far turn, came into the lane from mid-track
and lacked a closing response. PROUD N FAMOUS set the pace while under pressure through the turn then gave was after entering the lane.
MANEUVERED along the inside into the far turn, bid in late turn to get into contention entering the lane then tired. JUSTICE IN VEGAS pressed the pace
two wide through the far turn then was empty entering the lane. MICHAELS TARNATION chased the pacesetters from the three path into the far turn and
was done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
SPARKLING JUSTICE vied for the lead three wide through the turn, edged to the top spot after straightening in the lane, cleared inside the eighth pole and
slowly widened. WALLAWALLABINGBANG vied for the lead on the inside of two other rivals, gained a short lead into the lane, then could not keep up with
the winner while keeping on for the place spot. YESTERDAYS KISSES was along the inside through the turn, angled into the five path entering the lane
then moved up to gain the minor share. TALKINABOUTMYGIRL vied between rivals through the turn, continued in close contention into the lane then
weakened. ELITE ATTRACTION was in the three path through the turn and finished evenly while not a threat. WHO WANTS WHAT chased the three rival
duel through the turn while well positioned, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a closing bid. UNDERTHECHERRYMUNE was along the inside
through the turn and into the lane, continued along the rail through the lane and showed some interest late. LUCYDOESTHEHULA was never seriously
involved while in the two or three path through the turn. BACKHAND chased the pace from the two path through the turn and was done after entering the
lane.

STERLING MISS raced well back, rallied strongly and was clear late under a mild drive. JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP stalked in the four path, bid in early stretch,
led late but couldn't hold off the winner. INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ bid four wide at the quarter pole, then closed well. PRECOCIOUS PEACH gained fourth place
late outside. REENIE D vied in the two path before giving way late. LESLEY'S SONG stalked between foes, then gave way in the stretch. TWICE GOLDEN
raced evenly in the two path. QUEEN OF SHADES vied inside to the turn. TENPINS TEMPO was not a factor. THE QUARTER-MILE TIME IS OMITTED
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.
