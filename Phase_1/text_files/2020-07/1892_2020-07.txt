Footnotes
COUNTER OFFER dropped in leaving the initial straightaway, was taken under a tight hold especially with the left rein while in the two path on the first turn,
dropped closer to the rail late on that bend, was reserved near the rear, moved closer late on the backstretch, was roused while two then three wide on the
final turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a left-handed whip, was carried out while gaining momentum outside the eighth-pole, rallied outside in the
final furlong, drifted in a bit late and closed well to get up at the wire. VALUE ENGINEERING established a forward position early, rounded the first turn in
the three path, disputed the pace on the outside, was joined by GO POKE THE BEAR before the wire the first time round, raced between foes into the
second turn, went three wide on that bend, contested the pace on the outside, was asked to pick it up a bit in the two to three path on the final turn, shook
clear into upper stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths then was put to a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip around the furlong marker,
led desperately into the final sixteenth, drifted out late then was switched back to a right-handed whip, bothered BUNDIBUNAN in the process and was
denied on the wire while able to get the place. BUNDIBUNAN went two to three wide on the first turn, settled outside while dropping farther behind the
leaders the first time down the stretch, went two to three wide on the second turn, continued outside down the backstretch, moved closer with
seven-sixteenths to run, chased three to four wide on the far turn, drifted out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth then
steadied late and missed the place while clear for the show. LEGIT was taken back between horses into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path,
dropped further behind the leaders while settling down the stretch for the first time, moved closer while put to urging late on the backstretch, was put to the
whip late on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. CAN'THELPBELIEVING (IRE)
bobbled ever so slightly at the start, contested the pace on the inside, was asked on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. GO POKE THE
BEAR dropped back early, raced inside for most of the first turn then moved to the two path while keen under restraint, was hard held while tugging at the bit
early down the stretch for the first time, shifted out a bit then moved up a mile from home, bolted on the second turn, fell well behind on the final turn and
was eased while traveling along the outside fence but walked off. Following the race, the stewards' posted the inquiry sign and the rider of BUNDIBUNAN
claimed foul against VALUE ENGINEERING. After the stewards' review, VALUE ENGINEERING was disqualified from second and placed third for
interference in deep stretch. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
KABOB secured a forward position after the field had been released, sneaked its way into the pack coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, inched
up after the half had been rattled off, swung to the outside heading home, eventually challenging in earnest four wide, had the rider lose the whip in the
vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, shifted a bit to the outside when switched over to hand encouragement before settling in on a truer course, struck the
front end with approximately a sixteenth remaining and edged clear. IMPERIO D pressed the issue two to three wide, got asked for more spinning into the
lane, grabbed the advantage, was himself collared right around the sixteenth marker, saved second. BRUNATE took up the chase three wide on the turn,
got sent out six wide rallying down the stretch, missed the place. ALWAYS FUNNY dropped back after disputing the pace from between rivals during the
opening phases, was two wide entering the turn and about the same exiting it, lacked a solid closing punch. BIELEFELD guided over to the inside shortly
after the start, continued along it while tracking the front runners, cut the corner with sufficient room to launch a rally along the rail, wasn't up to the task at
hand. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT spotted at a slight distance from off the inside route, argued for command until the furlong grounds before giving way. APEX
PREDATOR worked out a tuck into the two path at the top of the turn, was never involved. LORENZEN sighted along the rail on the turn, was set down
angling to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, wound up six wide by midlane, made no headway. FRIDAYBEERS strung out three to four wide on the
turn, tired. BREED'S HILL taken hold after breaking to the outside, raced four wide on the turn, went on to wander out to path seven down the stretch to no
avail. JACK RUSSEL was never in it. SECOND FORTUNE without speed, stopped to a walk.

Footnotes
UNIVERSAL PAYDAY chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch,
came under an off sided stick and came in just inside the eighth pole brushing with THE ROCK SAYS when taking command, then edged away to the finish
to prevail. THE ROCK SAYS grew rank three wide between foes into the first turn when eased off and put to restraint by the rider, continued three wide
through the opening bend before advancing to be in closest aim of the leader into the backstretch tucked to the two path, tracked the front in striking range
down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive latched on to
the outside, got brushed just inside the eighth pole when UNIVERSAL PAYDAY came in under an off sided stick and paused very briefly, then ran on to
secure the place honors in the late stages. BLOOD MOON four wide into the first turn, tucked three wide once THE ROCK SAYS was taken back, then
tucked to the two path seizing command midway on that opening bend, showed the way tucked inside down the backstretch, came under light coaxing
nearing the far turn, got put to steadily increased pressure nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, dug in stubbornly to the eighth pole
fending off the aforementioned foe before being displaced inside that station, then weakened in the very late stages while preserving the show honors on
the line. FIRST RATE coaxed from the gate, raced three to four wide early on before tucking two to three wide through the far turn, angled five wide into
upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. SUPER WICKED CHARM chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered
just off the inside for home and tired. FRIED RICE KING bobbled outwards at the start, chased three wide from the tail of the field until tucked inside half a
mile from home, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and trailed throughout. There was a Trainer's objection by the
trainer of THE ROCK SAYS alleging interference against UNIVERSAL PAYDAY in the stretch run. After review, the objection was dismissed and and result
stood prior to be declared official.

LEAVEUWITHASMILE brushed the outside of the gate at the start then was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two
path on the turn, was guided with a little extra left-rein pressure coming to the quarter-pole then asked once straightened for the drive, responded well when
put to a right-handed whip in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a continued right-handed whip in the final furlong and held under hand
urging in the shadow of the wire. PICK UP THE FONE broke out and brushed with a rival then was corrected by the rider, was asked to establish a good
position just off the pace, dropped to the rail near the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, came out under a
left-handed whip into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, gained gradually to
the wire but missed while clear for the place. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled under some urging, came under stronger encouragement near the half-mile
pole, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide around the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished with good courage to
safely secure the show. PERSIAN QUEEN dropped back to the rear under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a
drive, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, shifted further out outside the sixteenth-pole and improved position. STUNNING MUNNINGS brushed with foes
on both sides at the start, was well placed just off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide outside the five-sixteenths then was roused,
chased outside into the stretch and tired. TOUCH OF NIRVANA brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved in leaving the
backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty. MS. MALEVOLENCE pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the
turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. LAKE CHICOT raced just off the pace on the outside, dropped back while four then five wide on the turn
and failed to respond.

TOO EARLY away without apparent mishap, was three wide heading for the clubhouse bend, went about it pulling hard on the bit, fighting the pilot, tucked
one path closer to the rail at the top; of the backstretch, continued to apply pressure on OPEN LENGTHS from the outside, saw the second place finisher
burst upon the scene as three-quarters was being completed, came under a ride after falling back position-wise when SANDRO THE GREAT assumed the
top, swung three wide into the lane, closed the gap, igniting a three-way tussle for the top deep into the furlong grounds, out-fought the twosome to its left
during the next sixteenth to take over, kicked clear. SANDRO THE GREAT two wide around the first turn, tipped out wider shortly after entering the
backstretch, left it stationed in the three path, responded when given some rein, unleashing a bold move at the three-eighths pole, wrested away the
advantage, settled in at the head of the stretch and got switched over to stronger handling, was forced to defend a slim lead by the beginning of final furlong,
positioned between rivals, relinquished for good a sixteenth down the road, ventured on with enough energy left to secure second. OPEN LENGTHS gained
command prior to arriving at the end of the homestretch, led the way from along the inside route, tailed by the winner to his right, was over-powered by the
runner up as the third fraction was being finalized, got asked for more and battled back, argued as the innermost of a trio for a sixteenth starting from the
eighth pole, held the show. SCUTTLEBUZZ away the tardiest after leaping into the left side of the gate, got guided over to the rail, abandoned it and drafted
behind the second place finisher for a spell on the backstretch, moved inward in time to begin the run around the far turn from path two, got cued up for the
drive, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, failed to make any headway. VOLIERO pocketed until the end of the
second bend, got worked into the four path over the course of the first half of the stretch run, lacked the needed response.

VIADERA (GB) was taken in hand early, went two to three wide on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field, was asked while three wide on the far turn,
rallied outside under a right-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker, closed well to get the lead in the final
sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. NOOR SAHARA (IRE) was taken under a strong hold early then rated on the inside, drafted along the
rail on the far turn, came out while asked into the stretch, made an outside bid under a right-handed whip into the final furlong then took the lead shortly
thereafter, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to get the place. PASSING OUT became restless in the gate but broke with
the field, was taken under a very strong hold early, became rank off heels under vigorous restraint on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, saved ground
while still under tight restraint on the far turn, was roused into the stretch, chased into the final furlong, had a hole close between horses outside the
sixteenth-pole then steadied while blocked, found room again late and finished with good courage to just get the show. CLARA PEETERS (GB) was taken
back between horses early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved while last but one, came under urging around the seven-sixteenths, was
urged along in the two path on the far turn, idled behind horses in upper stretch, moved out while climbing some in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and
finished willingly to just miss the show but was up for the last spot in the superfecta. CATCH A BID came away in good order, raced inside of XENOBIA
while attending the early pace, was taken back under a strong hold late on the first turn then moved to the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in
the two path on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, took the lead in upper stretch, came under a right-handed whip while still in front
approaching the furlong marker, was headed outside the sixteenth-pole and outfinished then lost the last spot in the superfecta while crowded against the
rail late. XENOBIA (IRE) was antsy in the gate and charged the front of the stall prior to the start, broke out a bit then was asked, went to the front, rounded
the first turn in the two path while in hand then dropped to the rail very late on that bend, showed the way on an uncontested and easy lead, vied inside on
the far turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and gave way.
HOGANS HOLIDAY went three wide on the first turn, dropped in entering the backstretch, settled at the rear, saved ground on the far turn, came four wide
into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 9 Feet)

Footnotes
LADY LAWYER sat reserved in midpack in the two path, got tipped wider in preparation for the drive late on the bend, was called upon for more spinning
onto the head of the stretch, at this stage three wide, narrowed in, hitched up becoming engaged in a late duel with the second place finisher, bested that
foe to prove best. OLENDON (FR) got rated along accompanying LOST TICKET, gong about her business in the three path, was looming dangerously
when switched over to stronger handling in the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, wrested away the advantage, failed to shake free and was instead
pounced upon by the winner in deep stretch, fought onward with determination but wound up denied. TURF WAR got guided over to the rail nearing the
conclusion of the backstretch, stayed put keeping watch on the front runners, was maneuvered into path two entering the stretch, clawed her way towards
the ones to catch, doing some drafting, availed of a clear path in the final stages by accelerating herself into the show slot. LOST TICKET pursued the pace
two wide on the turn, was moved out four wide spinning into the lane, mustered up a mild response sufficient enough for the final significant slice of the pot.
LADY WORTHINGTON emerged for a tight pack at the break with the advantage, went over to the inside, eventually settling towards path two, cut the pace,
prompted by OLENDON to the outside, inched inward in time to cut the corner, but under siege by the previously-mentioned foe, yielded then weakened.
GUACAMOLE had a ground-saving journey and faltered.

INDIAN PRIDE broke in a step at the start brushing BELLA CIAO, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled,
had JOY EPIFORA advance inside midway on the turn and was headed for the front near the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole
now between foes, swung three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away taking brief command before being headed at the three-sixteenths by
BLAMED, had that rival drift inwards and was in tight along the rail a furlong out, knocked heads with her showing good courage unfazed by the tight
quarters, the rider flashing her an off sided stick and gamely took back command a sixteenth from home before beginning to shake away at the end to
prevail. BLAMED three wide in aim of the leader, advanced on the top pair from the outside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four then
three wide straightened away into upper stretch, seized narrow command three-sixteenths from home, came in putting her main rival in tight along the rail a
furlong out, dueled defiantly through to the sixteenth marker clinging to the lead, got headed at that station and ultimately bested while along clear of the rest
for the place honors. RISKY MANDATE three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled three to four wide into upper
stretch, ran on to procure the show honors. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) crossed to the inside shortly after the start and chased along the rail lightly coaxed along,
advanced three furlongs from home to take command nearing the five-sixteenths now put to urging, swung along the inside into upper stretch under threat
from a pair, yielded the front straightened away, had that pair of rivals drift in front just past the three-sixteenths and tipped out a furlong from home, then
weakened to the finish. HONOR WAY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch
and improved position in the drive. POSITIVE SPIRIT chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under encouragement at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. BELLA CIAO brushed at the start by INDIAN PRIDE who broke inwards a step, chased just

Footnotes
COLD HARD CASH bumped solidly with a rival at the start then bobbled and was last away, moved up on the outside to prompt the pace, vied in the three
path on the turn, took a short lead under a strong hand ride in upper stretch then came under a right-handed whip, lugged in and brushed with the runner-up
into the final furlong then was pulled off that foe by the rider, switched to a left-handed whip at that point and edged clear in the final sixteenth under strong
urging. QUICK RETURN bumped with a rival at the start, angled in while going to the front, set the pace under some pressure to his outside, vied in the two
path while inside of the winner on the turn, was asked late on that bend, lost the advantage while put to a left-handed whip in upper stretch, was brushed by
the winner and steadied very briefly just inside the furlong marker and was outfinished while clear for the place. DIANNESIMPAZIBLE settled off the pace,
was urged three then four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. GOLCONDA
was urged along at the rear on the outside, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the rail at the three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. OPERATIVE settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came under the whip inside the five-sixteenths, chased
into upper stretch and tired. TRUE GRACE moved in while showing speed then was taken in hand, stalked the pace down the backstretch, chased inside on
the turn and capitulated. YOUSAIDHELLO dropped back while in tight against the rail near the five-eighths, was roused in the two path on the turn, shifted
four wide into the stretch and came up empty. FROZEN ACCOUNT broke out at the start, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground early on the turn,
shifted four wide before the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
