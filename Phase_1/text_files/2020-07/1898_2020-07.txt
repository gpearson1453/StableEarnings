Footnotes
EAGLE EYE rushed between horses in the opening staged to bid for the lead two wide after a quarter mile, dueled for the lead outside of GOD WINK into
and around the turn, assumed command passing the quarter pole, drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch, then was geared down through the final
furlong. TALENTED TAPPER was bumped hard at the start by her outer rival, came under a drive to keep pace while far off of it at the half mile pole, saved
ground around the turn, then produced a mild rail rally through the lane to achieve place without threatening the winner. CRIMSON LUCK raced far off of the
pace two wide, advanced inside of SUMMER WAR while outside of TALENTED TAPPER turning for home, but was outkicked by the latter in upper stretch,
shifted three wide in midstretch, and kept on to pass a tiring foe for a minor reward. GOD WINK broke outwards but clear from outer rivals, set the pace in
the early stages, dueled for the lead inside of EAGLE EYE passing the half mile pole and into the turn, but proved no match for that foe turning for home,
shifted off of the rail in upper stretch, then weakened between horses in the final furlong. SUMMER WAR broke in and bumped TALENTED TAPPER at the
start, prompted the pace three wide, but weakened into the turn, and faded around it. BRODY'S GIRL was always outrun.

Footnotes
ORLEANS settled off of the pace two wide, shifted to the four path around the far turn and began to gain on the tiring leading duelers, produced a strong
four wide bid turning for home while under extremely confident handling, strolled past the inner leader passing the furlong pole, and won going away while
never being asked for full effort. EBONY BAY dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, put away her inner foe around the far turn and cut the
corner turning for home while edging an advantage, but took an awkward stride approaching the furlong pole, was bested by an outer rival at that marker,
then kept on to held place. PRINCESS MARYKATE sent from the start to duel for the lead inside of foes early on, but failed to keep pace with a pair of outer
foes into the far turn, held stride and shifted three wide turning for home as ORLEANS made a wider bid, found traffic passing the quarter pole between
horses, then sustained her rerally through the lane to secure show. THE MORE I BURN saved ground while far off of the pace through both turns, shifted to
the four path in midstretch, but failed to factor. MINNIEMOREPROMISES vied for the lead four wide early on, dueled for the lead three to two wide around
the far turn after inner foes gave way, but weakened in upper stretch. LYNNE T prompted the pace three wide between horses, but failed to keep pace with
those foes at the nine sixteenths pole, faded into the far turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LADY EDITH set the pace in the early stages, dueled inside of a pair of foes around the turn, shook free from those foes in upper stretch, then was kept to
task to hold her margin through the late stages. SATURDAY NIGHT broke outwardly, stalked the leading duelers from the two to three path around the turn,
shifted four wide turning for home, produced a place bid outside of a pair of rivals in upper stretch, lugged in at the furlong pole while edging place from
AUNT JOIE, was corrected, but veered in sharply at the sixteenth pole, interfered with that foe, and edged place. AUNT JOIE prompted the pace three wide,
dueled for the lead two wide and between horses around the turn, proved on match for the eventual winner in upper stretch, dug in for place, but was
interfered by SATURDAY NIGHT at the sixteenth pole. LEONA VANDER (GB) was bumped on both sides at the start, prompted the pace, inched forward
into the turn and dueled three wide around the bend, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, then weakened between horses at the furlong
pole. LADY PREACH saved ground far off of the pace before coming into the lane in the four path, and rallied mildly. WHATSERFACE shifted off of the
inside to the four path turning for home while midpack, but failed to make an impact. ZEBRA CAKE broke a bit in, raced in midpack two wide, but failed to
factor. KITTEN WITH A WHIP shied from an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and failed to make an
impact. MORE IS MORE was off slowly, trailed the field to the stretch and passed tired foes. SHE'S A SHOO IN raced off of the pace in the three path, was
floated to the five path turning for home, and failed to produce a rally. TWIRLING WILDCAT stalked along the inside early on, but steadily faded into and
around the turn. SARIAH SARIAH prompted the pace two wide early on, stalked from the inside into the turn, but weakened turning or home and stopped
through the lane. Following a Steward's Inquiry, SATURDAY NIGHT was disqualified and placed third for interference with AUNT JOIE in deep stretch

Footnotes
BLACK KETTLE prompted the pace three wide early on, took back to stalk the leading duelers after a quarter mile, inched forward to make a three wide bid
for the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, forged a narrow advantage from inner foes in upper stretch, and held that margin safely through the lane under
driving pressure. FRENCH ROSE vied two wide between horses, dueled for the lead outside of SHACKLEFORD COUNTY into and around the turn, but
was headed by BLACK KETTLE to her outside turning for home, dug in between horses through the lane, but did not have enough to regain even terms.
SHACKLEFORD COUNTY set a pressured pace through the early stages, dueled for the lead inside of FRENCH ROSE into and around the turn, but was
headed by a wider rival turning for home, dug in briefly in upper stretch, but gave way passing the furlong pole. FRILLS raced off of the pace two wide down
the backstretch, but came under a drive and shifted to the four path into the turn, chased the leading trio around the bend, but failed to factor and weakened
through the lane. LIL MISS HOT MESS saved ground while off of the pace, but weakened, and was outrun.

Footnotes
OLSON dueled two wide, forged a slight lead passing the five sixteenths pole, and held his margin gamely through the lane. WILLISTON WAY dueled for
the lead inside of OLSON, was headed by that foe passing the five sixteenths pole, fought on courageously through the lane, but failed to regain even
terms, and just held place at the wire. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY saved ground while far off of the pace around the turn, shifted to the four to five path turning
for home, but found traffic in upper stretch, shifted inwards approaching the furlong pole for clear racing room, rallied through the final furlong, split horses
late under moderate driving pressure, but missed. SHIPPINGPORT raced off of the pace two wide, was blocked turning or home while shifting to the three
to four path, angled in in upper stretch, produced a rally through the lane, but did not have enough to catch the leaders and got outfinished for minor
rewards. HOMEBRED trailed early on, swung to the seven path turning for home, produced a rally while hanging on his lead, and was gaining on the
leaders at the wire. CHASIN CHARLIE raced far off of the pace in the five path around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival turning for home, then
kept on through the lane. BYBEE tracked from midpack in the four path, was floated to the six path turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer foe in
midstretch, and weakened. SKY RIDE was forwardly placed two wide, but drifted to the four path in upper stretch, and weakened. WESTWOOD PROUD
prompted the pace three wide early on, stalked the leading duelers around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch, and faded. SATCHEL DE RITCHES was
forwardly placed along the inside early on, but retreated under restraint through the turn, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
LIZZIE B set the pace along the inside, drew away from the field turning for home, widened her margin in upper stretch, and was kept to task through the
final furlong. CAROLINE LOIS shied outwards from an inner rival at the start, stalked the pace three wide, inched forward around the far turn and edged
place turning for home while proving no match for the leader, then held that position through the lane. INTROSPECTION trailed in the four path, was floated
to the six path in upper stretch, then stayed on past tired rivals for a minor reward. FASHION FRAME broke outwardly, prompted the pace two wide, but
failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, and weakened through the lane. PRINCESS PHONE stalked along the inside, saved ground around
the turns, but was outmoved around the far turn to trail the field turning for home, but failed to factor along the inside thereafter. LIL' SHOPPER raced off of
the pace two wide, shifted three wide at the quarter pole, then angled to the five path in upper stretch to be outside of the leaders, but failed to make an
impact, and weakened.

Footnotes
COWBOY DIPLOMACY broke outwards, prompted the leading duelers from the three path, vied three wide around the turn, drew clear of inner foes
approaching the furlong pole, and widened his advantage under mild hand urging. ALL EYES WEST broke outwards, dueled for the lead inside of
MOUNTAIN AIR and COWBOY DIPLOMACY through the turn, but was headed by the latter while getting the better of the prior in upper stretch, then kept
on to secure place. MOUNTAIN AIR dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but proved no match for his outer foe in upper stretch while failing to
match strides with his inner foe. LAKE NIMROD stalked along the inside, shifted to the two to three path in upper stretch, and finished up evenly without
producing a bid. RAG TAG saved ground while far off of the pace, but to no avail. WAR DETONATOR trailed along the inside into the turn, came into the
lane in the three path, and passed tired foes without factoring. THE FEATURE was off a bit slow and bumped by an inner foe at the start, but recovered to
be forwardly placed two wide and between horses, shifted to the four path turning for home, but failed to make a bid, and weakened. JESS MO was
reluctant to load, then broke outwards from an inner foe, tracked from off of the pace in the four path, but weakened after being floated to the five path
turning for home.

Footnotes
HOLLIS set the pace along the inside, shook away from the field in upper stretch while shifting off of the rail, and held under driving pressure. JAZZY TIMES
lunged outwards at the start, but was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted off of the rail around the turn, but waited for racing room while in the three
path turning for home, quickened between horses while exchanging bumps with his outer foe approaching the furlong pole, then quickened and rallied
through the final furlong to secure place. MANIACAL took back to midpack down the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, and produced a mild rail
rally through the lane. RULER OF THE NILE stalked four to three wide around the turn before being floated back to the four path in upper stretch by JAZZY
TIMES, exchanged bumps with that foe in upper stretch, then was outfinished by that rival while sustaining his grinding rally. NOMO RON prompted the
pace setter two wide, but failed to keep pace with that foe approaching the furlong pole, then got outfinished for minor rewards. STAR OF KODIAK was
bumped by an inner foe at the start and was off a bit slowly, raced off of the pace in the four path between horses around the turn, shifted to the five path
turning for home, and failed to factor. VIVID VERSE raced off of the pace in the five to seven path around the turn, and failed to make an impact. LYKAN
raced close up to the pace two wide and between horses early on, but steadied slightly out of tight quarters at the seven sixteenths pole, trailed the field
around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, but failed to factor.

Footnotes
DICHOTOMY was forwardly placed two wide, made a three wide bid for the lead while in hand at the five sixteenths pole, dueled with her inner game rival in
upper stretch, and prevailed inside the final sixteenth. SHAPE OF YOU set the pace, dug in turning for home as DICHOTOMY made a bid, dueled gamely
inside of that rival through the lane, but was bested in the final sixteenth. ALL FACT raced off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and produced a
grinding rally for show. MISS PINKERTON tracked from midpack three wide, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, forged show approaching the furlong
pole, but was outfinished for that position in the late stages. SPOOFY DOO saved ground while far off of the pace, and produced a mild rail rally without
threatening. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) raced far off of the pace two wide, and was no factor. LADY MAUKETTE stalked along the inside, but failed to keep pace
with the leader after shifting to the three path turning for home, and subsequently weakened. JILLS PASSION prompted the pace two wide, but weakened
between horses turning for home, and stopped through the lane.
