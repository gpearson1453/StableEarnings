Footnotes
THEBOYZGALAXY stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded entering the drive, brushed with STAR GAZE entering the drive, and steadily drew clear. After a Jockey's Objection and review by the Stewards'
there was no change. STAR GAZE dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, was brushed by the winner entering the drive and
was no match late. NANA'S JOY forced the early pace outside, inched closer entering the second turn but was no match for the top two. BORN TO D' WILD
dueled from the inside and tired in the drive. CHRISTEANA'S KISS bobbled at the start and was no factor. SEE WHAT'S WHAT dueled from between foes
and faded.

gained the margin and steadily drew clear while kept to task. WRECK EM forced the early pace from the outside, made a bid entering the second turn but
was no match for the winner while gaining the place. RAY'S KING allowed to settle, advanced outside through the second turn, responded when sat down
for the drive and closed with a rush for the show. COME ON GET HIGHER outrun early, advanced outside through the second turn and had a late rally.
KING ZIPPY chased the early pace from the inside but had nothing for the drive. CHAMBLISS was no factor. IN CHARGE HALO up close early from the
outside came up empty in the drive. MISS YOU JO was never a factor. TENSAS TODDY had a steady fade. LUVMEWHENIMGONE dueled from the inside

ALL BIZNESS stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded entering the drive, was brushed by BROOK IS
GOLDEN upper stretch and steadily drew clear. PUNKY MONKEY chased the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, responded
and rallied late for the place. BROOK IS GOLDEN up close early from the outside, dueled through the turn, drifted out slightly entering the drive, brushed
with the winner and held the show. CRAFTY IKE outrun early, advanced inside through the second turn, altered outside and rallied but too late. A BIG A
BAD BILL forced the early pace inside but had nothing left. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN was no real factor. INDICATIF broke sharp from the outside, gained a
clear early margin, dueled through the turn then gave way in the drive. Six furlong split time unavailable due to a timer malfunction

Footnotes
AMERICAN DREAM broke awkward, chased the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the
second turn, responded entering the drive, drifted in through the drive and was along in time. After a Jockey's Objection and Stewards' Inquiry there was no
change. PHILOSOPHICALLY dueled from the inside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, held a forward position for the drive, responded but was
outfinished. LOUISIANA SPECIAL dueled from the outside early, remained engaged up the backstretch, battled through the drive, was steadied at the
eighth pole when in tight and held the show. ELLA'S MY GIRL forced the pace from the outside but could not keep pace in the drive. DIAMOND AND SILKS
was no real factor. COZZENE ZING was never a threat.
