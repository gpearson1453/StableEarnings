Footnotes
FLAMIN FIRE stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn,
responded to gain the margin and was well clear late while kept to task. OUR BLUE JAY pressed the early pace from the outside, inched closer entering the
second turn, responded when asked but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. MAJESTIC SOCIETY forced the early pace from the inside,
dropped back up the backstretch, altered outside, responded and rallied late for the show. NORTHERN BIG IRON could only improve position. TAPIT'S
TEMPLE forced the early pace and tired. UNBRIDLED SHOES was no factor. SUPER INTENSE stumbled at the start and was no threat. FIREMAN SID
broke sharp from the inside, set the early pace then faded in the drive.

BISTRAYA stalked the early pace from the inside, steadily advanced through the turn, angled outside for the drive, responded and was just up the final
stride. KATS SECOND SILVER dueled from the inside early, chased the pace through the turn, responded along the rail for the drive but just missed.
SCOTTY BOY dueled from between foes early, gained a clear margin through the turn, was engaged for the drive but could not keep pace while just lasting
for the show. RIV forced the early pace from the outside, dueled through the drive but weakened late. DREAM HALO was never a factor. DANCE
KINGDOM bobbled at the start and was no threat.
