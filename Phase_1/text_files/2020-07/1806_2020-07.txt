inside in the closing strides. JULIANO a step slow through the turn angled four wide in upper stretch surging late getting up for place on the wire.
BUNGALOW FLASH was jammed causing the rider to lose his irons at the break, put in a strong bid on the far turn extending three deep down the lane
hanging in the closing yards. SIDE TRACKED came out causing issues at the break, made the early lead being overtaken on the backside, would regroup
along the rail to vie in upper stretch dueling late being put in tight in the last yards. MR. NOBODY was jammed and forced to steady back at the break,
hurried to recover on the backside would chase through the far turn then flatten out in upper stretch. VOLCANO BAY squeezed at the break had brief
position then retreated on the backside. JUST DOING came in jamming rivals at the break. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START RESULTED IN NO
CHANGES.

WARRIOR'S DELIGHT away alertly set the pace coming under pressure on the turn, shook clear in the three path upper stretch holding up under a drive.
LISTEN TO THE LION chased the pace pressing all out on the turn, ceded a clear lead to rival in upper stretch bearing down four wide lane closing the gap
while saving place. BEDTIME FOR BONZO chased the pace bidding hard on the turn, extending down the stretch angled from the two path to the rail late
staying on gamely. MOONBOUNCE a step slow through the the turn raced five wide down the lane having some late gain. STERLING REBEL slow early
raced inside to upper stretch losing path along the rail steadying near the wire. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF STERLING REBEL
AGAINST BOTH WARRIOR'S DELIGHT AND BEDTIME FOR BONZO THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH.

through the turn circling out to upper stretch coming on late six wide to save place. FLASH ME NOT sent hard pressured on the inside through the turn,
ceded to rival in upper stretch angling out late to the four path missing place. CHARLIES HOT raced evenly angling to mid track in upper stretch finding no
late surge. CHARLIES WATCHIN pressed the pace moving between horses on the turn fading to upper stretch. PATTY'S MISCHIEF in a bit close early was
