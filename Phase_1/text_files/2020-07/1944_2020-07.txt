Footnotes
OUR BALDY B was quickly clear, raced off the rail in the two path into the turn while remaining clear, came into the lane with a widening advantage, was
shown the stick near the eighth pole and was ridden out to deep stretch and put in hand late. BENNETT raced along the inside through the turn, shifted into
the three path for the drive and was just up for the place spot. HEZA GLITTER chased the pace from the three path through the turn, continued off the
inside into the lane and kept on to save the show spot. GUN HILL was in the two path through the turn and into the lane and moved up and just missed the
show spot. KITKAT KITTEN tracked the winner from the two path through the turn and into the lane and faded late. C J'S I'M BYU was well back through the
turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and moved up while never a serious factor. DR. APPROVAL was in the three path through the turn and
into the lane and tired. DAKOTA JUSTICE was along the inside through the turn and was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
MYEERAH pressed the pacesetter two wide through the turn, bid in late turn, gained the lead before entering the lane, stepped in toward the rail when
straightening into the lane, stepped back out a path under left-handed urging and widened to the wire. HALAMA chased the pace from the four to the three
path through mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane, was no match for the winner and ended up clear for the place spot. RIA MUNK raced in the three or four
path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and was clear for the show spot while not a threat to the top two. DISCERNMENT was in the
two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and moved up. NUTCRACKER BALLET in the four or five path through the turn and
lacked a closing bid. QUEEN OF VERONA was along the inside through the turn and was done in late turn. SPITEFULNESS set the pace while near the rail
through mid-turn when under pressure then gave way.

Footnotes
INDY TOURIST set the pace from the outset, slowly widened through the turn, continued to lengthen the advantage straightening in the lane and was ridden
out inside the eighth pole. NIAGARA CHARLIE pressed then chased the winner from the outset, was no match for that one while keeping on to be well clear
for the place spot. ENRAGED raced in the three path into the far turn, was asked for more after mid-turn, swung into the lane under a drive and could not
gain on the top two while well clear for the show spot. SAINT VRAIN was near the rail through the turns and never was a factor. COUGER was a contender
for half then began losing ground after mid-turn and tired through the lane. KISSIN ALEX was in the three path to the rail through the far turn and was empty
outside the eighth pole. STRIKEITORTAPIT was outrun while in the three path. RUN RABBIT stalked the pace while in the three path into the far turn and
was done after the three-eighths pole. INNIS was near the rail and a contender into the backstretch and was suddenly done entering the far turn then was
eventually eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ set the pace while in the two path through the turn, continued on a clear lead into the lane and slowly widened to the wire. MORE
pressed the early pace then chased the pace from the three path through the turn, continued to chase the winner into the lane then was all out late to regain
the place spot. HAYNESFEST came in early when getting position, raced four wide near the quarter pole, came into the lane from the five path, dueled for
the place spot through the final eighth and lost the place spot. STERLING MISS was steadied early when another came into her path, raced in the two path
into the turn, angled into the four path approaching the quarter pole and finished evenly from the six path. LUNA FORTIS raced in the four or five path
through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and weakened late. KAY BEE GEE was close early while near the inside then faded along the rail.
AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #3 STERLING MISS AGAINST THE RIDER OF #4 HAYNESFEST FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FIVE-EIGHTS
POLE RESULTED IN A DISQUALIFICATION OF #4 HAYNESFEST FROM THIRD TO FOURTH.

Footnotes
ESKENDEREYAS DREAM was unhurried early while off the inside, bid three wide near the quarter pole, came into the lane from the four or five path,
brushed with the runner-up a couple times, drifted in when clear and widened to the wire. PEPPERED stalked the pacesetter from the three path, bid in late
turn, gained the lead into the lane, was brushed by the winner and leaned on, floated in a path or two and could not keep up. ZANESVILLE was unhurried
while along the inside through the turn, moved up into the lane, waited when top two floated in and saved the show spot. GOOD GOOD was unhurried while
off the inside, was in the two or three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path, moved up and ended up missing the show spot.
SAXON LORD was near the inside into the far turn, was steadied when running up on a tiring rival near the quarter pole, moved into the four path and was
not a menace. KEARNY COUNTY was never a factor while along the inside through the turns. DREAMMEISTER was never a factor while in the two path
through the far turn. C JS BILLY BYU set the pace while in the three path then gave way entering the lane and was eased to the wire and walked off. A
