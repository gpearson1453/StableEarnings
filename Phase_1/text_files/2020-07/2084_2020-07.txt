Footnotes
HIDDEN FIGURE soon shared the lead between rivals while in hand, moved clear when let out on the bend, was put to a drive upper stretch and proved
clearly best. DIAMOND STELLAR progressed from inside on the turn, rallied to take over second upper stretch then could only pull away from the rest the
final furlong. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE bobbled at the break, was hustled up to contention between rivals, did not stay close three wide on the turn, swung
widest for the stretch run and caught TAP'S LULLABY for third. TAP'S LULLABY vied for the lead from outside on the backstretch, did not stay with HIDDEN
FIGURE on the turn and flattened out for the drive. RUNNING SCARED displayed early speed inside horses but began to wear down before finishing a half
mile. CASHNCARI was prominent toward the outside on the backstretch, improved position three wide on the turn, fanned outside RUNNING SCARED for
the stretch run and gave way. MISS SWAMP TALES showed little in a ground-saving trip. WHITE CASHEL broke slowly and was always outrun.

Footnotes
FOX FREY kept close between horses, went for the lead two wide on the bend, moved clear upper stretch and maintained full control under a steady drive.
MAGNITUDE TEN prominent between horses, advanced three wide on the turn, took over second with a furlong to go and proved easily second best.
SIMPLY FAST advanced from inside on the bend, angled outside MAGNITUDE TEN upper stretch, lacked a serious rally but caught COMMANDING
MIDAS for third. COMMANDING MIDAS emerged with the lead just off the rail, was challenged from outside on the bend and weakened through the lane.
CAROLINA BEAST was forced in and steadied at the break, progressed just off the inside on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, advanced to
midstretch then leveled off. PRINCESS MANDII in contention early from outside, began to yield with three furlongs to go. SKIPTOTHEWIRE chased staying
off the inside and was never a factor. B REWARDING somewhat reluctant to load, broke inward when the race began, was a factor on the backstretch but
gave way from inside on the bend. LADY DI pressed COMMANDING MIDAS from outside on the backstretch but bolted on the turn and was held in check
until under control in the stretch.

PRANCIPANTS showed first and set a pressured pace, moved clear on the turn, was challenged from outside upper stretch, dug in under steady handling
and held on. DEAUVILLE MIST pressed just outside PRANCIPANTS from the beginning, came to the latter upper stretch, fought gamely, lacked the extra
needed but was easily second best. AIR ELLIE in contention early from inside, angled out leaving the turn, took over third inside the last furlong then could
only pull away from the rest. MIKAYLA ATTACK prominent early, advanced along the rail on the bend but flattened out from inside the final eighth. MACBU
angled out between horses midway on the backstretch, was three to five wide taking the turn and had no late bid. SHRIMP forwardly placed outside on the
backstretch, faded widest on the turn. BLANCO BRUSH moved to the outside early on, stayed well off the inside taking the bend and gradually drifted out
through the lane.

G G'S SECONDCHANCE prominent from inside, was steadied before altering out at the half mile marker, was three wide on the bend, floated out some for
the stretch run, gained a narrow advantage inside the final furlong and kept MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET at bay under urging. MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET
progressed from inside on the bend, angled out some for a clear path upper stretch, battled inside G G'S SECONDCHANCE inside the last furlong but had
to settle for second best. SUMMER DISCO chased from between horses, advanced from inside on the turn, swung out behind G G'S SECONDCHANCE for
the stretch run and moved clear for third late. STUMP vied for the early lead from outside, did not stay with VIRGA on the bend, came three wide into the
lane and began to wear down. TRUE TEN was an early factor, did not stay close on the turn but improved position from along the rail through the stretch.
VIRGA contested the pace between horses on the backstretch, moved clear on the turn and took the rail, flattened out inside the last eighth and drifted out
through the waning yards. AMAROQ trailed, picked up his pace three wide on the turn, angled in beside TRUE TEN upper stretch, progressed to the last
eighth then leveled off. DR. LIECHTY in contention from outside on the backstretch, faded three wide on the turn. GUARD YOUR GRILL was a factor from
between horses on the backstretch but gave way on the bend.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S SICILIAN forwardly placed just off the inside, swung to the outside to advance on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, was all out between
horses and edged ahead in the waning yards. REJOICE AN BE GLAD without early speed, advanced from inside on the bend, angled out five wide upper
stretch, closed well, came up short but caught GHOST TRAIN for second. GHOST TRAIN shared the early lead from outside, was two wide on the turn,
took over upper stretch, was clear inside the last furlong, under steady urging the rest of the way, was outfinished but clearly best of the others. TOUR ON
chased from between rials, was three wide on the bend, fanned outside REJOICE AN BE GLAD for the stretch run and improved position late without
threatening. BELLAH DOWN prominent between horses, was three wide taking the turn and wore down for the drive. ROCKET QUEEN displayed early
speed from inside but flattened out the final furlong. BROWN SHOES well placed inside, gave way between rivals on the turn. MAY BE SUSPECT fractious
in the gate, showed little in a wide trip.
