Footnotes
CLEVER LAD up close early from the outside, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn, gained a clear margin at the eighth
pole and held sway. RAY'S KING stalked the early pace from the outside, steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the
second turn, responded when sat down for the drive but could not reach the winner. IN CHARGE HALO broke sharp from the inside, gained a clear early
margin, dueled up the backstretch, remained engaged through the second turn but could not keep pace. WRECK EM pressed the early pace inside but had
nothing for the drive. MISS YOU JO unhurried early from the inside, advanced entering the second turn, clipped heels with BOLD ZARB at the five eighths
pole, recovered and finished evenly. BOLD ZARB forced the early pace outside but had no late response. COME ON GET HIGHER showed little in a dull
effort.

Footnotes
IRISH HOKIE broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained a clear early margin, remained clear up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the
second turn, widen the margin at the eighth pole and was well clear in a gate to wire effort. CANDIZAR chased the early pace from the outside, inched
closer entering the second turn, responded to pressure but was no match for the winner while clearly second best. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) unhurried early,
steadily advanced up the backstretch, reached a striking position entering the second turn, angled outside for the drive and rallied late for the show. D TWO
forced the early pace inside but had nothing left. LIL BIG MAN chased the early pace inside and tired. GOBLER went evenly. BIG BOBBY BROWN was no
factor. JAILHOUSE KITTEN was no threat. DAGGERS ARCH chased the early pace and faded.
