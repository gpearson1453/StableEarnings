Footnotes
MY DARK SECRET bumped a horse at the start, dueled three wide, was between horses in a four way battle on the turn, steadied nearing the stretch, then
grinded away amongst foes to pull out the win late. TRICKIZAR layed off the top group while off the rail, advanced on the turn, dove further inside in the
stretch, found room and gained but was beat at the wire. ARCHIE'S GIRL was last, made a five wide rally on the turn, came widest into the stretch and
steadily advanced for show. SACRED STORM broke sharply, showed to the front, stayed to the stretch, fought valiantly with nearly the whole field coming
down the lane but weakened late. LUCKY AT JUSTICE bumped a horse at the start, made a four wide duel wth several foes on the turn, led leaving the
turn, fought but faltered late. MOONLIGHT TRAIN was forwardly placed, dueled between horses on the turn and flattened out mid stretch.

Footnotes
SOUR PEACH led on the first turn, was confronted by a challenger on the far turn, gave up the lead there, then re-took the front at the sixteenth pole for the
win. GIRLS GOT TRACK prompted the leader from the outside, took the lead on the far turn, was under heavy urging down the stretch, but could not
withstand a re-rally by the leader and had to settle for place as second best. ABOGADA raced inside and gained position down the lane. TICKET TO
RICHES was well placed off the pace but lost position in deep stretch. KARA'S ANGEL broke in and bumped a foe, and was no threat. SECRET TOWN
was bumped at the start, raced unhurried, was put under the whip on the far turn and came up empty. LATINA CANTINA was off slow and no menace.

raced a clear second to the stretch, found more to stave off challengers, but was beat out of place at the wire. PRIMED FOR TALENT broke out and
bumped a horse at the start, advanced five wide on the turn, gained third but lost it in deep stretch. WHOLE LOTTA RUN was bumped by a foe at the start,
steadied shortly after the start, raced towards the back and improved postition in the stretch. GREAT HARBOUR CAY led well clear from the first turn to the
top of the stretch and faded. ZANFORCE was unhurried and tired at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
PARKING TICKET stayed back, made a strong middle move on the turn, evened out in upper stretch, then re-grouped and flew home late. HEY NEGRITA
was well off the lead, moved up outside on the turn, then came home while between horses for place. SHE'S NO DRAMA tracked from third, quickened on
the turn, and had good energy to close late for the show. TIZ RED WINE was the clear speed to deep stretch but slowed nearing the wire. TIA FLOR was
very wide coming into the stretch and ran evenly. TIZ TAKEN BACK was off slow and improved some late. STORM TEMPLE PILOT chased the lead as a
clear second, drifted out in the stretch and faltered. FORT MARSH blew the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
MY MAIKO close up from outside first turn, rallied into the far turn, gained command and cleared off as much the best under stout handling. FIONA POWER
no speed to far turn, rallied between horses out of the far turn while no match late. ABBY'S DESTINY raced evenly throughout with a mild bid on the far turn
but flattened out in the late stages. STRONG WORK unhurried to far turn, ran on to move up in the stretch while no real no menace. PERSONAL SERVER
failed to reach contention with no gain in the stretch. DON'T TELL ME bothered at the start, rushed up to the quarter pole wide and came up empty in the
stretch run. TEMISINA speed to the front inside to quarter pole, backed up from there. IMNOTSMALL through after half and retreated thereafter. TOO
SHORT through early, dropped far back.

MOONLINE settied behind a three horse duel, moved alongside readily on the turn and cleared in the stretch for the win. TIO MOSCO broke in and bumped
a foe at the start, went to the lead at the rail, was joined by two others in a three way duel, lost position entering the stretch but picked up second after
passing a tiring foe late. VANDROSS was bumped by a horse into another horse at the start, tracked the dueling leaders from inside, ran even in the stretch
and inherited the show after passing a tired foe late. VINEYARD dueled outside three wide, stayed on to battle the winner from inside on the stretch, but
faltered late. NUMBERS NEVER LIE came very wide on the backstretch, dropped back to last and gained position late. DRAFT BEER was bumped at the
start as part of a chain reaction, was in contention to the turn, urged for more, and faded in the stretch. J DUB vied between horses and dropped back mid
turn.

Footnotes
FORBETTERORWORSE sharp speed to the lead, confidently handled from the quarter pole and held on to the wire in a good effort. UNCLE EARL chased
winner to deep stretch with a late surge at the wire but too late. ROYAL LEIGE had a rough start, lagged far back to the turn angled out for clear run and
was coming on. GET SOME MO good position from inside stayed on rail with a good finish to no avail. BEST YOU EVER SEEN bobbled at the start, rushed
inside to turn and flattened out late. MY MAE DAY outrun to the turn and only, moved up in the stretch run from inside. COMMAND CODE never a menace.
BOURBON MOMENT raced wide run throughout and faded quickly. ABSOLUTE CONTROL stumbled at the start, rushed to turn but was used up and, gave
way in the final sixteenth and subsequently vanned off while in distress. TRAMORE BAY never a threat from the start.
