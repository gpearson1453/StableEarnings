Footnotes
FULMINI pressed the early pace outside LIME, bid past the quarter-pole, took over through upper stretch and drove clear. THE PREDICAMENT was outrun
early, and finished well on the far outside. OMAHA CITY had aim outside the leaders at the top of the lane, rallied into second in deep stretch but was
outfinished for that spot under mild urging. CASTLE KING turned in an even effort from the two-path, and lacked a solid final bid. CROWLEY'S WAR was
outrun early, and passed tired horses never a factor. LIME set the early pace inside, and weakened through the drive. CON PERMISO saved ground well
back early, steadied inside FOSTER HOPE on the turn, and remained outrun. FOSTER HOPE moved inside early on the turn, and tired. MR TINGLES was
a step slow at the start and trailed early, came four wide off the turn, and made no headway. NINJA was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT TRAVELER was in a bit tight pressing the pace inside WARM SUNNY BREEZE, got through on the rail near the quarter-pole, kicked clear into
the stretch and drew off under pressure. H P BIG HOPE pressed the pace three wide, could not go with the winner turning for home, and ran on second
best outside. WARM SUNNY BREEZE set the early pace in the two-path, got overhauled from both sides turning for home, and saved the show. GEGE
CONQUEST was outsprinted early, and finished evenly on the rail for a share. VENETIAN DREAM gave chase two wide early, and faded after three
furlongs. CHUCKY faded four wide after three furlongs. HANGAR ONE was a step slow at the start, moved out four wide and dropped far back off the turn.
ARRENDAJO broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DIZZY SIGHT moved out three wide on the turn chasing after MORE THAN USUAL, rallied determinedly to reach the lead from outside with 70 yards
remaining, and edged JANUARY WON to the finish. JANUARY WON was far back early, hugged the rail advancing after six furlongs, stayed inside for the
drive and finished willingly to get up for the place. MORE THAN USUAL set the early pace well off the rail, moved in to the two-path well clear on the turn
and into the stretch, began to labor past the eighth-pole, and was overhauled from both sides late. FLAWLESS MOON bumped with SLIPPY at the start and
was slow early, circled five wide past the quarter-pole, lugged in through the lane and rallied mildly for the last major share. HAY HAY MY MY was no factor
two wide. SLIPPY bumped with FLAWLESS MOON at the start, chased outside the pacesetter for a half-mile, and tired. STILL SCHEMIN raced three to
four wide, and was through after six furlongs.

CITRUS BURST bumped lightly with RODEO RED at the start, was eased back off the early leaders, moved out three wide at the top of the stretch, kicked
in to reach the front past the eighth-pole and drove off. ROCKET BLAST dueled for command inside EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE, lost the advantage to that
one approaching the stretch, then battled back to get second. EXTREMELYEXCLUSIVE vied outside ROCKET BLAST, gained the upper hand turning for
home, then weakened through the late stages. RODEO RED bumped lightly with CITRUS BURST at the start, and was outrun inside. UKNOWTHEDRILL

Footnotes
CASH CALL KITTEN went up to join the leaders from outside midway up the backstretch, reached the front near the quarter-pole, drove clear through upper
stretch, and held BASHA at bay late. BASHA brushed with YEAR OF THE KITTEN at the start, advanced two to three wide after six furlongs, tipped out a bit
further for the drive and finished well. YEAR OF THE KITTEN brushed with BASHA at the start, tugged along under a firm hold through the opening
half-mile, was roused to go after the leaders four wide approaching the stretch, and flattened out through the furlong grounds. LUCKY FAST failed to
menace two wide. BILLY BIG (IRE) was no factor three wide. GREAT KAHUNA vied for command outside COULD BE early, got joined from outside by
CASH CALL KITTEN after a half, and faded soon after completing six furlongs. COULD BE argued the pace inside for six furlongs, and gave way. MR.
PAPILLON saved ground early, moved out three wide on the far turn and lacked a response.

Footnotes
ASSERTIKO emerged with the lead exiting the chute, rated along slightly off the inside for six furlongs, repelled a bid from FLASH PASS through upper
stretch and drew off much the best. FLASH PASS rallied along the rail to loom a threat inside ASSERTIKO after six furlongs, shortened stride after
straightening away for the drive, and stayed clear of the others. R U LUCKY raced four wide around the turn, and ran on evenly outside for the show.
FRENCH QUARTER broke out and had to be pulled off KRAMMY BOY, chased outside ASSERTIKO for six furlongs, and tired. KRAMMY BOY was
crowded at the start by FRENCH QUARTER, raced four wide and lacked a rally. BAHAMIAN PRINCE was forwardly placed three wide to the far turn, and
tired approaching the stretch. FOURTH DESIGN dropped back under a ride around the turn.

Footnotes
DAKOTA'S DUDE grabbed the lead out of the gate, loped along inside through an easy half-mile, picked up the tempo as necessary to fend off challengers,
and stayed clear under clever rating. SON OF OAHU tucked in behind the pacesetter for six furlongs, tipped out for a bid into the stretch, finished gamely
but did not have enough. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN was four wide entering the first turn, moved in a bit but stayed out in the course well back, found his best
stride after six furlongs, rallied through the furlong grounds and was up for the show while lugging in. GRAND NENUCO was three wide and roused midway
on the far turn, gained some ground to upper stretch and flattened out. TIPSY KITTEN prompted the pace outside DAKOTA'S DUDE for six furlongs, and
faded in the stretch. MURRY SPUR raced three wide early, moved in after that and failed to become a factor. STOCK saved ground, and dropped far back
after six furlongs.

Footnotes
KEEPSAKEKITTEN was outrun early, advanced three wide under a ride on the far turn, rallied to the front outside UNCLE ANDREW near the sixteenth-pole
and edged away. VERDICT IS IN was in tight brushing and bumping between SHANGHAI MOON and UNCLE ANDREW entering the first turn, stayed in
the second flight for six furlongs, responded through the drive and was up inside UNCLE ANDREW at the wire for second. UNCLE ANDREW brushed with
VERDICT IS IN while widest in the four-path entering the first turn, tracked outside BLAZING DESIRE through a sharp half-mile, took over at the top of the
stretch and pulled clear, but weakened through the final stages between the top two. SHANGHAI MOON brushed and jostled around with VERDICT IS IN
entering the first turn, stayed in range primarily three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed bid. MR. CESCO was no factor inside. SCAR was never
prominent. INCONVEYANCE steadied behind BLAZING DESIRE as that one crossed in front of him approaching the first turn, stayed inside and tired after
six furlongs. BLAZING DESIRE crossed over inside keyed up with the early lead, yielded to UNCLE ANDREW turning for home and had nothing left.

ALIZEE was never far back, slipped through on the fence inside SAMMIE SUNSHINE turning for home, drove clear through mid stretch, then held on while
drifting out. SKY CHASER raced three then four wide under a drive past the five-sixteenths, rallied determinedly and was inching closer outside the winner.
FREE TO FLY prompted the pace outside SAMMIE SUNSHINE, challenged on the turn and poked a head in front at the quarter-pole, stayed on to the

weakened.

Footnotes
SALOW was a step slow at the start, saved ground taking closer order early on the far turn, shifted out three wide at the top of the stretch, kicked in to
overhaul the leaders from outside past the eighth-pole and drew clear. JOE BENJAMIN prompted the early pace, wrested command outside
REINOANIMAUX after six furlongs, moved inside battling with MR MATUSCHEK turning for home, and dug in on the rail for second. MR MATUSCHEK
stayed close early between horses, lodged a bid three wide a quarter-mile out, fought outside JOE BENJAMIN through upper stretch and was outfinished.
SPIN FACTOR was reserved early inside, swung four wide off the far turn, and flattened out in mid stretch. NOTHINBUTABLUR broke behind the field,
trailed for six furlongs, and passed tired horses in the lane. UNBRIDLED TIZZY was four wide entering the first turn, moved in a bit through the middle
stages in the second flight, put in a mild run through upper stretch but could not sustain the rally. SAFE AND SOUND broke out, raced two to three wide in
range to the far turn, and tired. REINOANIMAUX set the pace to the far turn, could not hold off JOE BENJAMIN after six furlongs, and dropped back inside.
FAKE MUSE was three wide early, moved out further to the far turn, and dropped back in the four-path at the head of the stretch.
