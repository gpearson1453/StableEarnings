STACCATO settled while three wide, advanced into the far turn and won a prolonged duel. ALEUTIAN HARBOUR set at contested pace, was challenged
on the far turn and stayed on stubbornly along the inside. SHELL FIRE off slowly, was outpaced inside, lost his position on the far turn, showed late interest
and was gaining at the finish. BEST TRICK YET forced the pace and weakened.
