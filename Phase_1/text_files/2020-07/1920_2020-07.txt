Footnotes
TAPIGAL prompted the pace setter two wide early on, took over passing the half mile pole and drew clear into the turn, held her margin over TRACI's
GREELEY around the turn before widening her advantage under confident handling in upper stretch, then came under mild urging approaching the wire as
that foe chased on, but held safely. TRACI'S GREELEY was off a bit slowly, stalked the pace from the three path, took over place as a foe weakened into
the far turn, but came under coaxing to keep pace with the leader at the quarter pole, failed to do so through upper stretch, then chased the leader through
the lane while making slight progress in the final sixteenth. HER GIANT saved ground off of the pace, then passed a tired foe in upper stretch, but was no
factor. CAFE MISCHIEF set the pace along the inside of TAPIGAL down the backstretch, but was proved no match for that foe into the turn, and faded
around it. MAGNA G FORCE trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
SEVIER quickly established a clear advantage in the early stages, held his margin into the turn, remained under confident handling as rivals inched closer in
the latter part of the bend, came under mild coaxing in upper stretch as FUTILE tried to move alongside, repelled that foe's bid at the furlong marker, and
was ridden out the wire. FUTILE settled off of the pace three wide early on, swiftly gained ground in the latter part of the turn to produce a bid for the lead in
upper stretch, but was turned away at the furlong pole by the confidently handled leader, and stayed on to prove second best. CHARGE THE LINE stalked
the clear leader from the two path, but was outmoved by FUTILE to his outside turning for home, then stayed on to prove third best. STAY HOME trailed the
field through the turn before coming into the lane in the four path, but failed to factor. DARK ARDEN was urged along under heavy pressure in the early
stages to rush to be forwardly placed along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through the final furlong.

Footnotes
WILLFRED was off a step slowly, raced off of the pace while inside of rivals, was slightly shuffled into the turn behind HARDING PARK, shifted the three
path and gained ground around the turn outside of foes, shifted four wide turning for home, sustained his rally in upper stretch to produce a four wide bid the
lead passing the quarter pole, and drove past inner rivals to inched clear in the final sixteenth. CONQUISTADOR SHOW stalked the pace three wide, bid for
the lead turning for home between horses while shifting down to the two path, dueled between horses through midstretch, forged a lead passing the furlong
pole, dug in gamely as WILLFRED ranged along side, but was oufinished in the final stages. BECKENBAUER was a bit crowded at the start, raced off of the
pace two wide, advanced in the three to four path around the turn before making a four to three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but was outkicked
between horses at the furlong pole. WINGING WAYS set the pace along the inside around the turn, dug in inside of a pair of foes turning for home, but
weakened inside a trio of rivals at the sixteenth pole. FIRST CITIZEN broke outwards, was forwardly placed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the
leaders turning for home. HARDING PARK was forwardly placed along the inside early on, but weakened into the turn and faded around it. BOOYAKASHA
bobbled a bit at the start, then lagged behind the field, and failed to factor.

MEDICINE TAIL set the pace along the inside, kicked clear from outer bidding foes approaching the quarter pole, widened his advantage in upper stretch,
and was kept to task to the wire. PICO D'ORO raced close to the pace along the inside, attempted to split foes two wide approaching the five sixteenths
pole, but failed to squeeze through a narrow opening, steadied, the cut the corner inside of foes turning for home as the leader kicked away, forged place in
upper stretch, and proved second best. WAYAKIN broke inwards, prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace between horses at the five
sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane to reclaim show. UPSTART GENTLEMAN bumped an inner foe while bobbling at the start, saved ground
while off of the pace, then passed a tired foe without factoring. OPTIMUS KAT saved ground while trailing around the turn, then passed tired foes without
threatening. TREE GENIUSES took a bump to his hind quarters at the start, raced far off of the pace, came into the lane in the three to four path, and failed
to make an impact. MONEY MILES was bumped then pinched between horses at the start, recovered to stalk the pace in the three path, made a four wide
bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the inner leader turning for home, and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
EBBEN tracked the pace three wide, responded to coaxing into the far turn to produce a three wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with his inner
foe in upper stretch as that rival dug in, but drew clear from him under driving pressure passing the furlong pole, and won going away. STREET TO INDY
bobbled at the start recovered to set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of SUENO down the backstretch, repelled that foe and dug in as EBBEN made
a bid for the lead turning for home, but was headed by that rival in upper stretch, then was bested passing the furlong pole, but held place. ARRIVAL trailed
in the four path around the first turn, chased the leading trio of leaders around the far turn while still in the four path, lugged in while producing a bid for show
in upper stretch, but also while not matching strides with the leaders, then edged that position late. SUENO prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep
pace with his inner foe and the wider bidding EBBEN turning for home, then was outfinished in the late stages for show. FRANKNJYMME stumbled at the
start, saved ground while off of the pace, but weakened into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
ORO DE TEJANO raced off of the pace along the inside early on, advanced to striking range two wide into the turn, chased the leading group while right
behind turning for home, found stride in upper stretch, angled inwards approaching the furlong pole then surged along the rail at that marker, and drew off
through the late stages. GROVE DADDY was off a bit slowly, trailed the field in the five path around the turn, swung to the seven path turning for home, and
offered a rally while hanging on his left lead through the lane to reach place inside the final sixteenth. MAJORS VINDICATION stalked the leading trio from
the five path, made a four wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenth pole, inched a slight advantage outside of foes turning for home, but drifted in at the
furlong pole, proved no match for an inner surging foe while being corrected, and got outfinished by an outer oncharging rival for place. DONTNEEDANAME
dueled for the lead two wide and between horses while in the three path, continued to vie among rivals turning for home, but was no match for an inner foe
passing the furlong pole, and got outfinished for minor rewards. GOLDEN NOTION dueled for the lead inside of rivals while staying a path off of the rail, dug
in inside a trio of foes turning for home, but left the rail open for the eventual winner at the furlong pole, and weakened through the final sixteenth. MY
GOLDEN DIABLO vied for the lead three wide while in the four path, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. LEA RIDGE chased the pace from
along the inside, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and was done early.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL LAKE pressed the pace two wide, inched forward into the far turn, dueled for the lead around that bend and through upper stretch, inched a slight
advantage passing the furlong marker, then just held at the wire under driving pressure. SCREENWRITER shied from an inner foe at the start, saved
ground around both turns while far off of the pace, advanced to be behind the leaders in midstretch, shifted to the four path approaching the sixteenth pole,
split horses at that marker and surged stoutly in the final stages, but just missed at the wire. ENVIED saved ground while stalking in midpack around both
turns, shifted to the three path in upper stretch for clear racing room right behind the dueling leaders, but lacked the needed kick to make a bid, then got
outfinished for minor rewards. DEVIOUS CHARM tracked from midpack two to three wide around the turns, shifted from the four to the eight path through
upper stretch to be widest of all at the furlong pole, then produced a mild late kick to achieve a minor reward. UNUNDERSTANDABLE set the pace along
the inside, dueled for the lead inside of CRYSTAL LAKE around the far turn, dug in in upper stretch, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, and
yielded in the final sixteenth. MISSION FROM ELLE raced far off of the pace two to three wide, came into the lane in the five path, but was floated to the
seven path by inner foes through midstretch, and lacked a kick to get involved. WELL SPENT raced off of the pace four to three wide around the first turn
before advancing to striking range in the two path down the backstretch, shifted three to four wide in upper stretch, but weakened between horses in the five
path in the late stages. SECRETLY WICKED was forwardly placed three to four wide turning for home, but lacked a bid, and weakened in the six path in the
late stages. STYLISH KITTEN trailed throughout and was never involved.

Footnotes
MADAME OVERSERVED dueled for the lead two wide, forged a narrow advantage between horses turning for home, dug in gamely as SPEIGHTY SHIRL
sustained her bid through the lane, and held that foe at bay before inching away in the final stages. SPEIGHTY SHIRL stalked the leading duelers four to
three wide, inched forward around the far turn when ORENCIA made a wider move, produced a three wide bid between horses at the quarter pole,
sustained her bid through midstretch as her inner foe dug in, but was repelled in the late stages, and held place. MAJESTIC BLEND was forwardly placed
two wide early on, shifted inwards and advanced to track from the pocket at the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick to split the leaders in upper stretch,
tipped to the four path passing the furlong pole, and produced a late kick, but failed to achieve place. SISTER'S GHOST had a slow start, raced far off of the
pace, advanced in the five path in the latter part of the turn, but leveled off in upper stretch, and caught a tiring foe for a minor reward. ORENCIA advanced
four wide around the turn to produce a four wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but flattened out turning for home. BELLUCCI dueled for the lead inside
of MADAME OVERSERVED, then inside a trio of foes turning for home, but gave way in upper stretch. LUCKY FIND saved ground from midpack, but to no
avail. SARAH JOE vied for the lead three wide early on, but was restrained back passing the half mile pole, steadily faded without encouragement from the
rider around the turn, and was eased through the lane. HEALTHFUL broke outwards, but lagged behind the field down the backstretch, bore out around the
turn, then was eased through the lane, but walked off.

Footnotes
TYNAN set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold a clear advantage in upper stretch, drifted out through the final furlong while still clear of her bidding
foe, but held her margin late. TEENAGE KICKS stalked two wide around the first turn, tucked down the backstretch and stalked from the pocket around the
far turn, waited for racing room turning for home and into upper stretch, shifted two wide approaching the furlong pole and produced a bid, but was herded
outwards by the clear leader through the final furlong, and failed to make headway. EDGEE ANGEL advanced four wide around the far turn, and willingly
sustained a grinding rally through the lane to achieve show. STOP SHOPPIN TAMMY tracked from midpack two to four wide into the backstretch, produced
a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, then got outfinished for show. HASHTAG WINNER
raced far off of the pace, took the far turn three wide between horses, but failed to factor. SNEAK PEEK stalked three wide early on, vied two wide around
the far turn, but failed to keep pace between horses turning for home, and weakened through the final furlong. LADY JENNEVIERE saved ground from
midpack around the first turn, but was done early.
