Footnotes
PORT LIONS was bumped at the start, opened a clear lead before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased her margin into the
stretch and was ridden out to be kept to task. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was bumped at the break, chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match
for that rival in the drive but held for the place. BABY ROCKS settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid.
MISS CALCULATION raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. MAYBEE A DIVA lacked early foot,
raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. JOHNNIE GUITAR broke inward, showed brief speed and weakened. The race was hand timed.

LA WAUN dueled for the early advantage with BUCKLEY BAY while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and held sway to the
wire. MISSED THE BOAT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SHIFTY DANCER raced off the
pacesetters early and finished with late interest. PAMPER ME NOW lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished
well. MALIBU BAY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished willingly. BUCKLEY BAY was fractious at the gate then away
alertly, dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. IRON ROB settled off the leaders and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
SWIFT AS I AM was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew off
through the lane as a handy winner. GORDON ANTHONY broke in, chased the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that arrival in the drive but
was up for the place. WHISKEY NOT WINE chased the winner while racing five-wide and failed to gain in the drive. NAVAL ESCORT lacked early foot,
raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. SLEW'S LEGACY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace of the winner while racing
three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. TAKE YOUR SWINGS was off a step slow, rushed to contend, saved ground through the turn and
weakened. SHADY DRIFTER broke in to bump rival, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not offer a bid. TIMBER JOEY three his
head at the start and lagged far back throughout.

Footnotes
THIS GREAT NATION dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch and held sway to the wire. VALID
PRINCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. DRIZZY chased
the leaders while racing four-wide and failed to gain late. MITCH AND JOHN E was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a
striking position but lacked the needed late response. LOLLY EXPRESS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run
and was not a factor. SMOOTHEE LEE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. DOC RADKE disputed the pace from the inside,
gave way after going a half, steadied in mid-stretch and continued to retreat.

HARBORS RULE was away in good order to stalk the pace of CANDIED LUTE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run
and edged away. CANDIED LUTE broke a step slow and inward, rushed to the lead, maintained a safe advantage through mid-stretch but could not match
strides with the winner late.. STAND TO lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late.
BALIUS showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN was forwardly placed, raced six-wide
through the turn and gradually gave way. STAREDOWN chased the leaders from the inside and weakened after going a half.

PISTOL POWER lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with SEATTLE SMOKE and
proved best over that rival in the stiff drive. SEATTLE SMOKE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid
nearing the quarter, vied with the winner through a vigorous drive but could not get by that foe. CATS TOUCH settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail
through the turn and finished with a steady bid. BERNIE chased the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the quarter, found room in mid-stretch and
finished willingly. DOUBLE A. PROSPECT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some
late run. CREST DRIVE sprinted clear soon after the start and gave way after going a half. SHOCKAZULU lacked early speed, saved ground through the
turn and did not menace. WORKING was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and was
not a factor. ROMAN BOOS showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. GALLANT HEAT showed brief speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. FAIR ADVANTAGE chased the leaders while racing three-wide for three furlongs and weakened.
