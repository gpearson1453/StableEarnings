Footnotes
CAROL'S A CASE showed first, was rated on the front end from outside, stayed in path three on the bend, moved clear when allowed leaving the turn, was
under a drive the last furlong and lengthened command. TAPNFIRE was settled at the back after the start and moved well off the inside, lost ground widest
through the turn, rallied deep stretch and caught RUBY LEES SONG for second nearing the wire. RUBY LEES SONG a bit rank, broke awkwardly, was
soon under control, advanced between horses to dispute the pace inside her rivals, kept the rail through the turn, was no match for CAROL'S A CASE in the
stretch and began to wear down the final eighth. HAL'S MISCHIEF raced in contention just off or along the rail from the beginning, swung out leaving the
bend and raced evenly four wide through the stretch. LUCKY STIFF was hustled up to contest the pace between rivals on the backstretch but began to fade
before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ROSKI soon had the lead, stayed just off the inside, floated out some into the stretch and widened command under mostly hand urging. GONZO in
contention from outside, lost ground five wide on the turn, angled in some for the stretch run, took over second then could only just hold his position.
BARNYARD FIDDLER bumped with CLASS WON at the break, was settled at the back, picked up his pace five wide on the turn, rallied belatedly in the
stretch but was clearly best of the others. JAGUAR RIDGE well placed inside, weakened for the drive. K STREET forwardly placed between rivals on the
backstretch, began to wear down two wide on the turn. DR. LIECHTY was prominent from outside for a half mile, came three wide into the stretch and
flattened out. CLASS WON bumped at the start, was a brief factor from inside but gave way after three furlongs. WILDCAT LITE pressed the pace just
outside ROSKI on the backstretch, did not keep up three wide on the bend and gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
UNCLE PAPPY vied for the lead inside from the beginning, was just off the rail on the bend, drifted out into the stretch, moved ahead, continued to gradually
drift out but just lasted for the win. GREAT GRET disputed the pace outside UNCLE PAPPY from the start, was carried out leaving the turn, dropped back
some upper stretch but rallied back as he was gradually carried out the last furlong and got up to finish on even terms with UNCLE PAPPY. MUSIAL
prominently placed, saved ground on the bend, was steadied behind DATA BREACH at the top of the lane, altered out, closed well but was too late. DATA
BREACH boxed in early, was just off the inside on the turn, moved to the rail at the top of the stretch and finished evenly. RUDY'S BOY pressed just outside
the top pair but lacked the extra needed for the stretch run. TOCCETIVE JAC in contention early, saved ground taking the turn and had no late rally. RED
DIRT ROAD chased from outside, stayed off the rail taking the turn and weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
DAVKA broke well, was rated on the front end while just off the rail, let out some on the second turn, roused entering the stretch then steadily opened up
under a drive. JOLLY GHAALY pressed DAVKA from just outside, was no match for that one in the lane and could only just hold his position. LEFT COAST
DREAMS advanced to contention from inside on the backstretch, angled out on the second bend, lodged a mild bid four wide deep stretch and was closing
the gap on JOLLY GHAALY late. WORKINGFORALIVING prominent just behind the leader, swung out three wide leaving the second bend and gradually
wore down for the drive. AMERICAN SUCCESS saved ground and failed to menace. MR. LUV MAKER was a factor from outside to the second turn then
began to tire. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE MILE FRACTION IS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ARCH FLYER stalked the early speed from outside, commenced her bid two wide on the turn, led into the lane then gradually opened up under a drive.
SIMPLY FAST without early speed, advanced three wide on the bend, took over second upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader but proved
easily second best. SWIFTY CAUSE well back early, picked up her pace three wide on the turn, fanned five wide for the stretch run and caught JAM UP for
third nearing the wire. JAM UP set a pressured pace from inside, was challenged leaving the turn and tired for the drive. ELIZ'S HOPE chased from inside,
was jostled nearing the bend, angled out on the turn and advanced widest in the stretch without threatening. WARY CARRIE caught in tight quarters nearing
the turn, jostled briefly with ELIZ'S HOPE, did not keep up just off the inside on the turn and had no late bid. PHOENIX ATTACK progressed two wide on the
turn and upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. INNER DELIGHT was away slowly, bore in and failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.
AFFIRMANCE pressed the early leader from just outside but gave way with three furlongs to go. VERRAZANO WOMAN was fractious in the gate, taken
out, walked for the vet and reloaded then showed little staying off the inside throughout once the race began.

Footnotes
SHOWIT boxed in early, was caught in close quarters between rivals nearing the turn, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out further for a clear path
into the stretch, was all out and swept past DARLIN ROSIE with less than seventy yards to go. DARLIN ROSIE in contention early from outside,
commenced her bid three wide on the turn, engaged KALISPELL inside the last eighth, took a very brief lead inside the sixteenth marker but could not hold
SHOWIT back. KALISPELL pressed outside KIPPER DOODLE, took the lead and moved clear on the turn, was challenged from outside inside the final
furlong and slowly wore down. KIPPER DOODLE broke alertly, showed the way from inside, was overtaken on the turn and gradually weakened for the
drive. VALIANT LADY stumbled at the break, was settled inside, angled out to advance on the turn, swung five wide into the lane and improved position
without threatening. PARA VIVIR well placed on the backstretch, began to tire along the rail on the bend. AMERICAN HOLIDAY prominent early, was
caught in crowding nearing the bend and faded soon after.

AT GUARD kept close toward the outside, swung to the middle of the track for the drive, took the advantage nearing the last eighth and held sway under
steady handling. YABA DABA DOO bumped with AFFIRMATIF SONG at the break, was boxed in through the early going, got through four wide at the top of
the lane, vied for the lead while all out but had to settle for second best. G G'S SECONDCHANCE in contention between horses, was three wide on the
bend, fanned six wide for a clear path entering the stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going but was clearly best of the rest. AFFIRMATIF SONG
bumped with YABA DABA DOO at the start, was well placed from inside but flattened out the final furlong. RICHIESONARAMPAGE contested the pace
between rivals then flattened out for the stretch run. GO VO forwardly placed outside, gained the lead three wide on the bend, drifted out to path five
entering the lane and wore down between horses. GO BEEJA was hustled along to vie for the early lead, began to yield from inside before finishing a half
mile, came off the rail some into the lane and gave way.
