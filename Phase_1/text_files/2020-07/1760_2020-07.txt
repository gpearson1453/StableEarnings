Footnotes
TEMPLE OF ROSES chased the early leader inside, lost some position in the turn, moved out for the drive, displayed some moderate late interest outside
to finish up best of the rest. LOVELY TETON broke on top, quickly sprinted clear, continued to show the way through the turn along the inside, gave way
when headed by the runner up turning for home. AMARDINE in the second flight early off the rail, ranged up to challenge turning for home, showed the way
through upper straight, could not contain the winner, remained clear for the place. JAMMINFORMEL broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.
FLEETA BELLE lacked speed outside, dropped in to save some ground through the turn, shifted out for the drive, set down and finished up willingly.

Footnotes
BUXTERHOOTER dropped inside past the wire the first time, saved ground in the second flight through the first turn, continued inside, patiently handled
second turn, rail bid midsstretch, long drive, narrowly best in a determined effort. OUTOFTHISGALAXY broke with the leaders inside, got clear to show the
way through the first turn off the inside, continued to set the pace, headed turning for home, responded and fought back to regain the advantage while
between foes and allowing the winner the rail inside the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. CAJUN PINATA closest to the leader off the inside,
continued to stalk that rival in the run up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge and put a head in front turning for home, gained the advantage, narrowly
showed the way past the furlong marker, faltered the final furlong, saved the show. RUN TAPPY void of speed, continued back into the far turn, came five
wide into the stretch, improved a bit with some mild late interest while remaining well out in the strip. WOMAN WITH A BOOK settled off the pace, continued
in even fashion through the lane in lacking a closing repsonse. PINCH ASSAULT last away, continued to lack speed early, advanced on the outside into the
far turn, five wide through that bend, lacked a closing punch in the drive. HIDEAWAY HERO four wide when with the second group first turn, continued
outside, four wide again in the second bend, tired. BROADWAY ICE three wide with the second group early, was finished before a half.

Footnotes
DREAMY ART forwardly placed early outside, closer four wide through the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, drove well clear. DOUBLE DOWN
BRITT off a step slow, moved up afterward to mid pack, three wide and in some traffic in the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for
the palce. MAGGIE TRUE lacked early foot outside, asked along to improve through the turn, four wide into the stretch, dropped inside for the drive,
continued with a mild advance to annex the show. BLUSHING BELLA broke back, lacked speed, four wide into the stretch, displayed a mild amount of late
interest to improve position. CONSPICUOUS WOMAN settled off the pace, lacked a serious rally, came up empty for the drive, pulled up short and was
vanned off. PRINCESS GIANNA forwardly placed off the inside, continued to race within striking distance while three wide through the turn, had little left for
the stretch run. BEADSINTHETREES broke through the gate and ran off about a quarter prior to the start, reloaded in good order, broke with the leaders,
vied up front for a half then gave way in the drive. KATIE'S BAYOU flashed early foot off the inside, began to back up before three furlongs. OUR STORY
fell back after the start, four wide through the turn, remained back to be outrun through the stretch.

Footnotes
MIGHTY PEGASUS outrun early while four wide through the first turn, continued outside and advanced into contention while four wide again through the
second bend, put a head in front entering the stretch, drove steadily clear. RUN BY broke back, advanced steadily inside the winner far turn, came four wide
and behind that foe into the stretch, finished willingly to be in time for the place, not a threat to that same rival for the win. COMMERCIAL FLASH lacked
early foot while saving ground, continued inside while racing back into the second turn, steered out for the drive, late run to be up for the show in the final
strides, getting to the runner up. CRIDER CHASE forwardly placed in the three path early, fell back into the stretch while between horses, came again a bit
to miss for the place. BEAR TOOTH PASS broke back, devoid of early foot, saved some ground second turn, made a late run up the rail to improve position
and finished willingly. ENVOY'S GUILT settled off the pace and the inside, fell back in the far turn, three wide into the lane, passed tiring rivals. FAYOLA off
a step slow, was slow to settle while rank through the first turn, raced four wide through the second turn and also picked off some faltering foes late. J.'S
GIRL dueled up front closest to the inside, gave way drive. LASSIE'S LAST HOUR dueled up front off the inside, continued to contest the issue in upper
stretch, gave way suddenly inside the furlong marker, vanned off. RUNPEGGYRUN staged a steady retreat before a half, well beaten.

furlong marker, enough left late to late. BERKO lacked early foot, improved while four wide through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker in
seeing that progress stall then made a late surge to close the gap on the winner late, all out to narrowly prevail for the place. PHILLY forwardly placed in the
two and between horses early, fell back off the winner in the turn, three wide into the lane, also closed the gap on the winner late while being outkicked for
the second spot. ONEHOLYLION in the second flight for a half, three out to four wide exiting the turn, some late gain outside while not enough to challenge
the top three. DOMINANTE lacked early foot, moved out to race three out to four wide exiting the turn, widest for the drive, held position late midtrack.
SOUTHERNAIRE fell back to trail after the start, raced outside, five wide through the turn, improved position in the drive while not a serious threat. BIG
CANE vied up front early along the inside, second flight through the turn, gave way in the drive. VALYRIAN last to leave, never menaced. BOOTH ROAD
SHINE in mid pack early while racing outside, steadily faded.

Footnotes
LOOKING FOR BULL broke back, lacked speed,continued to late three wide in the second turn, shifted out a bit when straightly for home, set down,
finished up strongly to be quickly clear the final sixteenth. MUCH CLASS settled off the pace and the inside, in the second flight turning for home, behind
traffic into the lane, steered out and finished willingly to earn the place, no match for the winner. STAR BANJO last away, raced well back, three path out of
the final turn, moved out to be widest for the drive, up for the show with a belated rally down the center of the course. FIRE LAKE behind the pace, saved
ground into the lane, lodged a brief bid along the rail a furlong out, failed to sustain that advance in the run to the wire. SOUTHPINE GIFT broke alertly, was
forwardly placed while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. KRAFTY BOY in the second flight for a half outside, advanced and challenged with a
four wide bid far turn, came five wide into the stretch to lose considerable ground, finished up evenly in picking off a couple of tiring rivals. LOVE
CONQUERS broke in good order, narrowly showed the way into and through the first turn, gained a larger advantage before a half, continued to vie into the
lane, caved in the final furlong. KING SNIPER pressed the issue off the inside, challenged second turn, faltered. FLASHY IMAGE trailed throughout and
was never involved.

Footnotes
ACT OF DONATION broke alertly, cleared to the inside, showed the way into and through the turn, long drive, held the runner up at bay under firm handling
in a determined effort. DR. GELP pressed the winner in the two path from the outside, could not get to that one in the drive, clear for the place. MORO
PHAROAH broke with the leaders, fell back to race in the second flight off the inside, moved out a bit late, no match for the top two late, clear for the show.
ELISHER within striking distance early, moved closer to prompt the top tow in the three path through the turn, weakened a bit in the drive, outkicked for the
show psot. MR. E EDWARDS broke through the gate prior to the start, reluctant to reload, off bit slow, moved up to mid pack, four wide into the lane, went
evenly to the wire. IDE B A WINNER fell back, lacked speed, improved position in the drive without posing a serious threat. RONNIE'S REASONING
remained back while saving ground, in some traffic turn, failed to menace in the drive. MAN ALIVE forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back while
continuing along the rail early in the turn, not a threat in the drive. PENNIES LIL MAN broke in, was straightened to race in mid pack for a half, had little for
the drive. MR. FIERY FLASH remained always back. LIONS HOT MESS was finished early, stopped after a half, jogged in.
