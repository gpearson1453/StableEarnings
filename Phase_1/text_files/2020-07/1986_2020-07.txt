Footnotes
WESTONS WILDCAT, urged to the lead racing a bit off the rail, held sway on a clear margin through the turn, shifted to the rail entering the lane and
maintained a safe advantage under pressure. AND HE'S LOOSE, firmly rated off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while
shifting out four wide on the turn and gained second in late stages. GOLD AND SKOL was rated between foes in second flight racing through the
backstretch, exchanged bumps with THREESIXTHREE nearing the seven sixteenths marker, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter inside a rival racing into
the lane but had no final bid. THREESIXTHREE, pulling hard along the inside early, shifted off the rail exchanging solid contact near the seven sixteenths
marker with GOLD AND SKOL and quickly gave out. WILD HERCULES tracked the leader outside foes in second flight but dropped out early.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES, reserved last to the backstretch, gained position between rivals nearing the far turn, shifted three wide on the far turn making steady
progress and wore down the leader to prevail in time under firm left handed pressure. SLINGSHOT MISTRESS, in touch prompting a rival's pace to the
backstretch, went clear on the far turn, held sway into the lane and was collared late. HUSH Y'ALL tracked just off the first flight under rating to the
backstretch, angled inwards nearing the lane but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. MISS LEIN settled outside foes early, angled out
five wide entering the lane but made no impression. EUTYCHIA settled near the inside in the opening half, saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed
late response. CSILLA, urged to dispute the pace inside a rival from the outset to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
SEANSHINE, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the turn, forged clear racing into the stretch and was kept to steady right handed
encouragement. BEYOND STREETSMART, in touch between foes in the opening sixteenth, was eased off the second flight to track outside a rival into the
turn, swung five wide entering the lane and finished with interest to gain the place honors. FOREIGN RUMOR tracked off the second flight while angling
inside, saved ground to upper stretch gaining position in late stages but was outkicked for second. BLAME BISHOP, three deep between in the second flight
in the opening stages, tracked the leader between foes in second flight to the lane but lacked the needed late response. WHATDOYATHINK, prompted to a
forward placing along rail, made brief pursuit of the eventual winner but gave way into the lane. NOTTE OSCURA tracked the leader racing four wide in
second flight to the turn, then into the lane and gave way in late stages. BIG MONEY MAX, steadied out of close quarters just after the start, settled last,
swung wide entering the lane but proved no threat.

MASKED broke readily, shifted off the rail disputing the pace in the three path inside a rival, then between foes into the turn, continued in a protracted
skirmish remaining well off the rail while being headed racing into the lane but edged forward to narrowly prevail in time under brisk handling in an all out
drive. CORRANA EN LIMEN angled inwards to join the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, pressed the issue in the four path into the turn, struck the
front in a long drive near midstretch but just failed to contain the winner. DAD'S A GAMBLER rated between foes in second flight racing to the turn, swung
out five wide entering the lane and continued with interest to edge rivals for a share nearing the wire. AZARUK angled to the inside early tracking off the first
flight, was prompted to bid inside the leaders racing into the turn but gave way into the lane. BLUE ECLIPSE tracked off the second flight four wide into the
turn and continued in that path between foes to the lane but had no final kick. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE, shuffled back at the start, failed to menace
thereafter. LONESOME HIGHWAY angled inwards to lodge a brief bid between foes racing into the turn, was pulled up in distress racing into upper stretch,
then was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
TEMUJIN LADY was prompted between foes to dispute the pace in the opening stages, shook clear racing into the turn while racing a bit off the rail, then
held sway to the end, widening late under firm encouragement. MIN FREYA, in touch with the eventual winner prompting that rival in the opening stages,
conceded some ground to that rival nearing the turn to track outside foes, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a game effort to
narrowly prevail for second, then was vanned off the course after the race. MRS. D'S CONCERTO angled to the inside early tracking just off the leaders,
was urged to advance along the rail nearing the lane but had no final kick. WEE MS. BURNZIE was rated along the inside early, shifted out four wide racing
into the lane but had no late kick. EXTRA CHROME, held up last in the opening stages, saved ground to the lane but made no impression. WILD DESIRE
broke sharply, conceded the lead to track off the first flight, was urged to make brief progress between foes challenge the leader nearing the lane but
abruptly emptied out in upper stretch. HASH BROWN settled outside a rival tracking well off the second flight early and soon faded.

MR. COUGAR, held up last in the opening stages, switched outside rivals while being prompted to advance nearing the turn, advanced on the leaders in the
four path racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage while drifting out leaving midstretch but went clear under firm handling. TRADIN UP settled
between foes in the opening stages, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to prevail for the place
honors. JIMMY'S MARCO angled inwards disputing the pace inside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, pressed to upper stretch and weakened
late. BOLD PROPOSITION, urged forcing the pace outside a rival on a narrow advantage through the backstretch into the turn, dueled between foes into
upper stretch and yielded late. THEMANLOOK tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn but lacked a closing bid.
DAZZLING REUNION tracked the pace inside foes in second flight and retreated early. VIVACE dropped out early.

HOTFOOT gained a forward placing tracking off the first flight along the inside in early stages, switched outside foes approaching the turn, advanced on the
leaders four deep racing into upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm hand urging. BUSHROD broke slowly, was urged to terms with the pacesetter
prompting that rival into the turn, pressed the issue between foes to late stages striking the front but came up second best. JUST BLAZE tracked the leaders
between foes in second flight and continued with an even effort to edge a rival for a share on the wire. DISCREET TIGER tracked off the second flight along
the inside, shifted out three wide racing through the lane and made some mild progress. DARE FELIX broke readily, angled to the inside dictating the pace
on a narrow margin, dueled for command inside a rival to upper stretch and weakened late. MORE THAN A. P. tracked off the second flight three wide
early, angled four wide racing into the lane but had no rally. NO MO HOOCH, urged along the inside prompting the pacesetter in the opening stages,
steadied out of tight quarters racing into the turn and quickly gave way. SCOOTER'S BOY dropped out early.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF BLUE vied for command three wide between foes in the opening stages, dropped back nearing upper stretch, angled to the four path
entering the lane and produced a solid second effort to wrest the advantage in time under brisk handling. HURRICAIN HUNTER exchanged bumps with
MISS STEELE JONES at the start, was righted to press the pace four wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the lane while gaining the
advantage and just missed. SWEET AS CANBE, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shifted off the rail racing into the lane
contesting the issue but weakened late. MISS STEELE JONES, exchanged bumps at the start, was caught five wide early tracking off the first flight, shifted
in to track the leaders three deep into the turn and continued evenly to gain some position late. GOLDEN GOPHER settled outside foes while going a bit
erratically in the opening stages, angled five wide racing into the lane but made no impression. B L BREEZY vied briefly between foes but emptied out early.
SHINE MY BADGE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
