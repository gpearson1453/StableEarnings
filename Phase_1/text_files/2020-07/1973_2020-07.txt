Footnotes
DONTMESWITHDISCAT broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear and toward the inside, set all the pace, held the runner up safe late under steady handling.
BECCA'S ROCKET forwardly placed form the start off the inside, chased the winner through the turn, drifted slightly past the furlong marker, slowly gaining
late while remaining clear for the place. PLATINUM QUEEN in mid pack early toward the inside, steered out to be three wide for the drive, lugged in when
advancing midstretch, flattened out in the final furlong to finish clear of the others. EXPECT OURS closest to the winner early off the in side, began to fade
before three furlongs. MIDNIGHTONTHEBAYOU went evenly while racing outside. CHIEF THE GREAT broke back and made little impact. RUNAWAY
HENNY off a step slow, was always outrun. TEXAS FUGITIVE moved to the inside to save ground into the turn, tired while continuing inside.

Footnotes
LADY RAD forwardly placed inside, took over turn, headed while in the two path into the stretch, headed when straightened for home, battled back to be
clear late in a solid effort. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK void of early foot, angled out to be six wide turning for home when beginning to advance, continued
willingly while widest in the drive, up for the place. ZUGERSEE broke well from the outside, pressed the issue out of the chute, fell back to race in the
second flight into the turn, ranged up to challenge in the four path exiting the bend, showed the way past the furlong marker, could not match the winner the
final sixteenth when beginning to weaken, continued to falter to lose the place spot late, narrowly saved the show. TWO WITH A TEN also lacked any early
speed, raced five wide and inside the runner up exiting the turn, improved past the furlong marker then flattened out out a bit late. EURA QUEEN back off
the early pace toward the inside, improved in the two path into the lane, also failed to sustain that advance in the late going to finish up evenly. MY LITTLE
DIVA set or forced the pace for three furlongs while three wide, gave way from between rivals into the stretch. BIND ME UP settled in mid pack, lacked
response. MISS MABELEE in the main body for three furlongs along the inside, had nothing for the drive. KOHENSRISING forwardly placed for three
furlongs, stopped in the drive and jogged in. YOU HAVE A POINT was finished early, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
I'LL RAISE YOU in mid pack early off the inside, advanced to a striking position late in the turn, challenged the leader when straightened for home from the
outside, dueled past the furlong marker and wore that same foe down late under firm handling. CAT ON THE ROOF broke on top, clear early, continued to
show the way past the furlong marker, responded when the winner came alongside nearing the furlong grounds and gave ground grudgingly, clearly second
best. WHISTLING WIND closet to the runner up, continued to chase through the turn, proved no match for the top two in the drive, saved the show. FLASH
DANCERLUCK forwardly placed while along the inside, continued to race within striking distance into the lane, came up empty for the stretch run. GRAND
OMEGA lacked early foot, raced three wide early in the turn, bothered, forced out to be five wide into the lane, improved slightly with some mild late interest
while remaining wide through the lane. CAEUS IN PASADENA back off the pace and the inside, steered out to be four wide and bothering a pair of outer
rivals turning for home, finished evenly late. FIRE MAKERS STAR unprepared at the start to spot the field several lengths, remained back in failing to
threaten. CORK ARM lacked speed outside, was fanned six wide into the lane, faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
OUT OF THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

BORN AGAIN GEORGE in the second flight up the backstretch outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, set down for the drive, up in time outside.
BROADWAY ICE back off the pace inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, moved out slightly and split foes when advancing late, finished up
willingly to annex the place. I WANT A PICTURE forwardly placed while moving off the inside, pressed the issue into and through the turn, put a head in
front inside the furlong marker, led late but could not last. SOUTHERN SWAGG broke alertly,sprinted clear to set the pace, continued to show the way
through the turn, responded when the runner up challenged approaching midstretch then faltered in the late going. ONEHOLYLION last away, trailed early,
continued to race back in the turn while well wide, came five wide into the lane, failed to muster a closing response. STORMATION in the second group
early, moved out when beginning to weaken late in the turn to be four wide into the stretch, continued to weaken in the drive.

DOUBLE RED outrun early while four wide through the first turn, moved closer in the three path the third quarter, challenged on the outside into the lane,
vied past the furlong marker then drew clear late under pressure. FLASH ANNIE forwardly placed past the wire the first time, steadied, bumped when put in
tight entering the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, asked along into the stretch, rail bid late, determined for the place. STREETTALKINHOTTIE
forwardly placed, took over after a half, showed the way past the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, allowed the runner up the inside late and
was outfinished for the place spot by that rival. BREEZIN BYE YOU four wide into the first turn when well off the pace, advanced the next quarter to become
a forward factor, lodged a bid in the second turn then began to weaken in upper stretch. SHEZA MEAN BROAD jammed then was forced to check up
sharply in tight quarters after being bumped into the first turn, settled in mid pack and came up empty for the stretch run. MY PAL CHARLENE lacked
speed, moved outside was four wide through the final turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. SAFE KEEPING was never involved. I AM THE FIRE broke
on top, angled toward the inside into the first turn, bumped with MORE CLEVER soundly, dueled with that one for a half and gave way. MORE CLEVER
asked away from the gate to keep up with the leaders, in tight, bumped entering the first turn, pace for a half, stopped, fell far back, jogged in. PARTY
TWIST gave way after a quarter, pulled up early backstretch, walked off.

Footnotes
ATCHATA broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and through the turn along the inside, shook off the other speed entering the straight
and drew well clear while being kept to task. MI COPA REBOSA broke out a bit, void of early foot, continued back coming into the stretch, made a late run
up the rail to annex the place. SUCKERFORAGREY settled off the pace, came in the two path for the drive, bid for the place between rivals the final
sixteenth, outkicked. DUEFORADATE pressed the winner from the outside for three furlongs, weakened steadily in the drive to lose a couple of positions
late. DIVA'S RANSOM within striking distance for three furlongs, came up empty for the drive. TOUGH KICKS broke in, was straightened to race in the
second flight, had little left for the stretch run. NEW ORLEANS SPICE pinched back at the start to be last away, moved outside while racing in the second
flight, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on.

Footnotes
HE'S A LADY TAMER broke with the field, continued to race with the main body off the inside, bit closer late in the turn in traffic, waited into the
stretch,steered to the outside when straightened for home, engaged the leader past the furlong marker and was slowly edging clear at the wire. DIXIE BEAT
forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, chased the dueling leaders into the turn, challenged three wide turning for home, gained the advantage,
briefly responded when the winner came alongside with a furlong remaining, could not match strides with that one late, clearly second best. HANDSOME
HARVE void of speed outside, came three wide into the stretch, set down for the drive, found best stride to late through traffic, in time for the show. BET
AGAIN well back as well for four furlongs, two path into the stretch, improved position through the stretch while also dealing with some traffic.
SUCCESSFUL RYKER away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, weakened in the drive. MR RED SENSATION in the second flight while racing
outside, was five wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. FLATTER THE QUEEN raced back off the early pace, saved
some ground through the turn, got through along the rail into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late punch. SO SORRY RUSTON well back
while racing outside, five wide late in the turn, failed to rally. CHIEF ENVOY dueled up front closest to the inside for three furlongs and began to give way.
ELITE RUNNER tired while four wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
KING OF CANDY allowed the pace to go early, saved ground, advanced and challenged inside the runner up exiting the final turn, put a head in front soon
after, dueled to the wire and proved narrowly best in a determined effort. GOTTA GO took command just after the start, set the pace just off the inside,
continued to show the way up the backstretch through some soft splits, got out a bit further turning for home allowing the winner an ample opening entering
the stretch, dueled with that rival to the wire, outkicked in the final strides to miss. INVASORS WIND fell back to trail after the start, continued unhurried the
middle half, staged a mild rally to be well clear of the others, no threat to the top two. CAJUN CREED chased the runner up outside that one, floated out a
bit late in the final turn then steadily weakened through the stretch. WHAT POWER was finished after four furlongs.

Footnotes
JERRY'S LEGACY with the pace from the start, dueled late in the turn closest to the inside, kicked strongly clear in the drive under steady handling.
CRYPTO BRAVE vied early inside the winner, fell back through the turn while continuing inside, came back to earn the place while no match for the winner.
RARE ONE broke back, moved up outside, challenged the winner in the two path late in the turn, dueled into the stretch then quickly could not keep up nor
match strides with the runner up, saved the show. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL forwardly placed toward the inside, continued in the second flight in the two path
through the turn, lacked a significant closing response when called on for the drive. TENACIOUS FAITH settled off the pace and the inside, one paced into
the lane, drifted out in the stretch, finished up evenly. ENOUGH HEART lacked early foot, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, improved only slightly in
the drive without posing a serious threat. BETTY GETS BETTER last away, was six wide into the turn, failed to menace in the drive. KNIGHTS RANSOM
void of early foot outside, angled out six wide turning for home, failed to mount a threat. BLESSED VILLANA back off the pace and the inside, in some traffic
early in the turn, failed to rally when clear for the stretch run. BROKE AND PRAYING in the second flight early, tired toward the inside. SMART N HOLY was
always outrun while racing wide. CAJUN CATIN within striking distance early off the inside, steadily faded.
