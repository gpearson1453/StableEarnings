FAITHFUL NEIGHBOR tracked leader to far turn, took over past the quarter pole and and motored clear late under stout urging. AULD CUP broke tardy, far
back to the stretch four wide run but proved no match and second best. PLAIN TALES raced outside most off way with no late response but roused for the
third spot. CAPTAIN KITTEN saved ground throughout to no avail. ZANFORCE showed speed, led to quarter pole while overtaken and gave in from that
point. ARCH YOU READY never menaced.

Footnotes
LAHIRI stalked the leader from outside, moved wide into the stretch and wore down rivals. BIZBY chased the leader from the inside, engaged that one at
the top of the stretch, got by that foe but gave way late. PRESI PLAIN JANE led inside, flattened out at the eighth pole and lost the lead at the sixteenth
pole. PERSONAL SERVER unhurried, was moving well late. TOO SHORT gained position on the turn, then came up empty in the stretch. SAFFRON GIRL
raced mid pack and evenly. YELLOW BIRD tracked from the rail and faltered at the eighth pole. OXBOWINDY had an awkward start and was no threat.
UNSCATTERED raced mid pack outside and had no rally. HIDDEN STRENGTH was never in it.

Footnotes
SUN DRESS confidently handled throughout, tracked to quarter pole, ran on with ease, cleared in the stretch run and held sway to the wire. LITTLE
MATILDA perfectly placed, angled off rail past the quarter pole and was coming on late. GIRLS GOT TRACK good speed to the front, stayed to the turn but
could not contain winner and came up empty. TWELVE MONARCHS slow to un-track from inside, split horses with a middle move gain while no real threat.
BLUEBERRY SHINE through after half with nothing left to go on. ANSWER MY CALL three wide first turn, showed little from there. DANCE THE DAY
AWAY was through early and dropped far back.

Footnotes
AWESOME GENT pressed the leader from outside, pulled ahead on the turn in the thrree path, was clear at the top of the stretch, was caught by the inside
runners in deep stretch and re-raliied to prevail. TRES EQUIS was away last, raced way back, gapped off the leading group, rode the rail all the way and
closed well in the stretch. LET'SCALLITEVEN raced with the rear group early, made a middle move at the rail on the turn, battled a foe late and lost a head
bob for place. MO DONT NO chased the pace at the rail and ran evenly. ROYAL BLUE BOY raced in front inside and faltered in the stretch. LEVANTO
(ARG) moved up to challenge the leader on the backstretch, dropped back from the pace heading to the far turn, was urged for more on the turn and lacked
a needed rally in the stretch. ITS YES raced widest on the first turn, contended to the far turn, went widest again, and faded. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT
trailed and was no threat.

while best of the rest. HAMPTON SPRING saved ground throughout, caught in tight late stretch and rallied for show. MIS ELAIN E US sharp speed outside,
crossed over to rail with the lead but faltered in the drive. ALLOUTPATRICIA broke well but never menaced. R LUKKI SONG had a terrible start and lost
best chance, rushed to the turn while used up and faded. MORNINGSTARDUST never a factor. TALE OF CONDUCT stumbled badly at the start and lost

Footnotes
HIGH POWERED chased a bit back off the leader, headed that one on the turn, took over the lead, angled in down the stretch and stayed clear under
pressrue. MARK MY WAY unhurried early, was moved up on the far turn, angled off the rail for room in the stretch and just held place while unable to catch
the winner. SOLO DRINK tracked the pace at the rail, was pushed on while racing on the far turn, rallied, and was closing late while dueling a foe down the
middle of the strip, getting up for third. BUGLE BARRY moved up to contend while three wide on the turn, battled a foe down the center of the lane and got
beat for show. GEH SCHNELL moved closer on the far turn, got within range, then dropped back from between horses and lacked a rally. CONTRACTION
was off awkward, went to the lead off the rail on the first turn, and dropped back on the far turn.
