Footnotes
BABY BAM BAM disputed the pace three wide, drew clear around the far turn and held clear under a drive. TINK was hung out five wide around the first
turn, stalked the pace outside, moved into a clear second while in the four path rounding the far turn, lacked a rally but dug in to preserve the place.
VICTORY SPELL tracked the pace four wide, was one-paced in the lane and was outfinished for the place. QUEEN OF MUSKOKA vied inside of the winner
in the two path for a half, could not keep pace around the far turn but churned on to maintain a minor share. RUBY PUNCH was bumped at the start, raced
off the pace three wide and never threatened. MISS TOM TOM played no factor while racing two and three wide. S P F NINETYNINE was bumped at the
start, raced wide, made little impact and was vanned off after the finish. DILLY DOES IT chased the pace two wide and was through after a half.

SINGLINO set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. YOU ARE AWESOME chased the winner three wide, never threatened that foe but
stayed on well to be clearly second best. END ALL GET ALL stumbled at the start, raced three and four wide in midpack and was along for the show.
SHOULDA HAD IT failed to menace while racing two wide. IMAGINE LEGEND chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. SILVER SUN was
fractious in the starting gate, raced two wide and played no factor. BEAVIS chase the pace inside and faded in the lane. HANLEY was outrun inside. WINDY
MOSH trailed inside.

CALL ME DADDY stalked the pace inside, went two wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied between foes and was up in deep
stretch. DRIFTWOOD pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, took the lead midway down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path rounding the
far turn and led until the final strides. SKYDIVING settled well off the pace along the inside, made good progress inside around the far turn, angled out
nearing the lane and rallied outside. BAYTOWN JIMBO was squeezed back at the start, raced off the pace two wide and had a mild rally. BELLARMINE
HALL was a bit rank around the first turn, chased the pace two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. BRUTUS failed to menace while racing three
and four wide. ITSKNOWNASTHEBERN set the early pace along the rail, chased inside around the far turn and faded. PRINCE KHOZAN played no factor
while racing three wide. THE CONNECTOR stalked the pace three wide and faded around the far turn. CRAZY KATER was outrun while racing four wide.

LASTING UNION set the pace in the three path, ceded the lead down much of the backstretch, edged ahead around the far turn and drew off under a drive.
ANNIKA GOLD contested the pace inside of the winner in the two path, was no match for that foe in upper stretch, angled further out and held clear for the
place. ALWAYS A QUEEN broke in the air, raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. BE BOP A LOLA stalked the pace four wide and
came up empty. PAT'S NO FOOL chased the pace inside and retreated around the far turn. FILLY RIDE was through early.

COWBOY GANDHI lacked early speed, advanced five wide around the turn, came eighth wide into the lane, closed down the center of the track and was up
in the final strides. SMALL INVASION settled off the pace along the inside, advanced two wide between foes nearing the lane, rallied between foes, took the
lead near the sixteenth pole, drew clear briefly and led until the final strides. LEADING MAN prompted the pace three wide, battled on between foes through
the lane but was outfinished. MR. VECCHIO settled off the early pace, advanced three wide between foes around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch,
led to the sixteenth pole and weakened a bit late. BERRY HILL was in tight at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. WATCH THE DIP
had early speed inside, dropped back around the turn, re-bid inside of foes nearing the midstretch then weakened. BOSS ONTHE HORIZON set the pace
two wide and tired in the stretch. BOLTER was outrun while racing two wide. CONFUSION stalked the pace four wide and came up empty in the stretch.
AIKEN ON TAP had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
SHE'S ACHANCE TOO stalked the pace three wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. FLY ON ANGEL set the
pace in the two path, was no match for the winner but held on well to save the place. CAUGHT UP IN YOU was fractious in the starting gate, saved ground
off the pace and was along for the show. PERFECT REINS gave distant chase three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a bid.
FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER was outrun outside. STEELIN MAGNOLIAS pressed the pace between the top two down the backstretch and retreated around
the turn.

Footnotes
KAMEHAMEHA set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. STUCK UP pressed the pace two wide, was no match for the winner but finished
willingly to hold second. DON JUPP hopped at the start, lagged well back while racing four wide, swung further out in upper stretch and rallied widest.
CODE NAME BRODY stalked the pace three wide, was bumped midway around the first turn, continued three deep around the far turn and lacked the
needed rally. RADCLIFFE ROYALE raced up close inside and came up empty in the lane. THEKIDSBACK saved ground to no avail. TEMPLE CITY STAR
was outrun while racing three wide. ALDO'S KITTEN was bumped midway around the first turn, raced two and three wide and never threatened.
VIXSINSFANTASTKFOX played no factor while racing three wide. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN lacked speed three wide, made a wide run down the backstretch
then retreated five wide around the far turn. BAYOU JAM played no factor while racing three and four wide.
