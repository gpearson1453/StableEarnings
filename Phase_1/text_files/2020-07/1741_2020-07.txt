Footnotes
ALDA got guided over to the inside route prior to reaching the conclusion of the backstretch, kept watch within striking distance, was let out a notch at the
five-sixteenths pole, swung out three wide into the lane and went after the ones to catch in earnest, wrested away the advantage in the vicinity of the
sixteenth pole and edged away. ILLEGAL SMILE (IRE) disputed the pace to the inside of STEAL MY SUNSHINE during the initial stages, shifted to be
outside that opponent once that one had asserted control, did its prompting from the two path, pulling a bit on the bit, got cued up taking on the leader as
they turned into the lane, gained the advantage only to have the winner bearing down hard to the right, relinquished with approximately a sixteenth to go,
held on well to save second. FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) chased the pace from the two path, got set down a short distance from the end of the bend, was
ridden four wide into the stretch, flattened out. FUNWHILEITLASTED pursued the pace from the three path on the bend, fanned out into the five path from
upper to midstretch, venturing onward as virtually widest throughout, made no headway. CONTAINED took the inside route for the opening half, was moved
into the two path at the head of the stretch, had no offering. STEAL MY SUNSHINE showed the way from just off the rail, got overhauled during the early
stages of the stretch run and backed away. TREWISH saved ground while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
MONEYMEISTER four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to wear
down the leader and take command near the sixteenth pole, then edged away to the finish kept to task. JAVELIN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to be along for the place honors in the final jumps. VINCERO coaxed from
the gate, vied inside a pair just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and emerged with sole command spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in getting collared near the sixteenth marker and weakened in the late stages while clear for
the show honors. TALE OF MIST chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved
position by tired rivals. SWIPING DAN chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. TIPSY MOOSE hustled from the gate, vied two to three wide between foes through to the midway point on the turn when put to coaxing, cornered
just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MASSEY HALL hustled from the start, vied outside a pair three then four wide, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch in the midst of getting shaken off and tired.

Footnotes
HUNGRY KITTEN worked out a tuck onto the inside coming up the end of the homestretch, brought up the back of the pack, got steered into the two path at
the half mile pole, was asked to pick it up angling to the outside late on the second bend, straightened away in the four path, clawed her way to the front
runners, struck the front end with approximately a sixteenth remaining and shook free. SETTING THE MOOD travelled about the clubhouse turn from path
two, was more in the three path racing around the far turn, was given her cue coming up the top of the stretch, forged her way past a twosome to the left to
emerge at the eighth pole as the new leader, was reeled in a sixteenth later, held on well for the place. WHATDOESASHARKSAY established the top prior
to reaching the first turn, carved out the pace at or near the two path on a loosely-contested lead, felt an increase in pressure approaching the quarter pole,
got turned loose in response, was forced to fend off two others to the outside, failed, fought until the general area of the sixteenth pole then weakened into
the show slot. NO MO TEMPER forwardly placed, was towards the two path drafting behind the pacesetter both on the backstretch and the second bend,
tipped a bit wider for the drive home, vied from between foes from the head of the stretch to deep stretch, couldn't claim the top and weakened. EBONY
(FR) pocketed until the quarter pole, was moved out three wide into the stretch, failed to fire appreciably. WICKED AMBER saw the rider suffer a broken
right iron in the shadow of the starting gate, was pulled up after being eased, then got escorted off the course by the outrider.

Footnotes
GIANT STELLA broke outwards brushing the off side stall at the start, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, shied in
suddenly a path from an outside rival just inside the five-sixteenths forcing a backing away foe to be taken in hand briefly and once more near the quarter
pole clear of rivals, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail.
BELLEZA brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three to four wide and began to advance on the top pair through the latter portion of the turn under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, took over the front with three-sixteenths to go, dug in and was collared inside the eighth pole,
ran on to be along clear of the rest and second best. MADAM DEPUTY chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and improved position for the show honors. CENTRAL EXIT inside briefly, tipped to the two path with five furlongs remaining, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths tipping out three wide, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOVE ME TOMORROW showed the way in hand along the
inside, came under coaxing under pressure at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, yielded at the three-sixteenths and weakened. BUFFET
coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside before tipping to the two path through the turn, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. SANDER'S EMPIRE chased two to three wide under a ride from midway on the turn, went four wide for home, was
unable to make an impact. ALLURE FORTUNE three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, prompted the pace tucked to the two path through the turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. FUNDERELLA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside
until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
ANOTHER rapidly established himself on the front end, spurted off from the competition, appearing keen, showed the way on open lead, on or very near the
inside route, came up to the three-sixteenths pole and got turned loose, emerged a sixteenth down the road in possession of its largest advantage,
squandered much of it, but held sway. C C RIDER strung out four wide on the first turn, went about the subsequent one in the three path, was still in it
spinning into the stretch, closed in well and won the place. QUIET OUT EAST sat reserved in the two path after stumbling at the start, went over to the rail
at the half mile pole, rode it to the end of the bend, angled four wide turning into the stretch, gained readily on the top one, came up short then missed out
place honors too. WAR FILM was in the two path stalking the pace from afar, got roused for the drive home, was outfinished late. TRICKY MAGICIAN
tracked the front runners from the inside route, was forced to bide time caught behind some foes during the final stages of the run around the second bend,
slipped by into clearance after getting eased towards the two path at the top of the lane, didn't manage to muster up enough headway. UHTRED three wide
early, travelled in the two path on turn tow, swung out five wide into the lane, lacked a solid closing punch. RIENDO spotted along the rail in short order,
took up residence there until the quarter pole, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, made no impact. CHANNEL ISLAND pursued the pace from
the two path, shifted out a couple of paths wider for the stretch run, had no rally. MONAGHAN faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey.

POP A CHOC established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under some pressure from a
trio to the outside, spun just off the inside for home, drew off under a drive to prevail. HARLEM HEIGHTS veered out at the start and was corrected, chased
five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the
latter portion of the bend, went five wide for home, dug in under a drive proving no match for the top one while keeping on to battle head to head with BACK
CHANNEL through to the finish to procure the place honors. BACK CHANNEL four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the winner while knocking heads to the finish with the aforementioned foe, but was bested on the
wire for the place honors while well clear of the rest. SIMPLY SWEET bumped at the start by CAPRAIA'S DESTINY, who broke inwards, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. VENUS
OYZO chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside for home and improved position in the stretch. BUYER'S REMORSE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, prompted the pace just off
the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. CAPRAIA'S DESTINY broke in at the start bumping SIMPLY SWEET,
chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn pushed along with seven-sixteenths remaining, went six wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. ORSAY chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide for home, faltered in the drive.
FAST CHICA veered in at the start, chased five then four wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, went three to four wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
NO WORD away in good order, proceeded along the clubhouse bend well rated three wide, shifted one path closer to the rail prior to reaching the next turn,
crept up to the leader after three-quarters had been rattled off, angled three wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the one to catch, latched on
sparking off a spirited tussle in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, wrested away the lead but remained engaged with ASSIDIOUSLY until well inside
the sixteenth marker, dug in late to fend off the second place finisher. SHAMROCKET took the inside route until the end of the second bend, got steered out
three wide for the stretch run, rallied with good energy, missed. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) put to a snug hold after the start, eyed an equally-rated ON BASE
from the two path during the opening phases, was yanked back into path three after momentarily wandering into the third one on the backstretch, moved on
to assert control shortly afterwards, with none before this seeming too eager to cut the pace themselves, slid over to the rail on the far turn, waited until the
three-sixteenths pole before getting roused, by this juncture back in the two path, saw a duel with the winner get set off, relinquished, fought onward before
weakening in deep stretch. WILL SING FOR WINE was gathered after breaking to the outside, tucked along the inside, brought up the back of the pack
while one-paced, flashed some interest late on the second bend, fanned out six wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, gained, but all
accomplished without much impact. ON BASE a pace factor from the rail during the initial stages, remained forwardly placed once another took over, cut the
corner into the stretch, backed away. BUY ME CANDY underwent a three to four wide trip to the quarter pole, was more the latter after spinning into the
lane, lacked a solid closing punch. OUR COUNTRY rank early, saved ground and faltered.

GRAND CRU CLASSE broke in at the start and was corrected, vied inside a pair down the backstretch from the two path before tucking inside through the
turn, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive drifting out from the eighth pole through to the finish despite an off sided
stick and was kept to task. MRS. DANVERS lunged at the break getting away last, chased briefly six paths off the inside before tucking four then three wide,
came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the place honors. THE GREAT
JOHANNA three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and angled in
as the leader drifted out, kept on to secure the show honors. EXCESS CAPACITY vied five then four wide outside a pair, tucked three wide at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAIDEN BEAUTY four to five wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide for home and tired. DOVEY LOVEY vied between foes three then two wide placed to
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch having been shaken off and tired.

Footnotes
COME STORMING in slightly springing from the starting gate, launched a two wide run on the first turn to establish the top, slid over to the inside route
shortly after stepping onto the backstretch, saw the rider holding something in reserve leading the way, came out a bit and onto the outer border of inside
route once onto the far turn, went onward with the rider applying a strong grip on the left side, edged away, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when
finally asked for more, left the eighth pole leading by its largest margin, had WICKED HAPPY cut into it, but held sway. WICKED HAPPY strung out three
wide on the opening bend, took up the chase slightly closer to the rail afterwards, swung two to three wide into the stretch, rallied for the place. SIMPLY
MISS RED raced from path three on the bend, went to to stalk the pace from the second one on the next turn, spun about as wide into the stretch, mustered
up a mild response sufficient enough for third. TOASTNJAM prompted the winner from path two for three-quarters, got guided over to the rail in upper
stretch, weakened. HARD WON shied away from the top one as the field was sent off and running, tucked along the inside route in short order, patiently
kept watch from midpack, fanned out into path five from upper to midlane, lacked a solid closing punch. FLEET STEPPER in a bit at the start, saved ground
to no avail. WISHES AND DREAMS three wide early, was one path closer to the rail on the far turn and upper stretch, made no impact. MATADOR MOON
bumped lightly with SHINE LIKE BOBBY at the start, went on to race four wide on the first turn, appeared unsettled at times on the trip leading up to the
conclusion of the backstretch, was near the inside on turn two, tipped into the two path heading home, had no rally. QUEEN DAVEIGH gathered after
breaking to the outside, found refuge on the rail early on the backstretch after being four wide on the first turn, drafted behind others, was eased back to the
two path after SHINE LIKE BOBBY got worked over to the rail at the half mile pole, was sent out six wide during the initial portion of the stretch, never made
her presence felt. SHINE LIKE BOBBY unhurried two wide after making some contact with MATADOR MOON, cut over to the rail at the end of the
backstretch, strolled into the lane on empty. PLIMSOLL ANNY hung out five wide on the opening turn, managed to get worked into the three path by half
mile pole, backed away steadily after leaving that station.
