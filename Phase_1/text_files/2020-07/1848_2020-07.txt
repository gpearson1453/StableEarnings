Footnotes
GOLD SUPPLY broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by FINE ELEMENT nearing the quarter, opened a clear
lead soon after the held EXCESSIVE BELIEF safe late. EXCESSIVE BELIEF stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the
drive and finished with a steady bid. FINE ELEMENT was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage
that rival nearing the quarter marker and gave way in the drive. BELLAMAGIC settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out
into the stretch and finished with some late run. DAKOTA ROSE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SASSY EDIE
was off a step slow, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. RUEFUL'S NIGHT OUT was off a step slow, settled
off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
ZEYNEP broke inward, dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off. MISS VALOR was allowed to settle early,
saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, could not gain on the winner but finished with good energy. MS LYNN lacked early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. MEAN SHARON pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
XIMENA'S HONOR was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. JACOMINA was void of early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TIMBER JENNY broke sharply to dispute the early fractions from between foes and gave way in the drive.
GUARDING ELK CAMP settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. COASTAL AFFAIR was off slow and lagged
throughout.

Footnotes
TIG was away in good order then hustled along to open a clear margin before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted in nearing the
furlong marker and continued to draw away. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into
the stretch and finished with good late energy. MOSQUITO FLEET raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn, checked in mid-stretch,
angled out and finished with good courage. ROYAL ASPIRATIONS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
late response. SPITTIN IMAGE tracked the leaders from off the rail throughout and gave way in the drive. LONG LANCE was off slow, lacked early foot and
failed to rally. MONARCH WOODS raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CRITERION showed no early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace.

the start, lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GALLANT HEAT was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and did not menace. DOUBLE A. PROSPECT was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. CREST DRIVE disputed the
pace from the inside, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole and weakened. JACKSON TELLER lagged throughout.

lead and held sway to the wire. IRISH SWING chased the pace of FUZZY DOLPHIN while racing three-wide, stayed on well in the drive and held the place.
THORN LEGACY was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and finished willingly. ONLY THE
HIGH ROAD raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. HOW'S MY HERO lacked early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not menace. WINNING BLUFF showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FUZZY DOLPHIN
was bumped at the start, sprinted clear at once and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
RAISE THE WOOF was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to gain command with a sixteenth to run and edged away
through the closing yards. WINE AT NINE lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished well to be up for
the place. BUCKLEY BAY set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and gave way grudgingly in the drive.
VICENTE'S SHADOW lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn, drifted out into the stretch and finished with some late run. AQUA FRIO showed no
early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled back in with a furlong to run and did not offer a bid.
HOLLYWOOD HEAT was off slow, rushed up for a contending position and weakened after going a half. THIS GREAT NATION broke sharply to press the
pace from between foes, weakened after going three furlongs and was eased through the lane.
