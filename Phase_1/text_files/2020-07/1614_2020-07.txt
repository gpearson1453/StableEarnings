Footnotes
PRIVATE PARTY took control at once, widened on the turn, remained well clear and was taken under wraps late. JACK O LIAM rushed up inside to engage
the leader briefly, angled to the two path and continued well. THE GREAT SAMURAI chased between rivals early, dropped back on the turn and was no
threat. PEGASUS RED lacked speed inside and was never in contention. TRULY A MOON SHOT chased three wide and was never a factor. REFUNDED
hustled within striking range early and gave way. OFF DUTY was urged close up wide down the backstretch then stopped.

FLASHNDYNAMITE set a pressured pace early, repulsed a challenge on the turn and edged away under moderate pressure. SLINGIN SAMMY B rushed to
contention inside on the turn, could not stay with the winner but continued willingly. SALLY O'PRADO lagged far behind inside, angled wide into the stretch
and offered a mild bid. DREAMING DIAMONDS prompted the winner for half a mile and began fading midway on the turn. LIVIN A DREAM lacked speed
racing wide and was never a factor. MAGALIE angled inside in the opening quarter and weakened steadily. PANSY was urged close up briefly then stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN TREE forced the pace outside, was soundly bumped at the top of the stretch then came again late to gain the decision. INSPIRED OPTIONS
stalked the pacesetters, bid to the front in the stretch, drifted out in the lane and was nailed. SHILOH LANE broke slowest, chased three wide and rallied
mildly. RAILROAD BILL set a clear pace inside, came out bumping winner at the top of the stretch and tired. LITTLE TOWN BLUES lagged far behind then
passed fading rivals. ELREGAL saved ground close up for half a mile and faded. GAME CHANGER gave way after a quarter mile. MARNESIA ONE STEP
was urged just off the leaders three wide and stopped. A claim of foul by the rider of RAINBOW BILL against the winner for interference in the stretch was
dismissed.
