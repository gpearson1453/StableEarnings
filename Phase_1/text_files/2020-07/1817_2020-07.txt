Footnotes
ABSTRACT PAYNTER advanced in close quarters between rivals nearing the half mile marker, rallied in the stretch and drew away under mostly hand
urging the last furlong. MONFORD prominent between horses, took over from path three on the bend, was challenged from inside upper stretch, no match
for ABSTRACT PAYNTER but was unchallenged for second. FAST ONE in contention early, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the
stretch run, loomed a serious threat with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. W W CRUSADER advanced widest on the bend, regained a striking position
midstretch but could not sustain his bid late. HARD WHISKEY altered in to avoid the loosed horse nearing the half mile pole, improved position four wide on
the turn then failed to have a significant stretch bid. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD displayed early speed, was overtaken from outside leaving the bend and gave
way two wide through the lane. TOUGH COMMISH was away slowly, a factor from inside for three furlongs then gave way. GEM CITY JEWEL fractious in
the gate, hesitated then bore in at the start, losing his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into GEM CITY JEWEL'S start but no action taken after their
review. Due to the riderless horse taking the lead after two furlongs, the half mile, five furlong and finish fractions were hand timed.

Footnotes
STUMP rated on the front end from outside, moved clear on the turn, was roused leaving the bend then gradually opened up under a drive through the
stretch. JACK N JOHN was steadied in traffic leaving the chute, began to progress between rivals on the bend, rallied in the lane and moved clear for
second deep stretch. ALSHUJAA advanced between horses on the turn, was two wide leaving the bend, lodged a mild bid and gained third late.
NOTANINJA without early speed, did not keep up widest on the turn and could only improve position the last eighth without threatening. WILDWOOD'S
AFLEET chased from inside and just passed tired ones from along the rail through the stretch. MONTEZUMA EXPRESS displayed early speed inside
STUMP, did not stay with that one on the turn and flattened out the final eighth. GENTLEMAN RICHIE pressed the early pacesetters, was just off the rail on
the bend then weakened between rivals for the drive. FLOWER PUNCH advanced three wide on the bend, fanned to the outside for the stretch run and had
no late bid. KIM MAN faded from inside on the turn.

Footnotes
BOB'S BRASS DANCER was settled inside, angled out on the turn to advance between horses, surged from five wide in the stretch and swept past EL
PRINCIPE I B near the wire. EL PRINCIPE I B rated on the front end from outside on the backstretch, moved ahead when allowed on the turn, was all out in
the lane, did not have enough but was clearly second best. MARCO'S DREAM stumbled at the start, quickly recovered, advanced between horses to
threaten four wide on the turn but weakened deep stretch. BIG BAD DOC in contention early between rivals, did not keep up four wide on the bend but
improved position the last furlong without threatening. IWANT SGT RECKLESS chased from outside, was widest through the turn but passed outside tired
ones through the stretch. SQUIRRELY MIKE well placed on the front from inside, did not keep up on the bend and flattened out the final eighth. KAPCORI
ROAD in contention on the backstretch, faded from inside on the turn. EUGENE prominent from outside, progressed on the turn but gave way for the drive.
REAL TALK TY displayed early speed between rivals but gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
W W CANDY stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead when allowed on the bend, moved ahead in the lane and lengthened command with
little asking. D' YANK in midpack early between horses, came three wide into the stretch and caught WILDWOOD SECRET for second in the waning yards.
WILDWOOD SECRET soon had a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the turn and gradually wore down the last eighth. AUNDREYA'S BOY just off
the inside on the backstretch, angled out some on the turn, was four wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. TUFF ATTACK
progressed four wide on the bend, fanned out further for the drive but had no late bid. COUP DE VILLE trailed, angled out for the stretch run but had little to
offer. ENDGAME pressed from inside on the backstretch but steadily faded once on the bend.

Footnotes
ANGEL'S RUN rated just off the pace, went for the lead in close quarters two wide on the bend, moved clear with little asking upper stretch and proved
much the best. TOMASITA blocked behind a wall of rivals for a half mile, got through seven wide into the stretch and took over second with a sixteenth left.
MISS LEARJET kept close outside, went for the lead six wide on the turn to be a serious threat leaving the bend but weakened the final eighth. LITTLE
MOLITTA in contention just off the inside, made her way through traffic two wide in the lane to close in for third late. JUST CHARLIE forwardly placed
between rivals, bid four wide in tight quarters on the bend but wore down the final furlong. LOGI prominent from outside, also went for the lead on the turn,
came five wide into the lane and began to wear down the last eighth. TEMPLESIS pressed from between horses, took a narrow lead three wide on the bend
but flattened out for the drive. LION'S WAGER failed to menace in a wide trip. ON THE MONEY chased from just off or along the rail, fanned out some for
the stretch run but had little to offer. FOO FOO GIRL displayed early speed from inside but began to tire after three and a half furlongs.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME rated on the front end from inside, was overtaken on the second bend, angled out to path three for the stretch run, rallied under a drive,
engaged FORT RIDGE inside the final furlong and edged ahead late. FORT RIDGE settled the first quarter mile, advanced between horses on the
backstretch, circled rivals from outside to gain a clear lead on the second turn, moved to the rail leaving that bend, was all out in the lane, lacked the extra
needed but was easily second best. JUSTENUFFTUFF settled between horses early, commenced his bid two wide on the second bend, steadily
progressed and gained third deep stretch. SHOBIZ STAR chased just outside JUSTENUFFTUFF, also advanced on the second turn and lodged a mild bid
the last eighth. SYRUP vied for the lead between horses for more than a half mile, did not keep up from inside on the second bend and slowly wore down
the final furlong. COOL AMBITION chased from outside, was four then five wide taking the second turn and ran evenly the last eighth. GARRISON
COMMANDER displayed brief speed from outside, did not stay close on the second bend and gave way the final two furlongs. CITY POSITION gradually
retreated just off the rail on the backstretch, gave way on the second turn, angled out upper stretch and had little to offer. SEA OF MAKEBELIEVE faded
from inside on the backstretch.

Footnotes
STAR MAGNA rated on the front end from outside, moved clear on the bend, floated out some entering the lane, was under a steady drive and held off
SEATTLE TRAIN. The latter, settled in midpack on the backstretch, was three to five wide taking the turn, rallied belatedly in the stretch but caught
PRECIOUS KOWGIRL for second. PRECIOUS KOWGIRL prominent from the beginning, was three then four wide through the bend, took over second
upper stretch but leveled off the late going. TRYST CAT displayed early speed inside STAR MAGNA, did not keep up on the turn, floated out behind the
latter for the stretch run and slowly yielded. SEE GRACE FLY BY a step slow at the break, advanced to contention from inside, was just off rail taking the
bend and ran evenly through the lane. KINGSBURY DREAM failed to keep up three then four wide taking the turn and only improved position in the stretch
without threatening. MCKINLI'SBABYBLUES failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. SING KITTY SING was not a factor in a wide trip. ICE ATTACK
showed little.
