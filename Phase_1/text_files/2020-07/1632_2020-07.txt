Footnotes
GAROPPOLO hustled from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command near the sixteenth marker, then inched away in the late stages to prevail. WINFROMWITHIN hustled from the gate, chased along the inside
coaxed along from the get go, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out near the eighth pole and kicked on belatedly to just get up in the final
jumps for the place honors. BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL brushed the near side stall at the start, came under coaxing to duel from the three path with
INDOCTRINATE to his inside, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the front, got collared a sixteenth from home and kept on
to preserve the show honors. INDOCTRINATE struck the near side stall at the start and came under coaxing to duel inside of the aforementioned foe, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. EXPLAIN got paused in tight just off the heels of rivals shortly after the
start, chased greenly three wide before settling into stride near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an
impact. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) coaxed from the start, chased five wide through the turn urged along from the three-eighths, spun three to four wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BLUE ATLAS strung out four wide on the chute, appeared keen stepping onto the backstretch, settled down a bit afterwards as well as one path closer to
the rail by half mile pole, was patiently ridden keeping an eye during the run around the far turn, got cued angling five wide into the lane, clawed its way
towards the front end, saw a duel with BEACH DREAMING get ignited by the beginning of the final furlong, bested that opponent then edged away in the
final seventy yards. BEACH DREAMING parked out five wide early, was successfully maneuvered a few paths inward after departing the chute, travelled
three wide on the second bend, swung into action by getting roused four wide into the lane, wore down TAKE CHARGE TINA at the furlong grounds to lead
by a slim margin, but with the top one bearing down hard one path farther to the outside, vied with vigour only to relinquish nevertheless, had enough left at
the end to preserve the place. ANNIE ROCKS raced in path three for a good portion of the trip leading up to the backstretch, pursued the front runners from
the two path, in between rivals for a spell, on the far turn, went three wide into the lane, straightened away and rallied for the show. TAKE CHARGE TINA
was rated along from path two prompting the pace for over three-quarters, challenged in earnest heading onto the top of the lane, gained the advantage,
albeit narrowly, was overhauled by the top twosome a short distance from the eighth pole, missed the show while weakening. FACTORING vied for control
from along the inside route, matched up with TAKE CHARGE TINA to her outside, showed the way, pulling a bit on the left, got set down when put to the
test turning into the lane, yielded, then steadily backed away. COBRA SOPHIE rode the rail for the first six furlongs, was taken hold getting mildly shuffled
late on the backstretch while OFFLEE IRISH was attempting to tuck along the rail herself, slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, made it into the
stretch, fanned out into path six during the ensuing furlong, failed to make any headway. OFFLEE IRISH reserved raced two wide in midpack, was
heck-bent to take up residence along the rail as the half was being reeled, finally achieving the goal a sixteenth down the road, completed the trip to the
quarter pole and folded.

TIPLE (IRE) away in good order, took up residence at the back of the pack, flashed interest as the half was being completed, was put to a ride fanning out
towards path six from the head of the stretch to the eighth pole, burst upon that station with a full head of steam, wrested away the advantage for a good a
sixteenth later, then dug in well in the final stages to preserve the decision. KEOTA tracked the pace from just off the rail, got turned loose for the drive
home, was maneuvered into path five for racing clearance, rallied with willingness down the center of the course but was staved off. JADES GELLY staked
OVERTIME OLIVIA from the pocket, shifted into the two path for the drive home, wrested away command soon afterwards, began the last eighth under
siege from a slew of foes to the outside, held out for another sixteenth, then stayed on for the show. GLORIOUSLY pursued the front runners from the two
path, arrived at the end of the bend, was gradually worked into the four path during the first half of the stretch run, had room with which to rally in the final
furlong but only went fairly evenly. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS remained along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, was steadied when in a
bit midpoint on the turn, got going in short order, was being strongly hand ridden cutting the corner into the lane, inched her way towards path two, threaded
her way between rivals in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, ventured onward with a mild rally. JEN'S BATTLE stalked the pacesetter from the two path, was
more in path three getting roused into the stretch, put in her bid until the sixteenth pole before weakening. CAPE COD DIVA cut over to the rail, bided time
making her way around the bend, was steered out six wide from upper to midlane, made no headway. SEA SPARKLE three wide onto the turn, went five
wide exiting it, gave way. OVERTIME OLIVIA spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, showed the way loosely pressed for the opening half, relinquished
readily in upper stretch then steadily backed away.

REED KAN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, went
on through a clear rail at the quarter pole to seize command straightened away for home, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. TOPPER T chased three
to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. PREAMBLE four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home and offered up a mild bid. SEANOW pressed the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. ARISTOCRATIC hustled from the gate, showed the way three then two
wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths and under pressure the whole way from SEANOW to the outside, cornered just off the inside for home displaced
from the front, weakened in the late going. SEETHISQUICK five then four wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch, made
no impact. SPOKANE EAGLE chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from midway, went
five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SPICE IS NICE bobbled springing from the starting gate, moved up gradually towards SAY MOI, hitching up as the first fraction was being finalized, rated
along two wide attending that opponent all the way to the end of the bend, was lightly hand ridden striking the front end during the opening phases of the
stretch run, was deep into the furlong grounds when asked for more, offered up the desired response and kicked clear. SAY MOI retained the advantage
after out-breaking the field, cut over to the inside, was held in reserve showing the way, shadowed by the winner one path farther to her outside, continued
along under the same set-up all the way to the end of the bend, got set down coming up to the quarter pole, was reeled in by the more confidently-ridden
winner, had no difficulty salvaging second. OVERJOYED took up the chase along the inside route, was put to a hand ride travelling around the bend, fanned
out into path four from upper to midstretch becoming the widest of all, proved no match. TONAL VISION strung out three wide on the turn, was in the same
path spinning into the lane, gave way. BACHELOR'S BAIT spotted at a slight distance from off the rail, drafted behind SAY MOI all the way to upper stretch,
backed away when no longer able to keep pace. SUPER TWENTY SEVEN two wide until the quarter pole, displayed no speed.

Footnotes
FRACTORZATION established the front and showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch under pressure from
MAGNOLIA'S LADY to the inside, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home,
shied out slightly under a near sided stick three-sixteenths out, continued under that near sided stick shying once more to force her main danger to alter out
just off her heels a furlong from home, then shied a third time once again under a near sided stick forcing SNICKET to be taken in hand and altered out near
the sixteenth marker and held safe to the wire. SNICKET three then two wide in pursuit from just off the top pair, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied and had her momentum broken when shying very slightly at the three-sixteenths when the aforementioned foe
shied out under a near sided stick herding her, ran on to nearly latch on and was again herded out a furlong from home this time a path or two, dug in under
a drive to nearly latch on once more when forced to be steadied and altered a sixteenth from home as FRACTORIZATION came out a third time under a
near sided stick, got hand ridden to the finish to be along second best having had her momentum paused and interrupted three times through to the finish.
MAGNOLIA'S LADY pressed the pace along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages
while clear for the show honors. PURE BODE broke in at the start bumping MIA BEA STAR, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and offered up a mild bid. BANKERS BEAST chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the stretch. MIA BEA STAR bumped at the start by PURE BOD, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. BIG AL'S GAL chased two to three wide under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TUCK IN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. LEMONCELLA three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled four
wide into upper stretch and tired. ARRIETTY chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, went two to three wide for home, tired. There was
a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the top two finishers before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
YANKEE DIVISION stalked the pacesetter towards the three path, crept up late on the turn, appeared to poke a head down in front turning into the lane,
kicked clear when asked for more a few jumps later, then kept clear, perhaps aided by BOURBON BAY seemingly having not switched leads down the lane.
BOURBON BAY needed no encouragement powering his way into the pocket during the opening phases, kept an eye on the front runners,saw the pilot
resort to some light hand urging on the turn, angled three wide into the lane and took off in earnest, made no headway in the final furlong, appearing to go
about it on the wrong lead. DANNY CALIFORNIA took up the chase from the three path, got driven out towards path five for the drive home, inched up,
came out a bit after some left side pressure in the general area of the sixteenth pole, trudged onward, fell short of snagging away the place. VINTAGE
HOLLYWOOD kept control after breaking on top, carved out the pace from slightly off the rail, tailed by the winner from the outside, emerged from the
quarter pole with the nemesis clutching a slim advantage, vied for another furlong before weakening. DANCERS FOR TOKEN got moved into the two path
after the start, was rank early on the backstretch, settled down and resumed its pursuit from midpack, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail,
had no response. RUN FOR BOSTON departed the backstretch from the two path, shifted inward in time to cut the corner into the stretch, backed away.
SIX PERCENT sighted pulling early on the backstretch, eyed the front runners from near the inside route, tipped out into the two path entering the stretch,
came up empty. FOREVER WICKED hit the gate after getting off in a tangle, got guided over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, went
four wide into the lane, wound up trailing throughout.

Footnotes
OUR TROUBADOUR off the inside throughout, scurried into contention by unleashing a three wide run from the three-eighths pole, maintained the
momentum angling approximately six wide for clearance once into the stretch, closed in readily on the one to catch, charged to the front end just beyond the
eighth pole and kicked clear. ADIOS AMIGOS took up the chase three wide, got sent out wider and wider until in the neighborhood of path seven, rallied for
the place. LORCAN angled sharply over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, paused behind some traffic as the half was being
completed, idled in the same predicament tipping into path three during the opening stages of the stretch run, then got maneuvered a second time, this time
towards path seven in the final furlong, closed in to secure the show. MOMMIE'S JEWEL stalked the pace from path two in midpack, swung out five wide for
the drive home, got outfinished in the final furlong. FIVESTAR BANDIT two wide onto the turn, went four wide exiting it, gained some ground, with only a
minor slice of the pot to show for it. J'S WARRIOR pulled away from any potential contact with another after coming out with his initial step, assumed
control, cut the pace spotted on inside route on a loosely-contested lead, got let out heading home, was reeled in with slightly under an eighth to go, backed
away. LOVE CODE sighted along the rail on the turn, came up empty after cutting the corner into the stretch. JET FOR ANDY two wide on the turn, had no
response. SHANDIAN forwardly placed, shifted closer to the rail at the top of bend and resumed its pursuit of the leader stationed now in path two, kept at it
before giving way in the last eighth. DETERMINED ONE strung out three wide on the turn, had no rally. RAPIDE FRANEY away a length the tardiest after
making contact with the left side of the gate, got guided over to the rail by the end of the backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail. BEYOND THE
STARS hustled from the get-go, chased the pacesetter from path two on the backstretch, dove over to the rail after the first fraction had been set, was still
being asked feverishly afterwards, folded after going a half.
