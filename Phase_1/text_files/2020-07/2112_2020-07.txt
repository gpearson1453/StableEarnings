Footnotes
FAST CAR settled towards the back of the pack after field departed the flag, tucked into the two path prior to arriving at the first of four turns, remained well
reserved, tipped to the outside and into the three path on the third bend, began to close the gap, saw the leader attempt to shake free coming up the final
hurdle, but hitched up to that opponent nevertheless by the beginning of the run around the final bend, kept the pressure on. was given his cue challenging
in earnest entering the stretch, emerged at the furlong marker in charge, steadily extended the margin. GLOBAL FREEDOM (GB) mostly along the inside
route, picked up interest after clearing the penultimate fence, exchanged a few bumps with his stablemate scooting by as the twosome approaching the next
one, swung into the lane slightly wider, proved no match rallying for second. ANTICIPATING established the top in short order, was rated along cutting the
pace while taking the inside route, edged away to his largest advantage during the journey between the last two jumps, had the winner draw up anyway, got
put to the test by FAST CAR as they turned home, relinquished, then weakened into the show slot. GAYE BREEZE (IRE) strung out three wide on the
opening bend, was closer to the inside thereafter, lacked the necessary response. WHITMAN'S POETRY prompted the pace from path two until the end of
the backstretch the second time, gave way. CRITICAL DATA (IRE) faltered after undergoing a ground-saving trip. EMERALD ROCKET (IRE) along the
outside until the quarter pole, travelled three wide on the first and third turns, came under a drive leaving the half mile pole, cut the corner into the stretch
and backed away. SIXTY FIVE (FR) unhurried two wide early, was sent over to the inside route prior to crossing the finish line the second time, bumped
losing position to his stablemate coming up to the eighth hurdle, fell back readily losing interest, then was allowed to fade away down the stretch.

Footnotes
WHISTLINGINTHEDARK coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside in aim of the front early on before knocking heads briefly nearing the turn, took over
command at the seven-sixteenths, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe
to prevail. BIG AL'S GAL chased along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the aforementioned foe and was paused briefly before being
roused at the three-sixteenths but unable to tip out until the eighth pole, did so to the two path at that station and offered up a mild bid for the place honors.
BELLEZA struck the off side stall at the start, then bumped QUEENTIGUA, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tipped
to the four path near the half mile pole, went four wide through the turn coming under light coaxing before being let out swinging three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to secure the show honors. QUEENTIGUA bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. WHIPPY CREAM broke in at
the start brushing MISS ROSS, led early on four paths off the inside before dueling with WHISTLINGINTHEDARK to her inside now tucked to the three path
through the turn, came under urging five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SANDER'S
EMPIRE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position with some
late interest. MISS ROSS broke in at the start and pinched back CROSS KEYS and IRENA N ELLA against pressure inside, chased five then four wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and weakened. CROSS KEYS got bumped at the start by MISS ROSS and was
pinched back, chased four to five wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, went five wide for home and made no impact. IRENA N ELLA pinched at the
start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got ridden along with five-sixteenths remaining, cut the corner into upper stretch
and tired.

FIVE ALARM ROBIN was asked to go to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, set the pace while well rated on the inside,
responded well when asked at the top of the stretch, came under a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, swapped back to her inside lead at the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. TRADEABLE bumped with a foe into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, was forwardly placed on the
outside, came under urging while three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under a drive then pursued the winner under the whip and finished
willingly for the place while unable to impact the winner. MAKE OR BREAK bumped with a rival into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, stalked the
pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, came under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong,
swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole then was given one crack of a right-handed whip before being placed under a strong hand ride to the
wire while able to get the show. SKY KITTEN raced inside on the first turn, settled towards the front while saving ground, was asked with three furlongs to
run, came off the rail into the stretch, moved out more near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. POSITIVE SKEW angled in at the rear of the
field, raced inside early on the first turn then moved to the two path, settled at the rear, went around most of the far turn in the two path, shifted out late on
that bend while roused then came four wide into the stretch, moved out outside the three-sixteenths, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong
marker and improved position. GEA was taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, traveled three wide on the far
turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. STORMY DERBY DAY settled towards the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the far
turn, moved off the rail late on that bend then came three wide into the stretch, shifted out some under a drive around the three-sixteenths, drifted in at the
sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. SUPER CUTE raced inside to the two path on the first turn, settled off the pace, rounded the far turn inside to the two
path, was roused at the five-sixteenths, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. QUASAR went three wide on the first turn,
settled towards the back on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 18 Feet) FINAL TIME WAS ADJUSTED

Footnotes
FIRST LINE attained a prominent position after bobbling at the break, prompted HOMETOWN from the two path, kept the pressure on even as the tempo
picked up a few ticks after the half been off reeled, turned for home directly abreast of the nemesis, got roused right around the three-sixteenths pole, subtly
shifted to the rail, putting HOMETOWN into a tighter fit along the inside route, ventured onward eye to eye with that foe and gamely got the job done.
HOMETOWN gained the top shortly after the field had been sent off and running, cut over to the rail, showed the way feeling the presence of the eventual
winner all the while, was the first to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring past the the five-sixteenths pole, stepped into the stretch still locked up
with the top one, proved to be a stubborn one to the end but was ultimately denied. ASHIHAM pursued the pace from the two path, between opponents for
much of the trip leading up to the half mile pole, tucked along the rail at the station, got cued up swinging back to the outside for the drive, completing the
maneuver in the neighborhood of path three, proved no match, despite closing the gap in the final furlong. LUCKY ASSET guided over to the rail, rode it for
over three-quarters, got asked for more in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, was worked into the four path from upper to midstretch, made no
impact. AJHAR strung out three wide on the both turns, was sighted pulling on the bit while travelling on the first one, fanned out five wide during the initial
portion of the stretch, lacked the needed response. VICARAGE three wide on the turns, was slightly closer to the rail drafting behind some cover on the
backstretch, stepped into the stretch, had no rally. ZUZUDINI sent over to the rail, abandoned it for the two path nearing the conclusion of the backstretch,
angled four wide into the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
CLASSIC LADY hard held along the inside, grew a bit rank under restraint seven furlongs from home into the first turn, tracked the pace along the inside in
closest aim of the leader remaining under firm hands down the backstretch and into the far turn, got given a notch five-sixteenths out, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, had WAR CANOE emerge to the outside and was roused at the three-sixteenths, rallied to poke a head in front a furlong out, dug in
dueling to the finish with his stablemate to his outside and gamely prevailed at the end. WAR CANOE saved ground in reserve near the rear of the field
through the opening bend and down the backstretch, tipped out three wide at the seven-sixteenths for the run around the far turn, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, cornered three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out and was heads apart for command at the eighth
pole, dug in knocking heads with the aforementioned foe through to the finish defiant but was ultimately bested at the end. WEGETSDAMUNNYS hesitated
at the start leaving the gate two beats after the field and lunged when she did so conceding five lengths to the front that she then made up in quick order as
the front took hard hold and slowed the pace down considerably, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung
three wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to close in and just get her head on the wire for the show honors. VORTEX ROAD brushed the off
side stall door at the start, established the front shortly after and crossed to show the way rated under a firm hold just off the inside through the first turn
before tucking to the rail into the backstretch, remained on hold sauntering out to a safe lead, came under light coaxing just past the five-sixteenths as the
field began to take closer order, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat from a pair and relented a furlong out, then weakened in the late
stages. NIKO'S DREAM tracked the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild bid but was outkicked. WISH UPON saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, went just off the inside into upper
stretch, angled to the inside at the three-sixteenths and offered no response.

PETE'S PLAY CALL came away in good order, was well placed in second position down the backstretch, gained in the two path on the turn, made a bid
passing the five-sixteenths then took the lead approaching the quarter-pole, shook clear into upper stretch then was put to a right-handed whip, switched to
a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. LONE ROCK settled comfortably
off the pace, came under some urging late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch
in the two path, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong, gained determinedly into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the place.
CREATIVE STYLE settled well off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the turn, moved out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to
a right-handed whip near the furlong marker and finished with good energy to safely secure the show. CLENCH was urged along in third position, went three
wide on the turn, came under the whip turning into the stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed response.
AMERICAN POWER bobbled at the start, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive and
failed to threaten. THEBIGFUNDAMENTAL was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to
rally. TOPPER T moved up to take the lead then went clear outside the five-eighths, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat from the winner around
the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to that foe at the quarter-pole and gave way. THE SICARII acted-up just as the gate opened and reared then swerved
in while coming out very slow, spotted the front many lengths, moved in at the back, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the whip and
was no factor. Following a stewards' inquiry into the start, no change was made and THE SICARII was declared a starter.

Footnotes
READYFORPRIMETIME put to an abbreviated brisk hand ride springing from the starting gate, out-sprinted the others for the front end, inched his way over
to the inside, eventually taking up residence along the outer border of the inside route, showed the way, not being heavily pressed, settled in at the
three-sixteenths pole and was given its cue, emerged a sixteenth down the road leading by his largest margin, began to squander it by drifting out, had right
side stick work prove to be futile, kept going well enough long enough to hold sway. BACKTOHISROOTS tracked the winner from the pocket, tipped into the
two path for the drive, gained on the one to catch in the final furlong, aided in part by READYFORPRIMETIME'S wayward ways.. GHOUL (BRZ) the least
impacted of a threesome making some contact with each other at the start, made it over to the inside route by the conclusion of the backstretch, finished off
the run around the bend, fanned out wider and wider from upper to midstretch until six wide, went on to secure the show. SECRETARY AT WAR went over
to the rail coming up to the half mile pole, cut the corner into the lane, made no headway in the final furlong. VICI brushed from both sides in the shadow of
the gate, pursued the pace from the two path on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no solid closing punch. SAYYAAF chased the pace
from path two on the turn, went out four wide for the drive, idled in traffic for a furlong beginning from the general area of the three-sixteenths pole, had room
late only to display no interest. MICK'S STAR stalked the top from path two, between rivals for much of the turn, was already being roused by the
three-eighths pole, shifted out a couple of paths in upper stretch, gave way. MAD MUNNYS took up position in midpack after making light contact with
another right after the field had been sent on its way, entered the turn two to three wide and exiting it by getting sent out seven wide, becoming the widest of
all, lacked a response. KITTEN'S CAT strung out three wide on the bend, angled out into the five path for the drive, backed away.

DANNY CALIFORNIA broke in a step at the start under light coaxing and bumped DANCERS FOR TOKEN, raced three wide through the first turn, settled
just off the pace four paths off the inside down the backstretch, began to advance nearing the half mile pole and tucked three then two wide at that station
engaging the leader into the turn, took over command near the three-eighths, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths under challenge now himself
from the eventual runner up to the outside, spun three wide into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish,
the outcome in no doubt. BLACKJACK DAVEY stumbled at the start, recovered to race just off the inside in closest aim of the leader through the first turn
before taking to the three path down the backstretch, tucked to the two path near the half mile pole and had the aforementioned foe circle him outside and
tuck in front, tipped back out three wide into the far turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and issued a challenge latching on DANNY
CALIFORNIA through the latter portion of the bend and swung four wide for home, got shaken off straightened away for home, proved no match for the top
one while running on to safely secure the place honors. SIX PERCENT just off the inside just off the pace, came under a ride at the three-eighths, angled
three wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. BEBE BANKER bobbled at the break, recovered under light coaxing and established
the front to show the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled and had the eventual winner advance outside issuing a challenge for the front
into the far turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths in response, got displaced from command at the three-eighths, angled out four to five wide into
upper stretch and weakened. MICROSCOPE chased just off the inside, came under coaxing two to three wide at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and made no impact. DANCERS FOR TOKEN bumped at the start by DANNY CALIFORNIA who broke inwards, grew rank under
restraint between foes in the two path when off the heels of a rival through the first turn and into the backstretch, tipped to the three path and settled better
midway, went three to four wide through the far turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. FOREVER
WICKED two then three wide through the first turn, chased four to five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

BREAKING THE RULES saved ground on the first turn, settled well off the pace in third position, was roused in the two path on the far turn, rallied three
wide into the stretch, closed strongly to make a bid under a right-handed whip approaching the furlong marker, battled with MADE YOU LOOK into the final
sixteenth then disposed of that foe and held under strong urging. THERAPIST went around the first turn in the two path, settled well back on the outside,
was urged along in the two path on the far turn then driven three wide into the stretch, moved out under a left-handed whip just inside the three-sixteenths
and finished with good energy to just get the place. DEVAMANI (FR) settled towards the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn, came off
the rail into the stretch, gained into the final furlong and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to get the show. MADE YOU LOOK
rounded the first turn in the two path, settled in second position while well behind the runaway leader, had the rider take a peak behind him at the
five-sixteenths then was asked some, came under stronger encouragement while moving out into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid coming to the furlong
marker, battled with the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. WISSAHICKON traveled around the first turn in the two path,
settled at the rear of the very spread-out field, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, dropped to the rail
around the three-sixteenths, gained into the final furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and missed the superfecta. GIDU (IRE) charged the front of
the stall just as the doors opened then hit the inside of the gate at the start, moved to the front then went clear while tugging hard at the bit, was a bit difficult
to rate while opening up a sizable advantage on the inside, had the rider take a peak behind him coming to the quarter-pole then was asked, came under a
right-handed whip in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong and gave way. Half mile time omitted pending review. (Rail at 18 Feet) Race was hand
timed.

ZERO TO SIXTY away without apparent mishap, settled into the three path before departing the backstretch, kept watch on an ongoing three-way tussle for
the top, flashed some interest coming up to the end of the bend, made it to the three-sixteenths pole and was switched over to stronger handling, narrowed
in so as to challenge in earnest, was the outermost of three contending for the top a sixteenth later, seemingly having the most momentum, appeared to
poke a head down in front in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and edged away. LET THEM EAT CAKE made it onto the inside route approaching the half
mile pole, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners, waited in hand as the run around the bend was being completed, got gradually worked into path
four during the ensuing furlong, displayed willingness rallying for the place. SEQUIN forwardly placed from the get-go, cut over to the rail, vied as the
innermost of three for control, albeit not always versus the same rivals, settled in upper stretch and got asked for more, relinquished to the winner with
approximately a sixteenth to go, weakened late into the show slot. VENUS OYZO got placed along the inside route at the half mile pole, contently brought
up the back of the pack, stepped into the stretch and was maneuvered into path five, rallied well enough to earn the final significant slice of the purse.
MADAM MACLEAN pressed the issue from path two, doing so from between rivals, became unhitched from pace contenders coming up to the sixteenth
marker, then weakened. SPECTACULARSUNRISE appeared keen getting steadied after coming into close proximity to SEVNTEENEIGHTYSEVN late on
the backstretch, got going in a more professional manner pursuing the pace two wide on the turn, was steered out into path five from upper to midstretch,
made no impact. SEVNTEENEIGHTYSEVN stalked the front runners two wide from between rivals on the turn, stepped into the lane, lacked the needed
response. MUMBAI forced the issue from path three as the widest of a trio to upper stretch before giving way. ZACCAPA (FR) pocketed within range of a
contested pace, got roused springing from the five-sixteenths pole, went into the lane and faltered.
