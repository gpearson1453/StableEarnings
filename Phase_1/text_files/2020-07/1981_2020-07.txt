Footnotes
SNAP DECISION struggled over fence one while near a stumbling rival upon landing, was reserved under restraint in the back half of the field, was roused
into upper stretch, dropped in entering the final furlong and closed well to win going away. GALWAY KID (IRE) jumped well while traveling mostly in the two
path, tracked the leader around the final turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, battled on even terms for the lead into the final sixteenth and was
out-kicked but earned the place. BODES WELL (IRE) set the clear pace while jumping well, was asked on the final turn, responded well under heavy
pressure in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished then missed the place while clear for the show. FAMILY TREE
(GB) was reserved while saving ground, dropped back a bit in tight quarters entering turn two, continued to save ground through the final bend, angled out
near the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. BELISARIUS (IRE) struggled over fence one at the rear, settled towards the back, was urged along on
the final turn and failed to rally. ZANZI WIN (FR) hit fence one with his forelegs then stumbled badly behind while landing, settled towards the rear while
jumping relatively okay thereafter, came under urging just after clearing fence eight and failed to threaten. CITY DREAMER (IRE) had the saddle slip down
the backstretch for the first time and left the course after clearing fence four.

Footnotes
WICKSTERS DREAM got set up in the pocket, tracked the front runners within striking distance, got set down coming up to the quarter pole, swung out
approximately three wide into the lane, disdained an opening between the ones to catch for the next several jumps, choosing instead to draft behind the
BERNIN' THRU GOLD, tipped towards path four to be outside of that one then kicked into her best stride, began the final furlong looming boldly with
momentum, out-fought a pair of opponents to her left during the ensuing sixteenth to take over, drew clear smartly. BRAZEN put to a brisk hand ride after
coming in with her initial step and shouldering BOX OF CHOCOLATES, saw the pilot resort to a lighter hand ride after establishing the top, led the
competition primarily from the two path on the backstretch, cut over to the rail at the top of the turn, faced pressure from BERNIN' THRU GOLD one path
farther off the inside, made it onto the top of the lane and got set down, began the last eighth desperately clinging to a narrow advantage, but now having
been forced to defend it against the eventual winner too, relinquished a sixteenth down the road, kept going well to save second. BERNIN' THRU GOLD
along the outside throughout, forced the issue, three wide early, and them from the two path on the bend, was in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole when
put to a drive, vied for control from between the top twosome from midlane to around the sixteenth marker, fought onward but missed the place. BOX OF
CHOCOLATES chased the pace from the inside route on the backstretch, got gradually worked into the two path after stepping onto the turn, completed the
half, angled into path four from upper to midlane, lacked the necessary response. STAR OF THE WEST strung out mostly three wide om the turn, shifted
inward during the early stages of the stretch run, came up empty. PASSCODE three wide entering the turn, fanned out into path five from upper stretch to
the eighth pole, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
CROSS BORDER broke out at the start brushing and bumping THE J Y, tipped off the inside just after the start to track the top pair three then two wide
through the opening bend, settled three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked briefly to the two path into the far turn before tipping out to the
three path once more three furlongs from home, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch, got roused
straightened away and rallied to take over command just inside the three-sixteenths, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. RAPT saved ground at the tail
of the compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors in the final jump
to the wire. BLEWITT established the front and showed the way just off the inside under rating through sensible splits under attendance to the outside from
THE J Y but facing no pressure saved from the presence of that rival, tucked inside through the far turn and came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late stages getting nailed
on the line for the place honors. THE J Y brushed and bumped at the start by CROSS BORDER who broke outwards, attended the leader from the outside
three then two wide placed to coaxing five-sixteenths out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch between foes, then weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
YANKEE EMPIRE stalked the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was
asked at the top of the stretch then shook clear at the three-sixteenths, drifted out between the eighth-pole and the sixteenth-pole then held under a
right-handed whip. LOST IN ROME was reserved on the far outside, tucked into the three path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then put to
the whip while four wide into the stretch, chased the winner on the outside in the drive and was outfinished while narrowly able to get the place.
BREITHORN was hustled from the start then taken in hand, steadied while pinched back nearing the nine-sixteenths, raced under restraint while off heels
into the turn, saved ground on that bend, was roused while shifting three wide into the stretch, came under a right-handed whip outside the furlong marker
then dropped in a path and finished with good courage to just miss the place while able to get the show. TENDERFOOT settled off the pace, was asked in
the two path on the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend then was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. KICKIN' KIRBY bumped
lightly with foes on both sides at the start, showed speed on the inside of a rival, was carried in nearing the nine-sixteenths then well placed just off the pace,
saved ground on the turn, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner while crowded against the rail into upper stretch, altered outside
despite room along the rail at the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. BREES BAYOU broke in and bumped lightly with a rival, went to the
front, dropped in nearing the nine-sixteenths, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner outside the
quarter-pole and gave way. VERIFY bumped lightly with a rival at the start then was asked, settled at the rear, started the turn in the two path, shifted three
wide at the five-sixteenths then four wide outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MAXWELL ESQUIRE away without apparent mishap, got guided over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, tracked the pace towards
the back of the pack, swung into action by swinging out five wide during the initial portion of the stretch, straightened away and closed in on the one to catch
with good energy, maintained that burst of speed, striking the front end about a sixteenth later, shook free, crossing the wire under a hand drive. LUNA'S IN
CHARGE worked out a tuck in the two path in time for the beginning of the run around the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, becoming
the widest of all, had a good finish down the center of the course to garner the place. CRACK SHOT established the top in short order, was moved over to
the rail, showed the way while pulling a bit on the bit early, settled in at the three-sixteenths pole and got set down, came under aim by the winner a few
strides later, held out for another sixteenth, relinquished then weakened into the show slot. THREE JOKERS went onto the inside route after making slight
contact with GO RUDY GO at the start, kept watch on the leader, was being urged along cutting the corner into the lane, got outfinished. ZELENKA took up
the chase three wide, was one path farther off the rail challenging in upper stretch, failed to fire appreciably. WILD WILLIAM stalked the pace from the two
path, turned into the lane slightly nearer the rail, idled behind a hole that was not of the optimal size for use, checked when it clamped down leaving the
eighth pole, tipped wider and wider chasing a wall afterwards, never having been fully asked. GO RUDY GO prompted the pace from the two path, rated
along after brushing with THREE JOKERS, came under a ride spinning into the lane, gave way.

MANIFEST DESTINY prompted the pace along the inside, got shaken off a bit into the far turn when patiently handled before coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch scraping the paint and under an off sided stick, rallied up the inside to take command near the eighth pole,
inched away briefly before coming under growing late threat and held gamely to the wire to prevail. JUST RIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased three wide
in aim of the front, advanced on the leader in tandem with THESIS to his outside and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to tepidly threaten late but was ultimately repelled to the finish. SUMMER BOURBON four wide in pursuit,
tucked three wide briefly at the three-eighths when placed to coaxing, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors.
DURKIN'S CALL broke in at the start bumping PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the last major share. BRONX
BOMBER broke in at the start brushing the near side stall while under coaxing, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from
MANIFEST DESTINY to the inside early on, shook away from that rival who was patiently handled into the turn and was engaged outside through the bend
by a pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat straightened away and was displaced near the
eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. O SHEA CAN U SEE chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and made no impact. PLAYTHATFUNNYMUSIC bumped at the start by DURKIN'S CALL who broke inwards, chased just off the inside under
a ride from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. THESIS broke out at the start and was corrected, raced five
then four paths off the inside in range of the front, advanced in tandem with JUST RIGHT through the turn on the front coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide for home and tired.

upper stretch, switched to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. GAELIC GOLD was
taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, raced inside for most of the far turn then shifted to the two path,
was roused while three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker, shifted further out late and finished with good energy to just
get the show. DANCING KIKI went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside while given cover behind the leaders, went around
the far turn in the two path, was asked outside the quarter-pole then shifted three wide into the stretch, bumped lightly with a foe outside the three-sixteenths
while making a bid, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the show. TWO CENT TOOTSIE was hustled from the start
then taken in hand early, raced just off the pace while rated on the inside, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole then bumped lightly with a foe
outside the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong and weakened. MADISON PARC was taken under a snug hold early, saved ground on the first
turn, settled down the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. SAINTE MERE EGLISE

towards the back, went three wide on the far turn while roused, swung six wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. MIA BEA STAR went
around the first turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, dropped
back under a drive in upper stretch and gave way. RUNNING ON ENTRY was antsy in the gate as the latch sprung, went around the first turn in the two

Footnotes
COLONEL LIAM moved closer to the rail approaching the end of the homestretch, was well rated towards the two path keeping an eye on the front runners,
ventured onward for three-quarters under the same set up, was asked to pick it up leaving the five-sixteenths pole, made it into the stretch, got maneuvered
four wide for better racing room, kicked in, exploding on the scene at the eighth pole with strong momentum, out-fought a pair of opponents to the left to
cement himself to the top, then kicked clear under good handling. LA HARA (IRE) bobbled to the outside as the field was being sent off and running,
stepped onto the clubhouse turn stationed in the four path, sped past SMILE BRYAN and shifted one path closer to the rail, was rated along within striking
distance, flashed some interest after crossing the midway point of the far turn, hitched up to the front runners a few strides later, settled into upper stretch
and was fed his cue, emerged at the eighth pole still involved in a three-way scramble for the lead, but now forced to do so from between rivals, not as the
widest of three as before, saw the winner take charge with approximately a sixteenth to go, stayed on to salvage second. JUNKANOO unhurried taking up
the chase from the two path, completed six furlongs and got cued up for the drive home, made his way into the four path, displayed some late foot to be
along for the show. WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO was put to a good hold prompting the pace from the two path, saw the second place finisher add itself to the
pace picture as the third fraction was being finalized, turned into the lane as the pace dispute intensified, did battle from between rivals from upper stretch to
the furlong grounds before becoming the innermost of three vying for the lead for another sixteenth, weakened late. GAUGUIN (GER) dove to the rail, took it
until a short distance from the quarter pole, angled two wide into the stretch, tipped a one wider later on, made no impact. SMILE BRYAN strung out three
wide on both turns, got sent out five wide once into the stretch, gave way. SOUTHERN BRIDGE grabbed the top shortly after the start, was rated along the
inside route cutting the pace, with WILD MEDAGLIAD'ORO in accompaniment from the outside, was forced to fend yet another when LA HARA ranged up
at the five-sixteenths pole, got asked for more, backed away stayed in contention until the furlong grounds before backing away..

Footnotes
SINGULAR SENSATION broke in at the start brushing with ELOQUENT SPEAKER, chased two then three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked back to
the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide for home, dug in under a drive rallying to take command a
sixteenth out, inched away and was geared down near the finish. SHARP STARR was placed under restraint and grew a bit rank nearing the opening bend
as rivals crossed in front, raced along the inside through that first turn unsettled and took to the two path down the backstretch, pulled on the bit under
restraint into the far turn, tipped out three wide at the three-eighths placed to coaxing, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick
to close in late and secure the place honors. ELOQUENT SPEAKER stumbled at the break and was brushed by SINGULAR SENSATION, and in turn
squeezed out the lane of PRINCESS PINKY in tandem with FIGHT ON LUCY, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared near the
sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages. COURAGEOUS GIRL coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths,
cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened. LEM ME HAVE IT chased two to three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. FIGHT ON LUCY two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. PRINCESS PINKY squeezed between foes at the start, chased three to four wide coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths,
continued three to four wide into upper stretch and was eased.

Footnotes
MANI PEDI was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, made a bid
between horses nearing the furlong marker and proved best in the final sixteenth under strong urging. ADRIATIC HOLIDAY settled off the early pace,
moved closer in hand with five furlongs to run, raced inside early on the turn, shifted two then three wide while asked later on that bend then came five wide
into the stretch, chased outside in the drive and finished willingly for the place. MEBS WEB was forwardly placed on the outside, came under urging while
four wide on the turn then chased, made a bid coming to the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth
and was outfinished while able to get the show. CENTRAL PERK was sent hard to the lead, set the pace through tepid fractions, was urged along while
inside on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip, battled under a drive into the final furlong, lost the lead shortly thereafter and was outfinished then
lost the show. LOTTIE'S MIZZION settled well back in the field, went three wide early on the turn, moved to four wide around the five-sixteenths then five
wide shortly thereafter, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. GRINGOTTS bobbled at the start and was off a step slow,
raced near the back under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, shifted
further out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. CHOOSE HAPPINESS brushed with a rival shortly after the start, was urged along near the
middle of the field, dropped back under urging while four then three wide on the turn and failed to respond. MOPOLKA broke in and bumped with a rival,
pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. ASHIKA broke a step slow, was
urged along while well behind, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. CENTRAL CAPITAL was bumped at the start, raced on the outside while ridden
along, was hard ridden in the five path on the turn and had nothing left. FLATTERING EYES brushed with a foe just after the start, was urged along off the
pace, dropped back while three then two wide on the turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. MICROGRAM dropped back while ridden along, went
three then four wide on the turn and also faltered then was eased but walked off. HAPPY HILL LIL brushed with foes just after the start, pressed the pace
into the turn and retreated then was also eased but walked off.
