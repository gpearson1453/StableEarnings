CHARLIE'S GAME stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. DOCTOR
ROBERT showed speed from the outside and set the pace, had the lead on the far turn but failed to hold. SOUL N' SPIRIT was in touch and roused on the
far turn but was no real threat. STROLLING POSSE was in range, raced evenly on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch bested the
rest. TEXAS BOY was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was never in contention. WHATSONEMORE showed no speed, chased on the far
turn and dropped back though the stretch.

ROMANTIC GIZMO set the pace, took command turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. KINZUA stalked the early leaders
and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. STELLATARA showed no speed and had a
mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. READY AND WILLING forced the early pace but lost ground on the turn
and was empty. WEDDING RING was in touch early and hustled along on the turn but was not a factor.

ONE FOR NICKI was in touch, had a slim lead on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. OBLIVIOUSLY was
unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. MARVEL was off the pace, moved up on the far turn
and from the six path at the top of the stretch gained gradually. EINSTEIN'S BABE stalked the early leaders, raced evenly on the far turn and vied through
the stretch but needed more. HOT COPY had no speed, saved ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch passed tired foes.
KLASSY DELIGHT set a pressured pace but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. TALKING LEAVES showed speed from the inside but lost ground
on the far turn and was empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON OBLIVIOUSLY AGAINST ONE FOR NICKI FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE

MIDNITE SNACKATTAK was hustled early, had a slim lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task.
LEWNSKYSWILDAFFAIR was in touch, roused on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. HONDURAS showed speed
from the outside and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. CHILLING SECRET was in range and
raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. QUALITY BREW was well back, trailed the field throughout and was
never a threat. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

UNO CHAMP was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and drew clear late. PRECIOUS BADGE had no speed, moved up on the far turn and had
the lead from the five path in mid stretch but failed to hold. FIRST CRUSADER stalked the early leader and had the lead on the far turn but from the four
path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. SPINOS set the pace but was headed on the far turn and gave way. FLAMBORO JEWEL was off the pace, in
tight on the far turn and had no rally. ALMOST DANCER was up close but chased on the far turn and came up empty. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER
ON FLAMBORO JEWEL AGAINST BOTH UNO CHAMP AND PRECIOUS BADGE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FAR TURN WAS
NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BAKERSFIELD was away alertly and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. CUATTHEFINISHLINE showed speed from the
inside and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. OMAR was in mid pack, saved ground on
the turn and was up for show. BALDUR was in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. BRADY O'BRADY
was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. UNCLE LOU was off the pace and had a mild
gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. MASTER CONNOR had no speed and showed little in a dull effort. TOP
HAT TRICK was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.

MEET YOU AT HOME was in touch, raced evenly from the inside on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch proved best. I MISS YOU was in range,
roused on the far turn and vied from the five path at the top of the stretch but just missed. GYPSY JAZZ forced the pace and dueled on the far turn but from
the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. MEDDYBEMPS had no speed, was hustled along on the far turn and gained gradually through the
stretch. ANNIE O'SCHILLER set a pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way in mid stretch. GLORIOUS FREEDOM was off the
pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. GINGER CANDY was off slow and saved ground on the
