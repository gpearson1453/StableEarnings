Footnotes
THIS TIME LUCKY vied inside for the early lead, responded gamely to challenge entering the lane, edged away from IRISH TRICK and held firm. IRISH
TRICK chased the pacesetters, came three wide into the lane to challenge the leaders, loomed boldly into the stretch but needed more. LANNY MAC trailed
the field into the turn, rallied steadily outside through the lane and was along in time for show honors. RYANWATER allowed to settle early, rallied mildly
through the stretch inside and was edged out late. DEVILS COMMAND settled mid pack early and lacked a rally through the drive. ROLL THE STONE
prompted the pace from the two path, was unable to move on with rivals leaving the final turn and gave way. TRADER LYNN broke slow, advanced
gradually along the rail and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NU LEGACY contested the pace from the rail, dueled inside of ROX STAR WILDCAT through the turn, shook free into the lane then edged away under
pressure. LIL OL FLATTER hopped then was brushed leaving the gate, stalked the pace three wide, rallied into the stretch moving up menacingly but was
unable to get by the winner and just held for place. REBATE SHOP broke outward, rated off the pace inside, rallied mildly through the stretch but was
unable to improve contending position through the drive. A FLEETING FEATHER raced wide in the opening stages, angled towards the rail entering the first
turn, raced wide into the lane and closed willingly late. ROX STAR WILDCAT quickly went to the front, contended the pace through the turn and had nothing
left in reserve for the drive. FLASHY SISTER squeezed away, chased through the backstretch and tired. RASCAL LAKE broke inward, raced four wide
entering the turn and faded gradually.

Footnotes
LITTLE BRIAN allowed to settle away from the gate, was never far back outside, closed determinedly under steady urging and was up deep stretch. STAR
CZAR sat in striking position racing three to four wide, rallied outside into the stretch and was out finished. SILENT EMISSARY sat mid pack outside, took
closer order in the turn then swung out into the lane and closed well for show honors. HORST settled in range between rivals, dropped back through the turn
and offered a belated rallied just missing out for show. TRIAL BY NITE prompted the pace along the rail, moved up alongside the leader entering the turn
and was unable to sustain the bid that was needed into the stretch. REMARKABLE VINTAGE last one away from the gate, saved ground inside, lodged a
mild bid then lacked running room mid stretch and yielded. CATCH ME IF U CAN hustled to the front, contended through the turn, had nothing left in reserve
for the drive and stopped.

INTENT TO STRIKE contested the early pace from the rail, showed the way leaving the backstretch, responded willingly from looming threat from WYE
CROSS into the lane then widened into the drive and continued to widen while in hand. WYE CROSS set a pressured pace from between foes, was
overtaken by INTENT TO STRIKE entering the turn then chased the winner into the stretch but was no match and finished clearly second best. LONE
PIONEER saved ground between foes, chased through the turn and held for show. LONESOME CAT chased from the rail, gained closer order but was
unable to improve contending position through the drive. TRIPLE LIVE tracked the pacesetter outside, raced three wide into the far turn, came under urging
but had no closing response when asked. RAIDEN lacked early speed, chased outside and tired. SLEWMACH chased throughout and had no response
under urging into the drive. SUNNY'S BEST lacked a bid. ROMAN STEEL pressed the pace racing three to four wide in the opening stages, dropped back
through the turn, was eased into the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
ROADSIDE KISSES trailed the field early, advanced quickly along the rail through the turn, was roused into the lane staying on the left lead then took
advantage of the rail opening up at the top of the stretch, angled in sharply then won driving. AXIAL LOAD raced widest through the backstretch, was at the
back of the pack leaving the final turn, took closer order, lacked running room then shifted out to the four path mid stretch, surging late and missed.
PHINALYWYN reserved off the pacesetters early, raced two to three wide in the turn, closed gradually and was along in time for show. TEXAS ALLEY KAT
stalked the pace outside racing four to five wide, went in pursuit of the leader leaving the final turn, moved up alongside ASTARTOBE then exchanged
bumps entering the stretch, inched clear of rival and yielded deep stretch. MOONLIGHT CRUSH lacked the speed needed then took a quick hold, tracked
inside, raced three wide into the lane, rallied mildly into the stretch then steadied in the final sixteenth from between foes. THRILLOFTHECHASE raced six
wide through the backstretch, remained wide through the stretch and offered a late mild bid. ASTARTOBE contested the early pace from the rail, drew away
through the far turn, responded to challenge from TEXAS ALLEY CAT, exchanged bumps entering the stretch and steadied. AMY JEAN saved ground
early, came five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. GOLDEN BAYERS vied between rivals for the early lead, was overtaken leaving the backstretch
and gave way in the stretch.

MOON KING contested the pace from between rivals, gained the lead into the turn then was under a drive into the lane and held firm through the stretch
under steady encouragement. BURNIN' POCKETS raced five wide through the backstretch, angled to the two path approaching the turn, closed outside but
was unable to reach the winner and finished second best. TRANG lagged in the early stages, shifted outside entering the lane and rallied belatedly for
show. MR. KALYPSO raced four to five wide early, bid four wide through the turn and lacked the kick that was needed. WEST OF SABINAL pressed the
pace racing three wide, was unable to move on with rivals at the half marker, lacked the rally needed and gave way late. WATER WAGON broke slow then
was squeezed away from the gate, trailed the field and chased to no avail. THE HYBRID tracked the pacesetters and failed to menace. UNSTOPPABLE
COLBY vied inside then was overtaken into the turn, was unable to move on with rivals and tired.

Footnotes
PEYTONS PRINCE sent for outside speed, contested the pace through the turn, responded to challenge from MAKEOURDAY into the lane and drew clear.
FORTHWITH saved ground from the three path, dropped back leaving the backstretch, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch and closed
determinedly for place. CAMINO DEL REY saved ground inside, gained closer order after the half marker, rallied mildly and was along in time for show
honors. MAKEOURDAY vied for the early lead, gained a short advantage racing into the lane and weakened in stretch. BARLEY BOY allowed to settle
early, raced three to four wide into the opening turn, was roused at the head of the lane and offered a late bid. MOON JUICE stalked the pacesetters from
the three path, chased the leaders leaving the turn and came up empty for the drive. POOR RUBEN trailed the field, swung wide into the lane and offered a
late mild bid. IMTELLINGYOUMYSON prompted four wide leaving the backstretch, was unable to move on with rivals and faded. OUR MONEY CAT raced
at the back of the field and passed tiring rivals late. DUDLEY DO failed to threaten. RUNAWAY LIGHTNING chased from the rail and tired. ITS ALL GOOD
showed little.
