Footnotes
MOBIL MAGIC prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, surged to make the lead late and won going away. MACADOOOO KID vied for the lead into the
turn, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. SEASONS END never far
back, finished with good courage three wide. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN saved ground and went evenly. BRILLIANTBENNY well placed, failed to respond.
ADMIRAL GLEN away alertly, set a slow pace to the top of the stretch then gradually weakened. GOOD ENERGY was no factor. THUNDER STREAK dwelt
at the start and was never close. CLASSIC VOLUME with the second flight three wide through the turn wilted. THE DONNER had brief speed.

Footnotes
DOROTHYS BOY bumped at the start, advanced steadily three wide, made the lead near the top of the stretch, drifted out under strong right handed urging
and won as much the best in the six path. UNCLE CARLITO set the early pace, two wide, gave up the lead and dropped back a bit then came on again in
the four path through the stretch and gained second. SANDLOT SAM dueled along the inside with the runner up through the clubhouse turn, dropped back,
shifted out n the far turn then came on again late in the six path. RESISTANCE JAK pressed the early pace three then two wide, made the lead before a
half, set the pace through the far turn then came up empty. FIGHTING FOR GRACE trailed far back for five furlongs then closed some ground late.
REWARD THE MIRACLE bumped at the start and was no threat. CHECKWITHME was no factor. STORM PEAK was through after a half. DANTU had
speed for a half then flattened out.

bid near the inside into the stretch then leveled off. BLACK BUTTE advanced along the rail into the stretch then came up empty. SOUTHERN RUFFLES
chased the winner from between horses into the turn and was through early. THEOREM had her head turned at the start and was no factor. COUNTING

leveled off. B DUBYA also in tight at the start, was outrun. FATHER DENNIS was no factor. BRUHLMEYER stalked pace the pace into the stretch then
faded. COTTONWOOD CANYON was no threat.

Footnotes
NORTHERN JOURNEY was in tight shortly after leaving the chute, moved up steadily, angled out to the six path entering the stretch, responded with a late
burst of speed and drew clear. LEXY ANNA broke in front, set the pace under pressure into the stretch, shook clear then couldn't handle the winner. TRUE
LIGHT pressed the pace along the inside, drifted to the four path and was outfinished. BEST OF YOU had a mild late rally outside. ENDURING LOVE
bobbled at the start, was in tight soon thereafter and failed to menace. MOBIL SONG was no threat. GRAZIA WHO with the second flight two wide, gave
way in the stretch. SO GO MY LUCEILLE also tight early, had brief speed.

Due to a heavy rain the horses were obscured from view into the stretch at which point DOUGS MORNING PICK closed with a burst of speed in the five
path under right handed urging and was along in time. IT'S A MANS WORLD opened a daylight lead before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the late
charge of the winner but just held on for second. SUSIE'S KID finished well in the six path. WAPAKONETA PHIL was advancing into the stretch then came
up empty. CHOCOLATE PHILLING was no threat. KONTAR was no factor. TAPSHOT passed tiring rivals. GIFT OF OAK hesitated start and was never
involved. HE'S A MOMMA'S BOY faltered in the lane. CAPTAIN WES lost contact with his quickly, was distanced and walked off.

AWESOME GENT broke well and made the lead soon after the start, set the balance of the pace while getting quick fractions, drifted to mid track under
right handed urging and won as much the best. AMERICAN PASTIME chased the winner from the five path and held on gamely for second. MORE THAN
GOOD had speed from the start and finished with good courage near the inside. OVER ICCE broke in a tangle then went evenly. GRECIAN PRINCE was
through early. MANGA MAN hopped at the start, stumbled and was never close.

Footnotes
DARK TEMPTRESS prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path, made the lead a furlong out and drew clear under brisk handling.
AWESOME MACHINE broke in front, set the pace into the stretch, drifted in before the furlong marker and held on for second. MS SASSY ATITUDE stalked
the pace from the start, inched closer along the rail, lacked room before the furlong marker, shifted to the four path and finished with good courage. HOPES
AND PRAYERS had good early speed then faded. JIMMYSEXTRAGIRL wheeled at the start and was no factor. ZENMODE hopped at the start and was
outrun. GET NAUTI was no threat. DEVIL'S REVOLUTION hesitated at the start and failed to make contact with her field.
