Footnotes
BACKSEAT PROMISES chased the pace while near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path, moved up on the pacesetter near the
eighth pole, shifted in towards the inside nearing the sixteenth pole then surged away late. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD vied for the lead along the inside into the
lane, shook clear of the dueling challenger straightening into the lane, widened to the eighth pole, continued to lead approaching the sixteenth pole and
could not hold off the winner while keeping on to save the place spot. WEIGHTLESSNESS was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from
the five path, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then flattened late. LUCY TOO was in the three to the four path through the turn and never was a
factor. POLARIZING vied for the lead through the far turn then gave way turning into the lane. CHARMING JILLY B bobbled at the start and dropped back to
last then steadily lost ground. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
MUSIC TO MY EARS was off a bit sluggish, advanced through the turn from the two or three path, entered the lane from the four or five path, continued with
momentum once straightened, caught the leaders inside the sixteenth pole and was all out to the wire to hold off the runner-up. TWOBIRDSONESTONE
was well back down the backstretch, continued to trail while near the rail through the turn, came into the lane from the two path, angled from there to the
eight path while gaining momentum, continued with much energy inside the sixteenth pole and finished full of run to just miss. CASH FOR GOLD was in the
two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path with aim on the top ones, was moving well when passed by the top two and continued on
to be clear for the show spot. SOUL STREIT set fast fractions while clearing for the lead before the first call, continued to set a hot pace into the lane,
maintained his largest advantage with an eighth to go then faltered. GAWKIER chased the fast pace through the turn when in the three path, was under a
drive entering the lane then weakened. CAP DE FUEGO was along the inside through the turn and weakened in the lane. PORTOBELLO'S HERO dueled
for the early lead then settled back to chase the leader into the turn, lost ground in late turn and was no longer a factor. WICKED SLIDER was outrun while
in the three or four path through the turn.

FLAT OUT MINKIE stalked the pace from the pacesetters from the three path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, gained the lead when
straightening in the lane, widened to the eighth pole and continued to be kept to the task while extending the advantage. MATILDAS MAGIC unhurried into
the turn, moved from the two to the four path through late turn, came into the lane from the five path with momentum and moved up to be second best while
not a threat to the winner. BIRDIE BLUE tracked the pacesetters while in the two path through the turn, was well placed into the lane then could only pass
one rival for the show spot. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART vied for the early lead, moved clear into the turn, remained clear entering the lane then faltered the final
eighth. SEMINOLE SISTERS was in the three path through the turn, came into the lane in the three path and in mid-pack, shifted from the three to the six
path inside the eighth pole and lacked a closing response. TOUCH OF BLESSING raced near the inside through the turn and never was a serious factor.
HITCHED saved ground into the lane and tired. REAGAN'S INDY LADY vied early then pressed the pacesetter into the turn, chased that one into the lane
then faded. PISANTE' CAT was done near the three-eighths pole while in the three path.

Footnotes
CASH NOW set the pace under early pressure, clear into the turn, widened into the lane and was ridden out while extending the advantage. SIT TIGHT
chased the winner while in the two path, continued to be clear for the place spot into the lane and was well clear for place and second best. BUTTERED
NOODLES was along the inside through the journey and saved the show spot. SCOBY was in the three path through the turn and lacked a response.
GALILEO'S ROCK was in the three or four path through the turn and never was a factor. ULTIMATE FIGHTER was never a factor while racing in the two
path through the turn. MAJESTIC MR. JONES was done on the turn while saving ground. RUNNING TIMES WERE OMITTED DUE TO A TIMING
MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED.

NATES HEARTTHROB was clear early, was challenged in the stretch, dueled and brushed a rival late while winning under a strong hand ride. EMPIRE'S
SCORE stalked in the four path, bid at the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch with a head in front briefly, was brushed late and was outfinished. OUR
NEIGHBOR BOYS was bumped at the start, rallied four wide at the three-eighths pole but had no late gain. DIRTY BAD BOY pressed between foes and
faded ion the stretch. BAD ELMER pressed inside to the stretch. SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT was bumped at the start and improved position late. COOL
JUSTICE stalked in the three path for a half mile and then faded. STRONG WORDS was not a factor. CHUY stalked inside to the stretch. FARS GLITTER
was pulled up nearing the half and was vanned home. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INVOLVING THE TOP TWO FINISHERS IN DEEP STRETCH FOUND NO
REASON TO MAKE A CHANGE IN ORDER.
