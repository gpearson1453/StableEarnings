pace to the top of the stretch then was no match the winner while clearly second best. ISLAND CHIC stumbled at the start, trailed into the far turn then
finished with good courage in the two path. EDGE went evenly. SASSY SISTER well placed, lacked the needed response. MA KETTLE was through early.

Footnotes
ISTILLGOTIT broke n front, set all the pace while nicely rated, drifted a bit at the top of the stretch and prevailed under mild urging. RED CHILL chased the
winner into the stretch, inched closer along the rail but finished second best. B DUBYA slow early, swung wide and passed tiring rivals near mid track
through the stretch. TUBA chased the winner from between horses and faded in the stretch. SHAKEDOWN was a forward factor three wide then through
after a half. COTTONWOOD CANYON failed to menace. GATLING was outrun. DEFINITELY TONIGHT was no factor.
