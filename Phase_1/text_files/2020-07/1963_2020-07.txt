CHARMING INDY well placed bid clear three deep on the far turn digging in from the three and four paths down the lane holding safe. REPLAY slow early
circled out to upper stretch bidding willingly six wide. SUPER ECHELON reluctant to load would rear at the break racing well back to the far turn showing
some life advancing in upper stretch finishing evenly. FOREST NIGHT hustled out would work to carry a narrow lead to the far turn ceding there having little
left in upper stretch. DISCREETLY PLACED raced second flight posing no menace. GONE MOUNTAIN was never involved. INMYFATHERSIMAGE was
always outrun. IRON GRIP pressed the early pace then gave way on the far turn. HONEST BOND folded up early.

BOND rallied to bid on the turn wresting the lead in upper stretch shaking clear along the inside only to be run down at the end. GLITZY GALA went evenly
through the turn coming seven wide in upper stretch having solid late response. UNTAPPED ENERGY slow early gave a mild rally in upper stretch angling
four wide lacking a closing punch. DANCE WITH STARS sent hard angled in while pressing to the turn dueling there into upper stretch wearing out in the
two path. MOM'S MAGIC was never involved. K'S MEMORIES was always outrun. MADDY MACHEN had early speed then wilted from the quarter pole
