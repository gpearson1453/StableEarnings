MISTER NOT FUNNY tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and wrested the advantage
under firm hand urging to go clear. CLASSY PAPA, urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset into the turn, dueled into upper stretch gaining a brief
advantage but proved no match for the winner. HOMELAND MESSA was rated off the second flight in early stages, shifted out four wide leaving the midway
point of the bend to lodge a bid nearing upper stretch but finished evenly through the last quarter while prevailing for a share. COASTLINE SERMON, urged
to the lead while angling to the inside in the opening stages, dueled for command into the stretch and gave way late. SMELLIN CANDY, held up between
foes in early stages, was prompted to a gain a position just off the first flight three wide racing into the turn but emptied out in that path after a half. SHEHE
bobbled at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
BENTLEY'S DREAM took up a position stalking just off the leaders three deep racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside on the far turn racing just off
the leaders, came through inside foes when presented an opening to challenge for command in upper stretch and kicked clear late under firm
encouragement. FROSTY FLIRT, reserved out of striking distance a bit off the inside to the backstretch, shifted three wide on the far turn while advancing to
challenge nearing upper stretch, couldn't match the winner's kick but edged a rival for the place honors late. HISSY MISSY, rated from out of striking
distance along the inside in the opening half, saved ground to upper stretch gradually drawing into contention but was outkicked for second. GOLDEN TAP,
urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker.
AWESOME SUNSET, in touch prompting the pacesetter between foes racing to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. GIO'S LIL ANGEL was settled last
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PLAN, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside in the opening stages, was rated to stalk just off those rivals along the inside nearing the first
turn, shifted off the inside after a half, was urged to advance three deep between foes nearing upper stretch and edged forward in the closing stages to
narrowly prevail under brisk right handed pressure. GLACKEN'S GHOST, urged between foes to dispute the lead in the opening furlong, angled to the rail
nearing the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, resisted several rivals' challenges on the far turn into the lane but proved
only second best in late stages. A P IS LOOSE tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
three deep racing into the second bend, was fanned four wide into the lane and continued with interest while outkicked by the top pair. TAPSOLUTE settled
off the second flight racing outside a rival to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide midway on the far turn, was fanned five wide into the lane
but lacked the needed late kick. PROFESSIONAL, held up in close quarters just after the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, was prompted to gain position inside foes on the far turn to upper stretch but came empty in the closing stages. MINNESOTA LUCKY, caught
three deep in early stages, raced on terms with the pacesetter while pulling a bit attending that rival's pace into the backstretch, was urged to press the
issue through the far turn but came up empty racing into upper stretch.

HADDY UP broke sharply to gain a clear advantage, angled to the rail dictating the pace through the backstretch, came under pressure racing into the turn
to turn back a challenge, kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. MY MISS MARILYN tracked the
pacesetter between foes in second flight in early stages, shifted out three wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors.
BOOZIN AT BOZOS, off a step slowly, was urged three wide on the backstretch to gain terms with the leader prompting the pace racing into the turn but
proved no match in the drive. CLASSIC WHISKEY ducked out at the start, was settled between foes from out of striking distance and continued evenly into
the lane. SURELY A LEGEND was a brief factor inside rivals tracking just off the leaders in early stages but steadily faded into the lane. DATA QUICK
settled last and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHE'S FIRE AND ICE broke readily to prompt the pace outside foes in the opening sixteenth, was eased off the leaders nearing the first turn to track those
rivals just off the inside under light rating, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn to press the issue, gained a clear advantage in that
path racing into upper stretch and held IRISH HALO safe to the end under firm left handed encouragement. The latter, reserved last between foes into the
backstretch, swung out five wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, continued in that path to loom outside the winner in late stages but was
outkicked. ELUSIVE AMELIA was rated out of striking distance three deep racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the far turn steadily gaining on
the leaders between foes nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed no final kick. JOLLYVILLE was rated along the inside from well out of striking
distance to the backstretch, switched outside rivals to race four wide nearing upper stretch, angled back to the inside entering the lane but lacked the
needed late response. AND ISLES angled inwards racing to the backstretch tracking the first flight from just out of striking distance for a half, saved ground
on the far turn, awaited an opening nearing the lane, came through inside foes nearing midstretch but offered no rally. SARJENALLI, urged to dispute the
lead along the inside racing into the first turn, gained a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, dueled inside foes into the far turn and gave way into the
lane. AVIE'S PARADISE angled in sharply while being urged between foes contesting the lead in the opening stages, drifted out wide on the first turn, was
righted entering the backstretch to press the issue between foes into the second bend but emptied out racing into the lane.

GOT EVEN SMARTER tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum shifting out midway through the far turn,
came through between foes three deep to bid for command racing into upper stretch, gained the advantage midstretch, was headed late but just prevailed
on the wire under firm left handed pressure. OMEN OF CHANGE, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on
the far turn to gain the advantage racing into the lane, then grudgingly resisted the winner to the end to just miss. TWOKO BAY tracked the leaders between
foes in second flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders three wide entering the far turn, drifted wide racing into upper stretch but continued
willingly in the five path late while just outkicked by the top pair. BLUE DANCER, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, dueled for
command into the far turn and gave way into the lane. HAMAZING VISION threw his head at the start while breaking slowly, settled along the inside as part
of the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside nearing the lane while being prompted to advance but offered no rally. TABIA, off a step
slowly, tracked outside rivals in the second flight while caught four wide after a half, was fanned five wide leaving the midway point of the far turn and gave
way. WHY GOD settled outside foes dropping off the second flight and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY AND KIND, caught a bit wide racing to the first turn, was rated off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance on the leader three deep racing into the second bend, steadily gained terms with that foe to wrest a narrow advantage, edged clear between calls
in late stages and just held FIRST HUNTER under firm encouragement. The latter dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, conceded the lead
when headed racing into the far turn, shifted off the inside to bid three wide in late stages but just missed. BEE BIT exchanged solid contact with TIME FOR
KISSES at the start, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, shifted out nearing the far turn to gain between foes while exchanging repeated contact
with CATTY KRYS entering the second bend, shifted out of close quarters entering the lane and found her best stride four wide in late stages to close the
gap on the top pair. SMART N WICKED, caught five, then four wide racing into the first turn tracking off the first flight, was prompted to advance outside
foes on the backstretch, bid for command racing into the far turn while angling to the inside, dueled inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and gave
way late. CATTY KRYS, forwardly placed between rivals prompting the pace, shifted out conceding some position midway through the backstretch, was
prompted four deep into the far turn while exchanging repeated contact with the BEE BIT entering the second bend, was fanned five wide into the lane and
gave way. MORNING REPORT, forwardly placed three wide, continued between foes in pursuit of the leaders to the second bend and emptied out nearing
the lane. TIME FOR KISSES exchanged bumps at the start, was settled last and failed to menace.

READY TO RUNAWAY broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside on a comfortable margin into the backstretch, repelled a challenge from
MAYWOOD HOPE racing through the far turn, was prompted right handed to kick clear in the stretch and steadily widened the margin while being gathered
up late. PINUP GIRL was rated tracking the leaders off the inside to the second bend, angled three wide racing into the lane and edged a rival for the place
honors late. MAYWOOD HOPE, off last, steadily gained position between foes after a half, bid for command racing into the far turn but flattened out in upper
stretch. FIRSTMATE forwardly placed in early stages tracking just outside the pacesetter, emptied out nearing the lane.
