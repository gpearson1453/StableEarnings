second. LOOKN FINE AS WINE raced at or near the inside through the turns, and gained mildly in the stretch. MISS WROTE veered out bumping FIELD
BET solidly at the start, was keyed up leading through most of the first quarter-mile, vied through the middle stages inside FIELD BET, and faded through
the stretch. MOR BREEZE slammed into the right side of the gate and was off slow, shifted off the inside midway on the far turn, and went by faders.
TERRIBLE TARA bumped with ALL ABOUT KATHERN at the start, raced three wide and was through before reaching the stretch. FIELD BET bumped with
ALL ABOUT KATHERN at the break, then bumped hard with MISS WROTE, vied outside the latter for six furlongs and gave way. G T'S BLUE SQUALL
was ridden along inside on the far turn, and had no response. MYSTIC MOON broke out bumping COUPLE OF NIKKIS and pushing that one into MISS

TATWEEJ broke in at the start, set the pace inside, repelled a challenge from MCCAIN passing the quarter-pole, and widened under pressure on his left
lead. EL SAMURO raced widest throughout, and was along late to take second while never a threat to the top one. MCCAIN moved menacingly outside
TATWEEJ to loom a threat nearing the stretch, then flattened out staying on his left lead and weakened late. ALASTOR raced between horses in range
early, and faded after a half-mile. ELUSIVE EDGE pressed TATWEEJ from outside early, and was finished after six furlongs. PASSING LANE got herded in
a bit by TATWEEJ at the break, and tired inside after a half. This race was hand timed.

DANCE TILL DAWN prompted the pace outside ITS ABOUT ME, wrested the lead away through the furlong grounds, then dug in to hold off SAND DRIFT
on her left lead. SAND DRIFT rallied to contention three wide after six furlongs, had aim outside the winner through the lane, and was inching closer in the
final yards. AMAZING AUDREY advanced approaching the stretch three then four wide, and rallied mildly outside. ITS ABOUT ME set the pace inside,
yielded to the winner in mid stretch, and weakened. PICASSO MOON saved ground and failed to threaten in an even effort. DIXIE PRINCESS raced
forwardly inside to the far turn, and tired. LEDECKY saved ground and was not a factor. PAINT THE CORNERS hopped at the start to get away last,
entered the backstretch four wide at the rear, and never got close. BAHAMA KITTEN raced mostly three wide, and tired approaching the stretch. KYLLA
INSTINCT (GB) moved out three then four wide on the far turn, and tired into the lane.

Footnotes
MEXICAN WONDER BOY was bumped by DIAMONDS ENJOY at the start, set the pace inside, came under attack from REBELDE late on the turn, fought
that rival off through upper stretch and held firm for the decision. REBELDE advanced between horses in the three-path after a half-mile, loomed boldly
outside the pacesetter turning for home, stayed on his left lead and was outdueled while clearly second best. TURN ON THE MAGIC saved ground
throughout, and faded after six furlongs. TONS OF GOLD broke a step slow, raced three to four wide around the turn, and made no impact. DIAMONDS
ENJOY broke in bumping MEXICAN WONDER BOY, pressed the pace outside that one to the turn, and dropped out of it before reaching the quarter-pole.
This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
MONY broke out bumping ADJUDICATOR. was reserved for six furlongs, circled four wide rallying between horses leaving the far turn, caught
ADJUDICATOR from outside with 70 yards remaining and edged away. ADJUDICATOR was bumped by MONY at the start, set the pace through
manageable fractions, moved clear through mid stretch, and stayed on well. HIGH DEFF (FR) was unhurried for six furlongs, circled five wide turning for
home, had aim through the drive and flattened out late just saving the show. MR MATUSCHEK was pocketed in and among horses midway on the far turn,
lacked room behind a wall of horses from the quarter-pole through upper stretch, altered course to the far outside and finished gamely. JOE BENJAMIN
bumped with PRINCE IGOR at the start, pressed the pace outside ADJUDICATOR from the outset, and weakened through the stretch. CONCORDE'S
DREAM fought rating three wide forcing the pace, and had nothing left late. AVENTINUS broke slowly, moved up considerably along the rail through the
backstretch run, but could not sustain the rally. NOTHINBUTABLUR was a step slow at the start, and retired after six furlongs. PRINCE IGOR bobbled and
bumped with JOE BENJAMIN, came four wide off the first turn, and tired after a half-mile.

BELIEVE INDEED settled in easy striking range early, took over outside DESCENTE and NOTHINS FREE near the five-sixteenths pole, and widened under
a drive. PAYNTER FEST raced in midpack for six furlongs, cut the corner into the lane, and finished well to clearly best the others. DARLINDIVA led out of
the chute, dropped back steadily despite urging through the middle stages, came five wide into the stretch and rallied mildly. DESCENTE vied for command
inside to late on the turn, and weakened. TROPICALITY saved ground to the turn, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch, but lacked the needed
response. KINDHEARTED KOTA was always outrun. NOTHINS FREE bumped with GRACE'S DRAMA after the start, contested the pace outside
DESCENTE, and gave way approaching the stretch. GRACE'S DRAMA broke out and bumped with NOTHINS FREE after the start, and was through early.

Footnotes
GIROLAMO'S ATTACK vied early outside APACHE, shook clear on the turn, and widened through the lane kept to pressure. TAPI FROST was close up
early inside, swung four wide off the turn, and was along for the place outside. LORD MELBOURNE tracked outside the early leaders, gave futile chase to
the winner turning for home, and weakened late. APACHE vied early inside GIROLAMO'S ATTACK, could not stay with that one after three-eighths of a
mile, and faded steadily. CURTIN'S UP became fractious in the gate unseating the rider, missed the break coming out two or three lengths behind the field,
got forced out a bit by KID LEE up the backstretch, and was through after a half-mile. WILLARD brushed with LORD MELBOURNE at the start, got pushed
out early outside CURLIN'S UP, and was outrun. KID LEE moved out from behind horses briefly forcing out CURLIN'S UP, and tired. TINKER'S PAL saved
ground ridden along through the turn, and dropped far back after a half-mile.

Footnotes
RUDIGER tossed his head getting away slow, lagged far back for a half-mile, fanned six or seven wide into the stretch, gathered momentum through the
furlong grounds, dueled outside DONJI late and prevailed. DONJI settled in the second flight early, moved off the inside midway on the far turn, found
clearance joining the leaders in the four-path through mid stretch, dueled late inside RUDIGER and just missed. REMEMBER THE MAINE was four wide
around the first turn, moved in through the middle stages, slipped through on the rail with a bid turning for home, reached even terms for the lead past the
furlong marker, but was outkicked inside the top two. ALIEN INVASION broke out, went along well placed behind the leaders for a half, loomed a threat
three wide into the stretch, and was outfinished between horses. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was up with the early leaders inside, lost position through the
middle stages, came four wide off the far turn, and lacked a solid response. FUEL THE BERN battled up front from the start, dueled inside POWER
WALKER around the far turn, and stayed on past the eighth-pole before giving way. MR. PAPILLON bumped with POWER WALKER and was back to last
at the start, raced wide and never got close. CHIEF WHITE SOX vied early between horses three wide, and retreated soon after going a half. POWER
WALKER bumped with MR. PAPILLON at the start, was strung out four wide contesting the lead on the first turn, dueled outside FUEL THE BERN to upper
stretch, and gave way between horses. DAKOTA'S DUDE was never involved. BOLD PAYNTER was far back throughout. G Q COVERUP was done after a
half.

VIOLENT TIMES saved ground with the leaders in sight entering the turn, closed the gap after a half-mile, drew a bead on LADY'S ISLAND shifting outside
the pacesetter past the three-sixteenths, forged past leaving the furlong marker and drew clear. HEIRESSALL was unsettled and hit the right side of the
gate coming out, took closer order rallying four wide off the turn, and overhauled LADY'S ISLAND from outside for second late. LADY'S ISLAND took over
from MY SARASOTA STAR soon after the start, was hounded by the latter while slightly removed from the rail through a sharp half-mile, could not hold off
the winner after five furlongs, and lost the place in the closing yards. MY SARASOTA STAR left the gate in front but was overtaken by LADY'S ISLAND,
hounded the leader from outside to the stretch, and faded steadily. SUZIE'SSTEPPINOUT was outrun three wide. VICTORY CRUSADE broke slowly, and
was always far back. SAYONARA BABY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SAILING SOLO grabbed the early lead inside, moved well off the rail for the run up the backstretch, made his way back inside fending off SHARM EL
SHEIKH around the far turn, kicked away in upper stretch and was never in jeopardy under a mild drive. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) broke slowly and lagged
well back for a half-mile, shifted out four wide beginning to find stride turning for home, and finished willingly outside to go clear of the others. GALLEON
MAST saved ground unhurried early, took closer order around the far turn, rallied mildly through upper stretch, then was one-paced through the closing
stages. SHARM EL SHEIKH prompted the pace outside SAILING SOLO from the start, was well out in the course through the backstretch run, stayed on
the chase to mid stretch and weakened. FOREVER MO raced well back three to four wide for six furlongs, and gained mildly without threatening. LAHINCH
saved ground in the second flight to the far turn, moved out for room bumping BATTLE OF BLENHEIM at the top of the stretch, and had no rally. THUNDER
RIDE saved ground tugging under a firm hold early, continued inside from easy striking range to the far turn, was asked for a response at the top of the
stretch and came up empty. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM settled within range for six furlongs, and was making no headway when bumped by LAHINCH at the
top of the stretch. IL FARAONE was never involved, and dropped far back after six furlongs.

SUNDAY SCHEMING settled in the middle of the field early, moved up three wide around the far turn, wrested command outside DREAM ADRIANNA into
the final furlong and edged clear. DREAM ADRIANNA stayed in range early, took over from outside three then two wide entering the far turn, moved clear
after six furlongs, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch and saved the place. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL raced well back early three wide, began
moving in the two-path a quarter-mile out, moved to the rail looming a threat through mid stretch, and just missed second. MOMS LOVE got pushed out by
NOBLE LEGACY and bumped with JAENT at the start, made a run four wide past rivals entering the far turn, but flattened out after six furlongs. NEW
YORK COMMANDER chased outside BUXOM BEAST to the end of the backstretch, and tired. JAENT got pushed out, bumped with MOMS LOVE and
steadied back at the start, moved up after a half-mile outside, steadied slightly past the three-eighths pole and had nothing more. SISTERMISCHIEF
bumped with BUXOM BEAST at the start, and faded inside after a half. MS. OUTRAJES was outrun inside. BUXOM BEAST bumped with
SISTERMISCHIEF at the start, set the pace inside to the far turn, and was finished nearing the stretch. NOBLE LEGACY broke out pushing MOMS LOVE
into JAENT, and retired early. PRINCESS LACIE was always outrun, and eased up through the lane.
