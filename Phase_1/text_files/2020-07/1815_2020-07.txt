Footnotes
V. I. P. CODE settled off the early pace four wide, bid four wide into the far turn, drew clear leaving the three-eighths pole, dug in outside of GENERAL
PADDY when that rival bid in upper stretch, vied outside through the lane and prevailed. GENERAL PADDY tracked the pacesetter two wide, bid between
foes nearing the three-eighths pole, could not match strides with the winner around the turn, bid inside of that one in upper stretch, dueled inside and was
denied. SOUND OFF was unhurried while racing in the three path around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn and rallied for the show.
LINDA'S NEKIA failed to menace while racing two wide. SACRAMENTO Q stalked the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. EXPECT
DRAMA set a clear pace in the two path and stopped.

the start, lagged two and three wide, angled to the far outside in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. NIKKI BELLA chased the pace inside and lacked a
closing bid. DAZZLE ME failed to menace while racing in the two path. BARLEY JACK stalked the pace three wide down the backstretch and faded around

Footnotes
KID MERCURY settled off the pace while racing two wide, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, bid four wide into the far turn, steadily gained, took
the lead near the sixteenth pole and drew clear under a drive. CAPTAIN HARDSHIP stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out to bid two wide entering the
far turn, dueled between rivals from there to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished late. FELIX THE FOX was bumped at the start, saved some ground
early, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, made a quick bid outside down the backstretch, took the lead three wide near the three-eighths pole,
battled on to midstretch and settled for third. HYPERLAPSE (IRE) chased the pace two wide and finished evenly. BARREL OF STOUT lacked speed, while
racing two wide and passed tiring rivals. MARKET MOVER advanced three wide to the lead, set the pace inside and weakened in the lane. WISE MEN
saved ground to no avail. IT'S FATE led inside around the first turn, stalked two wide around the clubhouse turn and faded around the far turn. MAYNOOTH
played no factor while racing two wide. BUSSTER VON TRAPPE failed to menace while saving ground. CONATIVE was outrun. PONY UP played no factor
while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
SIERRA LEONA settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up and clear late. BETTER
YET was caught five wide into the first turn, angled in leaving the seven-eighths to go about three wide around most of the bend, advanced three wide
around the far turn, split rivals near the quarter pole, bid inside of the winner but was no match for that foe late. MISDRIVEN raced three wide in midpack
early, advanced two wide around the far turn, bid inside of foes in midstretch then weakened a bit late. YESTERDAYSPLAN never threatened while racing
two wide. LADY BREANNA stalked the pace two wide around the first turn, took the lead near the nine-sixteenths marker, set the pace two wide around the
far turn, led to midstretch and tired. DR. ANN hopped at the start, pulled four wide around the first turn toward the front, bid three wide into the far turn and
wilted in the lane. MAMMA DEE played no factor while racing two and three wide. ALEXBABE set the early pace along the rail and retreated nearing the far
turn.

Footnotes
SOUL P SAY set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn and held clear under a drive. GOLD SHARK was bumped at the start, prompted the
pace three wide between foes, angled in midway around the turn, tipped back out in upper stretch and narrowed the gap while drifting out late. CAPE
LOOKOUT was pinched back at the start, made good progress four wide around the turn, rallied outside under minimal urging while appearing to try to lug
in. LORD SIMBA lacked speed, raced two and three wide around the turn and rallied belatedly. UNION GRACE never threatened while racing two wide.
DRILL'S LI'L MAN broke inwardly and bumped CAPE LOOKOUT into GOLD SHARK, prompted the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. FIELD
ADVANTAGE saved ground and failed to menace.
