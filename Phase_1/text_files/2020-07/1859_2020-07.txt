Footnotes
KING CORN prompted the pace outside a foe, took the lead on the turn, was joined by another horse on the outside and found more to draw clear for the
win. HEAVEN SENT ANGEL stalked the pace, rallied entering the turn in the three path, challenged the winner at the top of the stretch but could not keep
stride and was second best. KINETIC ART broke outward and brushed a foe, stayed just off the pace, chased the top two while under a drive down the
stretch and was game late to be best of the rest while settling for show. CONNORRSKIE was the speed off the rail, leveled out on the turn and ran on the
rail in the stretch. NANA ROZE was last and under the whip on the turn, but unable to keep up.

FACTOR AROUND joined as the third horse in a three way duel heading for the turn, took the lead near the top of the turn, cleared off in the stretch under
minimal whip urging and was geared down in the final furlong. SWEET WILLEMINA broke inward, was guided away from the gate with whip taps, drifted out
up the backstretch, got closer and chased the leader hard from the turn forward but was second best. OHIO TIME waited from off the pace, and was green
down the stretch while gaining position. WICKED VALENTINE came off the pace to rally five wide on the turn, but lost the show spot in the final furlong.
LUMINAIRE was bumped by a foe at the start, showed speed inside to the turn and gave way. COOKIES CAT broke in and bumped a foe, vied outside a

Footnotes
ORIGINAL INTENT stayed well back, made a middle move four wide on the far turn, wore down the leader and cleared at the eighth pole. DRAGSTER
tracked the lead, split horses three wide on the turn, had the lead in the stretch, couldn,'t contain the winner but just held place. PETE MARWICK waited,
had good energy to move up on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and closed well to just miss second. LIZZY'S LURE was off slow, got up to race
inside behind the leaders and had a mild gain late to improve position. JUNKET was always back, came widest into the stretch and improved position. FISH
TRAPPE ROAD brushed between horses at the start, raced in the five path on the backstretch and evened out in the stretch. EMPEROR'S GOLD cleared
the field to lead on the first turn, got into a duel on the backstretch, contended to the final furlong and faded. JENNYSREGALMAN dueled inside a foe to the
turn, then went between horses there before fading in the stretch.

CIGAR BOX stalked from third, made a move at the top of the turn in the five path, then outran the leader to gain the front at the eighth pole. SMUGGLER'S
GHOST chased the leader, went inside down the stretch, loomed boldly but leveled out while just getting second. HOVER was urged hard from the gate, led
off the rail, took the two path on the turn, but was swallowed between foes late, though game to hold the show spot. PRIME TIME was last into the stretch
and gained position late. MY PAL DAL was off slow, moved up well on the turn, but gave way in the final furlong.

SHANGHAI RAIN sat behind three duelers, went four wide on the turn to get around them, led in the stretch and drew cleer. PRINCESS ATHENA vied three
wide with two foes, was under presure to catch the winner in the stretch but was second best. ALI BLUE dueled inside two horses, angled out off the rail for
room in upper stretch, and just managed to maintain third at the wire. FLAT CALM checked early coming out of the chute, dueled between foes, floated out
in the stretch and just missed show. BACKSEAT PROMISES was well back, angled in to avoid horses drifting out in the strretch, then improved position
late. KISS OF DAHPESPE raced inside off the leaders before faltering in the stretch. SWORN SILENCE went to her nose at the start, recovered to join the
pack to the turn and faded.

Footnotes
KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE was off tardy, rushed up while rank to the turn, took over past the quarter pole, cleared off in the stretch and held sway to the wire.
MATCH PLAY well placed, raced outside to the turn, came after winner in the stretch but not enough while well clear of the rest. GIOVANTE no speed to the
turn, rallied four wide past quarter and ran on through the stretch for show spot. DUMBMARK bobbled at the start, regrouped quickly, dueled to the turn but
gave in readily. SWAMP RULER never a real factor while well off rail throughout. TRIPLE DELIGHT broke running, dueled to the turn but backed up from
there. GOOD LUCK JUSTICE had a terrible start, rushed widest to the turn but retreated quickly.
