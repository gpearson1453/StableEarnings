in the stretch. BIRCHMOUNT RD showed brief speed, forced the pace but gave way in the final furlong. TOO HOT had brief speed then stalked three and
four-wide on the turn, launched an all out stretch drive but tired in the final furlong. UNWAVERING was prominent early, raced two and three-wide on the
turn then tired in the stretch.

was pressured through the stretch, was engaged a 16th out and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. SHEER FLATTERY, in range, chased two-wide into
the stretch and finished gamely. WHERE'S THE WIDGET, in touch early, was hustled five and six-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished
determinedly. OVERBEARING hit the gate leaving, closed quickly to mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then tendered a mild gain in the
stretch. SOUPER FLY OVER, in range, came three and four-wide through the turn then showed some interest in the stretch. NIGHT WATCHMAN raced in
mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out in the stretch, closed but did not threaten. ROCKET PLAN was in range early, raced four and
five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a rally. TWO TIMING, in mid pack early, dropped back entering the turn, came on again

Footnotes
CURLIN'S VOYAGE made a mild advance to track the leaders past the 5/8ths pole, saved ground while stalking on the turn, began her bid at the 5 1/6ths,
angled three-wide at the 1/4 pole, reached the leaders with a furlong to run, dueled to the wire and prevailed. JUSTLEAVEITALONE pressed the pacesetter
while racing two-wide, commenced a duel at the 5/16ths pole, had a narrow lead in mid stretch and fought valiantly when headed by CURLIN'S VOYAGE
though just missing at the wire. INFINITE PATIENCE got out to set the pace while taking some pressure, dueled while saving ground on the turn, dug in
gamely in the stretch but gave way in the final 1/16th. AVIE'S SAMURAI was unhurried while racing on the outside, raced four-wide on the turn advanced
late on the turn and loomed dangerously at the head of the lane but evened out. MIZZEN BEAU stalked the pace while racing well off of the rail, raced from
three to two-wide on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. GUN SOCIETY trailed the field as they exited the chute, was asked for more midway
around the turn but was never involved.
