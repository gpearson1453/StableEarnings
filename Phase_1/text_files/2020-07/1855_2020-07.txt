GALLINIPPER angled to the inside taking the lead, moved clear, increased his advantage in the stretch and was under wraps late. AFLEET MELODY
prompted the winner outside but could not keep up through the stretch. ELREGAL angled inside before half a mile and flattened out in the stretch. SHILOH
LANE chased inside at the back of the pack, angled wide on the final turn and lacked a rally. LITTLE TOWN BLUES raced just off the leaders outside and
gave way readily. HURACAN was fanned very wide on the first turn and stopped, losing contact with his field.

ALFRED, in the four path while just off the pace, eased out wider nearing stretch, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and edged clear. TRAFFIC
TROUBLE lunged leaving the gate then came out and bumped BRIDLECREST, saved ground, lacked racing on the far turn and was steered to the outside,
angled back to the rail though stretch and closed. TEMPTING THE TIGER rated on the lead in the five path, resisted when challenged but weakened late.
DRAMATIZED saved ground while never far back, split foes in early stretch and had no rally. HAZASPITTIN' IMAGE, two wide in second flight, tired. ROAN
MOUNTAIN, racing widest, failed to menace. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN saved ground in second flight then tired. BRIDLECREST, bumped leaving the gate,
raced wide and failed to menace.

FLAT OUT FLASHY settled early off the inside, angled wide rallying into the stretch then offered a late surge to outfinish pair of opponents. MR CLASSICAL
went after the pacesetter after a quarter but yielded through the final furlong. TALLY MO broke alertly and moved clear inside then weakened through the
stretch. ARRECIFE dropped back along the inside and rallied mildly in the stretch. ARRIVE IN STYLE wide early, angled inside on the turn then flattened
out. CREATIVE GENIUS prompted the leader outside and began fading after half a mile. KAIROS lagged far behind, moved wide on the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
RATED SPECIAL, three wide while just off the pace, rallied to the lead in early stretch, edged clear with a furlong to run then held on. LAW OF THE LAND
was bumped leaving the gate and then was in tight early, raced off the rail, eased out looking for racing room near the quarter pole, split rivals and closed
determinedly. LEXATOGA, between foes while outrun early, eased to the outside near stretch and closed. GAUCHO came in at the start bumping
STRATEGIC LEGACY, saved ground and then tired. ABDAA,, in the three path while just off the pace, took up sharply near quarter pole and fell back .
FACTUM LOVE STYLE raced wide, bid and challenged near stretch but then flattened out. NONNO PIETRO set the pace just off the rail and faded through
the drive. WELL IN TUNE failed to menace. STRATEGIC LEGACY, bumped leaving the gate, recovered and raced two wide in second flight then tired.
MOSSBAWN raced wide and failed to menace. DUE TO A MALFUNCTION IN THE PHOTO FINISH CAMERA, THE FINISH WAS TAKEN FROM VIDEO.

FIDUCIARY VALUES vied outside, took over into the far turn then eagerly drew away driving. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lagged far behind, advanced near the
inside and closed well while no threat to the winner. JUMPIN JETT well placed behind the pacesetters, bid on the final turn then proved empty. CREATIVE
PRINCESS dueled along the rail to the far turn then retreated. RAG TOP angled inside on the first turn, moved closer on the final turn but faded. IF YOU
ONLY KNEW chased off the leaders and weakened steadily. BRUSHING raced wide off the pace, was asked for run on the final turn but had no response.

wide and outrun early, passed faders. BANKER'S ISLAND, in the four path while unhurried, moved to the rail and was no threat. BRILLIANT RICHIE set the
pace just off the rail, drifted out and faltered. DRUMMER DON, two wide, never threatened. SLOT, racing lapped on winner early, tired. WATCH MY DUST

Footnotes
ARIMA awaited room inside while close up, angled out in the stretch then surged away through the final furlong while kept to her task. FASTROADAHEAD
prompted the pace three wide, edged to the front at the quarter pole but yielded to the winner. PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER broke slowest then offered some
late energy while no threat. ICE DIAMOND moved up between foes into the far turn, bid briefly then faltered. PERFECT SONG led along the inside, was
collared near the quarter pole and weakened. LUCKY IMAGINATION dropped well behind and was never in contention. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS forced the
pace outside to the turn then gave way. BROAD JUMPER lagged far behind then passed a fading rival. DANCINGWITHTHEMAN stopped abruptly losing
contact with her field.

CURRENT SITUATION dueled along the inside throughout, lost the lead briefly but came again in the final furlong. SHE BROKE MY HEART forced the
pace outside, led narrowly at the eighth pole but was outfinished. AAMAAL stalked the pacesetters throughout and lacked a rally. MEGHAN'S ANGEL
saved ground and continued willingly while no threat. WHEREWITHAL angled outside on the first turn, moved very wide in the stretch with a mild bid. OUR
CURLENE lagged far back then passed fading rivals. RAGAZZA CARINA dropped back inside and was never a factor. BEE WINGS lacked speed along the
inside and was always outrun. BIG RED OAK chased off the rail and weakened steadily. PHI LII trailed throughout and was eased when losing contact with
her field.
