GOING WITH STYLE pressed outside of two foes, came three wide into the stretcn and got by for the win under good handling late. REBEL'S REVENGE
broke sharp, was hustled away from the gate, led in the three path while being prompted by two horses, was confronted in upper stretch, fought back
gamely while at the rail, but gave way late while maintaining second. OL' L B tracked from the rear of a bunched group, rallied for more on the turn when the
lead group started to get away, came widest into the stretch and passed a fader late. MANNFORD pressed between, led briefly in upper stretch and faltered
in deep stretch.

Footnotes
SKATINGONTHINICE led at the rail from the first turn to the stretch, angled out in upper stretch, lost the lead in the final furlong, but came back to wear
down the game leader while floating out to take the win. WIND TWIST raced off the rail while mid pack, shifted to the rail in upper stretch, led late, but was
worn down while floating out in a game effort. I'MYOURHUCKLEBERRY was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, and gained position in the stretch.
CHEROKEE HAWK chased early, made a move to rally on the turn from the three path, but needed more. STERLING JUDGE raced mid pack,, took the
turn five wide, and lost position on the turn and down the stretch. SAVO was bumped at the start, last early, and no factor. BIG BAD SHACK was through
after a quarter.

GRADE good position throughout, rallied with a late burst while all out through the final sixteenth to just get up with a nostril on the wire. OSVALDO behind
leaded to far turn, rallied up to clear in the stretch but was nosed out late. ONE THIRTY NINE lagged back to the far turn, gained past the quarter pole and
only moved up in the stretch run. COME ON VENEZUELA good speed from inside, led to quarter pole but faltered in the lane. CAPE MARCO DRIVE
lagged back to far turn with a steady run past quarter pole wide and cut the gap while no real threat. SQUARE THE CIRCLE hustled along from the gate but
failed to respond when needed. SHATTERPROOF always outrun.

Footnotes
LEO stayed just off lhe leader from outside, moved up on the turn, came into the stretch in the three path, took the lead at the top of the lane and drew off
under mild urging. BIG EXCHANGE led inside to the stretch and leveled out while no match for the winner. DREAM SATURDAY waited for the turn,
advanced four wide, gamely chased the leaders but evened out, unable to get by the place horse. STAY IN YO LANE was between horses nearing the turn,
pursued the leaders from inside down the stretch, and was just good enough to hold off a foe for fourth. DRAGSTER ,up close early, chased the leaders
while three wide on the turn, but needed more in the end. JENNYSREGALMAN lunged at the start, ran widest on the backstretch and widest into the stretch
and improved position late. GIANT TRICK brushed between horses at the start, got on the rail behind the leaders up the backstretch but dropped back on
the turn. After an inquiry the stewards determined that JENNYSREGALMAN started fairly and no change was made.
