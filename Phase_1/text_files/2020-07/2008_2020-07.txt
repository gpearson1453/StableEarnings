Footnotes
BAHAMIAN BENNY bumped with CON PERMISO at the start, was on hold behind a four-way battle up front, moved out four wide for clearance at the top of
the stretch, swept by the leaders from outside through the furlong grounds and drew off under a drive. GIVE ME TWO STEPS battled up front between
horses among a foursome disputing the pace, moved to the rail in the stretch and held for the place. CON PERMISO stumbled and bumped with
BAHAMIAN BENNY at the start, was up with the leaders until steadied and shuffled back between horses past the half-mile pole, came four wide into the
lane and rallied mildly. QUAKE argued the pace from the far outside for three-eighths of a mile, and faded. POWERFUL MOON contested the pace three
wide between horses, and steadied unable to hold his spot between GIVE ME TWO STEPS and QUAKE in mid stretch. PUGIN became edgy in the gate
dislodging the rider, vied inside a trio early, and gave way on the turn. ARRENDAJO broke slowly and was always outrun. TESTIFIED came six wide
outsprinted off the turn, and drifted further out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BY HIS GRACE raced alone in third tracking the early leaders, came five wide past the three-sixteeenths, and wore down PRINCESS CORO from outside
in deep stretch. PRINCESS CORO pressed LITTLE SHAMROCK from the start, took over outside that one without much trouble midway on the turn, drifted
four wide to the lane coming under fire from BY HIS GRACE, and could not hold that rival off while drifting out under left-hand pressure. CALI QUEEN shied
from WAR GODDESS and veered out sharply at the start, advanced in the two-path after a half-mile, and rallied mildly inside. VENEZUELANCHAMPION
was outrun for a half three then four wide, lugged in through the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. TRINNI CUTIE PIE was outrun inside. LITTLE
SHAMROCK set a pressured early pace inside, had no answer for PRINCESS CORO after three furlongs, and drifted wide tiring into the lane. WAR
GODDESS broke out a bit at the start, raced three wide and dropped far back into the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT BLOODED pressed the early pace, challenged for command between horses late on the turn, took over at the top of the stretch, and drove clear. THE
PREDICAMENT saved ground entering the turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, loomed a threat past the furlong marker, but did not have
enough. CONGRATS AGAIN settled in the middle of the field between horses early, moved out in the stretch and rallied mildly. ANDRES EDUARDO was
slow to get going, drifted five wide off the turn, and went by tired horses on the far outside. CHUCKY tracked the leaders three wide, lodged a bid with a
quarter-mile remaining, but faded through the final furlong. PAPA HONOR broke slowly, stayed in range early three wide, came off the turn in the five-path,
and lacked a response. CASTLE KING became fractious unseating the rider behind the gate, loaded without further incident, and posed no threat. WEIGHT
OF GLORY set a pressured pace inside, and gave way at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
FRANK FIRST bumped with KID DRAMA shortly after the start, moved up to challenge SCAR from outside after five furlongs, battled through a long drive
and prevailed while drifting out. SCAR got the best of a pace dispute with ST JOE VIPER midway on the turn, got tackled immediately after that by FRANK
FIRST, drifted out clinging to a tenuous lead past the eighth-pole, and yielded grudgingly. KID DRAMA bumped with FRANK FIRST soon after the start,
moved up around the turn four wide, but flattened out in the stretch. BACANO bumped with MR. CESCO coming out of the chute, got through on the rail
inside a tiring ST JOE VIPER coming to the quarter-pole, but was empty. VIOLENT FIGHT raced three wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. ST JOE
VIPER dueled inside SCAR for a half-mile, and gave way around the turn. MR. CESCO bumped with BACANO trying to make some room for himself
entering the main track, got steadied and shuffled back in a crowd soon after completing a quarter-mile, stopped on the turn and was eased up in the
stretch. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
PRIVATE MESSAGE spotted the field a two-length head start, had to be hustled along after that, kicked in with a four-wide run to contention late on the
turn, took over outside TREVESS in upper stretch and edged clear, then held on late. CHEZ PAREE saved ground making no headway under a drive
midway on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, and was gradually getting to the winner on the far outside. TREVESS lost her footing slightly and
brushed with TALIA LADYBUG at the start, dueled outside the latter and won that battle after five-sixteenths of a mile, could not cope with PRIVATE
MESSAGE through upper stretch, and weakened. I'M A ROCKSTAR was in range early, came under a full drive closing in on the leaders three wide near
the quarter-pole, then flattened out turning for home. TALIA LADYBUG brushed with TREVESS at the start, dueled inside that rival to midway on the turn,
and gave way. REGGAE REVOLUTION broke out, ran up into a pocket and steadied near the half-mile pole, and was empty in the five-path by the top of
the lane. FORTUNATE CAT showed speed two wide to the turn, and dropped back.

TIPSY KITTEN broke alertly, let SMOKE 'N' GLOAT go late on the first turn and moved outside to track that rival, breezed by the spent pacesetter coming to
the three-eighths, and was driving to stay well clear. BOW TIE AFFAIR saved ground outrun early, took closer order past the midway point of the far turn
under a drive, battled inside WINGMAN through the lane and prevailed for the place. WINGMAN raced mostly three wide on the turns, and was outfinished
for second. LUCKY FAST was slow away from the gate, and made no impact. GRAND NENUCO was never a factor. SMOKE 'N' GLOAT sped off through
ambitious early fractions, and folded up before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
CRUMB BUN moved outside REMARKABLE SOUL midway up the backstretch, tracked from close range around the turn, forged past the pacesetter in mid
stretch and drove clear. REMARKABLE SOUL grabbed the early lead, showed the way slightly removed from the rail, weakened inside the winner on her
left lead a furlong from home, drifted out and saved the place. MIDNIGHT SOIREE got bumped by ROSA STAR at the start, moved out for the drive and
finished evenly. ROSA STAR tossed her head, hopped awkwardly and came down bumping with MIDNIGHT SOIREE at the start, got taken out widest after
that, lodged a brief bid three wide late on the turn, and faded through the lane. MARYNMIKE saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
R U LUCKY shadowed SO LONG CHUCK early, took over from outside after five furlongs, got hooked by ALLURSTRA soon afterward, dug in through a
long drive and held on while drifting out past the middle of the track. ALLURSTRA was reserved early, ranged up alongside R U LUCKY from outside
approaching the quarter-pole, battled through the stretch and could not get by while drifting out considerably. SEPTEMBERTEN bumped with SO LONG
CHUCK at the start, chased two wide for six furlongs, and stayed on willingly for a share. ESPRESSO CALIENTE saved ground into the turn, moved out five
wide to the lane and passed tired horses. FIRST AND THREE was no factor inside. INGREIDO was urged along to stay in range early, drifted six wide off
the turn and dropped far back. SO LONG CHUCK bumped with SEPTEMBERTEN at the start, sped clear inside for a half-mile, got overhauled by R U
LUCKY midway on the turn, and faltered.

Footnotes
SAY ADIOS cleared off entering the turn, stayed well removed from the rail and was hand urged to score ridden out. SAMMY'S TOWN raced forwardly
outside getting closest to SAY ADIOS early on the turn, gave futile chase the rest of the way and was clearly second best. MERMAID KISSES brushed with
PRINCESS AVRIL approaching the turn, and was no menace to the top two going evenly through the lane. FLAMING INDY raced four wide, and was not a
threat through an even effort. DINNER AT FIVE bumped with R SEA SMOKE at the start and was off slow, put in a five-wide run around the turn, and
flattened out. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB broke slowly, and passed only tired horses. C. A. C. CHAQUIRA was in range early, but faded four wide
approaching the stretch. R SEA SMOKE bumped with DINNER AT FIVE at the start, was strung out five wide on the turn, and tired. LADY PARADISE was
finished early inside. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE showed early speed inside, and steadied while dropping back past the five-sixteenths. PRINCESS AVRIL
was forwardly placed early, brushed with MERMAID KISSES nearing the turn, and dropped back steadily.
