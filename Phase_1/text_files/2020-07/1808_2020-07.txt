ANDREWS BOOGIE sluggish at the start, settled while four wide, remained four wide into the stretch, rallied and was up in the last jump. GOTTA LOVE IKE
chased the pace, moved closer on the turn, lodged a three wide bid, led late and missed. BIG MACINTOSH led early, edged clear on the turn and was worn
down in the stretch. BARTENDERS MISTAKE swerved in at the start, saved ground and did not menace. MINGO BORN was always outrun. SHERWIN hit
the gate at the star and faded.

contention entering the stretch and kept on willingly. TAPITOR lacked room at the start, was reserved, commenced his bid far on the turn and rallied while

APRISE settled well, advanced on the turn, moved four wide into the stretch and rallied under a drive. BOSSY MOMENT set a contested pace, edged clear
into the stretch and was reeled in late. GARBO SPEAKS deliberate at the start, advanced early and stayed on while three wide in the stretch. DOT DOT
DOT outpaced, was swung five wide into the stretch and finished well. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE never menaced. SASS N STYLE was void of speed and
showed some belated energy. CAMPFIRE TALES raced forwardly between foes and faded. SASSY AIN'T I proved no factor. ME 'N JERRI LEE forced the
pace and faltered.

CANADIAN GAME stalked the early pace, drew even leaving the back stretch run and dug in gamely for the stretch run. HOUR CITY gained the early lead,
was challenged on the far turn and stayed on stubbornly in the stretch. GALINDO chased while three wide, moved closer on the far turn and stayed on in
the stretch. YOU SPLIT TENS saved ground and lacked a rally. LARCH was off slowly, eased at the quarter mile marker and vanned off. DUKES UP turned
his head sideways when the starting gate opened, refused to race and walked off. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THEY DECLARED DUKES UP A NON-STARTER BECAUSE OF THE POSITION OF
HIS HEAD AS THE STARTING GATE OPENED. ALL WAGERS ON DUKES UP WERE REFUNDED.
