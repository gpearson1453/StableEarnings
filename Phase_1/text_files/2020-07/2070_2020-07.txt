BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, assumed command soon after entering the stretch and quickly drew clear while being kept to task.
SOLARITY broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and
through the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner in the late going, but battled determinedly to hold the place. CHA CHING unhurried early
while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly four wide in the drive while finding her best stride late. DANCIN
SHOES away well, and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two
out from the rail in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. FOXY BRUNETTE tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving
ground at the rail, struggled to keep tabs on the top pair entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
SIMPLY GOLDEN away alertly and was quickly taken in hand and dropped back to trail entering the stretch the first time, began to take up the chase
midway down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and was up in the final strides to get the better of BONITA B. BONITA B broke
sharply and raced to the lead while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
opened a clear lead through the final turn, and just failed to last while proving easily second best. SEAGROVE BAY stalked the leader into the stretch the
first time while racing one out from the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and while no match late for the top pair, proved clearly best
of the rest. I GOT VISION tracked the leader from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, continued to save ground through the final turn, and
finished one out from the rail in the drive. LOUGH FOYLE LADY settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the lane the first time,
trailed the field in the run to the final turn, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to pose a late threat. PESADILLA away well and tracked
the pacesetters while racing three wide into the stretch the first time, began to struggle to maintain his position midway down the backstretch and had
nothing to offer late.

PRINCESS OF CAIRO tracked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, bided her time while continuing to save ground in the run down the
backside, shifted off the rail approaching the final turn to launch her bid, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to prove best. FLY AWAY away well
and pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, took a narrow lead into the final turn, was no match for the winner late, but
battled determinedly through the lane to hold the place. BAKZONE tracked the leaders from between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied two wide
through the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive while finding her best stride late in a solid effort. MISS EARL away alertly and raced to the lead from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but was outfinished in
the stretch drive. LIZZIES GIRL broke sharply and tracked the leaders while being hung three wide entering the backstretch, maintained her position in the

in the drive to draw clear late. MIS VIOLA away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail
in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and battled determinedly from along the rail late to finish on even terms with KENSINGTON
MARKET. KENSINGTON MARKET settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the rail
entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide from between rivals late to finish on even terms with MIS VIOLA. CLASSIC STATEMENT broke sharply
and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside through the final turn, tipped four wide
entering the lane, and closed with late interest to just miss the place. NOTICE pressed the pace three wide entering the backstretch while racing two out
from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn while continuing to battle for the lead, and finished willingly three wide in the drive.
HILARIOUSLYNAUGHTY stalked the leaders into the first turn while under snug restraint, maintained a striking position in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while lacking a closing punch. HEREVERYWISH dropped back to trail while racing
two out from the rail entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make a late impact.

FANCY FRAULEIN away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn assumed command soon after entering the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, held a clear advantage into the final turn, increased her margin through the turn, and was never threatened late. MISS

wide in the drive to hold the place. BLUEBERRY HONEY was squeezed at the start and trailed the field into the first turn while saving ground at the rail,
rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing three wide in the drive to just miss the place. DONE

position over the final furlong without ever threatening. DEW TELL broke sharply and vied for the lead while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn,
was unable to match strides with the winner in the run down the backstretch, and was outfinished over the final furlong. REIGNS DREAMZ drifted five wide
entering the first turn before settling well off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, was always well back and showed little. LOTS
OF LOVE away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to hold her position in the run to the final turn,
and had nothing to offer late.

collared the leader in mid stretch and inched clear late. BILLS SMOKN BULLET away well and tracked the dueling leader from along the inside entering the

while proving clearly second best. SWORD FIGHTER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three out from the rail entering the final turn, and
closed four wide in the drive to get up for a share. TWISTGRIPS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. TIZ MEOW settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. CRACKDOWN away alertly and vied for the

drive. BETATHANABOYFRIEND settled well off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but needed more when called upon while finishing four out from the rail in the drive. LITTLE GROOT broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out
from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SPROG broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the inside entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained her
lead through the turn, and widened her advantage through the lane. NO TAN LINES away well and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out
from the rail, took up the chase after the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, was no match for that rival late, and finished just out from the rail to hold
the place. ILHABELA tracked the leader through the first turn while being caught three wide entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering
the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive. PIPPA tracked the leader from along the rail entering the first turn, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the stretch drive. WILD WOMAN away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while
saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed evenly four wide in the drive. INTENT ON GOLD settled well off
the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon.
SARA tracked the leader three out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. ALUCIA trailed the field into the backstretch while racing seven wide, continued with a wide trip throughout, and wasn't persevered with
over the final furlong.
