Footnotes
UNSPOILED MOMENTS was slow in the early stages, moved up along the inside around the far turn into the lane, made a strong rail bid in the latter stages
and got up under strong handling. ALLEGIANCE pressed the early pace, gained command while racing three wide into the upper stretch but couldn't hold
off the winner late to finish second best. JIFFY JOSH showed good early speed while racing along the inside and weakened a bit late.
SEVENTYSEVENWILOW stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. HONDO GUSTO settled off the early pace,
raced three wide and failed to have a response. HALEL dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. RED ROSE CAT stalked the
early pace and tired readily.

Footnotes
WHISKEY DASH set all the pace while racing along the inside and drew off to be well clear under steady handling. TINKER'S PAL stalked the pace, made a
good rail bid through the stretch but was no match for the winner. UGLY DUCKLING stalked the pace, raced four wide into the lane and had no rally.
COURAGE DE LION pressed the pace from the outside and weakened while racing three wide. STOPIT stalked the pace, raced four deep into the upper
stretch and had no response. DIVINE CONTROL settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the lane and never was a
factor. MR. CABALLERO broke in sharply at the break, bumped with rival, settled towards the back in the early going, raced two wide in the stretch and
never threatened. PACHI was off slowly, saved ground and never was a factor. REACHNFORASIXPACK was unhurried early, raced five wide into the lane
and never menaced. GO ABA GO was bumped at the break, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never threatened.

SORCIER was allowed to settle early, moved up six wide into the lane, dug in late and just got up under all out pressure. SWIFT KID stalked the pace from
the outside, raced three wide at the eighth pole, finished gamely while racing between rivals and just missed. STINGSLIKEABEE pressed the pace from the
inside and finished willingly to the wire. STARSHIP FONZY showed good speed while racing two wide and weakened in the latter stages. NOT TELLING
stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no late response. DRILL BIT was off very slow, raced four wide through the stretch
and never was a factor. ALL STARR RUNNER settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and never threatened. IN HONOR OF ARTIE was
unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide in the lane and never was a factor. ITSMYLUCKYSUMMER broke a bit awkward and lost his irons at the
start, raced mid pack and faded late. BOLTER stalked the pace and tired along the inside.

Footnotes
TEGLA stalked the pace, moved up to challenge nearing the far turn, raced two wide and just got up under strong handling. ONE SLICK FACT showed
good speed from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. MISS LOTUS FLOWER stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide at the eighth pole
and finished willingly to the wire. REWROTE was off slowly, raced three wide through the lane and had no final winning bid. BATI BATI was slow early,
saved ground and had not enough late. PURE MAGIC stalked the pace while racing between rivals and weakened. BEACH LADY was unhurried early,
raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. ALL THIS JAZZ was off slowly and never threatened.

Footnotes
VALIANT THOR was quick to begin to set all the pace, raced well through the drive and was well clear late under steady handling. FIRSTCADETE was
allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the winner. MIDNIGHT FAME settled off the early pace, raced towards
the inside around the far turn, angled four wide through the lane and improved his position. DR PARKER stalked the pace, raced three wide through the
stretch and weakened. GLOBALTROUBLECOCO dropped back early, raced four wide nearing the upper stretch, angled to the inside and had not enough in
the drive. POWERFUL MOON was hustled from the inside and tired. VET'S GIFT stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and weakened.
FORMAL TREASURE failed to have a response. DAWN WEST was slow early and never threatened. EL BARBARAZO was off slowly and never was a
factor.

Footnotes
ELVIS COLE showed good speed along the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. KING OF LEINSTER (IRE) stalked the pace,
raced two wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. HEY GRIFF stalked the pace, raced four wide into the lane and had no final winning bid.
MORE THAN TEDDY was slow early, raced six wide in the lane and showed good late interest. IRISH MAIL was allowed to settle early, raced five wide
around the first turn, raced four wide at the eighth pole and never was a factor. GRAY'S IMAGE settled off the early going, raced towards the inside around
the far turn into the lane and had no final winning bid. HUSBAND IN LAW dropped back early and failed to respond. CHILI MAC N CHEESE raced towards
the inside and never threatened. SILENT MISCHIEF raced just off the inside in the stretch and showed little. GOOD SOLUTION pressed the early leader
and gave way.
