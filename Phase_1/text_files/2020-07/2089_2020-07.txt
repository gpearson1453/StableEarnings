Footnotes
INSURRECTION was bumped leaving the gate, settled, began to advance between horses early on the backstretch, raced three wide with the pace around
the final turn while still in hand, engaged the leaders under whip into the final furlong and was narrowly best after a long drive. RANCHO BARGO was
hustled early to the front, stayed close to the rail while urged to maintain his advantage then gave way grudgingly late. BUDDY ROCKET moved outside the
early leader before a half, remained prominent between the top two through the final quarter but couldn't gain. CAIRO KING broke slowly, advanced inside
early, was urged along into the far turn, edged out into the three path approaching the lane and lacked the needed closing. JAPEDO was unhurried early,
raced the four path around the final turn and gained mildly in the lane. TROOPER was no factor. MULE SKINNER ducked out into the winner leaving the
gate, angled to the inside soon after and failed to matter. PREFERRED PROSPECT raced the three path and tired. JETT RINK was outrun.
SCHOENHARDT was outrun three wide. SATURDAYNITESINNER was caught wide around the first turn while outrun. AIREDALE was finished early.

NAUTICAL GEM took over from the outset, stayed close to the rail under confident rating, began to draw off nearing the stretch and widened under
intermittent urging. CEDAR HALL came well out from the rail nearing the end of the backstretch, raced the three path around the turn then held the place
while weakening. STALEMATE pressed two wide outside the winner into the turn then faded through the final quarter. APPOLINA wasn't far back along the
rail into the turn then tired. LOVE AND LEMONS broke slowly, stayed well out from the rail and tired. SASSY KENZIE GIRL raced well out into the track
while no factor. DOC'S DENITA raced between rivals and stopped. DEES LOCA MOTION fell back soon after the break then never caught up.

and widened under mild urging. ORENA STARSHINE was slow early, stayed along the rail around the turn and outfinished tired ones for the place. HEAD
OVER BOOTS broke sharply, pressed outside the winner into the turn then weakened in the lane. ZOE'S GOLDLADY was prominent early, angled to the
rail nearing the turn, ran out some entering the stretch and faded between rivals. DO I MAKE YA SING lagged early, edged out into the three path while
moving on the turn, swung wide into the stretch then flattened out. PAULA'S PLAYLIST stayed well out from the rail and failed to menace. CHAMISA

DOHA was hustled clear soon after the break, stayed along the rail around the turn and was kept to a drive through the lane. SCAT FOR THE CAUSE was
slow to settle, raced outside rivals in the four path around the turn and closed willingly outside. SHEZAUNO was slow to settle, stayed out from the rail while
inside rivals around the turn, angled to the rail in early stretch and finished well. DUCHESS BUBBLES wasn't far back into the turn, came out into the three
path while under whip on the bend then lacked a strong closing response. ANXIOLYTICS chased outside the winner in the three path into the turn then
weakened in the drive. FANCY GI GI was slow early, stayed along the rail around the turn and passed tired ones with a mild late run. MISCHIEF GIRL
bumped with LADY ADELE leaving the gate, was hustled between rivals early, raced the three path around the turn and faded. LADY ADELE bumped with
MISCHIEF GIRL leaving the gate, gained early position in the two path then had nothing left for the drive. VENUS ISLAND failed to respond to early whip
and couldn't catch up.

Footnotes
VENTURE FORTH bumped with OTTO PARTS leaving the gate, was unhurried early, rallied the rail around the final turn, came out between horses in early
stretch and quickly ran clear late. JAMES'S MOONSHINE moved two wide to command early on the first turn, edged clear on the backstretch, widened
along the rail on the final turn, remained clear into the final sixteenth but was little match late. MIDNIGHT REVOLT settled inside, was shuffled back entering
the far turn, came out three wide on the bend and lacked a strong closing response. SHELLEY'S DREAM was hustled from the gate, dropped to the rail
while beginning a run into the far turn, moved closer nearing the stretch then flattened out. ARCHRIVAL was slow early, improved position along the rail on
the final turn, ran out entering the stretch but wasn't a factor. TIME IS NOW was outrun. LINUS was outrun. OTTO PARTS bumped with the winner leaving
the gate, showed speed along the rail into the far turn, stopped after three-quarters and was eased up late. COLONEL BOWIE briefly had position three
wide, stopped and was eased up.
