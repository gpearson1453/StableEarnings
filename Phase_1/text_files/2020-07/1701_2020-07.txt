Footnotes
MALARTACH broke sharp from the outside, quickly gained the early margin, dueled up the backstretch, shook loose entering the second turn, opened a
clear margin at the eighth pole and was much the best while lightly roused. MADISON'S WILD ONE stalked the early pace from the inside, inched closer
entering the second turn, angled outside for the drive but was no match for the winner while gaining the place. LAURALEE COCODREE pressed the early
pace from the outside, advanced through the second turn, remained forward but came up empty late. KISS ME LILY forced the early pace outside but had
nothing left. BULLETSANDBOURBON chased the early pace and tired. U THOUGHT U GOT ME trailed throughout.

task. WILL B LATE stalked the early pace from the outside, advanced through the turn but was no match while gaining the place. REBORN forced the early
pace from the outside but could not keep pace in the drive. AD LIBITUM chased the early pace from the outside, made a bid but was too late. SHARP
MONEY MORGAN was never a factor. HALF MOON MAIDEN dueled from the outside and faded. CLOUDYWITHACHANCE stumbled at the start and lost
