Footnotes
SILENT MAMBA set a pressured pace, was passed upper stretch, was steadied near the furlong marker when NERO DAVOLA came in and tried to jump
the rail in front of her, steadied but inherited the lead and finished under a hand ride. MATTHAUS chased in range along the rail and finished evenly.
SECRETLY, away slowly and off the pace, closed two-wide through the turn then finished gamely in vain. HATMAKER HOLIDAY was herded early on the
backstretch, chased three-wide on the turn, lugged in through the stretch and did not menace. CLEOMENES was hustled from the back of the pack, raced
two and three-wide through the turn but never reached contention. DOWN TO EARTH, in mid pack early, was hustled four-wide on the turn but failed to
menace. NERO DAVOLA came in early, pressed the pace, lapped onto the leader through the turn, moved to the lead upper stretch and drew clear, came
in and tried to jump the rail but fell and hit the fence unseating her rider, got up quickly and walked off walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
SPILL LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
CHEEKY PINT bumped at the start, settled in mid pack early, stalked on the backstretch, bid late turn, led upper stretch and held sway under a drive.
FLASHY PRINCESS raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. NATURAL HABITAT, in range, bid into
the far turn, gained a short lead, was engaged approaching the stretch, dueled, but was no match and gave way grudgingly. SWEET SHADES raced in mid
pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then finished gamely. CALL HER JOEY settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, lost ground at the
top of the stretch and chased to the wire. MY SUGAR PIE stalked the pace, was shuffled back on the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the
late stages. PLAYING SMART, in range, was shuffled back leaving the clubhouse turn, remained in contention on the backstretch, angled from the rail to
three-wide on the far turn but failed to threaten. HARPSWELL settled off the pace, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention.
MARTINI SUE, bumped at the start, sprinted to the early lead, set a reserved pace, was headed at the far turn, stalked to the stretch and tired.

from the rail to three-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive and was gaining late. COACH LORI settled in mid pack, was blocked at the top of the
stretch, found a hole quickly and rallied moving to the rail and finishing gamely. JUXTAPOSE stalked the pace in hand, was hustled two-wide on the turn but
finished evenly. TEACHER'S PET raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide late turn but lacked a closing response. TAKOTA pressed the pace, was hustled
along the rail on the turn then tired in the final furlong. TAKE CHARGE EH settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide from the rear on the turn, was eased
at the top of the stretch,crossed the wire and walked off.

ESKIMINZIN stalked the pace, forced the issue on the far turn, bid just into the final furlong and edged clear under a drive. INVENTING BLAME was herded
outward leaving the gate, set the pace, was collared a furlong out and gave way grudgingly. INCLUSIVE raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the far turn and
finished under a determined drive. ROSE'S VISION, in range, chased two and three-wide late turn and was all out in the stretch. COMBATIVE, in range,
chased from the rail on the far turn then evened out in deep stretch. ARTISTICO, well back early, closed fast from last coming four to six-wide through the
far turn then rallied widest, but mildly. SPLIT MY PANTS was pinched back at the start and settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn,
was blocked upper stretch but still finished gamely. WOODBRIDGE settled in mid pack, chased hard three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace.
HOLD'EMFORRANSOM broke outward, was rated in range, came three to five-wide through the far turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SHIRL'S SPEIGHT showed early speed, set a reserved pace, quickened late turn then widened still well in hand. JUST LIKE LARRY stalked the pace,
raced along the rail and two-wide, chased into the stretch, was all out and best of the rest. BELICHICK got away slowly and settled off the pace, closed
three to five-wide through the turn, lugged in while widest at the top of the stretch then rallied outside. ENCHANT ME hit the gate leaving, gained position in
striking range, chased hard three-wide late turn but failed to menace. U S ARMY CORPS forced the pace, chased three-wide late turn but evened out in
deep stretch. MARSHALL RABIL raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. L'ETAT
(GER) was off a step slowly and subsequently pinched back at the start, raced from off the pace, closed late turn and offered no response in the stretch.
OVER THE HILLS got off slowly, raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. MORE CHANCES stalked the pace, came three
and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and tired. SPINNING PIPER broke slowly and settled off the pace, trailed from the rail on the turn
and had no closing response.
