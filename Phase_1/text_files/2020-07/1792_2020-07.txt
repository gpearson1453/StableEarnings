Footnotes
STAY AWAY JONESY hesitated at the start spotting the field a few lengths, settled into stride while moving up mid-pack on his own, went in behind the
leaders edging still closer and racing in the three path, came out six wide turning into upper stretch and put to stout urging, got up late over LOPIN JOE, who
stalked from outside, was given a bit more encouragement early on the turn going into that bend five wide before soon moving in a path, struck a narrow
lead past the furlong marker but was overtaken late. QUICK LAUGH set a pressured pace into the turn going three then two wide with rivals inside and out,
gave way in mid-stretch. COMING ABSTRACTION came in and steadied after the break, settled well back near but just off the fence, moved out from the
two path on the turn coming six wide to the three-sixteenths and gaining ground but could not sustain the effort. ALVIS was urged forward, pressed the pace
inside, gave way. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT was urged at the break, chased from between runners four wide into the turn, dropped back and weakened.
INDIAN GAMBLER came out a bit at the break, tracked from inside, moved out coming the quarter pole and was five deep by the latter part of the turn,
failed to rally. SI CAPITAN MG switched outside a rival up the backstretch racing far back, moved inside that same foe entering the turn, went in the two
path through that bend and was never a threat. JAZZIE DREAM raced wide toward the back going in the three to five path on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
INVODKAWETRUST tracked the leading pair early, went in the two path through the turn, came out to engage a rival in the stretch, dueled and prevailed.
GHOSTLY TWO STEP set the pace facing pressure from an outside rival while racing removed from the rail, went in the three path on the turn, drifted out
five deep leaving that bend, hooked up with the aforementioned but was outdueled. BLACKBERRY LISA was forwardly-positioned between runners up the
backstretch, dropped back in the two to three path on the turn, came again to retake position and edge closer in upper stretch but evened out thereafter.
JAZZINIA chased mid-pack outside, went in the five path on the turn, moved in a path into upper stretch and ran on to improve position. SPEED BUMP was
outpaced in the early going and angled in, saved ground on or just off the rail through the turn coming out a path into the drive where she improved.
THOUGHT I'DMISSYOU bobbled outwardly at the start, recovered to prompt the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn before being floated six deep
out of that bend and having been asked for more by the quarter pole, came up empty in the lane. NOBODY KNOWS WHO broke inwardly just a hair then
was encouraged forward inside to chase up the backstretch into the turn, came up empty thereafter. SPECIALYKINDACRAZY was in the back half of the
field off the fence going in the four path on the turn, carried on evenly and made no bid. STARCAST chased the early leaders going three wide into the turn
and shifting out five deep by the latter part of that bend while starting to weaken, faded in the stretch. EBB AND FLOW trailed early, swung six wide out of
the turn and failed to rally. DIRECTED LADY was up close in the early going, went five to six wide on the turn and came up empty. SUTAH WHO was not a
factor racing three to four wide through the turn. Due to timer malfunction race was hand-timed.

Footnotes
LEATHERNECK stalked from outside, moved to challenge by the quarter pole four wide on the turn, was in command by the top of the stretch and drew
away under steady handling. FRANCHISE TAGGED was bumped into the inside foe at the start, set a pressured pace from off the rail going two wide on
the turn, dropped back in upper stretch but fought on to regain the place late while no match for the winner. DAKOTA broke awkwardly and thereupon
switched off the inside, went five wide on the turn advancing outside to the flank of LEATHERNECK and looming a threat but could not sustain the effort and
flattened out. PULPITS FOX broke awkwardly and was shut off by outside foes, trailed early, advanced quickly three to five wide on the turn, kept on in the
lane. DECK HUMOR was mid-pack racing on or just off the rail, went evenly and made no bid. HANDSOME LAD bumped the inside rival at the start,
chased between foes into the turn entering that bend three wide but was done by the five-sixteenths and dropped back. CITIZEN GELLER raced outside
toward the rear in the five to six path through the turn and was never a threat. MR NAVIGATOR was bumped at the start, pressed inside under some mild
coaxing, dropped back and emptied out. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
COMIC HOT TODDY tracked the leader just off the fence, moved up inside that one to take the lead outside the five-sixteenths racing one path removed
from the fence, widened the margin on the turn into upper stretch, was shaken up near the furlong marker then flagged with a left-handed whip in
mid-stretch before being ridden out. FRED was just a bit reluctant then broke out, raced up close early going four wide on the turn, fought on for the place
over SMOOTH BLUES, who was forwardly-positioned inside, saved ground on the turn before angling three wide past the three-sixteenths, took over the
second spot in upper stretch but was outfinished for that placing. JESSICA LEE was between rivals up the backstretch, went in the two to three path on the
turn and lacked the needed late kick. MISSISSIPPI MUSIC was bumped both sides and several times from outside at the start while steadying slightly,
raced mid-pack outside going five wide on the turn and failed to rally. B A CHAMPION steadied just slightly at the start as the outside horse moved in, went
five to six wide on the turn racing toward the rear and had no rally. SMOOTHING IRON exchanged repeated bumps with the inside rival at the start, shifted
in entering the turn and saved ground on the rail to no avail. MR. MCFEELY moved in breaking on top while setting the pace, vied three wide into the turn
then steadily emptied out. PROSPECTOR AL exchanged a brush with the outside rival at the start, chased briefly then dropped back three wide entering the
turn, tired.
