Footnotes
GAMBIT was five wide entering the first turn, angled down to stalk the pace three wide around most of that bend, made progress down the backstretch,
seized command two wide leaving the three-eighths pole and drew off under a drive. GOTTAWAY settled off the pace while racing two wide, moved into a
clear second two wide around the far turn and churned on as clearly second best in the lane. TWOFORONESPECIAL set the pace two wide around the first
turn, angled in nearing the far turn, led to the three-eighths pole, could not keep pace with the winner but lasted for the show. MAMAIGOTTHIS lagged well
inside, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole and never threatened. COWBOY GANDHI had some early speed inside and faded. BEEBE'S BEST BET
was outrun while racing three wide.

SARASOTA BOY engaged in a protracted duel outside of JOHN'S PROMISE and prevailed. JOHN'S PROMISE dueled inside of the winner throughout and
just missed in a game try. MOUSETRAP had some speed inside down the backstretch, dropped back around the turn, stayed inside through the lane and
passed tiring rivals to gain the show late. ARNINA broke awkwardly, advanced into a three wide stalking trip and came up empty in the lane. DANGERUS
HEARTED chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE was outrun while racing in the two path.

final yards. END ALL GET ALL had some early speed inside, dropped back while getting out a bit entering the turn, raced three wide around the bend,

Footnotes
ALDO'S KITTEN settled off the early pace outside, angled to the rail entering the turn, made progress inside around the turn, angled three wide nearing the
quarter pole, closed outside, seized command approaching the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. IT'S PAZIBLE pressed pace in the three path, took
the lead midway around the turn, led to midstretch but was no match for the winner. NOBLE KING lacked early speed inside, swung widest in upper stretch
and was along for the show. DAVID'S PROSPEC never threatened while racing three wide. BOURBON AGOGO saved ground and failed to menace.
AIKEN ON TAP had early speed outside and steadily faded three wide. MR. VECCHIO set the pace off the rail and tired in the stretch. SERGEANT AZER

NILEATOR settled off the early pace scramble two wide, edged closer down the backstretch, launched a four wide bid entering the far turn, seized
command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew off and widened while ridden out. BUZZ OFF had early speed between foes, rated back entering the
first turn, saved ground in midpack, split rivals in upper stretch and finished willingly to be clearly second best. FINE SPIRIT lacked early speed while racing
three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bumped with a rival in upper stretch and rallied for the show. NEXT COWBOY UP was unhurried while
racing two wide early, went three wide around the far turn, swung widest in upper stretch and improved position. DASHING LOU pressed the pace two wide
between foes and weakened in the drive. BELTWAY BOB was unprepared for the start, saved ground and never threatened. SCHERZO was outrun inside.
ROCK SOLID GOLFER chased the pace two and three wide and faded around the far turn. ALLURING SILVER set a pressured pace along the rail and
wilted in the lane. DREAMING OF FRANK played no factor while racing three and four wide. DRIVEN BY THUNDER prompted the pace three wide,
bumped with FINE SPIRIT in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SOMEDAY JONES settled off the runaway pacesetter three wide, made progress around the far turn, reached even terms in midstretch and edged ahead
under confident handling. COMPOUND IT sprinted clear soon after the start, set a clear pace along the rail, took a breather around the far turn, responded
well to the challenge of the winner in upper stretch, dug in inside of that foe and gave way grudgingly. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS lacked early speed while
racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, loomed in upper stretch but lack a late rally while getting up for the show. SOUND OFF settled
just inside of the winner in the two path with aim on the pacesetter early, made progress under a drive around the far turn but came up empty in the lane.
FOREVAMO never threatened while racing three wide. CLUBMAN saved ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
QUICK SAND AA settled off the early pace between rivals, advanced four wide between rivals around the far turn, seized command in upper stretch, quickly
went clear under some urging in upper stretch then widened while ridden out through final furlong. LAZUR HESS pressed the pace three wide down the
backstretch, led around most of the turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clearly second best. BIG BEN AA was bumped at the start,
moved up between rivals around the turn, angled in near the quarter pole and was along for the show. BELLFASTT set the pace in the two path and
weakened in the lane. KISSOUUR stalked the pace five wide and faded. UPTOWN WTF pressed the pace four wide and tired. COLORS IN MOTION was
bumped at the start then had only brief speed inside. WISECRACKER MHF trailed well off the rail.
