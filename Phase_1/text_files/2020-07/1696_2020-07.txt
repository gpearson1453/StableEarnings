TALE OF RONIN showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch prevailed. SEAL TEAM TWO stalked the early
leaders and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. ONE POUND STERLING showed no
speed, saved ground on the turn and was up for show. WATCH THIS was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch had no late kick. CRIME WAVE was off slow and had a mild gain on the turn but from the three path through the stretch had no impact.

NARROW ESCAPE tracked the early leaders, took command on the far turn and was much the best. MAGICAL BREEZE was unhurried early, a factor on
the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. DIVINE AMI was up close and roused on the far turn but had no
response. WORLD OF PROSPECTS was well back and showed little in a dull effort. SPORTSCASTER showed speed from the inside but dropped back on
the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
AWESOME MINER set the pace, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch held sway. GIDEON'S SWORD was in touch and had a
good position on the turn but was second best. UP N ADAM stalked the leader, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held
show. DOCTOR UPTOWN was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. MY FINAL TRICK was in
range and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. STONE KING was in mid pack and hustled along on the turn
but had no late kick. TIME TO DANCE was off slow and had a mild gain on the turn but flattened out. CEPELINAS was off the pace and showed little in a
dull effort. J M R SILENT LAKE had no speed and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. SPARKISH was well back and showed nothing while
outrun.
