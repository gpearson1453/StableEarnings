Footnotes
INFRINGEMENT was one of three alert ones breaking on near even terms springing from the gate, got tucked into the two path, disputed the pace
positioned between rivals from the top of the bend until its end, was roused spinning into the lane, chipped away at the deficit, struck the front end with
approximately a sixteenth to go then kept going well to stay in the clear. HIGHWAY QUEEN kept watch on the front runners from along the rail, got eased to
the outside spinning into the lane, wound up the right rim on the inside route, altered course towards the three path to be outside the ones to catch at the
eighth pole, kicked into her best a sixteenth later, gaining willingly en route for the place. SHESADIRTYDANCER required no feverish encouragement
establishing the top, glided over to the rail a sixteenth shy of the half mile pole, cut the pace, feeling pressure from a pair of opponent to her outside, one of
those being the eventual winner, got switched over to stronger handling for the drive home, relinquished in the general area of the sixteenth marker,
weakened late into the show slot. CHASING CARA put to some brisk hand urging after breaking a length the slowest, secured a forward position prior to
leaving the backstretch, contended as the widest of three from path three during the run around the bend, commenced the stretch slightly wider no longer
latched on to the other two, backed away. BUSTIN SHUFFLE saw the rider take hold as SHESADIRTYDANCER was angling in sharply at the start, took up
the chase from the two path, fanned out approximately seven wide from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, made no impact. SHAKER SHACK
put to some early urging, stepping onto the turn from the two path, stalked the pace from midpack, swung out five wide into the lane, lacked the necessary
response. CLASSIC COLORS saved ground until the quarter pole, got maneuvered three wide entering the stretch, had no offering.

Footnotes
MO FLASH broke in at the start and was corrected, established the front shortly after and crossed to show the way just off the inside lightly coaxed along,
tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail.
SOLITARY GEM three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dueled through the stretch
with RADIANTRITHYM to her inside and bested that rival for the place honors while offering up a mild kick. RADIANTRITHYM broke out at the start and
was corrected, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into
upper stretch, knocked heads with the aforementioned foe through to the finish offering up a mild bid to be well clear of the rest for the show honors.

WHYISSHESOOLUCKY in tandem with DIRTY BIRD, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and weakened. MISS LOYALTY chased along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. DIRTY BIRD shied in at the start in reaction to MO FLASH breaking inwards and bumped and squeezed back
WHYISSHESOOLUCKY in concert with BEYOND DISCREET, chased five then four wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, angled five wide for home
and tired. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY got off to a rough start when bumped between foes and squeezed out bobbling when clipping heels with DIRTY BIRD
and conceded six to seven lengths to the front, chased four then three wide detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COBBLE HILL momentarily placed along the rail, got tipped out two to three wide approaching the three-eighths pole, continued to keep watch from
midpack until the end of the bend, was under a ride angling into path five during the early stages of the stretch run, rolled by the fighting front runners soon
afterwards, then kicked well clear under a light drive. PASSCODE procured a prominent position after losing its footing springing from the gate, sat perched
three wide during the run around the bend, was called upon for more spinning into the stretch, fought his way to a narrow advantage during the ensuing
furlong, proved no match for the top one a few jumps later, went on to win the place. OUR STORMIN NORMAN sat within striking distance of the front
runners from path two during the initial half, was sent out approximately five wide for the stretch run, was one of those fighting for the place late, came up
short. I SAW IT ALL took up the chase from the three path, was moved out six wide for racing room during the initial portion of the stretch, narrowed in to
earn the final significant slice of the pot. LARCENY four wide on the turn, went a couple of paths farther off the rail stepping into the lane, mustered up a
mild response. WAYNES FOOTSTEPS came out at the start, was taken hold then scooted to the front end, argued for control from along the rail for the
opening half, turned into the lane, came under siege, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds and backed away. MORE THAN STRIKING sparred for the
top from the two path before weakening in the final furlong. OUR AMERICAN STAR checked getting squeezed at the start, saved ground for most of the first
half, came into the lane and made no impact. MAC'S REVOLUTION checked getting squeezed in the shadow of the starting gate, pursued the pace from
the two path on the turn, lacked a response after entering the stretch. IMPLIED VOLATILITY two wide entering the turn, was five wide exiting it, came up
empty. CHARGE AHEAD saved ground until the head of the stretch and faltered. RIDOLFO parked out three to four wide on the turn, was through after
going a half.

HONEY WON'T sent over to the rail after the break, abandoned it for the two path midpoint on the turn, swung into the action by swinging four wide into the
stretch, kicked into his best with under an eighth to go, wrested away the lead in the final seventy yards and shook free. DURESS stumbled at the start,
recovered and took up position at the back of the pack, departed the backstretch from the three path, crept up late on the bend, was four wide and poised to
strike the front end when given its cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, did indeed forge to a slim lead by the eighth pole, saw the winner closing
in, was overpowered by that one when finally confronted in deep stretch, salvaged second. MO GOTCHA sparred for control from the two path, had
FREGUA call it a day as the second split was being posted, gained no relief from pressure, got called upon feeling a pair of rivals to the outside approaching
the quarter pole, held out for another sixteenth before releasing the top, weakened into the show slot. QUARKY chased the pace from the three path, spun
into the lane challenging MO GOTCHA, bobbled appearing to take a bad step right around the three-sixteenths marker, fought onward for a little while
longer before backing away. FREGUA (GB) dueled for the lead from along the inside route for a half and faltered.

Footnotes
GOOD CREDENCE hustled along to establish the top during the opening panel, was switched over to much milder hand urging after achieving the goal,
showed the way from the inside route, feeling some pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside from the nine-sixteenths marker to the end of the bend,
responded when cued up in upper stretch kicking away to lead by its largest margin with a furlong to go, stayed onward with good energy to remain in the
clear. BUSTIN SCONES pursued the pace from the two path, made it into the stretch, altered course towards path five in midstretch to secure needed
racing room, rallied for the place, although posing no danger to the top one. POT OF HUNNY recovered in short order after stumbling at the start, departed
the backstretch from the three path, was fanned out five wide from upper to midstretch, narrowed in to be along for the show. RUVIES IN TIME crept up to
the front runners on the backstretch, latched on to them to make it a three-way scramble for the top a short distance from the half mile pole, kept up its
pursuit in earnest on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, remained a prominent factor for a little while longer before backing away. SINGLE
VERSE stayed in path two after the start, disputed the pace from between rivals from around the half mile pole to the head of the stretch, gave way. FAIR
LASSIE underwent a two wide journey on the turn, was about as wide coming into the stretch, lacked a response. WAILIN JOSIE dove in to the pocket after
the start, had a good view of the contested pace, cut the corner with a clear rail corridor available, came up empty.

Footnotes
LEITONE (CHI) dueled from the three path with MCERIN to his inside down the backstretch joined to the outside by HAN SENSE nearly latched on, tucked
to the two path into the turn and vied between rivals as HAN SENSE advanced outside, shook off the inner rival past the five-sixteenths knocking heads now
with HAN SENSE placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside and
gamely repelled the challenge to inch away to the finish and prevail. HAN SENSE got brushed at the start by FLEET IRISH breaking outwards, raced five
wide in closest aim of the duel early on before tucking three to four wide through the turn advancing to vie outside a pair, was heads apart for command at
the five-sixteenths when shaking off MCERIN in tandem with the top one, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on through the
length of the stretch but was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. SUPER DUDE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to
four wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly for the show honors. MCERIN coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of LEITONE down the backstretch
before vying inside a pair through the turn, got shaken off at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. HEAVY ROLLER
three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FAMILY BIZ chased just off the
inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.
AMERICAN LINCOLN chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went seven to eight wide for home and tired. FLEET IRISH broke
out at the start brushing HAN SENSE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and trailed throughout.

QIAN B C got slammed into by MORE GRAYFUL after brushing with UNCLE GEORGE, went over to the rail soon afterwards, was patiently ridden closing
on the front runners on the turn, cut the corner into the lane under encouragement, continued to whittle away at the deficit, saw BIG WONDER slowly begin
to shift to the outside, slipped by that foe once the hole was large enough, then gamely fended off its fellow in-the-money finishers to prevail. IMPAZIBLE
ODDS steadily advanced into contention from the two path on the turn, stepped onto the head of the stretch and challenged in earnest, fought with vigour as
the outermost of three in the last eighth, was determined to the wire, but wound up denied. BIG WONDER away well, remained forwardly placed, disputed
the pace from the outside during the opening phases, cleared SCOCCIATORE and slid over to the rail, saw the aforementioned apply pressure to his right
until the three-eighths pole, kicked clear of that one only to face fresher rivals right afterwards, was put to a drive for the drive home, desperately clung to the
lead, began to inch its way to the outside beginning from the furlong grounds, got overhauled by the winner in deep stretch, battled onward from between
foes, ultimately had to settle for the show. MORE GRAYTFUL out at the start, bumped soundly with the winner, cut over to the rail coming up to the
conclusion of the backstretch, stayed within striking distance in the pocket, got worked out into path four during the first half of the stretch run, flattened out.
TURBO DRIVE took up the chase from the three path on the turn, shifted inward for the drive, made no headway. FLY FLY AWAY strung out three wide on
the turn, lacked the needed response. UNCLE GEORGE stumbled after bumping lightly with another at the start, had the pilot pop of his iron momentarily,
got set up along the inside, route, went on to save ground to no avail. THE SINNER IS YOU pursued the pace at or near the two path, was maneuvered into
the five path from the five-sixteenths pole to midstretch, had no rally. BEACH FRONT three wide onto the turn, was ridden four wide exiting it, backed away.
SCOCCIATORE along the inside arguing for control control, went at it with BIG WONDER from path two afterwards to the three-eighths pole before
faltering. JACK OF CLUBS two wide onto the turn, displayed only brief foot.

Footnotes
WARDENOFTHENORTH brushed the off side stall at the start, chased five then four wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat to the outside and inched away kept busy
to the wire. TRUE PALACE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five
to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong running on willingly but was ultimately staved off while along
for the place honors. LORD CAMDEN came inwards and leaned on INSPECTOR HENNING shortly after the start and jostled for position for a few strides,
chased three wide down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home in behind J P'S
SONG, angled to the inside straightened away and had that rival drift in and was forced to steady then darted outwards angling from the three-sixteenths to
the eighth pole five to six paths for a clearance, then ran on to procure the show honors well clear of the rest. AFTER PROM PARTY coaxed from the gate,
pressed the pace from the outside four then three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over brief command near the quarter pole, swung
three wide into upper stretch displaced from the front and drifted in straightened away forcing the aforementioned foe to steady and angle out sharply, then
tired through to the finish. CONSTANT QUEST chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
and tired. J P'S SONG showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from AFTER PROM PARTY to the outside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, got headed briefly near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home back to command, dug in and yielded at the three-sixteenths,
then tired through to the wire. WARRIORS REVENGE bumped at the start by BOOK OF DELANCEY who broke inwards awkwardly, chased four wide until
tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and made no impact.
INSPECTOR HENNING coaxed from the gate, got leaned on by LORD CAMDEN soon after the start and jostled with J P'S SONG to his inside, chased two
to three wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.
BOOK OF DELANCEY got away a half a beat slow and awkward breaking inwards and bumping WARRIORS REVENGE, chased five paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
