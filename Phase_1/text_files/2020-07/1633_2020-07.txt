OVERZEALOUS was reserved behind the pace, moved up to pass the leader from between horses into the turn, briefly dueled a horse, led at the top of the
stretch and was confidently handled in deep stretch. NEPAL UP travelled inside unhurried, rallied in the four path on the turn, drifted out in the stretch and
kept on late. JUST LIKE RICHIE took the rail on the first turn, raced widest on the backstretch, dueled outside a foe on the far turn, and held third while no
match for the top two. HOT TRAFFIC had the lone lead to the far turn, was passed and no threat after that. ADOLFO broke awkward, was last early, pushed
on up the backstretch and had no response.

NO VA MAS was in tight at the rail early, angled out for room up the backstretch, rallied to catch the leader at the top of the turn and dueled another foe
from there to the wire, holding that challenger at bay in a close finish. STREET QUEEN was off slow, rallied in the five path on the turn to pass the fading
leader, dueled the winner to the wire and could not get by.;.ABSTAIN came from off the pace, lacked a rally on the turn, but found more in the stretch to get
the show spot. MISS EMMA'S SONG tracked the leader in hand and held fouirth while weakening down the lane. CYCLONE MILLIE led clear to the top of
the turn, was passed by ralllying horses and gave way. WHODUNNITANDRAN was no threat. SEA SERENADE (GB) was last and struggling in deep

Footnotes
TING TANG travelled reserved at the rail, steadied inside on the far turn, stayed inside down the stretch and closed determinedly to grab the lead and fend
off a stubborn foe. EDGE OF NIGHT was behind the leader at the rail, raced inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch with good energy but could not get
by the winner. LOVELY LADY LINDA was off the pace, gave chase on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and evened out. CRISTALINDA was
unhurried and gained ground in deep stretch. VAN DESK CANDY raced between horses on the first turn then stayed mid pack to the finish. SUCCOTASH
loped along early and came very wide into the stretch to improve position. TRUE LIGHT had a clear lead in the first turn, was caught on the far turn,
regained the lead, and tired in the stretch. TICKET OUT swerved in at the start and was no factor. HEAVEN SENT ANGEL ran mid pack, moved up three
wide on the far turn and flattened in the stretch. AFLAXENDREAM was always outrun.

Footnotes
JUNIOR GILLIAM four wide run to turn, shaken up to the quarter pole, responded well and drew off through the drive. HERE'S CARLOS inside trip to turn,
angled widest into the stretch run while gaining too late. KINKY BOOTS dueled from inside to quarter pole, dug in gamely to hold the third spot. SO
CAUGHT UP IN U raced mid pack to the turn and only improved position in the stretch run. KITCHI well placed to the turn but faded back between horses
late. KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE steadied and rank to the turn and gave way from the quarter pole. ST. RONANS never a real menace at any call.
ACCOUSTICAL off slow, rushed outside to the turn while used up and gave way through the stretch. DUMBMARK never a factor. R HOT TWENTY'S was
off slow and always trailed.
