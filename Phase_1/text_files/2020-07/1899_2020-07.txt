Footnotes
G'WILDCAT forwardly placed from the start outside, surged to the front to take over in the turn, clear through most of the stretch, enough left late to last.
CHU CHU'S LEGACY outrun early, moved outside then moved to be three wide through the turn, continued back into the lane, steered widest for the drive,
late run to be up for the place. WISE ANCHOR moved up inside to vie for the early advantage, showed the way into the turn, fell back off the winner then
moved out, chased that same rival into the stretch, outkicked late for the place, held the show. SARAH'S VISION broke alertly, settled in the second flight
out in the strip, four wide into the lane, extended battle for the second spot, outkicked for that position while between horses at the wire. BUNKIE'S SONG
broke with the field, in the second flight early between horses, raced three wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. FRIENDOFTHECOURT
broke back and failed to menace. DREWHUSTLE dwelt at the start, continued to trail turn, five wide into the lane, failed to rally. COAST GUARDSMAN vied
early between foes, was giving way while getting out late in the turn,continued to back up stretch.

Footnotes
DRILLING REPORT dueled early along the inside, shook clear before a half, maintained daylight to the wire under a steady hand ride to win ridden out.
PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN closest to the dueling leaders, chased the winner through the second turn, extended duel for the second spot off the inside,
determined. MUFFIN NUTS dueled early outside the winner, fell back off that rival before four furlongs, second flight through the second turn, long drive for
the place, outfinished for that position while well clear of the others. EASY TO MISS void of early foot out in the strip, came four wide into the stretch,
improved position while widest in the drive, not a threat to the top three. MR LEO went one paced throughout in the two path, lacked closing kick. ANDIAMO
GIACOMO broke well, fell back off the pace, had nothing for the drive when the real running began at the head of the lane. PRINCE CARLOS last to leave,
showed little in trailing throughout.

Footnotes
JUST A BANDIT never far back off the inside, moved closer while three wide exiting the turn, lodged an outside bid nearing the furlong grounds, wore down
rival under firm handling. COOL SPRING also forwardly placed from the start, pressed the leader into and through early turn, advanced to duel into the
stretch, put that rival away just as the winner was moving alongside nearing the furlong pole, gave ground grudgingly until late, remained clear for the place.
PRINCESS GIANNA settled off the pace and the inside, three wide exiting the turn, along for the show late. GLADYS' FRONTIER broke alertly, sprinted
clear soon after, showed the way early turn, dueled into the stretch closest to the inside and weakened when headed by the runner up. L L L COLLEGE
FUND went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. EASTER GIRL saved ground to no avail. ASDRUBAL off a step slow, remained always
back. CRESCENT LACE forwardly placed early along the inside, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
SHARP WITTED with the early pace along the inside, fell back off the leader in the turn, rebid along the rail entering the stretch, dueled past the furlong
marker then kicked clear under steady handling, held runner up safe lte. MAY HOUR lacked early foot, came four wide into the stretch, split foes when
straightened for home, finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the winner. AW SHUCKS with the early pace in the two path and between horses, fell
back with the winner off the leader in the turn, went evenly through the stretch, saved the show. HUFFS TAZ A BOO settled in mid pack off the inside, raced
in the two path through the turn, improved slightly in the drive, not enough late to earn the show.l. PURE VALOR broke outward and back, was used to
advance into the first flight, shook clear midway on the turn, faltered when confronted by the winner when straightened for home. TALKOTHTOWN broke
back, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. INTERACTIF MOMENT in mid pack outside, raced four out to five wide
through the turn, tired in the drive. CHASIN GRACIE broke alertly, set or forced the early pace between horses, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
DOUBLE COOL lacked speed while four wide into the first turn, in some traffic while still back in the second turn, came three wide into the lane, brushed,
split foes, finished willingly late to be up in time. OUR BERMUDA settled off the early pace, advanced three wide to challenge midway on the final turn, took
over into the lane, clear a furlong out, continued to lead late, could not contain the winner, lasted for the place. NINE IS MINE allowed the pace to go early,
lost some position while saving ground second turn, continued along the inside in moving closer approaching the furlong grounds, lacked a closing punch,
finished best of the rest. TUNE MY GUITAR raced in mid pack, ranged up to loom a threat four wide turning for home,brushed with the winner upper stretch
then flattened out in the drive. SON OF PATRIOT lacked speed toward the inside, in some traffic inside the winner late in the final turn, continued behind
horses into the lane, switched out to be widest when straightened for home, managed only some mild late interest down the middle of the strip.
JENNOVODKA away in good order, sprinted well clear in the first turn, continued to show the way by daylight up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to
the runner up turning for home then faltered. NOMOREQUESTIONS void of speed, continued back the middle half, came five wide into the lane, picked off
a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TONIGHTS STAR last away, was never involved. IZZY B WINN five wide into the first turn, moved
up to chase the leader through that bend and onto the backstretch, stopped in the far turn, jogged in.

GOFORTHEWINECOURSE back off the early pace, moved out and closer three wide into the turn, outside bid late in the bend, dueled passed the furlong
marker, edged clear late under firm handling. DOUBLE PRIORITY away well, set or forced the pace for a half inside, hooked up with the winner for a stretch
duel, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, far clear of the rest. WICKED STATEMENT lacked early foot, improved while saving ground through the turn,
proved no match for the top two, clear of the others. BIG COUNT broke alertly, was a pace factor for a half in the two path, weakened steadily through the
stretch. CLEVER PRINCE lacked speed, four wide trip through the turn, had nothing for the drive. WENDY'S WILL within striking distance early, staged a
steady retreat. ODAY SECRET broke slowly then outward, far back, jogged in. PRAY FOR JAKE in mid pack early, stopped in the turn, eased stretch,
walked off.

Footnotes
KISS OF THE WOLF broke well from the outside, dueled into and through the first turn, continued to alternate up front through a quick half mile, disposed of
the other speed turning for home, clear a furlong out, enough left to hold off the runner up. LIL BIT OF JUSTICE settled early three wide, began to advance
far turn, continued in the three path turning for home, slowly getting to the winner late. SHAQ JACK trailed far back early, continued to lag the middle half,
came four wide into the lane, rallied for the show while not a serious threat to the top two. REDDING COTEAU moved up inside after the break to duel,
helped set some lively early fractions, gave way turning for home. HEZANOTHERCORREDOR last to leave, was never dangerous and was going evenly at
the end. ROSES N' RUBIES chased the duel for six furlongs, began to give way turning for home. G CISIVE raced in mid pack for six furlongs, had nothing
for the drive. CLASSY TONI finished early, far back.

Footnotes
TREVILION broke with the field, raced forwardly into the first turn outside, pressed the dueling leaders in the three path up the backstretch, advanced and
took over late in the final turn, steadily drew out through the lane while being kept to pressure. MAKE ME SMILE settled back off the early pace and behind
the winner, moved out, advanced closer three wide turning for home, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. MISTAKE
PRESENT dueled up front while closet to the inside, offered little resistance to the winner when that one took over late in the final turn, proved no match for
the runner up through the stretch as well, comfortably lasted for the show. CAFE DU MONDE void of speed, made little impact. MY BOOK alternated up
front in the two path for six furlongs then faltered in the drive. SOCIAL MISFIT was finished early, well beaten.

Footnotes
WRINKLED ROSE in the second flight early while off the inside, swung out while being roused exiting the turn, collared the leader just inside the furlong
grounds, quickly clear to win going away. AWISHFORGREELEY pressed the early leader in the two path, dueled with that one through the turn, shook clear
when straightened for home, no match for the winner, clear of the others. STARBUCK LUCK within striking distance in the second flight three wide, lacked a
closing response in the drive, narrowly lasted for the show. CALAJA lacked speed outside, came four wide into the lane, improved slightly while in some
traffic, gaining for the show. WISH FOR INTEREST in mid pack while saving ground, continued along the inside into the lane, encountered some traffic a
furlong out, moved out a bit for room and finished up evenly. WARRIORS SPEAK last to leave, void of early foot, saved ground turn, improved position
without posing a serious threat. MANE PRIORITY broke in good order, narrowly showed the way into the turn inside, dueled through the turn with the runner
up, gradually gave way in the drive. GLADS LOVE CAT made little impact in remaining back. WILD BOTTOM BLUES was also always outrun. LUCKY LILY
BE forwardly placed off the inside for three furlongs, backed up in the drive. BLUE SUEDE RANSOM shuffled back just after the start, trailed throughout.
