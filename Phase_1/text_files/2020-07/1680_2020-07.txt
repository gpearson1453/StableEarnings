Footnotes
RIGHT LANE LUKASZ settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then cut the corner with a rail opening into
the stretch, rallied on the inside, closed fast under a right-handed whip to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, switched to a left-handed whip at that point
and held off the fast closing runner-up under strong urging. VAPORMAN went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, went three then
four wide on the far turn, was passed by VIEW MAGIC at the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch while behind horses then altered to the outside
coming to the furlong marker and finished with good energy but missed while able to get the place. VIEW MAGIC was put under restraint and taken back
between horses early then tossed his head while keen, moved in towards the rear while tugging at the bit, rounded the first turn in the four path, settled last
but one, advanced four then five wide on the far turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final furlong, lost the advantage
to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while clear for the show. VALENTINE STREET went four wide on the first turn, settled on the
outside, went three wide on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then driven four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and lacked
the needed kick while just able to get the last spot in the superfecta. BANJO BILL traveled around the first turn in the two path, prompted the pace on the
outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn then came three wide into the stretch, made a brief bid under a drive into the final furlong but
weakened. VALID THOR went around the first turn in the two to three path under restraint, was well placed in hand down the backstretch, saved ground on
the far turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch then chased the leader, made a brief bid into the final furlong but came up empty. ADONIS CREED
set the pace on the inside, inched away from the nearest pursuer on the far turn, was asked outside the three-sixteenths then came under a drive into upper
stretch, lost the lead near the furlong marker and gave way. MIDAS CAT lunged outward at the start and was off slow, spotted the front about three to four
lengths, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside on the far turn, gained into upper stretch, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and was out-kicked. MR. NICKELS went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked while three wide on the far
turn, came four wide into the stretch, was urged along into the final furlong, lacked room behind a wall of horses in the final sixteenth and lost any chance at
a minor award. WHITE WALLS went three to four wide on the first turn, settled towards the front, lost position in the two path on the far turn, lacked room
while three wide into upper stretch, found room into the final furlong but lacked the needed response.
