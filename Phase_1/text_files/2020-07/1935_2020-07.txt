Footnotes
LINEMANS CHECK was three wide in the first turn but was able to get to the rail up the backstretch came three wide entering the stretch and drew clear to
win handily while drifting in through the stretch. ELUSIVE FLAME showed the best early speed but was off the rail was challenged first on the inside by
Panic Button and held that one at bay but could not fend off the winner. PANIC BUTTON was a bit wide in the first turn but got to the rail up the backstretch
came through along the inside when the pacesetter raced off the rail but could never go by. LAW BREAKER showed good early speed while in the two path
but tired on the second turn. BOURBON PRIDE was well back of the pack early raced on the inside and offered no serious bid. CO CO KID came four wide
on the second turn and had nothing for the drive. COOL HAND LUCAS was four wide on the first turn and was never a threat while eased in the final stages.

WRIGHT WINGED showed the best early speed and was able to get to the inside and opened a clear lead on the turn and went on to win handily with
plenty left in the tank. NOT THAT I RECALL showed little early speed to trail early while on the inside came between foes in the stretch to get up for second
while not a serious threat to the winner. OVER EXPOSED Was away alertly but dropped back a bit up the backstretch had the perfect inside trip and held
third. CHEVERIE Made a bid in the three path on the turn and was passing horses through the lane. LIGHTNING LADY Raced along the inside came out for
the drive an could not make up ground in the stretch. WANDERNINTHEFOREST Showed good early speed outside the winner but tired on the turn. HIT
THE DECK Broke on the lead but quickly dropped back and was never in contention. CLASSY AND FAST Showed good early speed while hung three wide

SHIVERHERTIMBERS showed the best early speed right from the outset opened a long lead on the second turn and just cruised home while geared down
in the final sixteenth to win easily. STARLIGHT TWIST circled the field on the second turn and while not a threat to the winner was clearly second best.
HOLY DIVER raced in the three path and could not make up ground. MINE FOR A SONG chased the pace for three quarters and had little left in the
stretch. DAWNS MORNING raced along the inside and lacked the needed rally. WARTIME LADY raced along the inside and had no rally in the stretch.
MISS WINE TOPPER had a three path trip and had no response in the stretch. IRREPLACEABLE showed brief speed in the two path and faded after a
half.

Footnotes
SIX NINETY ONE Showed the best early speed opened up on the field drew clear and won easily. CHUCKMATE Was well back in the early stages came
through on the inside and was up for second. CADILLAC CHROME was mid pack then came wide and was up for third. NEPTUNE'S SEAL raced along the
inside but could not make up ground. LONE SHOTGUN RIDER showed good early speed in the two path and tired through the stretch. SILIS raced wide the
entire trip and could not make up ground. COLD SNACK THIRTY raced along the inside and had no rally. CHILANGO raced mid pack and had no rally.
CALL A COP raced wide and never mounted a serious bid. JOHN ARNOLD raced on the outside and was never a serious factor. DANNY'S BAD ROY was
well back throughout and not a factor. BAR ROOM BRAWL was off slow and trailed throughout.
