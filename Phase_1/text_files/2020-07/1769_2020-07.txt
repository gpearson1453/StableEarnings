Footnotes
SIX POINT RACK pressed the pace outside BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ), got pushed out to the five path into the stretch, responded to steady pressure and
took over leaving mid stretch then edged away driving. BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) set the pace off the rail to the second turn, drifted out four wide to the
stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. RIVER OF CHAMPAGNE stalked the top two to the second turn, was forced out to the seven path into the
stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. UBER STAR settled for a half mile, was three wide on the second turn but did not threaten in the
drive. LOVENSEEK was five or six wide throughout and never a factor.

THUNDER BOAT was outsprinted to the turn, came three then four wide to the stretch, responded to strong urging in the drive and was along in time for
Santos Rivera's first victory. JOHN'S INTUITION set the pace while off the rail to the stretch, responded when hooked by JAZZ STREET, battled that one
through the final furlong but was tagged on the wire by the winner. JAZZ STREET stalked the pace early, was fanned four wide to the stretch, responded to
be on terms leaving mid stretch, dug in determinedly but was bested for the win and nipped for the place. THE FILTER trailed to the turn, was four then five
wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. WINK AND A DREAM pressed the pace inside JAZZ STREET, came three wide to the stretch but got
outkicked to mid stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PAPA DO RUN was chasing the pace to the second turn, bid three then four wide when set down, rallied to mid stretch, got bumped by CLASSIC CHAMP
leaving the furlong grounds but surged in the final fifty yards and was up in time. TURNAROUND contested the pace while three wide to the backstretch,
raced two wide to the stretch, edged away to mid stretch but was tiring and could not stall the winner. CLASSIC CHAMP had no speed, settled to the
second turn, came three wide to the stretch, eased out for room then drifted inward, bumped the winner leaving the furlong grounds and finished willingly.
GIMME SPACE had no speed, settled to the second turn, bid four wide to othe stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. AERIAL DECOY broke
slow, trailed to the stretch and was never a threat. TADEO pressed the runnerup to the second turn, pushed up to stick a head in front at the five sixteenths
but was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. BERNARDOS HIDEAWAY tracked the pace to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but gave out in the
drive.

Footnotes
CARRIE'S SUCCESS was outsprinted to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed quickly to win going away. LASTING
LIGHT stalked the leaders four wide to the turn, pushed up to engage for the lead into the stretch, dug in determinedly but was no menace to the winner
while holding second. COZZE KID also was stalking early, raced two wide to mid turn then swung out five deep into the stretch, was outfinished by the
winner and could not get by LASTING LIGHT for second. BOUNTY OF GOLD was on the pace from the outset, raced two wide to the stretch, stayed to mid
stretch then was tiring. FULL OF PEPPER stumbled badly two strides out of the gate, trailed two wide to the stretch and could not threaten in the drive.
PAPAYA had no speed, raced four wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. MAYCEE JO hustled to contest the pace between rivals and three
wide to the stretch then was tiring and gave out in the final furlong.

MAXINAMILLION was unhurried to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in upper stretch then held under steady urging. SPEED
SAVER was also unhurried early, raced three then four wide to the stretch and closed determinedly to be second best. AZTEC WARRIOR was five wide
while trailing to the second turn, remained five wide to the stretch and was gaining in the final furlong. MY FRIEND GEORGE was settled to the half mile
pole, saved ground on the second turn while closing the gap then came up empty in the drive. COOL HUNTER was sent hard for the lead, set swift fractions
to the second turn and tired after six furlongs. GIANT MARK was also sent for speed but outsprinted, chased COOL HUNTER to the second turn, raced
three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and also tired.
