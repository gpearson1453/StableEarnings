Footnotes
WAR EAGLE'S LOVE was lightly bumped by a horse nearing the first turn, stayed with the reserved leaders to the far turn, quickened at the rail, led and
managed to hold sway late. SOUR PEACH sat reserved in mid pack, moved well while inside on the turn, steadily gained ground down the stretch and fired
late to keep second safe. BIG BLUE MAGIC brushed a foe at the start, loped along near the front early, angled outside for room nearing the far turn,
managed second down the stretch but was passed late by a game closer to settle for the show. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY was brushed at the start, waited,
came widest into the stretch, raced erratic, but closed best. SWEET CARLI broke out and bumped a foe at the start, lightly bumped another horse nearing
the first turn, went to a reserved lead, lost position on the turn as well as down the stretch. TENACIOUS SALLY was bumped at the start and always back.
KIMBERLEY DREAM was pinched back at the start, factored to the stretch and faded late. SECRET TOWN trailed.

Footnotes
ESCALERA raced mid pack in a strung out field, made a five wide middle move on the turn to range up to the leader, dueled down the stretch on the outside
, was bumped twice by that foe and got up nearing the wire. KITCHI bumped a horse at the start, was the speed off the rail, hooked up in a duel down the
stretch, then drifted out and bumped that foe twice before yielding late. SOLO DRINK was pinched back at the start, raced off the lead to the stretch, and
grinded away between horses down the stretch to keep the show. FRED'S COUNTRY BOY was well placed behind the leader early, went four wide on the
turn and took part in a long three horse drive down the lane, just missing show. HIGH RISK STRATEGY was bounced between horses at the start, took the
rail mid pack in a strung out field, and got involved in a long three horse drive down the lane but came up short. HONDO GUSTO posed no threat. SUN
BROWN raced widest throughout and always back. PER OHIO STATE RACING COMMISSION RULING #2020-BP-021, DATED 08/27/2020 ESCALERA
WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
INFINITE pressed an inside foe to the turn, took the lead, was shaken up at the top of the stretch, responded and was urged to stay safe late. DRAGON
DREW was under restraint early, pursued the leader on the turn, gave chase down the stretch but was unable to seriously threaten the winner. REVEREND
AJ came from off the pace, made a middle move on the turn but leveled out down the stretch. CITY FRONT took an inside trip from off the pace and evened
out on the turn. SPARKYS SURPRISE bumped a horse at the start, raced inside at the rear and was no factor, but gained position in the stretch. HIGH
ESTEEM swerved in and out, bumped a horse, and steadied at the start, raced outside a foe at the rear, drifted out in the stretch and was no threat.
FORBETTERORWORSE raced as the inside speed and tired on the rail in the stretch.
