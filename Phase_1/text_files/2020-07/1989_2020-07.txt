Footnotes
SEMI SWEET raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and
drew off with complete authority. GAZING was hustled along to open a clear lead before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace, could not
match strides with the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. LITTLE DANCER broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing
four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive. SHOE GAME was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further
into the stretch and finished evenly. FIERY CAUSE raced four-wide through the first turn, settled just off the leaders, moved five-wide through the second
turn and lacked the needed rally. SALSA VERDE was never far back, raced four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
MR. TAKAHASHI was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by DUDLEY STUDLEY approaching the
stretch, vied with that rival and gamely prevailed. DUDLEY STUDLEY was bumped at the break, stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to
engage nearing the quarter, vied with that winner but could not get by that rival in the drive. ROYAL BAR was bumped at the start, raced just off the leaders
early, angled out nearing the quarter, offered a bid with a furlong to run and finished willingly. SWAY ROAD was bumped at the break, lacked early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. SOLAR HEAT was bumped at the start, lacked early
foot, saved ground through the turn, steadied in mid-stretch, angled out and finished with good courage. BULLET EXPRESS disputed the pace with the
winner from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. ATTERCOP settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
ZIPPIN WINE was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

in at the start, recovered quickly to race just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and lacked the needed late response. CLUB
ROYALE was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SCARRAZANO showed no early speed, saved
ground through the turn and was not a factor. VAROMA lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to menace. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN

Footnotes
AERO STREET lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch, reached the fore nearing the sixteenth pole and
quickly drew off. BATTLE POINT RED broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing four-wide throughout but could not hold the winner safe through the
final sixteenth. TRIBAL IMPACT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished
willingly. DECKLOAD hopped at the start, pressed the pace while racing five-wide and weakened through the final furlong. GREAT EAGLE settled off the
leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished evenly. PREACHINATDINNER lagged early, raced off the rail through
the turn and was not a factor. CELTURIAN raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. ROUGH RIDE was away in
good order to dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs. ZOOMBIYA broke awkwardly, raced four-wide through the turn and
did not reach contention.

LOCHNESS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. NORSKI was off a step slow then allowed to settle,
saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady rally to gain the place. WILSON TO LOCKETT settled off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. SHAMISEN tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and
failed to gain late. ALWAYS WORKING was off slow, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and was not a
factor. VIOLENT BEHAVIOR settled off the leaders early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not
threaten. R B EYE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. MOJAVE broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.

inside the sixteenth pole and drew off. PEGASUS CHAMP showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished with good energy to gain the place. MENSCH was bumped at the break then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished willingly. STRATEGIC HOUR was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, was
bumped in mid-stretch while retreating and continued to give way. CLIFTON HOLLOW settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
failed to rally. PLAN IN THE MAKIN was bumped at the start, stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter,
opened a clear lead and gave way through the final furlong. DOIN DOUBLE TIME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed
to menace. ARMY KING was bumped at the break, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. SA LUTE MR. H
broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside and weakened through the final furlong. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE
BUMPING BETWEEN STRATEGIC HOUR AND COOLER THAN YOU IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED COOLER
THAN YOU HAD CAME OUT TO BUMP STRATEGIC HOUR AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH. THE RACE WAS HAND
