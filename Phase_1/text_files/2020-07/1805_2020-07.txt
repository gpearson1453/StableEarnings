COUNTER CLAIM hesitated and was off very slowly, quickly advanced inside on the turn, angled out, rallied four wide into the lane, closed willingly outside
in deep stretch and was up in time. ROADHOUSE BLUES raced off the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, put a head in front in
midstretch, dug in gamely and was caught nearing the wire. SHE'S CLASSY set the pace, dueled inside on the turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch, then
weakened. WOODBINE WAY stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide on the turn and tired. MISS PARFAIT chased outside and gave way.

JAYDINE set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused passing the quarter pole and kicked clear under urging. WICKED MERCURY
tracked along the inside, bid between rivals on the far turn, could not stay with JAYDINE in the stretch and remained clear for the place spot. POSITIVE
POWER raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane, gained mildly outside and was up for third. ALONG THE WAY stalked outside a rival,
bid three wide on the far turn, weakened and held on for fourth. SWEETOLOGY raced off the pace with an inside trip, angled out for the drive and lacked a
rally. RAZOR GIRL raced off the pace inside, rode the rail into the stretch and failed to threaten. SACRED UNION raced off the pace and did not factor.
WANNA BE REGAL was steadied after the start and outrun.

Footnotes
BIG RED ROCKS set the pace on the inside, dueled with BIG PERM on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch drive and edged away late. IF NOT
NOW stalked two wide, then tracked the dueling leaders on the far turn, loomed entering the lane, then raced greenly, shifted to the rail and closed late for
second. BIG PERM pressed the pace, bid two wide, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely in the lane and was outkicked. MASTERIO was
bumped at the start, raced off the pace, rode the rail into the lane and lacked a stretch rally. BEE BY THE SEA pulled in the early stages, raced inside on
the first turn, was steadied at the five furlong marker, then failed to threaten. MILLIES PARTY BOY was bumped at the start, raced five wide on the first turn,
then chased four wide and weakened. COOL ASSASSIN raced three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace and had no rally. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT
chased three wide and tired. STABLER was steadied entering the clubhouse turn, raced inside and did not factor. NOW I'M BROKE tracked along the inside
and gave way.

rival nearing the sixteenth marker and dug in to the finish. CARIBBEAN GOLD tracked close up on the inside, chased on the turn and finished evenly on the
rail in the stretch. MUCHMORETHANTHIS chased close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn and weakened. CAJUN CASANOVA dueled inside for
command, battled on the turn, dug in, then weakened in the final furlong. SO STREET raced off the rail, off the pace, moved inside on the turn, had to
steady in traffic at the eighth pole, then failed to rally. MERU raced off the inside and did not factor. JOHNNY RITT stalked between rivals, chased on the
