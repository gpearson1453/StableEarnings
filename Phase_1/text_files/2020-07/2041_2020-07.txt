slowly, raced in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then chased through the stretch. BEL TEMPO, away slowly and off the pace, hugged the

Footnotes
WILLY'S CASTLE raced in mid pack, closed two to four-wide through the far turn, challenged mid stretch and prevailed late under a drive. SPANISH RIVER
stalked three-wide, bid midway on the far turn, moved clear, was joined a 16th out, battled to the end and just missed. GREENFIELD settled off the pace,
closed along the rail on the backstretch but was checked in tight quarters early on the far turn, continued to close inside then rallied gamely between foes.
LEONARD'S BAY stalked the pace along the rail, had a clear path ahead through the stretch but lacked the necessary closing response. GIANT MINE, off
slowly, raced in mid pack while four-wide throughout, was hustled on the far turn but evened out in deep stretch. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE got away slowly
and settled off the pace, chased hard on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. DECISION DAY stumbled just out of the gate then stalked the
pace, was hustled angling from the rail to four-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. WHO'S GOT IT broke a bit outward causing some minor
bumping between rivals, dueled, was headed mid turn, chased to the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. CONQUEST ELIMINATR dueled, yielded
near mid turn and dropped back gradually.

Footnotes
SHIRL'S SPEIGHT pressed the pace, lapped on the leader through the backstretch, bid mid turn and moved clear then held sway under a hand ride.
LUCKY CURLIN stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail to three-wide through the far turn and rallied gamely. DOTTED LINE hopped leaving the gate
and settled in mid pack, was hustled two top four-wide on the far turn then closed with some interest in the stretch. UNTITLED led quickly, set a pressured
pace, was engaged mid turn, dueled briefly then evened out in the stretch. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the final turn
then failed to menace in the stretch. LOOKINATAMIRACLE stalked three-wide on the first turn, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn but lacked a
closing response. PERFECT REVENGE broke inward and settled well off the pace, hustled on the far turn but never reached contention.

PACENZA broke slowly, raced in mid pack along the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch, launched a determined drive, bumped with TIZLEGAL in the late
stages but prevailed under a drive. RAVEN'S SONG forced the pace, bid mid turn, dueled, led in the late stages but was caught on the wire. BARKIN raced
in mid pack, came along the rail and two-wide through the turn, ran into traffic upper stretch, closed, split foes then finished gamely. CON THIEN set a
pressured pace from the rail, was joined mid turn, dueled, then gave way grudgingly. LILI'S SONG, away slowly, settled off the pace, came four-wide
through the turn, was all out in the stretch and was gaining steadily. TIZLEGAL raced in mid pack, came five-wide through the turn, chased four-wide into
the stretch, was determined, was bumped late but finished gamely. SING FOR KITTEN stalked from the rail, chased late turn then evened out in deep
stretch. CANDY'S DREAM, off slowly, stalked from the rail to three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. NIIGON'S MISCHIEF left slowly and
settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn but never reached contention. ITSKATHIESLUCKYDAY hit the gate leaving, stalked the pace, came three and
four-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. CAPABLE broke outward and settled off the pace, gained striking range on the turn but flattened
out in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY FINAL TRICK drove to the front soon after the start, held a length advantage around the turn, opened a wider lead while drifting into the three path in
upper stretch and needed the wire late, just lasting. THE GOOD WITCH settled in mid pack, gained ground two to four wide on the turn, fanned out into the
six path in upper stretch and closed resolutely to make it interesting in the final seventy yards. JACKIE MILTON settled off the pace, rallied in behind
runners on the turn, tapping on the brakes while awaiting room by the quarter pole, closed well when clear but couldn't match the runner-up's finish, the
show spot her reward. DEA DEL CIELO stalked the leader while inside another rival, ducked in behind the front runner in upper stretch, fading late and
losing positions the final seventy yards. SELFLESS DEVOTION chased along the inside, roused by her pilot into a three wide spot by the quarter pole but
could only muster a mild rally down to the wire. HONEY GIRL was off the pace and four to five wide on the turn, dropped back while in the seven path
turning for home but did gather herself up and mildly passed a few late while never threatening. DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE was three wide stalking the
early leader throughout, still in range in upper stretch but couldn't continue down the lane, backing up in the final sixteenth. SOLITUDE IS BLISS fell back to
race off the pace, rallied along the rail into striking distance on the turn but only galloped along inside down the lane, going up and down. ROSES LITTLE
GIRL dropped back to trail quickly, was well out of it throughout.

Footnotes
TWO SIXTY broke well and got out to set the pace, saved ground throughout, came off the rail while being asked late on the turn, responded in the stretch
and was never headed. SARATOGA VISION dropped back in the early stages, saved ground, was asked for more midway around the far turn, came off of
the rail at the 1/4 pole then finished gamely on the inside. OWLETTE showed early speed, stalked the leader while racing on the inside on the opening turn,
came off of the rail early on the backstretch, tracked the leader while racing two-wide on the far turn, launched a bid late on that turn but could not reach the
leader. MERVEILLEUX was in midpack early, tried to drop to the inside but instead angled three-wide entering the opening turn, raced in midpack down the
backstretch, was four-wide on the far turn, came under some asking at the 5/16ths pole then chased while racing widest down the stretch. DIAMOND
SPARKLES raced in midpack on the inside, advanced along the rail to stalk the pace down the backstretch, was in contention late on the turn but chased in
vain to the wire. LIVIN IN THE SIX showed some speed, dropped back a bit while racing two-wide on the opening turn, was three-wide on the far turn then
four-wide in upper stretch before tiring. AMERICAN TAP was off a bit slowly, raced two-wide throughout, was the clear trailer on the backstretch and had no
rally.

Footnotes
AFLEET KATHERINE settled in mid pack, closed three to five-wide through the turn, rallied between foes and was up just in time, driving. PERFECTION
CAT broke alertly then settled in mid pack, closed three-wide on the turn, challenged a 16th out, gained a narrow lead but was caught on the wire. PEACE
SEEKER settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, rallied gamely outside and just missed. COACH LORI settled in striking range,
came two-wide through the turn, bid a 16th out but was outgunned late. FAIRYWREN set a pressured pace, shook clear upper stretch, was headed a 16th
out and gave way grudgingly. GREY SEAL raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, was blocked late turn and again upper stretch, moved to the
rail but was closed off again and evened out. VESPOLINA settled off the pace, raced two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. CEE'S
OVERTURE mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, chased, but evened out late. ENCHANTED LADY
was steadied at the start, closed up but checked behind a rival midway through the backstretch, raced two and three-wide on the turn then had no rally.
MILLENNIUM FORCE stalked the pace, closed three-wide late turn but flattened out in the final furlong. TEACHER'S PET forced the pace, bid late turn but
was no match once they hit the stretch and faded through the final furlong. BOBBI'S LEGACY stalked the pace from the rail, was contentious as they turned
for home but began to fade from mid stretch.

RED HIERARCHY forced the pace, bid two-wide late turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch and widened under a hand ride. SUNSPEAR stalked the
pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and raced gamely to the end. KEEN ARTIE settled in mid pack, closed fast
angling two to four-wide late turn and finished under a determined stretch drive. GOLDMINE CAT broke with his head in the air, settled off the pace, circled
three to five-wide late turn but failed to menace in the stretch. NEWS FLASH dueled briefly, held a short lead on the turn, was joined approaching the top of
the stretch but was quickly headed and gave way. PATROL raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn but never reached contention.
COPINSAY raced in mid pack, chased three then two-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. COHIBA GHOST was steadied at the start and was
outrun early, closed on the turn but never reached contention. DOUBLE THE HEART stalked the pace, raced along the rail and two-wide on the turn but
lacked a rally. BALA FALLS settled in mid pack, chased four-wide late turn then evened out in the final furlong. MUSKOKA SON dueled to the turn, gave
