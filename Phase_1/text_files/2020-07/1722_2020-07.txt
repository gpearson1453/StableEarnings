Footnotes
DUSTY SKY showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail on the turn opened a good lead on the turn drifted out a bit entering the stretch but
held on gamely for the win. KURIOUS KENNEDY was in the two path on the turn dropped back a bit then came again but could never go by the winner.
WAIT FOR LOVE made a move four wide on the turn to get into contention but could not cut the margin on the top two. QUICK LEGEND had the perfect rail
trip behind the leaders but could not make up the needed ground. MINE FOR A SONG raced along the rail and had no rally in the stretch. DAWNS
MORNING raced along the rail while well back and could not make up ground. TEMPLE CITY DARLIN broke best and was allowed to settle on the outside
and never mounted a rally. MISS DILLY DALLY raced along the inside while well off the pace and was never a serious factor. MAGIC MOMENT raced three
wide on the turn and had no rally.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE FLAME broke on the lead was engaged for the first quarter then opened a good lead and held throughout while never asked for his best. BIG
LARRY came three wide on the turn to get into contention made slight progress through the lane and was up for second. DANDY VAN had the perfect rail
trip up the backstretch and on the turn to get closest to the leader but could not sustain the bid through the stretch. MAC'S DRAGON came four wide on the
turn but could not make up ground in the stretch. ULTIMATE OLIVER showed speed for the first quarter along the inside and then tired. GRANDPA'S
RANGER raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. OURS TO HOLD cwas four wide up the backstretch and on the turn and had little left in the
stretch. TALK BIG MONEY dropped back early and was never a serious threat.

path on the turn but could not make up ground in the stretch. MATRICULATE raced along the inside on the turn came out for the drive but had little to offer.
LAW BREAKER chased the pace on the inside but dropped back after the first quarter. COLONEL GOTHAM raced mid pack on the outside and faded. GO
