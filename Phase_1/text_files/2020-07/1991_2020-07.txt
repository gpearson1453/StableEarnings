Footnotes
SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR went up to force the issue outside TAKE ME AS I AM midway up the backstretch, took over after six furlongs, drew well clear under
a drive through upper stretch staying on her left lead, and was geared down the last sixteenth of a mile. WEST SIDE GIRL bumped lightly with PACIFIC
PRINCESS after the start, was reserved toward the inside early, came under a ride midway on the far turn in the two-path, and rallied mildly to get up for
second. TAKE ME AS I AM cleared to the early lead after an alert beginning, established a moderate pace, could not withstand the winner after six furlongs,
and weakened on her left lead. BEACH CHICK lost ground to the leaders up the backstretch, and lacked a response when roused. AUDREY was taken out
three wide around the first turn, and tired before reaching the stretch. DANESSA LADY was never a factor. KNOW HOW (GB) moved out four wide leaving
the first turn, and was finished after a half-mile. PACIFIC PRINCESS bumped lightly with WEST SIDE GIRL after the start, cornered greenly on the turns,
entered the stretch in the middle of the course and dropped far back.

Footnotes
SIZZLING ROMA received a bump from ADONAI BLESS at the start, saved ground behind the leaders on the turn, split horses rallying through the furlong
grounds and edged away late. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA dueled inside CHIQUI THE GRAY, won that dispute turning for home, got hooked by challengers
a furlong out and stayed on stubbornly on the fence. VARSOVIA broke slowly and was outrun early inside, advanced around the turn while shifting outside,
loomed in the four-path at the top of the stretch, lugged in a bit coming over in front of CHIQUI THE GRAY near the eighth-pole, and could not sustain the
rally. CHIQUI THE GRAY got outdueled by SHES ONE MAD MOMMA after a half-mile, and steadied slightly behind VARSOVIA while in the process of
giving way a furlong out. ADONAI BLESS got bumped into the eventual winner by MARCHING IN at the start, raced three wide and failed to menace.
MARCHING IN hit the left side of the gate and bumped ADONAI BLESS at the start, stayed in range three wide early, and faded nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
DIRECTOR'S CUT was never far back, went along covered up inside entering the far turn, was guided out three wide at the top of the stretch, rallied to
reach the leaders between horses through the furlong grounds, dueled inside SLEEK LYNX bumping with that rival through the late stages, and proved best
while bumping hard with SLEEK LYNX again just past the wire. SLEEK LYNX (GB) was unhurried inside for nearly six furlongs, swung out advancing four
wide past the quarter-pole, lugged in while moving to the leaders in upper stretch, bumped with DIRECTOR'S CUT through a late duel and came up second
best. TAP TAP BIRDIE raced in the two-path on the turns, and offered a mild response for the show. I GET IT attended the pace outside RACE DAY
SPEED, challenged turning for home, and could not sustain the rally. BOLD ARTICLE got pushed out by LIESEL at the start, advanced through the middle
stages three wide, and flattened out into the lane. RACE DAY SPEED broke out pushing LIESEL into BOLD ARTICLE. stayed out five wide approaching the
first turn floating out ALEXANDRA AM I, moved in setting a pressured pace, and gave way in upper stretch. INDY FRONT saved ground under a firm hold
early at the back, and had nothing when asked. LIESEL got pushed into BOLD ARTICLE by RACE DAY SPEED at the start, raced four wide early, and
dropped far back. ALEXANDRA AM I broke outward, got floated six wide into the first turn outside RACE DAY SPEED, dropped far back hard to handle
after a half-mile, was pulled up leaving the far turn, and walked off. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF SLEEK LYNX ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
HEART OF GOD chased PRETZEL early, closed in from outside around the turn, took over after three furlongs, and widened steadily through the stretch
under a drive. MARIA'S MIRAGE got bumped by MIRACULOUS at the start and was slow into stride, raced four wide on the turn, and rallied to go clear for
the place. PRETZEL sped clear early, got overtaken approaching the quarter-pole, and weakened through the drive. V K STAR bumped with MERMAID'S
TEAR up the backstretch, and faded inside after three-eighths of a mile. MERMAID'S TEAR was bumped between V K STAR and GOLD COUNTRY up the
backstretch, and faded before reaching the stretch. LYLA'S MARK was finished early inside. GOLD COUNTRY bumped with MERMAID'S TEAR up the
backstretch, dropped back three wide, and shied from the whip through the lane. MIRACULOUS was hesitant to load, hit the left side of the gate and
bumped MARIA'S MIRAGE at the start, and trailed every step.

Footnotes
JESSICA rallied to contention four then three wide around the turn, reached the front outside PERFECTCOMBINATION in upper stretch, and staved off a
last-ditch bid from TRUE ATKA to get the decision. TRUE ATKA turned her head and missed the break by about three lengths, put in a four-wide run around
the turn, idled through upper stretch making no headway, then kept to task late and just missed outside the winner. PERFECTCOMBINATION dueled inside
HIFALUTIN early, came under fire from JESSICA five-sixteenths out, and fought gamely through the last quarter-mile inside. SENSE A MILLION stayed
close early between horses, steadily lost position through the turn, cut the corner beginning to get going into the stretch, moved out to the three-path late
and finished with good courage. BION MAGIC was hustled along to stay in range early, and lacked the needed late response. GRAYCLIFF raced three wide
between horses into the turn, got shuffled back and steadied past the three-eighths pole, and tired. HIFALUTIN dueled outside PERFECTCOMBINATION
early, and was through by midway on the turn.

DARDANELLOS closed in around the turn from the four-path outside the leaders, drifted to the middle of the track at the top of the stretch, shied in and out
from the whip through a long drive and prevailed. GEONOSIS dueled outside MACHIAVELLI in the three-path, got joined from the outside by
DARDANELLOS after six furlongs, and battled on gamely to the end. UNLIMITED DATA tracked the leading trio on the turn, bid along the rail at the top of
the stretch, but flattened out staying on his left lead. KING TIDE saved ground throughout, and passed tired horses to pick up a share. BYE BYE MAN raced
widest up the backstretch, and could not reach contention. AWESOME PARTY raced two to three wide around the turn, and made no impact.
MACHIAVELLI dueled in the two-path while inside GEONOSIS, and was finished late on the turn. MASON'S SONG retired early.

Footnotes
AVANT GARDE settled between horses at the back of a closely-knit group early, moved three wide to join the leaders from outside soon after completing a
half-mile, took over into the stretch and shifted in while drawing well clear. BAHAMIAN PRINCE pressed BEYOND GONE through a moderate pace,
reached a short lead between horses five-sixteenths out, could not match strides with AVANT GARDE into the lane, and ran on willingly to best the others.
HANDSOME PRINCE raced four wide on the turn, shifted inward in upper stretch, swapped back to his left lead moving out past the eighth-pole and was
along for the show. BEYOND GONE set a moderate pace inside for a half, got collared soon after that, and weakened on the rail. MACHO D'ORO faded in
the two-path soon after going a half. PLATO was bottled up along the rail through the early stages, and came up empty when asked on the turn.

Footnotes
VALLEY DATE advanced on the turn being guided out four wide after six furlongs, rallied steadily outside and edged COLONELS DAUGHTER while staying
on her left lead. COLONELS DAUGHTER hit the left side of the gate and bumped with PATIENT DIGNA and VINYARDNINA to get off last, moved off the
inside taking closer order early on the turn, slid out to the three-path cutting off PATIENT DIGNA and getting clipped behind by that one past the
quarter-pole, battled inside VALLEY DATE through deep stretch remaining on her left lead, and came up short. YAKO got through on the rail to poke a head
in front after six furlongs, edged away in upper stretch, but gave way through the last eighth of a mile. NOWITNA RIVER prompted the pace outside
PATIENT DIGNA, reached a short lead four then three wide approaching the five-sixteenths pole, lost the advantage to YAKO turning for home, and faded.
SPICY NELLY raced forwardly outside from the start, got pushed out to the five-path weakening outside the front flight at the top of the lane, and faded
steadily. PATIENT DIGNA got bumped by COLONELS DAUGHTER at the start, sped clear off the rail leaving the chute, got overhauled from both flanks
late on the turn, had COLONELS DAUGHTER cut in front of her while weakening outside the three-sixteenths pole, clipped that one's heels and stumbled,
and continued to drop back. VINYARDNINA bumped with COLONELS DAUGHTER after the start, tired three wide on the turn, and was eased up through
the late stages. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF PATIENT DIGNA AGAINST COLONELS DAUGHTER,
THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND POSITION AND PLACED SIXTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE NEARING THE TOP OF THE
STRETCH.

RELUCTANT BRIDE settled off the pace for a half-mile, came four wide rallying into the lane, collared LENZI'S LUCKY LADY from outside in deep stretch
and pulled clear. LENZI'S LUCKY LADY set a manageable pace clear to inside the final furlong, shortened stride on her left lead and could not deny the
winner. ADDILYN was outrun for a half, rallied mildly through upper stretch, moved off the rail past the furlong marker and finished evenly. CLASSY BEAST
chased outside LENZI'S LUCKY LADY to the stretch, and tired. SWEET MIA moved up after breaking a step slow, was pocketed behind the leaders
entering the turn, and was empty with five-sixteenths remaining.

Footnotes
SENZAZIONE quickly gained command, widened the lead racing well off the rail approaching the stretch, swapped back to his left lead tiring past the
eighth-pole, but faced no dangers while held together sufficiently. IN HONOR OF ARTIE veered in at the start bumping STOPIT, gained three wide on the
turn, and finished well enough outside to get the place. ESTILO PELIGROSO moved up around the turn, lugged in through the late stages and was
outfinished for second. FIRST SALVO raced three to four wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. ULTRACONFIDENT got pushed in at the start by
LORD D'ORO, moved up inside after a half-mile, and weakened on the turn. STOPIT got sandwiched at the start between IN HONOR OF ARTIE and LORD
D'ORO, raced forwardly for a half and tired. LORD D'ORO was bumped between horses and pushed in at the start, raced four wide and dropped far back
after six furlongs. ANGEL'S ENTRY was finished early, and stopped into the stretch. TEMPLECITYOFDOOM was far back when he veered out from
left-hand pressure in upper stretch, and was eased up. ESCRIBANO stopped after a half-mile, and was eased up into the lane.
