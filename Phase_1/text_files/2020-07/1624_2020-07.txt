Footnotes
SMIRK trailed along the inside, saved ground as others rallied wide turning for home, produced a rail rally in upper stretch, and prevailed under a long drive.
WHY WHY PAUL WHY stalked close to the pace in the two path under a tight hold right behind the leaders, waited for racing room in tight quarters turning
for home, split foes three wide in upper stretch, rallied between, but missed. A. K. SAFARI rallied stoutly four to five wide turning for home to forge a narrow
lead in upper stretch, but hung and was bested by inner foes. SPELLING BEE set the pace while two wide and between horses, held a slight advantage
turning for home, but weakened four wide in midstretch. PORT HUNTER prompted the pace three wide, but weakened four wide between horses turning for
home. BIG BIZ inched forward to vie for the lead inside of rivals into the backstretch, shifted off of the rail turning for home, weakened between horses in
upper stretch, then steadied at the furlong pole when WHY WHY PAUL WHY split horses, and stopped late. Due to a timer malfunction, no times are
available.

GANGLY forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but failed to match strides with that foe late. WOOPIGSOOIE bumped with an inner foe at the start,
raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted five wide turning for home, and rallied willingly. OUT COLD stalked the leading group of dueling rivals while saving
ground around the turn, attempted a rail bid through the lane, but only chased the leaders home. ITS MY BAG BABY saved ground through the turn while
far off of the pace, shifted to the five path in midstretch, and passed tired foes. ALBERT'S BARN vied for the lead three wide and between horses, but
weakened passing the quarter pole. YAMANO MAKER (JPN) bumped with an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and between horses into
the turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. Due to a timer malfunction, the five furlong time is unavailable. PER RULING 20-0085 FROM THE KENTUCKY

Footnotes
LADY MCKENZIE pressed the pace setter from the outside, inched forward to vie for the lead into the far turn, forged a narrow advantage turning for home,
and prevailed under a long drive. NOBLE ALMA set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of LADY MCKENZIE around the far turn, dug in when that foe
forged an advantage turning for home, then stayed on gamely, but was bested. SKYVALUE stalked the leading duelers from along the inside, chased those
foes after coming under a drive into the far turn, and failed to make a bid through the lane while mildly cutting the gap in the final sixteenth. STYLISH
KITTEN broke outwards, tracked from the two to three path while off of the pace, then failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, and failed to
factor. CITY FUN bobbled at the start, then lagged behind the field throughout in a dull effort.

Footnotes
ALL I KNOW set the pace in the two path while encountering inner pressure, inched clear of that foe passing the quarter pole, and held through the late
stages under driving pressure while hanging on his left lead,. FAST BOB was forwardly placed four wide early on, then three wide around the turn, produced
a mild kick in upper stretch, and stayed on to achieve place without reaching the leader. LOOTING stalked in the three to two path into the turn, but lacked a
kick between horses in upper stretch and chased the leaders home. FUEGO CALIENTE bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace from along
the inside, but gave way in upper stretch. DAUER bumped with an outer foe at the start, saved ground while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. MR.
PETERKIN trailed by a distance into the turn, cut the gap on the field in the six path turning for home, but never got involved. RUNABILITY shifted to the five
path turning for home while far off of the pace, and failed to factor. DREAMER'S DISEASE had a slow start but recovered to raced midpack in the five path
early on, shifted to the four path into the turn, but weakened turning for home.

place. GIRL FROM BERLIN trailed early on, rallied in the five path around the turn to forge place turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch.
