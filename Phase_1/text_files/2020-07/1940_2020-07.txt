Footnotes
HOUSE OF CORTEZ rated on the front end just outside a rival, was roused into the lane, under a drive and shook free the final sixteenth. AGGRO CRAG
(IRE) vied for the lead from inside from the early going, fought through the stretch, gradually wore down in the late going but was easily second best.
TREASURE NAP rated in midpack toward the outside, was widest taking the second turn then moved clear for third inside the last furlong. HEY RALPHIE
BOY bumped with PISINERO and was shuffled back some at the break, settled inside then gradually progressed along the rail the last three furlongs
without threatening. KING OF THE SOUTH pressed the top pair from just outside for five furlong then began to wear down. PISINERO bumped with HEY
RALPHIE BOY at the start, gradually faded from outside, was three wide taking the second turn and had no late bid. HE'S THUNDER raced in contention
just off the inside for six furlongs, swung out some for the drive and gave way. HONEYDOLIST showed little. Due to a timer malfunction, the first quarter
fraction was hand timed.

Footnotes
HELEN MAE'S SONG stalked the early speed while toward the outside, commenced her bid three wide on the turn, floated out some for the drive, moved
ahead then steadily widened command the last furlong while kept to a drive. DON'T DALLY prominent between horses, went for the lead two wide on the
turn then battled for second in the lane and edged ahead for the place in the late going. FOGGY KITTEN broke alertly and was quickly clear, challenged
from outside on the bend, no match for HELEN MAE'S SONG in the stretch and slowly wore down through the waning yards. BELLAH DOWN well placed
from inside, ran evenly through the lane. PRAISEM only passed outside tired ones. MAY BE SUSPECT forwardly placed from outside, took the turn four
wide, her rider lost his whip at the top of the stretch and she gradually yielded. ECO STAR failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. CUDDLE ME chased
from midpack, was two wide on the turn, angled out inside the final eighth but had little to offer. HAL'S MISCHIEF showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
MUSIAL settled off the inside, progressed three wide on the bend, fanned out some for a clear path into the lane, rallied under a drive and got up in the
waning yards. DATA BREACH was sent to a clear early lead, all out from inside through the stretch but did not have enough left. RUDY'S BOY in contention
early just off or along the rail, angled out three wide for room inside the last furlong and found best stride too late. RED DIRT ROAD moved to contention
three wide on the bend, angled in some entering the lane, loomed a serious threat with a furlong left but leveled off instead. GALAHAD KID advanced
between horses on the turn, swung out five wide for the stretch run and showed a willingness to run late. CONSPICUOUS BOX without early speed, began
to progress three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning outside GALAHAD KID entering the stretch and also showed late interest. TOCCETIVE JAC saved
ground and was never a factor. CLASSIC PURSUIT pressed DATA BREACH for a half mile then gave way. FAIRWAY LANE showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
SUMMER'S WINNER showed first and was quickly clear of the rest, was roused leaving the turn and gradually lengthened command under a drive through
the stretch. I LUV THIS BAR pressed SUMMER'S WINNER from just outside, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but proved easily
second best. WEST GLACIER settled outside on the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide on the turn, fanned outside I LUV THIS BAR for the stretch
run, moved clear for third approaching the eighth pole then could only hold her position. PALAGO was a factor off the rail on the backstretch, did not keep
up three wide on the turn, swung out some into the lane and had no late bid. TALE OF CONDUCT broke a step slow and outward, chased from inside,
angled to the outside on the turn and lugged in through the lane. MARYS LAST SONG also broke a step slowly and was steadied as she tried to lug in
some after leaving the chute, advanced between rivals, had the rail on the bend then gave way in the stretch. PRETTY GITA in midpack early, faded from
path three on the turn.

Footnotes
CREAL WONDER shared the early lead from outside, moved clear and angled in on the bend then steadily opened up under a drive through the lane.
MAGNITUDE TEN advanced between horses on the backstretch, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch, battled outside LINE
OF DENHAMS for second and edged that one out late. LINE OF DENHAMS prominent from outside, advanced two wide on the turn, fought for second
through the lane and did not have enough left nearing the wire. WAVE'NDUMONI contested the early pace from between horses, gained the rail into the
turn and wore down the last furlong. THE DOGMEN soon trailed from outside, began to advance three wide on the bend, swung out to path five for the drive
and steadily improved position without threatening. A MERRY HEART chased from between horses, was two wide through the turn and had no stretch rally.
A BOLD RYDE in midpack early from inside, came off the rail some on the bend, swung widest into the lane and had no late bid. BEE HAPPY ATTACK was
hustled along to contest the pace from inside on the backstretch, steadied briefly when he lost his path into the turn then continued to fade. YO HO HO
showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
SHMILY was hustled to the early lead, challenged from outside on the turn, moved clear upper stretch under urging and held sway under steady handling.
GO FOR SHERRIE pressed from inside, lost his path into the turn, waited for room along the rail, got through three wide into the stretch, rallied, took over
second with a sixteenth left but was too late for the win. STORMY PACIFIC improved position three wide on the bend, progressed behind GO FOR
SHERRIE upper stretch, altered outside that one approaching the sixteenth marker, closed well and gained third in the waning yards. NOT CHOPPED
LIVER bumped leaving the chute, chased from just off the rail, retreated from inside on the turn, lodged a stretch bid, altered out with seventy yards to go
and was closing the gap late. JOLLY GHAALY angled in some leaving the chute, bumped NOT CHOPPED LIVER, pressed SHMILY from just outside and
gradually wore down for the drive. SERIOUS TALK two wide taking the bend, had to steadily angled out to improve his position through the lane. WILLOW
RIDGE pressed from between rivals, was two wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run and flattened. W W KAN DO was prominent from
outside on the backstretch, three to five wide taking the bend then gave way for the drive. GREEN MEANS GO chased from outside and had little to offer for
the stretch run.

Footnotes
LT DAN ATTACK prominent early, advanced from inside on the bend, waited for room approaching the quarter pole, got through four wide into the lane,
took over midstretch then gradually opened up under a drive. LEE LA DEW crowded at the break, progressed three wide on the turn, gained a striking
position between rivals upper stretch, altered out for a clear path inside the final eighth and caught LOOKIN' AT MIKE for second. LOOKIN' AT MIKE shared
the early lead from inside, edged ahead two wide on the turn, moved clear entering the stretch, could not hold back LT DAN ATTACK midstretch and
gradually wore down in the late going. KEY VOYAGE disputed the pace between horses, had the rail on the bend, did not keep up leaving the turn and
altered his path several times through the lane. DONNER PASS chased from just off the inside, lodged his bid along the rail in the lane, was steadied briefly
midstretch when his path narrowed then finished evenly the last furlong. PRIME NITE in contention early from outside, did not keep up four wide on the turn,
swung out further for the stretch run and failed to have a significant bid. GREENSPAN broke a step slow and inward, moved up quickly from outside to be
an early factor, was three to five wide taking the turn then gave way between horses the last two furlongs. GUSANO caught in tight quarters between horses
nearing the turn, dropped back, angled out on the bend, came into the lane from the middle of the track and failed to have a serious response. CHILLY RED
ACCOUNT pressed the early pacesetters but gave way from inside on the turn. BEE ATTACK displayed early speed between rivals but began to tire before
finishing a half mile.
