Footnotes
HIDDEN DREAMS set the pace in the two-path, shook off ROCK WITH ROBIN in upper stretch and widened under a drive. ROCK WITH ROBIN chased
outside the winner from the start, and had enough to save second. CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE brushed with FACTS ONLY attempting to move off the inside
at the top of the stretch, and finished one-paced. C'EST PARTI stumbled a stride from the gate, and was no factor three wide. BELLA BASORA faded inside
through the stretch. HOPE LADY was a step slow to begin, and outrun four wide. FACTS ONLY brushed with CHERRY ROCK BRIDGE three-sixteenths
out, and dropped back through the lane. TONALA broke slowest and trailed every step.

Footnotes
DANVILLE tucked in behind the leaders waiting patiently, slid out three wide turning for home, rallied to the front outside SPINNING KITTEN in deep stretch
and edged that one to the wire. SPINNING KITTEN prompted the pace outside GRAND MORELAND, bid into the lane, and dropped a hard-fought decision
between horses. GRAND MORELAND set an easy pace inside, responded when hooked by SPINNING KITTEN on the far turn, and yielded grudgingly late.
INDIRECTLY was outrun early inside, bumped JEEKER JOE in the two-path entering the second turn, and found his best stride belatedly inside rivals. SIR
HOSKI took up sharply between horses midway on the first turn, raced three wide and finished one-paced. TIME FOR TROUBLE broke a couple lengths
behind the field, circled four wide approaching the stretch, and passed only tired horses. PLEASE SIT DOWN saved ground to no avail. GOOD TIMING
MAN came over from the four-path cutting off SIR HOSKI on the first turn, stayed close to the stretch and came up empty. JEEKER JOE got bumped by
INDIRECTLY and shut off into the second turn, and never got close. ALADDIN SANE got jostled around on the first turn between DANVILLE and SIR
HOSKI, and faded after six furlongs. ATAKAN steadied slightly behind a troubled SIR HOSKI on the first turn, and made no impact.

Footnotes
CAN'T BUY LOVE broke alertly and was with the leaders four then three wide, took over outside OMAHA CITY at the top of the stretch, and kicked clear
through the last furlong under a drive. KAY'S PROJECT took an awkward initial step to her right, recovered to be among a foursome contesting the front,
was outpaced between horses into the turn, shifted out for the drive and came back on with good courage going clear of the rest late. OMAHA CITY battled
for command between horses three then two wide, and weakened through the furlong grounds. ASYMPTOMATIC (IRE) bumped with COMPILER after the
start, rushed up along the rail to contest the pace for three-eighths of a mile, and faded through the lane. ONE OF US got outsprinted around the turn three
to four wide, and made no headway in the stretch. COMPILER (IRE) bumped with ASYMPTOMATIC after the start, and was outrun inside. HERE COMES
MAGIC trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
ICONIC settled in the second flight early, was under a drive by late on the turn four wide, rallied steadily and wore down FRENCH QUARTER from outside
late. FRENCH QUARTER prompted the pace outside WAR GIANT, took over and went well clear into the final furlong, but could not hold off the winner.
DESERT GENERAL raced two to three wide around the turn, and finished evenly. JUST KIDDING lost ground to the leaders approaching the stretch in the
two-path, then stayed on through the late stages to earn the last major share. WAR GIANT set the pace slightly removed from the rail, and weakened
through upper stretch on his left lead. BAD STUDENT dropped back early, and remained outrun. CONGRATS THIS was finished early, and dropped far
back in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAPITAN FOFO pressed the pace outside GOOD ADVICE, took over turning for home, and widened on his left lead. GOOD ADVICE set the pace inside,
was no match for the winner by upper stretch, and ran on best of the others. MAQUIAVELO bumped with EAGLES DAWN at the start, came three wide into
the lane, and had no rally. LAST JET OUT raced three to four wide around the turn, and lacked the needed late response. EAGLES DAWN took the worst of
a bump with MAQUIAVELO at the start and lost his footing, and faded steadily after three furlongs. WILD GO was outrun four wide. CROCODILE BITE had
no response to urging inside.

Footnotes
ADIOS saved ground reserved in the middle of the field early, swung four wide joining the leaders at the top of the stretch, and kicked away past the
eighth-pole under good handling. DREAMIN OF SEVILLE hugged the rail in striking range for six furlongs, got through inside EXTRA EXTRA turning for
home, could not finish with the winner but ran on willingly. BURLY BOY was outrun inside for nearly six furlongs, angled three wide off the far turn, and
found his best stride belatedly outside. EXTRA EXTRA set the pace alternating between the rail and the two-path, came under fire from both flanks into the
stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. KHOZY MY BOY prompted the pace outside EXTRA EXTRA, came under a ride between horses
midway on the far turn, and was outfinished. STRONG ENDING stayed in range two to three wide to the far turn, fanned to the five-path at the top of the
lane, and made no headway. STORM RISK had the two-path near the back early, moved inside and failed to make his presence felt. DUCHOSSOIS raced
three wide, lodged a mild bid a quarter-mile out, and gave way through the lane on his left lead.

Footnotes
LOUIS LE GRANDE was outsprinted early, closed in on the leaders around the turn four then three wide, collared CATCH ON EMOTIONAL from outside in
upper stretch and drove clear. EL PILLO raced two to three wide on the turn, and rallied on his left lead to be along for the place. CATCH ON EMOTIONAL
crossed over in front of ROUGH ENTRY with the early lead, showed the way inside for a half-mile, could not match strides with the winner into the lane, and
weakened. ROUGH ENTRY was in tight behind CATCH ON EMOTIONAL shortly after the start, went up to press the pacesetter from outside past the
half-mile pole, stayed on the chase to the top of the stretch and gave way. TRINNI JOHN was a step slow at the start, and never factored. GINO TIME was
finished early three wide.

Footnotes
LADY BOSS broke to the lead and claimed the two-path, fended off inside pressure from AVUNCULAR from start to finish, and held firm. AVUNCULAR
pressed LADY BOSS from the inside from the start, could not get by and was clearly second best. ALLURING RUMBA moved up three wide approaching
the quarter-pole, could not menace the top two with an even finish and was clear of the rest. MADDOX lacked room behind EZZADORA just after the start,
came four wide off the turn, and improved without threatening. SCAMPER ALONG faded four wide leaving the turn. SEAPORT STORM was through early
inside. MIAHSOLOMIAH gave chase three wide early, and tired through the stretch. EZZADORA came in just after the start bothering MADDOX, and was
outrun.

Footnotes
GRAN ETIQUETA settled in the middle of the field early, moved up four then three wide after completing six furlongs, collared MIA'S BOBTAIL from outside
in upper stretch and drew clear on her left lead. UPSY DAISY DO waited behind the leaders going by the quarter-pole, rallied inside the winner through the
lane and was clearly best of the others. KAUFY FUTURES raced in striking range between foes in the three-path midway on the turn, got yanked outside
GRAN ETIQUETA after being out-moved by that one near the quarter-pole, and drifted out through the stretch. MIA'S BOBTAIL rushed up to a clear lead
leaving the chute, was no match for the winner in upper stretch, and faded steadily. DIXIELAND HUMOR was slow away from the gate, raced four to five
wide moving up mildly around the turn, but could not sustain the rally. BATI BATI bumped with MARVA at the start, and tired after a half-mile. MARVA
bumped with BATI BATI at the start, chased after the pacesetter two wide early, and was finished after five furlongs. This race was hand timed.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN AROUND THE FAR TURN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE
RIDER OF KAUFY FUTURES, THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MO OF THE WEST tracked outside the pacesetter from the start, came under a ride midway on the far turn, stayed on task through a long drive and was up
outside in the closing yards. CENTSLESS DRAMA broke to the lead, rated along through leisurely early fractions, picked up the tempo through the middle
stages, dug in through the lane and yielded grudgingly. PASSION PLUS saved ground in the second flight for six furlongs, waited behind horses at the top
of the stretch, got through between rivals past the eighth-pole and finished well. TRILBY lagged well back in the three-path for most of the opening six
furlongs, fanned widest for the drive and improved for the last major share. NIGHT WATCH saved ground throughout, and was no threat through an even
effort. FOUR K'S raced three to four wide on the turns, and failed to rally while staying on her left lead. HERA raced forwardly four then three wide from the
outset, but faded in the stretch. TOKYO alternated between the rail and the two-path on the turns, and posed no threat. SWEET STORY reared up fractious
in the gate prior to the start, was slow into stride, and retired after six furlongs. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN settled in midpack three to four wide early, and was
empty through the lane.

Footnotes
FRANCO'S TEAM advanced around the turn shifting from the rail to the two-path, moved further out getting set down in upper stretch, and responded on his
left lead to get up in time. OMINOUS chased outside WAR OF DECEPTION from the start, lost some ground in the three-path through the furlong grounds,
then stayed on gamely between horses. ANIMA D'OR got knocked around between TOOK A CAB and WAR OF DECEPTION at the start, raced well back
to the stretch three then four wide, moved to the far outside and finished strongly. WAR OF DECEPTION bumped with ANIMA D'OR at the start, sped to the
front inside, edged away late on the turn, remained clear past the furlong marker, but shortened stride remaining on his left lead to the final yards.
ROMARIO was outrun to the stretch inside, got steered out a couple times past the eighth-pole, and finished well between horses. I'AM BEOWULF raced in
striking range two wide to the quarter-pole, moved inside for the drive and finished evenly. SUPER EDGAR was outrun two wide to the end of the turn,
moved out and gained mildly without threatening. BIG'S GRAY DAY was in tight and brushed the rail entering the turn, shifted to the two-path with aim
outside the leader into the stretch, but faltered late. SWINGIN ON A STAR hit the right side of the gate and bumped with EL SOLITARIO at the start, and
faded around the turn four wide. TOOK A CAB broke out bumping ANIMA D'OR, steadied between horses past the half-mile pole three wide, and tired in the
stretch. EL SOLITARIO bumped with SWINGIN ON A STAR at the start, and was outrun four wide. TRINNI DANCER was always outrun.
