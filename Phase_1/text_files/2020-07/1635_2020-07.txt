Footnotes
RED RIVER BEAR allowed to settle early just off the rail, moved into striking position into the lane, lacked running room inside, angled out sharply to the
three path at the top of the stretch, rallied steadily and won driving. SMARTY RIVER PANTS prompted the pace from outside, dueled three wide into the
lane with SHARP DRESSED BEAU, gained a narrow advantage mid stretch but was edged out late. SHARP DRESSED BEAU contested the early pace
from just off the rail, dueled inside of SMARTY RIVER PANTS, dug in early stretch and weakened in the final yards. TROOPER JOHN sat in striking range
outside, was roused at the head of the lane but lacked the response needed. PORT PROTECTION squeezed leaving the gate, trailed and bid belatedly.
BAR NO Q sat just off the pace from the four path and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BEAR sat in striking position, moved to HALLIE'S HERO midway on the final turn, then moved up alongside to challenge the lead, showed good
determination and inched up just in time. HALLIE'S HERO controlled the pace from the onset, responded gamely to challenge from DOUBLE BEAR but was
denied by a nose. GEM ALTA settled in the three path in the backstretch, took closer order in the turn but lacked a closing response that was required and
finished best of the rest. SMALL VICTORIES unhurried early, trailed into the far turn and offered a late run. A. F. INDY hit gate prior to start, breaking slow,
shifted inside racing into the far turn and chased to no avail. DARE TO ENTER saved ground and lacked a serious bid. THIN LINE settled mid pack, lodged
a mild bid into the lane and faded.

SAVEITFORARAINYDAY stalked the pace inside, shifted out to the two path into the lane, was headed into the stretch and drove clear under light pressure.
COPPER FOX vied between rivals, drifted out into the lane, rallied three wide into the stretch, weakened late and saved for place. BROADWAY BONNIE
brushed gate leaving, sat mid pack, came five wide into the lane, closed gradually outside and missed. BLUES ROAR vied inside, responded to
encouragement inside leaving the turn and gave way late. WHOOP IT UP settled outside and failed to threaten in the drive. PARCAM COWGIRL trailed the
field and lacked a bid. LITTLE ROSALYN pressed three wide and was done early.

PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE sat in striking position, was put to drive into the lane then widened and was kept under good handling. EVERYTHING'S QUIET
quickly went to the front, saw margins diminish in the turn and lacked the closing response needed but finished clear second best. FLAT AS A PANCAKE
reserved off the leader outside, lacked a response when asked and evened out. SALSA TANGO offered little. INQUISITIVE CAT saved ground inside and
failed to threaten. EDGE OF OKOTOKS chased to no avail.

MIDNIGHT SHAKE sat in range outside, hustled three wide into the lane, gained a short advantage into the stretch over CODE EIGHT and held firm in the
final yards. CODE EIGHT quickly took command, responded gamely to challenge from MIDNIGHT SHAKE, rival took slim lead then dug in gamely but was
out finished. DOC ROSS sat just off the pace in the three path, was unable to keep pace with rivals and just held for show. MR. IRRELEVANT stalked
inside, dropped back through the turn, rally late missing out. ACROSS THE CONCHO settled outside early, gained closer order and failed to menace in the
drive. DOMENICO lacked early speed and offered a late mild bid. PATRICK chased throughout and tired. BUDDY BOY lacked early speed needed and
tired.

FACTORED IN trailed early, closed angling from the rail to three wide leaving the turn, closed steadily through the stretch and flew late getting by just in
time. MADE FOR SATURDAY sat just off the pacesetters, took advantage of the rail opening up into the lane, rallied determinedly inside of TROJAN,
inched up but was rundown late for the win. TROJAN broke alertly, set a pressed pace, responded to challenge from inside rival into the lane, could not
muster the rally that was required and was narrowly denied in a multi horse finish. REDNECK REMARK hustled away then was brushed approaching the
turn, dropped back through the turn, chased hard and was unable to improve contending position through the drive. PHIL POWER pressed the pace from
between foes, was unable to move on with rivals and yielded. SYNNIN lagged early and showed some late interest. BIONIC BIRD prompted the pace from
