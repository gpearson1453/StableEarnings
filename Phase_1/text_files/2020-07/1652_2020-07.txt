Footnotes
CHARLOTTE WEBLEY quickly established control, was rated showing the way from the two path on a loosely-contested advantage, gradually kicked clear
of the competition during the run around the bend, was traversing through the furlong grounds when given some right side shots, with the second of those
causing the mount to duck in sharply right around the eighth pole, saw the pilot attempt to correct this waywardness with some vigorous shaking of the reins,
only to have the mount swerve out sharply three to four wide paths, held a straighter course from the sixteenth marker onward and held sway. REMOANE
remained stationed along the inside route after the start, got switched over to some hand encouragement as the half was being completed, arrived at the
quarter pole with plenty of room for the asking along the inside corridor, availed of the situation and rallied for the place. MISS ROSS took the inside route,
stepped into the lane and went on to secure the show. AGGRAVATION travelled three wide on the turn, swung about as wide into the stretch,got worked
into the five path, lacked a solid closing punch. QUEENTIGUA took up the chase from path four on the bend, was a bit nearer to the rail for the stretch run,
gave way. IDAKA took up the chase two to three wide, between rivals for a good portion of the trip on the turn, came into the stretch and had no response.
SHAYNA BAY tracked the winner from just off the rail, was put to a drive springing from the five-sixteenths marker, abandoned the pocket by stepping into
the two path for entrance into the stretch, folded. VINITA had the pilot grab hold after coming in sharply at the start, departed the backstretch from the four
path, was worked into path six from the top of the lane to the sixteenth pole, came up empty. HELEN BY NIGHT pursued the front runners on the turn from
path two, went into the stretch and had no rally. BOSTON GIRL three wide onto the turn, was never in it. MIA CALIA urged from the get-go, dove over to the
rail at the half mile pole, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
TRIBHUVAN (FR) two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack among the main flight as the leader widened away, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
as the field took closer order on the front, angled four wide into upper stretch matching strides with BALLAGH ROCKS to his inside, dug in dueling through
the stretch to the finish fighting gamely and got the nod on the wire. BALLAGH ROCKS coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside forwardly
placed among the main flight as the leader shook away, tucked inside half a mile from home, closed in on the top one through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch taking over command, dug in under threat from the aforementioned foe to the outside,
dueled through to the finish in game fashion but lost the bob on the line. CONVICTION TRADE tracked just off the inside until tucked inside five furlongs
from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. SERVE THE KING (GB)
saved ground down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, swung two to three wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. NORTH DAKOTA two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper
stretch and offered no response. GO POKE THE BEAR chased three to four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, went four wide into upper stretch
and was unable to make an impact. MEMORIES OF PETER established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, widened away down the
backstretch, had the field take closer order through the far turn and came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths under challenge for the initial time, yielded
the front and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened through to the finish.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ROCKETTE emerged from a tight pack at the break possessing a narrow advantage a few strides into the contest, felt heat from a pair of
opponents to her outside nearly from the get-go, rode the rail, having been placed to the mildest of hand encouragement, picked up the tempo several ticks
after the first fraction had been recorded, but wasn't able to shake off the pesky pair forcing the issue from paths two and three respectively, spun into the
lane with the battle yet on, was the last of the trio to have its pilot commit to a drive, this occurring deep into the furlong grounds, saw its advantage steadily
dwindle down in the last eighth, came out inside the sixteenth hole held on late to preserve the decision in near record track time. REAGAN'S EDGE
disputed the pace from the two path, from between rivals beginning from the shadow of the gate onward, got switched over to a drive a short distance from
the quarter pole, came out during the final sixteenth pole, intentionally or not taking CENTER AISLE along for the ride, was determined to the end, but
missed. CENTER AISLE cut over into the three path right after the start, ranged up to make it a three-way tussle for the top, participating in it as the
outermost member, stepped into lane still heavily involved, got called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, moved wider in the final
stages of the stretch run being herded and/or induced by the second place finisher, fell short. UP IN SMOKE gradually made her way towards the rail,
arriving there by the conclusion of the backstretch, kept watch on the front runners vying for control a few jumps up the road, was already being roused
cutting the corner into the lane, had no closing punch. MISS PEPPINA took up the chase three to four wide on the turn, was put to a stronger ride leaving
the five-sixteenths pole, exited the turn as wide as having entered it and backed away.

Footnotes
MR JAGGERS tracked the pace along the inside, assumed command inside the half mile pole as the leader got out into the far turn, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. BAY STREET MONEY two
to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. RED
STORM RISEN three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
BAIL OUT chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no late headway. MALIBU
EDGE just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no response.
HOSTILE WITNESS three wide through the first turn, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader, got carried out five wide into the far turn when latched on
that rival who got out into the turn, came under coaxing midway, swung four to five wide for home and faltered. GREAT CAMANOE established the front and
showed the way in hand just off the inside floated into the backstretch four to five wide before settling once more in the two path, steadily got out inside the
five furlong marker despite an off sided stick in correction, then got out six to seven paths off the inside through the far turn relinquishing the front and was
placed under a light hold, circled near the outside the rail into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish. COMMISSIONER DAVE chased along the
inside growing detached at the tail of the field, went just off the inside into upper stretch briefly urged before being eased to the finish.

Footnotes
FORTIN HILL away about a length the quickest, assumed a stalking role shortly afterwards, departed the backstretch from the three path, crept up towards
the front runners after the second split had been posted, spun into the lane, looming dangerously and being confidently ridden, struck the three-sixteenths
pole and got turned loose, as was the runner up, thus sparking off a spirited tussle, slowly but surely assumed control, then kicked clear in the final seventy
yards. AMUNDSON away well, was initially one of three scrambling for the top, saw that morph into an one on one contest with SKYLER'S SCRAMJET
soon afterwards, sparred with the aforementioned from path two for the opening half, momentarily edged away leaving the three-eighths pole only to have
the eventual winner draw up in a menacingly manner, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when finally called upon for more, fought well only to get
headed by FORTIN HILL at the eighth pole nevertheless, vied side by side for some time before getting shaken off in the last seventy yards. TIZ HE THE
ONE briefly spotted along the inside route during the opening phases, was pulling noticeably on the left making his way on the backstretch, chose to vacate
the rail and head towards path two approaching the top of the turn, kept watch on the pace from midpack, came under a ride late on the bend, angled three
wide into the stretch, made no headway in the last eighth rallying for third. AMERICAN POWER one-paced, brought up the back of the pack while racing
along the inside route, felt the whip at the three-eighths pole after having fallen farther behind, got roused while maneuvered to the outside for the drive
home, wound up wandering eight wide all told, had some gain. ZOOMER two wide onto the turn, got sent out six wide exiting it, made no impact. READY
TO ESCAPE tracked the pace while saving ground, was under urging racing on the turn, pausing it only after coming up to close to a weakening SKYLER'S
SCRAMJET in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, was driven five wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response. T LOVES A FIGHT two wide,
drafted behind AMUNDSON on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, failed to fire apprecibly. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET put to some
hand encouragement after springing from the gate, contended for the top from just off the rail for the opening half, faltered.

PUBLICATION broke out at the start brushing the off side stall and then bumping with ZACCAPA, chased three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied closing well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the embattled
top pair inside the sixteenth marker, then prevailed going away at the end. ZACCAPA (FR) bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking
outwards, raced four then three wide in range of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking
narrow command straightened away, dug in knocking heads with AMERICAN GODDESS through to the finish and was displaced in tandem inside the
sixteenth pole, then fought on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. BASTET four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying willingly to just miss for the place honors. AMERICAN
GODDESS led early on before dueling with AMAZING RIDE to her inside, took over the front five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch
now engaged by ZACCAPA to the outside, knocked heads with that rival through to the sixteenth marker when overtaken in tandem by the eventual winner,
then got outfinished in the final jumps. L'INDISCRET two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and kicked on belatedly. PILOT EPISODE chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got coaxed along five-sixteenths from
home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LIZA JAMBALAYA two to three wide in pursuit, came under a ride
five-sixteenths out, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. ZERENIA tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile from
home, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MADAM MACLEAN hesitated at the
start then leapt slightly before loping out of the gate conceding seven to eight lengths to the front, chased three to four wide detached at the tail of the field,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. DIPPING IN coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. AMAZING RIDE dueled
inside of AMERICAN GODDESS along the rail, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed for command at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
DANTE'S FIRE pulled off another after losing its footing at the start, pursued the front runners while undergoing a two to three wide journey, was steered to
the outside for the drive home, completed the maneuver in the neighborhood of the six path, was charging at JACK THE CAT with good energy finishing off
the run through the furlong grounds, wrested away the advantage a few strides past the eighth pole then kicked clear, kept to some urging to the wire. JACK
THE CAT remained stationed on the inside route after the field had been released, flashed some interest after stepping onto the far turn, managed to slip
into the two path in time to elude a spent STARRY MESSENGER at the three-eighths pole, by this juncture getting roused, spun into the lane, nudged his
way into the three path at the three-sixteenths pole, this coming at the expense of JIMMY JAZZ, forged to a short-lived lead, proved powerless once the
winner arrived on the scene, continued on well to salvage second. JIMMY JAZZ off the inside throughout, raced three wide on the second bend, got ridden
about as wide into the stretch, lost position to the second place finisher, getting brushed into path four, stayed on in the final furlong for the show. POINT
HIM OUT pursued the pace from midpack, travelled three to four wide on the far turn, fanned out into path five during the initial portion of the stretch, made
no headway afterwards. JO'S BOLD CAT underwent a two wide journey to the quarter pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, lacked an offering. BAD
GUY broke a length the tardiest, was spotted along the rail before leaving the clubhouse turn, rode it to the end of the subsequent bend, went three wide
into the lane, made no impact. STEELERSFANFORLIFE three wide, sparred for the top until the head of the stretch, folded. DANFUSI vied for command
from path two until the head of the stretch, folded. STARRY MESSENGER had a ground-saving journey, was through by the three-eighths pole.

SOCIAL PARANOIA two to three wide near the rear of the field, tipped four wide at the three-eighths put to coaxing as SEISMIC WAVE and VALUE
PROPOSITION commenced bids just prior, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside a host of rivals jostling for position inside through the final
furlong taking command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish to prevail. SEISMIC WAVE three wide in pursuit from the tail of the
field, tipped out four to five wide at the three-eighths put to coaxing and advanced through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive kicking on with good energy, came in a half a path inside the sixteenth marker forcing VALUE PROPOSITION to be taken in hand and
was along safe for the place honors. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent a furlong out when leaned on and nudged by HAWKISH to his inside,
denied the move to make a lane forcing HAWKISH to stay put off the heels of GOT STORMY, dug in under a drive and was forced to be taken in hand
inside the sixteenth marker as SEISMIC WAVE came inwards but kept on to secure the show honors. GOT STORMY forwardly placed three then two wide
in closest aim of the leader, took over command when roused near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under
threat from a host of rivals and clung to the front through to the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages. DREAM FRIEND coaxed from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, got headed near the quarter pole and cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive and weakened in the late going. HAWKISH just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, got set down angled three wide into upper stretch, was in
behind GOT STORMY coming to the eighth pole and was tipped out nudging and leaning on VALUE PROPOSITION attempting to bull his way out and
make a lane, was soundly denied the move and was forced to check off the heels of GOT STORMY, got re-engaged by the rider but was unable to recover.
EONS coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
VALID POINT tracked the pace along the inside pulling on the bit under restraint, got steadied briefly off the heels of DREAM FRIEND with seven-sixteenths
to run, cut the corner into upper stretch under a light drive, paused inside lacking a clear path as rivals got bottled up to the outside and was not persevered
with through the final furlong with no clear seam to run. There was a Steward's Inquiry as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of HAWKISH alleging
interference against VALUE PROPOSITION at the sixteenth marker, After review, the result stood before the race was declared official.

VEKOMA kept control after breaking on top, got guided over to the rail, carved out the pace, lightly hand urged and with WARRIOR'S CHARGE in
attendance in path two, continued along the same set up setting split after split, felt an uptick in pressure as three-quarters was being completed, strode out
towards the three-sixteenths pole however before being turned loose, responded, came under siege by the beginning of the final furlong, dug in gamely to
fend off all comers. NETWORK EFFECT secured the pocket after the field had been sent off and running, rated well keeping watch on the winner, got cued
up spinning into the lane, kept up with VEKOMA during the ensuing furlong, tipped into the two path and split rivals in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, held
on well enough long enough to preserve the place. CODE OF HONOR came away without apparent mishap, raced at a considerable distance from off the
rail throughout, got rated racing three to four wide on the turn, was asked for more stepping onto the head of the stretch, got maneuvered to the outside,
until in path five by the eighth pole, finished with good energy, fell short of snagging away second. WARRIOR'S CHARGE made contact with MR FREEZE
after coming in at the start, assumed a prominent position, prompted the winner while being reserved in the two path, challenged in earnest heading home,
shifted towards the three path, failed to make any headway. MCKINZIE took up residence in midpack, departed the backstretch from path four, kept within
striking distance during the run around the bend, stepped ito the lane and was switched over to stronger handling, moved out into the path five, came up
empty after leaving the furlong marker. MR FREEZE got bumped by an incoming WARRIOR'S CHARGE, displayed no ill effects, was worked into the two
path prior to arriving at the half mile pole, took up the chase from between opponents for a good portion of the trip on the turn, had the pilot commit to going
outward after settling in at the top of the lane, wandered out seven wide by deep stretch, made no impact. ENDORSED under a snug hold, crept up towards
the front runners on the backstretch, pursued the pace from the three path on the turn, went into the lane, and backed away. HOG CREEK HUSTLE
stumbled at the start, cut over to the rail, was waiting third in line along the inside route on the turn, tipped one path farther off the rail in upper stretch, had
no response.

INSTILLED REGARD just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled until set down angled three to four wide into upper stretch,
tipped out a path inside the eighth pole finding a seam between ROCKEMPEROR and SADLER'S JOY and rallied on through to loosely split those foes and
was up in the final jumps to the finish. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) tracked the pace just off the inside, remained patiently handled until set down swinging four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong, took narrow and brief command inside the sixteenth marker and
then got nailed in the final jumps. SADLER'S JOY two to three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field, tipped four wide near the three-eighths and had to go
five wide as SPOOKY CHANNEL tipped out four wide, came under coaxing at that station, swung seven wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly outside to
be up for the show honors in the final strides. CHANNEL MAKER broke out at the start bumping DOT MATRIX into SPOOKY CHANNEL, raced forwardly
placed and attended the leader to the outside in the three path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got let out continuing three wide at that
station, dug in knocking heads with CROSS BORDER through the stretch to the sixteenth marker when displaced in tandem from the front, then got
outfinished in the late going. CROSS BORDER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under attendance from the
aforementioned foe to the outside but facing little pressure, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as the tempo quickened and rivals in behind got busier,
spun just off the inside for home, dug in confronted and dueled through to the sixteenth pole when overtaken for command in concert with his main rival,
then got outfinished in the late stages. SPOOKY CHANNEL bumped at the start by DOT MATRIX due to pressure from CHANNEL MAKER who broke
outwards, chased three then four wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DEVAMANI
(FR) saved ground near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into contention when improving position by the move,
dug in under a drive and weakened in the final furlong. DOT MATRIX got bumped at the start by CHANNEL MAKER who broke outwards and in turn
bumped SPOOKY CHANNEL, chased three wide from just off the pace, got let out angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
outkicked.

Footnotes
TACITUS was allowed to ease back, conceding the top to PARSIMONY on the first turn, proceeded along to the crown of the backstretch appearing keen,
tipped off the rail and into the two path halfway home to the half mile pole, was on the move to the outside once, springing from that station, gradually made
its way into the three path over the course of the next furlong, hitched up to the leader by the quarter pole, saw the pilot confidently take over the front end
soon afterwards, was in possession of a healthy advantage when switched to a hand drive with approximately a sixteenth remaining, padded the winning
margin. MORETTI away last, raced three wide on the opening bend, worked out a tuck closer to the rail before arriving at the subsequent one, resumed its
chase from midpack, was cued up for the drive, got sent out towards path three, proved no match. PARSIMONY established the top in short order, cut over
to he inside, got rated cutting the fractions, with MR. BUFF in accompaniment to the outside, saw the winner range up boldly approaching the end of the
second bend, got overpowered, weakened enough to lose the place. JUST WHISTLE travelled about the first turn two to three wide, raced three to four wide
on turn two, angled out five wide entering the stretch, had no offering. MR. BUFF prompted the pace from the two path until the quarter pole before giving
way. SIR WINSTON made it over to the rail early on the backstretch after being mostly two wide prior, went on to save ground to no avail.
