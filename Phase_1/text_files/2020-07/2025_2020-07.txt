Footnotes
MAGIC FINNISH saved ground from midpack around the first turn, advanced between rivals into the far turn to loom behind the leading trio at the five
sixteenths pole, but was blocked behind those foes, steadied slightly turning for home among traffic, got through along the inside approaching the furlong
pole after an inner foe weakened, then surged past her outer rival at the sixteenth pole. SEQUAYA prompted the pace two wide and between horses, forged
a lead from between those foes passing the five sixteenths pole, held an advantage passing the furlong pole, but was no match for her inner rival
approaching the sixteenth pole, and held place to prove second best. MISS HATTIE was slow to get going early on, raced far off of the pace, commenced a
rally in the five path around the far turn, then sustained a mild six wide gain through the lane for a minor reward. IMNOTSMALL lied close up to the pace
three wide early on, inched forward and dueled for the lead three wide around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch.
PRINCESS MARYKATE stalked in midpack in the four to three path around the first turn, then shifted four to five wide turning for home, and stayed on
between horses in the lane, but got outfinished by an outer foe before being brushed by that rival approaching the wire. AMERICAN VALUES raced far off of
the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a kick to split foes and make a bid. NIVA set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of a
pair of foes into the far turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole. ANGLICO was never involved. JERSEY PRINCESS stalked along the inside and from
the pocket behind the trio of leaders, but was shuffled back behind the inner leader turning for home, failed t recover, and weakened. Following the race, the
rider of #9 PRINCESS MARYKATE claimed foul against the rider of #2 MISS HATTIE for interference in the late stages, but it was disallowed by the
stewards.

Footnotes
BLINKERS was bumped by an inner foe at the start, pulled forward to bid for the lead after a quarter mile, cleared off an opened up passing the nine
sixteenths pole, held his margin through the turn and midstretch, began to tire passing the furlong pole, but held safely as his margin dwindled. WEST BANK
BABY raced off of the in the two path, advanced under a drive and forged place turning for home from an outer foe, but chased the clear leader home while
only making mild late progress on the tiring leader's advantage. JO MARIE trailed down the backstretch, advanced in the four path around the turn, then
stayed on for a minor share. READYFORMYCLOSEUP broke outwards and bumped a foe at the start, stalked three wide, forged place into the turn while
chasing the loose leader, but weakened in upper stretch. DESTINY'S DARLING was never involved. QUEEN BESS set the pace through the opening
quarter mile, but was headed by the eventual winner passing the five furlong pole, and steadily faded into and around the turn.

Footnotes
NOTARY prompted the pace two wide before inching forward at the half mile pole to make a bid for the lead, dueled two wide into and around the turn,
forged a lead from his inner foe approaching the quarter pole, but was confronted by CALL PAPA turning for home, dug in gamely while just clear of that foe
through the lane, and fended that rival off to the wire. CALL PAPA tracked while off of the pace in the three path, split tiring foes into the far turn, sustained
his advance through that bend to produce a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, battled outside of NOTARY with a little over a length to find in
upper stretch, but was fended off through the lane and denied the victory. MIDNIGHT BOURBON set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of NOTARY
after that foe made a bid with a half mile to go, but weakened approaching the quarter pole, faded through the lane, but still managed show. CATIPARI had
a slow start and trailed the field, split tiring foes into the far turn, but failed to menace therafter. OKUDAH lied close to the pace three wide, attempted to
match strides with NOTARY approaching the half mile pole to make a bid, but failed to do so, then weakened at the seven sixteenths pole, faded around the
turn, and was eased through the lane. WESTERN PHAROAH stalked along the inside, but weakened into the far turn, faded, and was eased through the
lane.

LASTCHANCEATGLORY saved ground while far off of the pace along the inside, cut the corner turning for home and commenced a rally, shifted off of the
rail approaching the furlong pole, split foes in the late stages, and just got up inside of TEN FLAT at the wire. TEN FLAT was forwardly placed along the
inside early on, allowed DA GOLD ROOM to clear, shifted two wide to stalk that foe into the backstretch, produced a bid for the lead approaching the
quarter pole, but was floated to the four path by that foe turning for home, forged an advantage in upper stretch and gamely held his margin to deep stretch,
but was bested by a ground saving rival in the final sixteenth. PAINTSVILLE trailed early on, swung from the two path to the seven path while rallying
turning or home, sustained his advance through the lane outside of rivals, but did not have enough ground to catch the leaders. HIGHLAND BOSS steadied
along the inside around the first turn, pulled inside of foes to a stalking position at the half mile pole, but lacked a kick in upper stretch to produce a bid after
the leader drifted out, and got outfinished. HIGHESTDISTINCTION raced far off of the pace, took the far turn in the four to six path before shifting in in upper
stretch, split foes at the furlong pole, and stayed on willingly. PAINISMYGAIN tracked from midpack three to four wide, advanced to stalking position into the
far turn, but flattened out in the five path turning for home, and weakened at the furlong pole. DA GOLD ROOM cleared the field around the first turn, met a
bid from TEN FLAT around the far turn, drifted out turning for home, but was headed in upper stretch and weakened at the furlong pole. DRAW THE LINE
steadied early on, raced off of the pace in the two path, but failed to factor. SUGGESTED stalked two to three wide, but came under a drive between horses
into the far turn, and weakened. FALKIRK raced off of the pace in the three path, and was no factor. MULBERRY STREET was done early. PATRIOT'S
WAR raced midpack four to three path around the first turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
SENOR FRIDAY saved ground in midpack, surged through a wide rail opening turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch from outer foes, and was kept
to task to the wire. ENTERTAINER lied close to the pace three wide before inching closer to duel for the lead outside of a pair of foes at the eleven
sixteenths pole, forged a lead at the five sixteenths pole, but stayed in the three path and was headed by a ground saving rival turning for home, then held
place through the lane. FLYING FRANK prompted the pace setter two wide, dueled between horses passing the eleven sixteenths pole, but took back to
stalk those foes at the nine sixteenths pole, shifted to the four path and rebid at the five sixteenths pole as BAQUERO FLIES rallied alongside, but kept on
through the lane and fended off that outer foe for a minor reward while making mild progress on place. BAQUERO FLIES saved ground far off of the pace
around the first turn, produced a swift gain in the six path and outside of foes into the far turn, produced a bid at the five sixteenths pole, but leveled off
turning for home and failed to achieve show honors. OGEE'S EKATI rallied in the five path between horses into the far turn, but failed to keep pace with
those foes turning for home. JUSTIN ZEE raced far off of the pace two wide, and never threatened. KAPELLMEISTER set the pace along the inside, dueled
for the lead inside a pair of foes down the backstretch, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and wilted through the lane. VENKMAN was never
involved.

Footnotes
NATHAN DETROIT stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path into the far turn before producing a three wide bid for the lead at the five sixteenths
pole, shifted two wide turning for home, edged a lead in upper stretch, then gamely held off PRIVATE ISLAND to the wire. PRIVATE ISLAND tracked from
midpack along the inside, shifted off of the rail and loomed in the three to four path at the five sixteenths pole, produced a three wide bid for the lead while
hanging on his left lead, drift out at the furlong pole due to left handed pressure after swapping to her right lead, but flopped back to her left lead at the
sixteenth pole, drifted back in, and did not have enough to catch the leader. REALLY SLOW saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, advanced in
the two to three path around the far turn, then chased the leaders home willingly. CROSS OF GALILEE set the pace along the inside, but was headed by
the eventual winner turning for home, and weakened. AMES MISTER trailed early on, advanced along the inside around the far turn before swinging four
wide turning for home, caused multiple outer foes to stack up in the process, then stayed on through the lane, but failed to menace. MR. SLATE raced far off
the pace, advanced mildly in the five path around the far turn, but was forced to the seven path turning for home, then failed to produce a bid. GUNDUZ took
the far turn in the four to five path, but failed to factor. GOOD FIRST tracked from midpack three wide, advanced to striking range down the backstretch, but
weakened into the far turn. CONQUEST RAINYCITY advanced from midpack to striking range two wide and between horses down the backstretch, but
weakened into the far turn. LOCK UP pulled keenly around the first turn to vie for the lead three to two wide, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
FREEDOM'S FLIGHT advanced in the four path from off of the pace to produce a three wide bid for the lead into the far turn, dueled with a pair of inner
foes, then only a single foe at the five sixteenths pole, sustained the duel gamely through the lane, and prevailed at the wire. KING THEO prompted the
pace two wide before dueling between horses into the far turn, shifted to the inside at the five sixteenths pole, dug in gamely in upper stretch to hold a
narrow margin, clung to his advantage into the final sixteenth between horses, but was nailed on the wire. PREFECT tracked in the three path, lied in range
of the leaders in the three to four path around the far turn, produced a three wide bid between horses turning for home, sustained his bid through the lane,
but did not have enough to catch the game leaders. FRONT MAN stalked along the inside, shifted two wide around the far turn, but was blocked behind the
leaders turning for home and through upper stretch, altered course inwards at the furlong pole and produced a bid, but did not have enough to catch the
leaders. JOB SECURITY raced in midpack along the inside, shifted out through the far turn to attempt a rally, but found traffic in the three path at the quarter
pole, then willingly chased the leaders through the lane. NEPAL UP advanced from far off of the pace four wide around the far turn to produce a bid turning
for home, but flattened out at the furlong pole. STAGE READY advanced slightly in five wide around the far turn, but flattened out turning for home, and
failed to threaten. MISHAWAKA set the pace, dueled inside of a pair of rivals into the far turn, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped through
the lane. B SKY HIGH was never involved.
