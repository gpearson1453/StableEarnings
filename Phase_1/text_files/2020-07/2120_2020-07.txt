Footnotes
YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY forwardly placed early off the inside, moved up to duel onto the backstretch, dueled the middle half, shook off the other speed
turning for home, expanded that advantage past the furlong marker then held the runner up safe late. FRESH SNUFF in the main body early while four wide
through the first turn, continued in the second flight on the outside in the run up the backstretch, moved closer in the far turn, chased the winner through
upper stretch, slowly getting to that one late while in turn holding onto the place spot. SUPER LEGS forwardly placed early toward the inside, moved out,
four wide into the lane, drifted slightly, coming back on the top pair late. CABO SUNSET back off the early pace off the inside, advanced three out to four
wide in the second turn, bothered by a drifting COMMERCIAL FLASH approaching mid stretch, recovered to finish up evenly. COMMERCIAL FLASH settled
in the second flight off the rail, continued one paced into the stretch, drifted out nearing the furlong grounds, lacked a closing response. CLASSY BIRDETTE
moved up to show the way through the first turn, dueled up the backstretch and into the far turn, gave way in the drive. MY BABY BELE last to leave, void of
speed, remained back while lugging in midstretch. BEAR TOOTH PASS was never a factor.

Footnotes
BROADWAY JONES forwardly placed out of the chute, stalked the two leaders in the three path up the backstretch and into the far turn, ranged up to take
over on the outside turning for home, shook clear, kept to task. REACH THE CIRCLE in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground turn,
moved closer into the lane, could do little more with the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the place. SIR POKERFACE broke back, moved up to
race in the second group between horses, continued behind traffic into the lane, improved position mildly to be along for the show. GEM OF CARLOS
pressed the early leader from the outside, dueled through the turn while remaining in the two path, weakened steadily in the drive to lose the show late.
CASTLEMAN moved up to take control after the start, dueled through the turn closest to the inside, faltered in the drive. SCISSOR BILL remained always
back. DIAMOND PALACE off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
KEEP AMERICA GREAT away in good order, dueled briefly off the inside, clear before a furlong, continued to maintain a daylight advantage through the
turn, drew off through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. TEXAS PROMO GIRL back off the pace for three furlongs, steered out to be
three wide turning for home, angled back to the inside when clear of the others nearing midstretch, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best.
CUSTOM GULCH void of speed, moved inside for the drive, finished best of the rest while not a threat to the top two, vanned off. LINDA GOT LUCKY broke
alertly, dueled briefly inside the winner, chased that rival into and through the turn, had little left for the drive. KORAT QUEEN four wide trip, not dangerous
in the drive. CHARLIE ROADS went one pace, failed to muster a response in the drive. ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE forwardly placed in the early going off
the inside, floated out four wide into the lane, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
DAVES FRIEND DEWEY broke alertly, narrowly showed the way inside, headed nearing the furlong marker, proved no match for the top two late, held on
stubbornly for the show. CREOLE CHARLIE behind the pace for three furlongs, came four wide out of the turn, lugged in midstretch, challenged three wide
past the furlong marker, took over, led late but could not contain the winner. JANETS JAY JAY broke back, lacked early speed while saving ground, steered
out sharply into the lane, roused, slight drift, late surge to be up in time. D'FESTIVE CAT broke in but forwardly, chased the dueling leaders into the turn,
tired in the drive. PICTURE PAYNTER broke in, was straightened to duel in the two path for just over a quarter then gave way in the drive. RUN AWAY
SON in mid pack early, three wide move into the lane to lodge a bid, also proved no match for the top two late, outkicked for the show. MISTA VALENTINE
last away, void of speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to improve position slightly, no real threat.

Footnotes
WABASH CANNONBALL with the pace from the start, vied three wide into and through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, steadily increased
advantate while being kept to task. SI FAMILIA lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn when beginning to improved, moved out a bit when set
down for the drive, could do little with the winner late, clearly second best. JALEN HURTS in the second flight in the run up the backstretch outside, raced
four wide through the turn, no match top two, clear of the others. TIN ROOF RUSTED vied up front toward the inside early, continued to contest the issue
through the turn closest to the rail, weakened in the drive. DOMINANTE fell back to lag well behind soon after the start, continued to trail by a wide margin
turn, roused when straightened for home, finished with some late interest through traffic to improve and outkick several rivals for the fifth position. MUNDO
MUTADDA lacked speed well out in the strip, five wide through the turn, improved position in the stretch. VALLEY OF THE HIDE broke back, raced four
wide into the turn, steered in a bit to save some ground, picked off a couple of rivals in the drive while remaining out in the strip. TEN SILVER PINS broke
sharp, vied early inside, gave way in the drive. DRY WOOD CREEK last away, moved up to mid pack, four wide exiting the turn, tired through the stretch.
BWANA GO with the early pace, began a steady retreat after a half. MONTBROOKS MIRACLE was never close.

VON DOM broke with the leaders, chased the dueling leaders into and through the turn in the three path, set down for the drive, closed with good resolve to
be up in time. CATINANDSCATIN broke well, dueled closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, clear past the furlong marker,
could not contain the winner, remained well clear for the place. FRIENDOFTHECOURT broke well, alternated up front in the two path, could not match the
runner up in the drive nor contain the winner, saved the show. BANQUET CHEF in the second flight inside early, raced a bit greenly in the turn, continued
one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. GOOD TIMES ROLLIN last to leave, moved out, four wide into the stretch, lacked a significant
closing response. TIME TO B WILD broke back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TAPIT ON RACE DAY off a step slow, raced back early, circled four wide into contention late in the turn, lost some ground to the leader into the stretch,
engaged that one past the furlong marker and wore that same rival down to edge clear late. WAR SONG broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, shook
clear exiting the turn, briefly responded when the winner challenged nearing midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to that one late, well clear for the place.
SHOT ON WINDY HILL void of speed for a half, steered out into the five path entering the stretch to be widest for the drive, along for the show while not a
threat to the top pair. HALF OURS N STORMY fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced within striking distance early, bit closer turning for home,
flattened out to come up empty for the stretch drive. GOLDEN PALACE turned in an even effort while racing out in the strip. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT settled in
mid pack for a half, had little for the stretch run. LA CLEVER lacked a closing response. KING'S PRAYER away in good order, dueled up front inside the
runner up, gave way late in the bend. SIR ETNEY JOHN fell back after the start, trailed to be always outrun.

Footnotes
BUXTERHOOTER four wide into the first turn when with the second flight, continued to head up the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, moved to
challenge the leader when straightened for home, long drive to the wire, gained the nod while between horses at the wire. RUN TAPPY last away, continued
unhurried the middle half, began to advance midway on the final turn, widest into the lane, late run to challenge in the final strides while remaining widest of
the first flight to miss. OUTOFTHISGALAXY broke on top, got well clear before a quarter, set a soft set of fractions while maintaining daylight, responded
when the winner came alongside upper stretch, proved stubborn to the end. CAJUN PINATA settled in the second flight, raced inside the winner into the far
turn, lacked a late punch in the drive. KING OF THE TESTO forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn, continued to save ground while falling back
into the second turn, not a threat in the drive. PINCH ASSAULT settled off the pace, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
LUCKY PRIORITY forwardly placed while racing outside, advanced three wide to challenge late in the turn, long duel to the wire, wore down rival under firm
handling. GUILTY CONFESSION with the pace onto the main track off the inside, dueled into the turn, briefly gained a larger advantage late in the turn
before being joined by the winner soon after, dueled the length of the stretch with that foe closest to the inside, held on stubbornly. ZYDECO MUSIC lacked
speed, moved out, came three wide into the stretch while in some traffic, rallied for the show while too late for the top two. MIRACLE SWEEP in the second
flight off the inside, also came three wide into the stretch,closest to the top two a furlong outside, caught for the show late. LADY CARLOS settled in mid
pack off the inside, raced three wide through the bend, lacked a serious closing repsonse. ELLIE D CAJUN was never dangerous while racing off the
insode. JO JO'S HALO with the early pace while inside of the runner up, gave way late in the turn. SOFIA KAPE within striking distance early outside, four
wide exiting the turn, tired in the drive. FUHRCRY void of any early foot, was never a factor. K ONE COMET reared at the start to spot the field a couple of
lengths and also was never involved. G G'S WRECKINGBALL remained back, trailed home to be always outrun.
