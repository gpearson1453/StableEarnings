GROWTH ENGINE settled into a tracking position, closed the gap on his own rounding the far turn, bid outside of LOVE IS YOUR NAME at the quarter
pole, dueled with that rival, took over passing the furlong marker and pulled away under urging. LOVE IS YOUR NAME cleared the field to set the pace,
showed the way into the far turn, dueled with the winner turning for home, dug in gamely but proved no match. COLONEL JUAN raced two wide off the
pace, three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly near the inside and got up late for third. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL raced off the pace inside, rallied mildly and
was outfinished for the show spot. PURCHASING POWER raced three wide early, stalked outside, chased on the far turn and weakened. ORPHEUS (ARG)
raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
