Footnotes
BUSTIN SHOUT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path at the
seven-sixteenths, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, drifted out slightly straightened away and brushed lightly
with VALMONT who came in slightly straightened away forcing DOWSE'S BEACH to steady in behind those rivals, the riders of both peering back and
paused briefly at the three-sixteenths, got headed for command near the eighth pole due to the pause, dug in under a drive re-engaged by the rider
knocking heads with ROYAL ASSET to take back command seventy yards from home to prevail gamely on the wire. ROYAL ASSET coaxed from the gate,
chased two to three wide from mid pack, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, avoided the traffic issue and rallied to take narrow command a
furlong from home, dug in dueling with the aforementioned foe through to the finish getting headed seventy yards from home and was ultimately bested at
the end. VALMONT coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued two to
three wide into upper stretch, came in slightly straightened away switching leads and lightly brushed with BUSTIN SHOUT which in turn forced DOWSE'S
BEACH to steady in behind and in turn POWER UP PAYNTER to alter course, paused briefly taking a look back then kept on to preserve the show honors.
BANANA THIEF two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch, got brushed by
POWER UP PAYNTER at the three-sixteenths as that rival altered out from in behind DOWSE'S BEACH who steadied in front, then offered up a mild kick
for the last major share. DR. SHANE chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. POWER UP PAYNTER tracked the pace along the inside, was
briefly off heels and taken in hand at the seven-sixteenths before being tipped out to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, altered out a path at the three-sixteenths as DOWSE'S BEACH steadied in front as rivals in front of him came
together and in turn brushed with BANANA THIEF, then made no late headway. DOWSE'S BEACH coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, came
under light coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch eyeing a very slim seam of daylight between BUSTIN SHOUT and
VALMONT, had those rivals drift slightly towards one another and was forced to steady off them in turn forcing POWER UP PAYNTER to alter out brushing
with BANANA THIEF, the rider looking behind him paused at the three-sixteenths, then got wrapped up through to the finish. There was a Stewards' Inquiry
into the incident in upper stretch as well as a Jockey's Objection by the rider of DOWSE'S BEACH alleging interference against BUSTIN SHOUT. After
review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
DEEP SEA pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper
stretch then came under a left-handed whip, dueled outside of the runner-up, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, fought very gamely
to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. VINEYARD SOUND was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along
the rail on the turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch, came under a right-handed whip outside the eighth-pole
then fought on well, swapped back to his inside lead after being switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, went back to a right-handed whip
late and just missed while able to get the place. LAZARUS PROJECT was sent hard from the start then moved out while settling towards the front, went
three to four wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, chased the top two under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. OUR
HONOR was taken under a tight hold just behind the pacesetter early then rated just off the pace, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn, was
asked at the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and was out-kicked. VICAR'S LEGEND settled at the rear of
the field, saved ground early on the turn, shifted three wide while roused at the five-sixteenths, moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole, turned into the
stretch under the whip and gained some but failed to threaten. TALE OF MIST broke a half-step slow then was hustled, raced on the outside while ridden
along, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. HARDCORE FOLKLORE bobbled at the start, settled under some urging while inside of
TALE OF MIST, moved in to save ground on the turn, was put to the whip inside the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
IN FRONT the quickest out of the starting gate albeit by a narrow margin had the pilot see two others to his left likewise forwardly placed, responded when
put to a firm hold and was guided into the pocket, getting positioned there by the end of the homestretch, tracked the pace reacting somewhat keenly to the
snug grip being applied by the rider, kept within striking distance, waited momentarily behind the front runners as six furlongs was being rattled off, stepped
into the lane, drafted behind DOVIMA until deep into the furlong grounds, slipped to the outside and out-hoofed a weakening HALO CITY for the two
path,attaining it by the eighth pole, kicked into her best when asked for more, whittled away at the deficit, bumped with the second place finisher assuming
the top in deep stretch, then inched away. DOVIMA grabbed control shortly after the field had been sent off and running, rated well showing the way from
along the inside route, attended by HALO CITY out in the two path, settled onto the top of the lane and was turned loose, felt the presence of the eventual
winner at the end of the sprint through the furlong grounds, dug in with determination as the lead dwindled down steadily, came out slightly as the top one
was coming in a bit herself in deep stretch, resulting in contact between them, released the top, fought onward but couldn't re-claim the advantage. WITCH
MOON cut over to the rail after lunging slightly at the start, stalked the pace from midpack, slid over to the rail at the half mile pole, flashed interest closing
the gap departing that station, was roused at the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch slightly wider, got outfinished. HALO CITY prompted DOVIMA
while two wide, kept at the task for the opening three-quarters, got cued up for the drive home, shifted towards the three path while weakening during the
ensuing furlong, wound up losing position to the winner, then weakened steadily thereafter. GOLDEN CELINE off two lengths the tardiest, went over to the
rail, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed.

RELEASETHETHUNDER four then three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from
home, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. RYAN'S CAT established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile
from home, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat and was collared a sixteenth out, then dug in and preserved the
place honors on the wire. TWELFTH LABOUR five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. QUEEN'S MASON chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. AMERICAN RULE chased three then two wide, climbed through
the turn along the inside resenting the kickback from rivals up ahead, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.

MISCHIEVOUS DREAM was rated just off the pace, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide at the five-sixteenths, rallied outside into the stretch,
bumped with THIN WHITE DUKE nearing the three-sixteenths then took the lead, kicked clear outside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under steady urging.
THIN WHITE DUKE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was well placed just behind the leader, drafted inside on the turn, was asked briefly in the two path
at the quarter-pole, bumped with MISCHIEVOUS DREAM near the three-sixteenths then steadied, moved out for room shortly thereafter, chased in the final
furlong and finished willingly for the place. MARTINEZ bumped with a rival just after the start, was reserved at the back under a tight hold, went three then
four wide on the turn, gained five wide into upper stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and was out-kicked while able to get the show. DATA DEAL
was a bit reluctant to load, bumped hard with a foe at the start, recovered well to set the pace, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the rail,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. COMPETITIVE HERO
stalked the pace on the outside under a hold, was asked while three then two wide on the turn, made a bid into upper stretch, battled under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. WICKED EASY bumped with an opponent just after the start, settled near the back, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the
two path, shifted three wide later on that bend, was asked for his best in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. CHARGEMYDINNER was fractious
behind the gate, settled on the outside, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and also lacked the needed
response. STRONG DESIRE was fractious behind the gate, raced on the outside under urging, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. COUNT
FROST was hustled from the start then ridden along in the middle of the field, moved in to save ground on the turn and failed to respond. (Rail at 12 Feet)

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM took up position in midpack after the start, underwent a two wide journey for nearly three-quarters, between rivals on the clubhouse
bend, swung into action by swinging out into the four path after stepping into the lane, clawed its way into contention, out-fought a plethora of foes to strike
the front end with approximately a sixteenth to go, dug in gamely to fend off SENTRY'S late rally. SENTRY darted over to the rail after the field had been
sent on its way, was well-rated bringing up the back of the pack, got asked for more at the five-sixteenths pole, finished the run around the second bend and
got angled to the outside, fanned out into path six during the ensuring furlong, becoming the widest of all, had a good finish down the center of the course,
fell short. NOBLE THOUGHT three wide on both turns, was closer to the rail travelling along the backstretch, was given his cue for the stretch run, came
home willingly en route for the show. KROY off to an alert getaway, glided over to the rail, getting there well before arriving at the end of the homestretch,
was coaxed along carving out the pace, shadowed by ISOTHEM from the outside, saw that foe take over and shift onto the rail midway on turn two, tipped
into the two path right afterwards, stepped into the lane and re-bid for the top, was successful by the furlong grounds, held out against heavy pressure for
slightly over a sixteenth, weakened after yielding a second time. WILLING TO SPEED saved ground for the initial six furlongs, was moved towards path two
at the head of the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. LUSITANO sneaked his way into the pocket coming up to the crown of the first turn, sat within
range, well held, as were most of the others, during the opening half, continued to track the front runners leaving the half mile pole, got asked for more
coming onto the top of the lane, was eased outward and into the two path at the furlong grounds, slipped by ISOTHEM during the going from the eighth pole
to the sixteenth marker, re-tucked along the rail and went evenly late. ZERO GRAVITY took up the chase two wide after bobbling at the break, was
maneuvered into the five path from upper to midlane, lacked the needed response. ISOTHERM pressed the issue from, launched a take-over coming up to
the three-eights pole, slid over to the rail, spun into the lane, came under siege, released the lead at the furlong grounds then steadily backed away.

Footnotes
MY SASSY SARAH bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, spotted the front a couple of lengths, settled off the pace, started the turn in the
two path, shifted three then four wide around the five-sixteenths, was asked at that point, rallied outside into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead at the
three-sixteenths then accelerated clear, drifted in inside the furlong marker and was given two cracks of a left-handed whip then proved best under a strong
hand ride to the wire. LIGHT IN THE SKY bumped with a rival at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was reserved at the rear,
rounded most of the turn in the two path while still under restraint, shifted three then four wide late on that bend, gained five while roused into the stretch,
chased the winner in the drive and finished with good courage for the place. SARATOGA LOVE was taken under a tight hold while showing speed,
contested the pace on the inside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into
the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. MZ SEB PAT broke a step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused
inside the five-sixteenths, came off the rail into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. APPLETINI disputed the pace on the outside then in the two
path on the turn, was given her cue near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch and tired. WINIFRED J came away in front but was taken
under a vigorous hold while showing speed between horses, jostled with BULL FEATHERS while very rank under stout restraint nearing the half-mile pole,
steadied some in the process, leveled out while inside on the turn, was asked at the top of the stretch then put to the whip nearing the furlong marker and
came up empty. OFFICER HUTCHY broke a half-step slow then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the turn, turned
into the stretch under the whip and capitulated. BULL FEATHERS was hard held while rated just off the pace, jostled with WINIFRED J while very rank
under stout restraint nearing the half-mile pole, checked while lugging out into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend and failed to respond. (Rail at 12
Feet)

SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER remained stationed along the inside route after appearing to get away in good order, checked when cut off by a maneuvering
STUNNING SKY just as the first fraction was about to be finalized, lost some momentum reacting rankly afterwards, settled along and resumed tracking the
front runners in a professional manner, slipped to the outside and into the two path at the head of the stretch, kicked in when given her cue, split rivals taking
aim on the runner up, saw a spirited tussle between them ignite, forged to a slim lead then dug in gamely to stay in the clear. STUNNING SKY between
rivals heading for the clubhouse bend, bulled her way into the pocket, at the expense of the eventual winner, kept watch on the pace, gained clearance
along the rail corridor when the leader, that being BLAME DEBBIE began to drift to the outside approaching the quarter pole, availed of the open space
inadvertently provided and launched herself to the front end during the ensuing furlong, felt the presence of the top one, saw the pair engaged in a fierce
fight from the eight pole onward, lost the lead, battled onward with good courage, couldn't re-claim it. QUEENS EMBRACE saved ground until the quarter
pole, angled three wide into the stretch, rallied for the show. KEY BISCAYNE pursued the pace from the two path, swung out five wide into the lane, closed
in well enough to earn the last major check. CAT'S PAJAMAS well rated within striking distance from path two until the end of the far turn, got steered out
four wide for the drive home, flattened out. BLAME DEBBIE assumed the top and got guided over to the inside route, showed the way, rating unkind by
fighting the pilot, required some intermittent attention in the area of the right shoulder to maintain a straight course, both on the backstretch and the second
bend, drifted three wide into the lane, backed away, while continuing to get out some more at times. LASHARA (GB) prompted the pace from path two, was
induced to come a couple of paths wider into the lane in reaction to a wayward BLAME DEBBIE, remained prominent for a little while longer then gave way.
MIRABELL MEI took up the chase from the two path for over three-quarters, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all,
failed to menace.

Footnotes
CONTROL GROUP coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of MALIBU PRO from the get go steadily shaking away from the rest, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, shook off MALIBU PRO and drew off under a drive to prevail. MALIBU PRO broke in at the start bumping
SHADOW RIDER in concert with SCARF IT DOWN, then bumped that rival as well, raced two to three wide through the first turn hooking up with the
aforementioned foe and dueled from the two path with that rival to his inside, steadily shook away from the rest, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung two to three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and kept on to preserve the place honors. MILLS three to four wide through
the first turn, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and was along for the show honors best of
the rest. EDEN RIDGE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. STREET TRUST just off the inside through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SHADOW RIDER got bumped between foes who each broke his way
and was pinched back, chased inside through the first turn before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch, came under a ride at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. SCARF IT DOWN broke out at the start bumping SHADOW RIDER and pinching that foe back in
tandem with MALIBU PRO before getting bumped by that inwards breaking foe, raced two then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide down
the backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and faltered.
