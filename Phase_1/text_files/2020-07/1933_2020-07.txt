DARK ALE stalked the pace, angled from the rail to the second path late turn, chased into the stretch, took command a furlong out and widened under a
hand ride. DIXIE WIL, off a step slowly, gained the lead early, shook clear on the turn, was passed a furlong out but held place. NORTHERN SOLUTION
stalked the pace, chased four-wide late turn, drifted out a little at the top of the stretch then finished gamely. HEAD KITTEN stalked, was hustled three-wide
on the turn then evened out in the late stages. STEEL WOOL broke outward and raced from off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn and finished
evenly, but gamely. SUNKA WAKAN forced the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, backed away approaching the stretch and lacked a rally.

up in deep stretch under a drive. ISHIYAYA stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive.

in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide late turn, rallied outside but evened out late. SHORT SUMMER DRESS steadied at the start then was rated off the
pace, chased three then two-wide on the turn and was gaining through the stretch. SAY HEY (FR) raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn,
angled out in the stretch, chased, but weakened nearing the wire. SYSTEMIC RISK, off a step slowly, sprinted to the lead, was joined late turn then faded
through the stretch. MACHO BOURBON broke outward and settled off the pace, came three to five-wide through the turn but never reached contention.

steady pressure in the stretch but evened out in the late stages. ELUSIVE RO stalked early, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, launched a
determined drive but did not menace. CONSTANTINO stalked the pace two-wide, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. KITTEN'S

Footnotes
LAST AMERICAN EXIT broke outward and settled in mid pack, chased two-wide on the turn, rallied, challenged the leader in the final furlong and prevailed
late under a drive. LEAD DIRECTOR gained a short lead late backstretch, dueled on the turn, shook clear a 1/8 out but was quickly engaged and gave way
grudgingly in the late stages. RACING IN THE RAIN forced the early pace, dropped back at the turn, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide then
finished gamely. GHOST OF THE MAMBO raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn then closed with some interest. KEEN SAMURAI pressed
the pace, dueled on the turn, yielded upper stretch but chased to the end. GREEK GEEK steadied along the rail mid backstretch, was steadied again
entering the turn, chased hard still on the rail then closed gamely in the stretch. ENTRY TO HEAVEN lost his path leaving the gate and veered inward,
settled off the pace, came four-wide through the turn then evened out in mid stretch. CANADIAN PHAROAH broke outward and settled off the pace, was
hustled hard four-wide through the turn then lacked a closing response. I LOVE GOLD set a pressured pace, was headed late backstretch, stalked from the
rail then tired in the stretch.
