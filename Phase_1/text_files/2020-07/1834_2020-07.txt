ANOTHERSUNNYDAY away alertly and rushed to a clear advantage in the run to the turn while getting to the rail, maintained her advantage through the
turn, and widened that advantage late under confident handling. GREAT GASBY hopped at the start, and rushed up from along the rail in the run to the turn,
shifted off the rail entering the stretch and closed willingly to get up for the place. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS away well and chased the leader into the turn
while racing one out from the rail, and finished willingly three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. ARBEE'S RUN away well and chased the leader into
the turn while saving ground at the rail, saved ground throughout, but was outfinished late. VALUED chased the leaders one out from the rail entering the
turn, and finished two wide in the drive. DEEP COVE broke sharply and chased the leader four wide in the run to the turn, bore out entering the turn, but
dropped down to the three path entering the lane, and finished with late interest. EL QUETZAL was unprepared at the start to get away poorly, and trailed
throughout.

HEFTY RANSOM broke sharply and tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground along the inside, advanced from between rivals midway down
the backstretch and collared the leader entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up in time. PIPPA dueled for the lead one out
from the rail entering the first turn, took a narrow advantage in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, and closed determinedly
from along the inside in the drive in a solid effort. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid one out from the rail
entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing four wide in the drive. ALUCIA steadied briefly when between rivals passing the wire the
first time, rushed up to track the leaders three wide entering the backstretch, continued three wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response
when called upon. DONE THAT away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace into the backstretch,
struggled to keep up in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

BIG TIME LOUIE away well and rushed up from between rivals through the first turn bumping repeatedly with SCULPTED, battled for the lead from the
outside of that rival in the run down the backside and into the final turn , and closed one out from the rail in the drive while exchanging bumps with BAKKEN
AND EGGS in mid stretch. BAKKEN AND EGGS tracked the leaders while being carried five wide entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide
entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive while exchanging bumps with the winner. RIO ALEX was slow into stride and trailed the field into
the backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to grab the show position. SCULPTED away
alertly and battled for the lead through the first turn while being bumped repeatedly, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, and was outfinished late while racing at the rail. POWER OF INTENTION pressed the pace four wide entering the backstretch, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive. KEEPINGTHEDREAM broke sharply and pressed three wide entering the
backstretch, continued to force the issue in the run to the final turn, struggled to keep pace with the leaders approaching the turn, and finished one out from
the rail in the drive. BALDR settled off the early pace while saving ground entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive while unable to make a late impact. COMMANDER B stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, saved ground entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. NUMAANYS BOY lagged well back early, and was never
a factor.
