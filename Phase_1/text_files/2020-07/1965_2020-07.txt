Footnotes
SASSY SISTER never far back, responded readily when set down along the rail, made the lead past the furlong marker and finished full of run to win as
much the best. BACCARAT chased the pace into the turn, shook clear rapidly, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for winner. BEACH BABE
bumped at the start and had a mild late rally near the inside. WEEKEND AT LAST bumped at the start, was well placed in the four path and went evenly.
BAINBRIDGE bumped at the start, offered a mild bid along the inside in the turn then came up empty. CAUSE OF LOVE was no factor. WAY BACK WHEN
was through after a half. ASHLEY'S ENVY showed little. CENTSOFSTYLE set the pace into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
MISS IRISH BOSS had speed from the start, drew on even terms for the lead near the quarter pole, battled the length of the stretch and proved best under
brisk handling. CHIT CHATTING contested the lead the entire trip and just missed in a game effort. WOLF EYES never far back, swung wide and closed a
gap late. COSI MOMOSI well placed, was bumped at the top of the stretch then faded. DESIGNATE close up three wide, drifted out entering the stretch
then inward bumping a rival at the top of the stretch then lacked the needed response. VALID INTEREST dueled into the turn then gave way. ROSES FOR
MARTINA trailed.

LOVELY HEIR broke in front and dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, shook clear under a right handed stick and just lasted under a strong hand
ride. ZULU LEGEND altered course to the outside soon after the start, trailed into the stretch, closed with a rush in the five path and just missed getting up
in time. THE COOKIE MAN vied for the lead two then three wide, loomed boldly at the top of the stretch then leveled off. REANIMATE away alertly, dueled
with the winner along the inside into the stretch then weakened. SPECTACULAR ROAD had good early speed along the inside, checked repeatedly while
lacking room approaching the turn, had speed into the stretch then gave way. CUTLER had speed to the quarter pole then faltered.

Footnotes
LOVEATTURKEYCLUB unhurried early, closed with a burst of speed in the five path under right handed urging through the stretch, made the lead late and
won going away. FAST FAIRY allowed to settle, had a mild late rally in the six path and finished clear for second. LEOPOLDO dueled for the lead along the
inside until deep stretch then was outfinished. NOBLE BEHAVIOR contested the lead two wide and finished on even terms with LEOPOLDO at the wire.
OVERWATCH stalked pace the pace into the stretch then faded. TIZ SMART was fractious in the gate prior to the start, raced erratically the first few strides
and was always outrun. DYNAMIC KID trailed.
