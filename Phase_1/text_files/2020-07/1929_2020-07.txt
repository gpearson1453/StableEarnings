Footnotes
STONE GROOVE was on the pace from the outset then pushed away to the half mile pole, was three wide on the second turn then was never challenged in
the drive while under steady handling to the sixteenth pole. IF I HAD A NICKEL chased the winner throughout while two wide, could not threaten that one
but bested SUNNY SPOT for second. SUNNY SPOT was outsprinted to the backstretch, tracked to the second turn, made a run three wide to briefly loom a
threat but slackened in the final furlong. ON THE WINGS OF was settled for a half mile then saved ground to no avail. UNUSUALLY BIG had no speed,
raced four wide throughout and was not a factor. INTIMIDATE tracked the pace four wide to the second turn, got outrun to the stretch and gave way. PAPA
PAGOSA trailed, stopped after five furlongs then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
CLEM LABINE trailed to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, rallied to close the gap to mid stretch then split rivals, got to terms with the runnerup and
bested that one in a hard drive. SEQUENTIALLY pressed the pace outside three others, was four wide to the stretch, dueled the winner in the final furlong
but could not hold that one safe. RUSH contested the pace early, got outkicked on the turn, swung out four wide to the stretch then lacked a closing
response. TEMPLE KNIGHTS dueled for the lead inside rivals and two wide too the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. ARGOSY FLEET
hustled to attend the pace three wide and between rivals to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired.

Footnotes
JAZZY EINSTEIN tracked the pace to the second turn, came four wide to the stretch, shifted out for room and rallied then surged in the final sixteenth to
prevail. CULTURED PEARL stalked the leaders to the second turn, was carried out to the five lane into the stretch, rallied to collar CHARLIE'S A. T. M. in
mid stretch, could not shake off that one and was nailed in the final jump for the win. CHARLIE'S A. T. M. pressed the pace to the second turn, rallied three
then four wide to the stretch, was overtaken by CULTURED PEARL in mid stretch but kept on doggedly to the line. PAJAMA QUEEN set the pace to the
second turn, drifted out into the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. UNUSUAL SECRET tracked the leaders to the second turn, came
two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. SPIRIT LAKE had no speed and was not a factor. SOMETHING CHATTER showed little.

MISS YOU MOM was a pace factor to the second turn, got outkicked to the stretch but battled back to again join ODESSA for the lead in mid stretch then
battled gamely to the line to get the nod. ODESSA was on the pace four wide to the second turn, inched away to the stretch but was again confronted by the
winner in mid stretch, fought bravely to the wire but was nipped. SWEET SARAH BEAR chased the top two for six furlongs three wide then weakened in the
drive. BABY HANG ON had no speed, settled to the half, saved ground on the second turn but gave way in the stretch. SNOW PACK trailed throughout
then stopped after six furlongs, was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
NORTHERN QUEST had no speed, settled for a half mile, rallied when roused on the second turn, shifted out for room once in the stretch and closed fast to
prevail. HOLD ME CLOSE set all the pace for six furlongs, responded when set down for the drive but could not stall the winner. PREMIER LEAGUE
pressed HOLD ME CLOSE to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch, finished evenly but gained the show.
MATSON also prompted the leader to the second turn, saved ground and loomed a threat to mid stretch then weakened. WORLD O LUCK trailed to the
half, circled five wide on the second turn but was not a threat. BLUES RAPPER had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch and was also not a factor.
LONO settled for a half mile, was off the rail on the second turn and weakened in the drive. HOSS stalked the pace for a half mile then gave out.

Footnotes
LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS zipped clear in the opening furlongs, set the pace three wide, kicked away to mid stretch and was kept to task to the line in an
impressive debut. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS was sent for speed but could only chase the winner three then four wide to the stretch but had enough left to
save second. WHO YOU SAY I AM also was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. PRINCE ON THE RUN
was outsprinted, got fanned four wide on the turn and was not a threat. BLAKEFORD also chased the winner two wide but weakened in the drive. BOBBY'S
ALIBI got outsprinted to the turn then circled five wide and gave way. ANOTHER CHAMP had no speed and saved ground. BIG ERROR angled in to be in
the two path on the turn but was always outrun.

Footnotes
HABOBANERO had good speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch then edged away to mid stretch but was under vigorous handling to hold. SHEZA
GIRLY GIRL broke slow and trailed to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch, eased out and had a lane between rivals in mid stretch then closed fast but
was too late. PRAISE AND HONOR chased the winner to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the
line. CAROLINA MIA got outsprinted to the turn, was pushed out four then five wide to the stretch and did not rally. DRAW ME had no speed, raced off the
rail to the stretch then weakened. STRADARI prompted the winner three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and gave way. SMOKIN HOT
BOBBIE was sent hard to chase her stablemate from the rail but stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
PROPEPPY chased the leaders early then drifted inward slightly leaving the half and crowded CATTERING at the seven sixteenths, rallied two wide to the
stretch, got to terms in mid stretch then outbattled GAMBLER'S APPEAL and LOVEFLIESONWINGS to the line. GAMBLER'S APPEAL chased the pace
outside the winner and three wide, rallied alongside that one to mid stretch, dueled in the final furlong but was bested while getting the nod for second.
LOVEFLIESONWINGS pressed the pace outside of HOLD MY HOOPS and four wide to mid turn, got floated out to the six path by that one to the stretch,
was collared by the top two in mid stretch and bested late. SOMARA had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch but could only pick off rivals in
the drive. HOLD MY HOOPS hustled to contest the pace three wide to mid turn, drifted out to the five path into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
CATTERING was also chasing the pace early, got crowded by the winner while inside that one at the seven sixteenths, took up, shifted three wide but came
up empty in the drive. SOPRESCIOUS was through early, stopped in the stretch then was eased but walked off.
