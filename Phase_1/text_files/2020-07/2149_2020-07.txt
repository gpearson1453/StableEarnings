Footnotes
JERSEY DIAMOND set a pressured pace, quickened on the turn, widened when asked upper stretch and finished under a hand ride. GIANT ATTRACTION
stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased determinedly through the stretch. STORMY EGBERT raced in mid pack, was hustled from
the rail on the turn and finished gamely. WESTERN SOCIETY forced the pace, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. BACHELOR PAD
broke in the air and settled well off the pace, angled three to five-wide closing through the turn, was still game in the stretch but failed to menace.
CANADIAN SECRET settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn then finished with some interest. SOUPER DEPUTY raced in mid pack,
was hustled two-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. TALL WATER settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn but evened out in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
PURRSUADE ME set a pressured pace, quickened on the turn then widened through the stretch under a hand ride. FEDERAL COURT got away slowly and
settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn then rallied willingly to no avail. DANCING ZAZINGA stalked the pace, chased two-wide
on the turn, launched an all out stretch drive but evened out in the late stages. DOWN TO EARTH had brief speed then forced the pace, chased two-wide
through the turn but had no closing response. KENTUCKY FAN settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn then finished evenly. TARA
EMPIRE broke a step slowly and veered outward, raced from off the pace, chased two-wide through the turn but never reached contention.

IN A TWIST settled in mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the turn, challenged in the final furlong, gained the lead and held under a drive. KING
CAUSEWAY stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail late turn then bid between foes in the final furlong but was outfinished. MONEY MATTERS, in mid
pack early, closed late backstretch, forced the pace, lodged his bid just past the furlong marker but was oukicked. SECRET PATH led onto the main track,
set a pressured pace, dueled on the turn then gave way in the final furlong. GIANT CRITIC forced the issue, dueled o the turn but yielded when challenged
in the stretch. ZOOMER MUSIC stalked the leaders, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but failed to menace. ONE MORE DRIFT
settled off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. TORPEDO MAX, rated off the pace, chased two-wide through the
turn but lacked a closing response. GOOGLE IT stalked the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
FOREST SURVIVOR joined the early leader and drew clear late backstretch, set the pace then held sway under a drive. UNLIMITED TALENT was sent to
the early lead, was joined quickly, forced the pace, chased on the turn and was determined in the stretch SHAKOO MAKOO raced in mid pack, was hustled
angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then closed willingly. GRAND GIZMO steadied at the start, chased two and three-wide on the turn but failed to
menace. MUSIC TRIBUTE raced in mid pack, was hustled on the turn but was never in contention. OLD HABITS settled off the pace, was hustled along the
rail on the turn but lacked a rally. FLASHY SIGNATURE dwelt and trailed throughout.

bumped THE KIPPY TRAIN, settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide late turn and finished gamely. FRIGHT NIGHT settled off the pace, closed three to
five-wide on the turn then finished gamely. BEL BIMBO raced in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive but
was outkicked for the place and show positions. LEGAL GUMP stalked the pace, was hustled and closed along the rail late turn but evened out in deep
stretch. SILVER SHERIFF stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. D'S BEN stalked early, was
hustled two and three-wide on the turn, was checked in tight quarters nearing the top of the stretch then lacked a rally. THE KIPPY TRAIN was bumped at
the outset, showed speed and dueled on the backstretch, chased two-wide on the turn then tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MAKE NO MISTAKE set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, scooted away at the top of the stretch and finished under a hand ride. COMIC KITTEN
stalked the pace, chased two-wide late turn and was all out through the stretch. MIZZONA, rated off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide late
turn then rallied gamely outside. STOP WHO'S THAT settled off the pace, chased hard from the rail on the far turn then finished gamely in vain. CANADIAN
MAGIC settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide through the far turn but lacked a closing response. HANIEL, rated off the pace, angled from two
to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. STOKES staked the pace, closed three-wide late turn but evened out in the final
furlong.

but chased to the wire. WAVE WARNING broke outward and settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn, was steadied to avoid a checking
rival late turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. FAHRENHEIT pressed the early pace, stalked on the turn, chased into the stretch, was herded
inward by DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE upper stretch and had to check then finished gamely. AGNELLI bore out across VICTOR'S DYNASTY, MEANT TO
TELL YOU and DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE just out of the gate, forced the pace, dueled on the turn, chased into the stretch then evened out in the final
furlong. VICTOR'S DYNASTY stalked the early pace, was in tight between rivals late backstretch, closed three and four-wide late turn but was checked in
