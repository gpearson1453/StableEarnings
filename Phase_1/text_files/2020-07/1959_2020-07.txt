Footnotes
SUZY MASCARA away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering
the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to be up in the closing strides. KRISSY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and finished from just off the rail in the drive, but was
unable to hold off the late bid from SUZY MASCARA, while proving easily second best. DORYS DARLIN unprepared at the start to get away poorly, trailed
the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the
drive to prove best of the rest. ANIMA unprepared at the start, and got away poorly, raced into a stalking trip three wide entering the backstretch, rallied four
wide into the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive. TUI broke sharply and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, raced three wide entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a stewards inquiry
into the start of the race. After review, the stewards ordered full refunds on both ANIMA, and FOXY BRUNETTE who wasn't loaded in the gate prior to the
start

Footnotes
FLORAL away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch
and into the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. FULLY LENT broke sharply and steadied briefly when in tight quarters at the rail
approaching the wire the first time, tracked the pacesetter two wide entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly
two wide in the drive to prove second best. SANGRIA away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. WALKINTHEWALK stalked the leader into the first turn
while under snug restraint, pulled her way from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, raced along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
three wide in the drive. SOPHIE SOLEIL stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn,
but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

BACK ALLEY CAT settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, launched his bid three wide entering the final
turn, angled in entering the stretch and closed steadily from along the rail in the drive to be up in time. AVE'S IN COMMAND broke sharply and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, opened a clear advantage entering the final turn, and drifted out late and was nipped in the final strides.
WE GOT IT COVERED settled well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the
final turn, was fanned five wide leaving the turn, and finished four wide in the drive to grab the show position. ATOMIC HAZE stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive. RODE TO GALIANO
away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed from along
the rail in the stretch drive. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT ducked in at the start, and trailed the field throughout. TARGETED away alertly and was running off while
steadying off heels entering the first turn, pressed the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was unable to keep tabs on the
pacesetter entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

BAMBOO ELEVEN away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the
final turn, and closed tenaciously from along the rail in deep stretch to be up in time. BACKSEAT RIDER broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, assumed command in deep stretch, but was unable to fend off
BAMBOO ELEVEN in the final strides. BLONDIE settled well off the early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her
bid four wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing three out from the rail in the drive. ICELAND rushed up from between rivals
to take the lead entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run to the final run, maintained her lead into the lane, but tired late and was forced to
take up approaching the wire when put in tight quarters. SUNRONITA settled off the early speed while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. YOU GOT THIS away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing one out from the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive but hung late. RAINE OR
SHINE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied four out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished with some late interest five wide in the
drive. TIMELESS SHRUG settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground throughout, but failed to make an impact.
KODEE'S HONOUR stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, struggled to maintain her position approaching the final turn,
and faded over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a rider's claim of foul. The rider of ICELAND lodged a claim of foul against the
rider of BACKSEAT RIDER for alleged interference nearing the finish line. After review the claim of foul was upheld, and BACKSEAT RIDER was
disqualified from second and placed fourth
