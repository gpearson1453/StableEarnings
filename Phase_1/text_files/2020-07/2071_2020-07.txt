Footnotes
SALLY O'BRIEN pressed the pace three wide through mid-turn, continued in the three path into the lane when bidding for the top spot, edged to the front
when straightening, continued to inch up through the final eighth and cleared late. RISKY BEHAVIOR was off with an awkward start, hustled up to join the
contenders, raced in the two or three path through the turn, continued in the two path into the lane, had aim on the top ones through the lane and appeared
to gain momentum very late to just get up for the place spot. CLARO QUE SI vied for the lead two wide into mid-turn, repelled inside challenger then was
joined by the winner from the outside, dueled with that one into the lane and gave ground grudgingly then lost the place spot in a tight photo. GARDEN
AFFAIR was in the four path through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the top ones after straightening in the lane then lacked a closing kick. TALE OF
MONA was in the three path through the turn and never was a threat. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA vied for the lead early while along the inside then was done
nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
RIVER ECHO (GB) was unhurried early while racing in the pocket down the backstretch, came off the inside in mid-turn, guided to the three path in late
turn, bid three wide near the quarter pole, gained the lead when straightening in the lane, quickly cleared and widened through the lane while under minimal
urging. PEGASUS ON THE GO chased the pace from the two path into the backstretch, vied two wide into the far turn, led in mid-turn, was quickly
overtaken in late turn, kept on into the lane and regained the place spot while never a threat to the winner. QUICKSILVER stalked the pace from the three
path into the far turn, bid three wide in mid-turn, gained the lead in late turn which was short-lived as the winner rolled up, could not go with that one and lost
the place spot inside the sixteenth pole. DARREN'S FORTUNE was near the rail through the turns and lacked a closing response. HERE'S CARLOS was in
the two path through the turns and tired. AQUADINI was never a factor while near the rail through the turns. ONLYATTHESHOE vied for the lead along the
inside into the far turn then was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole. Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DAZZLING TRUTHS tracked the pacesetters while along the inside into the far turn, continued to edge up through the turn, bid into the lane from the three
path, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, cleared then was all out to last. APPLICATOR was unhurried while moving through the three path, came into
the lane from the four path and was closing in late to just miss. LOGICAL MYTH was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from along the
rail, shifted into the two or three path for the drive and moved up while not a serious threat. MARV'S MAGIC was in the two path through the turns, angled
into mid-track for the drive and moved up while not a menace. HARD TO BE GOOD set the pace into the lane then gave way near the three-sixteenths pole.
TAKE CHARGE D'ORO was never a serious factor while in the three path. UNTRACEABLE chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid
two wide into the lane to appear to be a serious threat then shortened stride and was done outside the eighth pole. TIZ OUR TURN chased the pace from
the two path into the far turn and was done near mid-turn. Race was hand timed

Footnotes
MANEUVERED was bumped at the start, settled off the pace while off the inside, advanced from the four path through the far turn, bid four wide into the
lane, caught the leader near the eighth pole and edged clear late. HOPPED UP bore out at the start, was unhurried while near the inside through the turn,
bid two wide into the lane, led briefly straightening in the lane then could not hold the winner safe. ABE set the pace along the inside through the far turn
then gave way when headed into the lane. MICHAELS TARNATION chased the pace from the three path through the turn then weakened after turning into
the lane. SUNDAY DRIVE was never a factor while in the three path through the turns. DON'T MATTER was cut off and checked sharply at the start, raced
well back while near the inside and never was a factor. DABITONME chased the pacesetter into the far turn, bid for the top spot and was empty into the
lane. BROTHER DOC chased the pace from the two path into the far turn and was done in mid-turn. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE
RACE RESULTED IN THE DISQUALIFICATION OF #2 HOPPED UP FROM SECOND TO SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START AND SHUTTING
OFF #3 DON'T MATTER.

gained the place late. COLDWATER pressed in the two path and was no match late. COLOR ME PRETTY stalked in the three path, then faded in the

Footnotes
SERENA BECK was off awkwardly, pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the quarter pole and held sway under steady urging. HAWAIIAN
MEMORIES raced in the four path, rallied at the three-eighths pole but couldn't close late on the winner. SAVEDBESTFORLAST bore out at the start,
stalked the pace in the four path, then faded. ELUSIVE JUSTICE stalked in the two path but gave way in the stretch. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU was impeded
at the start, then improved position late. AT FIRST BLUSH led inside to the stretch. C J'S EMPIRE stalked between foes for a half mile and then gave way.
WISHED was not a factor. IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN stalked between foes for a half mile before fading. Race was hand timed.
