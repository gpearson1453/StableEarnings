REAL GRACE had outside speed under pressure, opened short clear lead after half, increased margin late final turn, drew out. GAMBLER stalked forced
pace off rail, pressed outside into final turn, came up second best. BARE BACK JACK stalked forced pace inside, came out in mid stretch forcing RAIL
HUGGER to steady, rallied evenly for the show. RAIL HUGGER checked at the break, stalked from back and off the rail, was rallying mildly trying to come
between horses in mid stretch, steadied, finished evenly. ROBBI'S RIVER RUN stalked wide, well placed outside final turn, tired stretch. YOUNGBOY
forced pace inside, gave way after half, remained well placed inside final turn, faded stretch. BRING HOME STANLEY broke slow, showed little. CASH OR
CARD pressed outside early, remained well placed outside to final turn, faded. The rider aboard RAIL HUGGER lodged a claim of foul against the rider of
