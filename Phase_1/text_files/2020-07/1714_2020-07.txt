Footnotes
ZEN BABY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, maintained her advantage in the run to the final turn, opened a
clear lead entering the turn, and was all out to hold off a determined HONKY TONK WOMAN to prevail. HONKY TONK WOMAN settled off the early pace
while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced smartly three wide midway down the backside, rallied smartly three wide entering the
final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in deep stretch to just miss. PEPPERMINT stalked the leaders while racing three out from the rail entering
the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed two out from the rail in the drive to get up for a share. SPROG away well and tracked the
leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in
the drive. SHRUGS LOVE stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final
turn, and finished four out from the rail in the stretch drive. I GOT VISION lagged well back early while saving ground at the rail, rallied four wide through the
final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive. RUGGED BEAUTY settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. LOUGH FOYLE LADY unhurried early while dropping back
to trail, was always well back and never a factor. STAY COOL away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail into
the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but failed to make her presence felt. MIA BELIZE tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch, but
began to weaken approaching the final turn.

finished two out from the rail in the drive to be up in time. THE VALENTINE KID away well, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two out
from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to just miss. ATOMIC HAZE broke
sharply and tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly
one out from the rail in the drive. TARGETED away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run
down the backstretch, battled for the lead from just off the rail entering the final turn, but was outfinished late. WE GOT IT COVERED broke inwards and
was bumped soon after the start, was forced to take up entering the first turn when put in tight quarters at the rail, settled off the early pace in the run down
the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, steadied sharply entering the lane, and was unable to overcome the troubled trip while
finishing three wide in the drive. ALWAY'S A KNIGHT settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, advanced from along the inside midway

WARRIOR'S PROMISE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, launched her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, split rivals two wide in mid
stretch and closed with a rush to be up in time. CHA CHING settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch,
rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed steadily four wide in the drive to just miss. BUTTERSCOTCH BLEND away well and stalked the dueling
leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and finished willingly two out from the rail in the drive. DANCIN
SHOES tracked the leaders from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed from along the inside in the
drive but needed more. MISS PROSPECTOR broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the
outside of FLORAL in the run to the final turn, assumed command entering the turn, but faded in the late going. SANGRIA settled off the early pace while
racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive while unable to mount a
late bid. TUI settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious impact.
FLORAL away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch, struggled to match strides with MISS PROSPECTOR entering the final turn, and tired over the final furlong.

Footnotes
FOURTOWIN away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backstretch, assumed command entering the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. BAMBOO ELEVEN hopped slightly at the start, but
recovered quickly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed three
wide from between rivals in mid stretch to get up for the place. GIFTED GREY away well and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground
along the inside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn while lacking room, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for a
share. SATURNA settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide through the final turn, to loom
a danger entering the lane, and finished four wide in the drive. BLONDIE tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied
three wide through the final turn, but was outfinished late while finishing one out from the rail. ESSI ROSE was off a step slow, and settled well off the early
pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied five wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest four out from the
rail in the drive. RAINE OR SHINE settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but needed more late. SUNRONITA unhurried early and dropped back to trail, raced five wide into the final turn, but failed to make a serious impact.
PARIANNE broke sharply and dueled for the lead in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, was unable to match strides with the
winner entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. ASPIRED stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
continued with a wide trip throughout, and faded in the late going.
