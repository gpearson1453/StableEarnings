Footnotes
ULTIMATE BADGER tracked the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid three wide in the stretch, coasted past in the leaders and was
ridden out to the wire. MR SIPPI chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but was no match for the winner in the
late stages. THROWN FOR A LOUPE set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run. FAST BOB chased the pace early,
was bumped and bothered entering the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. COOL RAGS was a bit slow from the gate, chased the pace early,
darted out under left handed urging and bumped foe into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. VIOLENZA D'ORO was never a threat. WICK broke
awkwardly and was no factor. TRAPICHE was through after a half.
