Footnotes
DISC ONE FOR PETE away in good order, took control inside, shook off a rival turning for home, drew clear, kept to task. NINE SHOTS broke alertly,
pressed the winner from the outside, closer in the turn, could not match strides in the drive, clearly second best. DR. GELP forwardly placed while behind
the top two, moved out three wide in the turn, proved no match for that pair in the drive, clear of the others. RONNIE'S REASONING lacked early foot while
outside, came four wide out of the turn, improved position down the middle of the strip while not posing a serious threat. MORO PHAROAH raced in mid
pack toward but not on the inside, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly. PENNIES LIL MAN in the second flight early, steadily weakened to have
nothing for the drive. MR. FIERY FLASH broke in, was never a threat. MR. E EDWARDS off a bit slow, in tight just after the start, stumbled, unseated rider.

Footnotes
QUIKFAST N AHURRY allowed the leaders to go early while outside, raced in the second flight and three wide, set down when straightened for home,
found best stride inside the furlong grounds to be surging clear at the end. SABER CUT off a step slow, trailed early as a result, came widest for the drive,
rallied down the middle of the track to finish up willingly and be in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. SCHIFF'S CORNER dueled up front
off the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, clear past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner the final sixteenth, could not
contain the runner up in the waning strides, well clear of the others. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS closest to the dueling leaders early, fell back in the turn along
the inside and failed to menace in the drive. SHESTHECATSMEOW broke forwardly, dueled up front closest to the inside for a half, gave way in the drive.
FILM STUDY was finished early and trailed home.

Footnotes
TODAYISNOTTHEDAY in the main group early while racing in the three path, advanced in the turn to be closest to the leader turning for home, collared that
rival from the outside past the furlong marker, drove clear. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER lacked early foot, came four wide out of the turn, rallied willingly to earn
the place while no match for the winner. BLONDIE LOX BABE void of early foot, in some traffic early in the turn, moved out to be four wide turning for home,
also staged a rally well wide to be in time for the show. RED RED WINE asked early, dueled up front off the inside, shook clear late in the turn, offered little
resistance to the winner when confronted in mid stretch, faltered to lose a couple more positions late. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE remained back in lacking a
closing response. ITSNOTMYJOB called on for some run in the early going, dueled up front inside, gave way in the drive. JAMMINFORMEL in the second
flight early along the inside.

runner up safely at bay in the run to the wire while under steady handling. BUCKETS chased the winner along the inside, continued to save ground turn,
closest to that rival past the furlong marker but could little the final sixteenth, clear for the place. LANGS DAY raced back the pace outside, came four wide
into the stretch, lacked the needed bid to contend with the top two. PICKETT in the second flight while off the inside, gradually weakened in the stretch to be
outkicked for the show. THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
OXBOW PIONEER in the second flight toward the inside, in some traffic early in the turn, steered out a bit, between foes into the stretch, moved out further,
roused, accelerated while lugging in, continued to lug in while moving very smartly a sixteenth out, was straightened a bit was up in time. HEZA WAY
MAKER broke alertly, dueled early off the inside, shook clear turning for home, could not contain the winner late, clearly second best. MIZSPELT bit
reluctant to load, broke well to race forwardly outside, bid turn, veered in midstretch, finished up evenly, well clear of the others. MAIL MAN JOHNNY one
paced early off the inside, was four wide out of the turn, angled in steadily through the lane while going evenly to lack a late punch. DARK MATTER went
one paced throughout while racing outside. VALENZANO failed to menace. HESACALENDARBOY last away, was continuing to race back when bothered
and carried out in to the turn, passed a couple of tiring rivals late after the issue had been decided. HOG WILD dueled up front early along the inside, gave
way before three furlongs. HOLDEN PASS void of speed, got out into the turn, remained back in having nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
CLEAR THE NILE in the second flight while in the two path up the backstretch, moved a bit closer in the turn, switched out when straightened for home,
closed with good resolve to be up in time. JAIL HOUSE pressed early outside, vied four wide into the turn, continued to contest the issue while three wide
into the stretch, showed the way past the furlong marker but could not contain the winner late, remained clear for the place. CLEVER RACER away in good
order, chased the leader out of the chute, moved up to vie outside that rival and between rivals before a quarter, could not keep up with the runner up out of
the turn while proving no match for the winner, comfortably saved the show. PROPER CROSS last away, raced back toward the inside, continued to save
some ground turn, steered out a bit when improving inside of several rivals into the stretch, continued to better himself a bit the final furlong without posing a
serious threat. CLASSIC HEATH void of speed, raced five wide through much of the turn, not dangerous in the drive in passing a couple of faltering rivals.
PRIME HOOK also lacked any early speed, floated out six wide into the lane, remained back while out in the middle of the strip to the wire. DOUG'S BUG
broke sharp to be clear up front out of the chute, attempted to rate while behind joined by three rivals up the backstretch, pressed the issue along the rail
through the turn then gave way in the drive. SIX GRAND moved up to vie the opening quarter, gave way from between horses late in the turn, stopped in
the drive, eased to lose contact with the field and jogged in.

Footnotes
MISS UNDERRATED broke with the leaders, settled off the pace outside, came three wide when with the second flight into the lane, kicked down the clear
leader the final furlong to be in time. BIRDCATMOUSE last away, lacked early foot, came four wide out of the turn when beginning to advance, finished
willingly to be clear for the place and to be slowly carving into the winner's advantage late. MRS. DELLA sprinted clear after breaking in good order, opened
a sizable advantage through the turn, offered little resistance to the top two when they challenged late, remained well clear of the others. NIN TO WIN in the
second flight in lacking speed, improved position slightly in the drive without posing a serious threat. QUICK HEAT chased the leader for a half in the two
path, steadily retreated after a half. RACELYNN in mid pack off the inside, five wide exiting the turn, tired in the drive. CAMP HALO in the second group
inside, continued to chase while saving ground through the turn, gave way in the drive. OLD TIME GIRL trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
LONE STAR DIVA outrun for five furlongs, began to move midway final, turn, knifed out four wide turning for home, set down, finished with good resolve to
be up in time. BLESSED ANNA prompted the early pace while in some traffic, remained closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch and into the final
turn, put a head in front inside the furlong grounds but could not contain the winner late. SWEET AMELIA in mid pack while in some traffic early in the first
turn, moved closer turning for home, lacked a further response while saving the show. DISTRACTOR FACTOR broke alertly, vied early, got clear onto the
backstretch, continued to show the way through the final turn and upper stretch, faltered when headed by the winner with less than a furlong remaining.
GUILTY LADY in mid pack while racing in the two path, improved when advancing upper stretch then flattened out in the late going. MISTY DAY forwardly
placed for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. EZEE ENOUGH raced back, in some traffic in the far turn, came up empty when clear for the drive.
MARAMA four wide when forwardly placed through the first turn, continued outside when within striking distance middle half, four wide again in the second
turn when beginning to tire, continued to fade stretch. R T'S DUCHESS settled off the pace, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MAGIC VOW broke well, vied up front into the first turn, dueled in the run up the backstretch, put that rival away far turn, turned back a second rival turning
for home, drove clear late. SHIP STALKER within striking distance behind the dueling leaders while saving ground, inched closer late in the final turn,
proved no match for the winner in the drive, duel for the place, game for that position, no match for winner. POPS LEGACY away in good order, raced in the
second flight outside, closer to briefly challenge the winner turning for home, duel for the place, outfinished. BOSTON BOB back off the pace while saving
ground, continued inside and advanced to within striking distance when straightened for home, hung in the final furlong. FANCY THIS away in good order,
alternated up front outside the winner for five furlongs, weakened in the far turn, got out a bit into the stretch and continued to tire. RANDY PAUL void of
speed, improved slightly while never a threat. BEN'S MAGIC STONE within striking distance early, was finished after four furlongs. FOOLISH PRINCE void
of speed, never menaced. TRAPPER PEAK raced five wide through the first turn, settled off the pace in mid pack, four wide second turn, gave way in the
drive.
