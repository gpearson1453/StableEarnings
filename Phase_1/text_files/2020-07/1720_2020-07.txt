DANTU stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the five path giving up the advantage, dug in
determinedly and got back up in time. LEOPOLDO away alertly, set a pressured pace for six furlongs, was headed by the winner, fought back with grit to
regain command before the furlong marker, battled to the wire and just missed hanging on. GARDEN QUALITY was bumped at the start, trailed, offered a
mild bid into the stretch then leveled off. FAST FAIRY broke outward bumping a rival, was well positioned then failed to respond. CLASSY NEKIA pressed
the pace two wide into the second turn then gave way in the stretch. QUICK COWBOY was no factor.

in front, set the pace into the stretch, edged clear in the two path then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. HOMERS MAGIC steadied while in tight
along the inside near the five furlong marker then closed determinedly in the six path through the stretch. ATTUCK unhurried early, finished with good
energy along the rail. MINE'S DIALED IN prompted the pace two wide into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. GOD'S WILL BE DONE outrun early,
