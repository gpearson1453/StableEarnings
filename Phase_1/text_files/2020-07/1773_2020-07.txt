KISSOFFIRE (IRE) gained mid pack early, closed angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, took command upper stretch and drew off under a
drive. THANKS AGAIN, in range along the rail, was hustled two-wide late turn, rallied gamely and was up for place. THEREALQUAFF led quickly, set the
pace, quickened on the turn, was passed upper stretch and chased to the end. LAUDERDALE raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the
turn but never reached contention. STREET CAT SAM stalked the pace, pressed the leader briefly, chased two to four-wide on the turn then flattened out in
the stretch. HYTHE settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide through the turn but had no response in the stretch. HOLYSNAPENEYEBALLS

BAY OF RUM was close early from the outside, was under strong restraint late backstretch, came four-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and got up late
under a drive. ELUSIVE RO dueled early then forced the pace, had command at the top of the stretch and drove clear but failed to contain the winner in the
late stages. R U WATCHINGBUD raced from off the pace, came four and five-wide through the turn then rallied willingly outside. SLIP KID broke a step
slowly, moved up quickly and dueled, stalked the pace on the turn, was pinched back upper stretch then came on gamely. CRAWL FROM THE BAR was off
slowly and settled in hand in mid pack, was roused at the top of the stretch then finished gamely along the rail. WEEKEND WIZARD showed brief speed
then forced the issue three and four-wide on the turn, chased hard into the stretch but failed with a bid upper stretch and gave way. FOREST BROTHER
raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. SPANISH RIVER dueled, led briefly early turn, saved ground but
yielded at the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
HANIEL raced in mid pack early, stalked from the rail on the turn, led upper stretch and drove clear then finished under a hand ride. LOVE DADDY was at
the rear of the pack in the early going, closed three and four-wide on the turn, launched an all out rally in the stretch and edged ALICE'S WAR for the place
position. ALICE'S WAR stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. CRUMLIN QUEEN stalked early in
hand, forced the pace late turn, gained a slight lead at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the drive. SPIDER DANCE settled in mid pack early, came
two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but offered no closing response. STORMY SUMMER led quickly, set a reserved pace, was pressured on
the turn, dueled into the stretch and tired.
