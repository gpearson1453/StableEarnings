OAKLIE GAL tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening stages, steadily advanced on those foes shifting four wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. WEE MS. BURNZIE was urged to terms with the first flight pressing the pace
three deep through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward midstretch but was collared late. LUCKY MAC, urged between foes pressing the pace from
the outset to upper stretch, weakened in late stages. WILD DESIRE, urged along the rail disputing the pace racing into the turn, lost some ground to the
leaders entering the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. DAVIDSDERBYDAYGIRL tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the turn but failed to
menace. SHOT OF WINE soon dropped out.

Footnotes
PLATINUM NIGHTS broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, edged forward to a narrow advantage between foes racing
through the turn and shook clear into the lane while being kept to firm encouragement. GUSKA MON SHOES angled to the inside disputing the pace inside
the eventual winner, couldn't match that rival nearing upper stretch but continued with a grudging effort to regain second in late stages. EPIC DRAMA,
forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, shifted out three wide on the turn while being urged in pursuit of the winner while briefly gaining
second but faded in late stages. MASTERFUL STRIDE, off a bit slowly, settled off the second flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and improved
position inside foes late. BLUE ECLIPSE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out nearing upper lane but had no closing bid.
BIG SPORT hopped at the start while breaking slowly, was steadied sharply when losing his path after the opening furlong and failed to menace thereafter.
GAME DAY DECISION angled in sharply crossing a rival's path in early stages while racing briefly on terms with a rival in second flight but gave way
nearing the lane.

YEAH YEAH stalked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, waited momentarily when caught in close quarters nearing the far turn, shifted
out racing past the three furlong marker to bid for command between foes, wrested the advantage while angling inside racing into the stretch and edged
clear under firm encouragement. SIDE STREET DAVE tracked off the first flight from just out of striking distance in the opening half, split foes nearing the
far turn to challenge three deep on the second bend, couldn't gain even terms with the winner but proved best of the others. CHARLIES A CHARMER
settled last to the backstretch, angled out racing into the lane and edged a rival for a share late. TENACIOUS MOON, urged to the lead along the inside, set
the pace to the far turn and gave way once headed by the winner. JERF, forwardly placed outside the pacesetter, was prompted to lodge a brief bid nearing
the far turn, was pulled up entering the second bend and was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
LUCKY LORRETTA was rated outside the first flight from just out of striking distance racing to the turn, made steady progress to split foes three wide into
upper stretch, went clear between calls late and just held COLLEGE QUEEN under firm handling. The latter, off awkwardly, was settled last along the
inside, swung out five wide racing into the lane and was going well late to gain terms with the winner nearing the wire. LIL B QUICK, forwardly placed
outside foes racing just off the first flight, was urged to advance four wide racing into the lane but flattened out midstretch. SASSY SETA, urged between
foes disputing the pace, pressed the issue outside a rival on the turn, shifted out entering the lane and gave way midstretch when failing to contain the
winner. SAYGOODNIGHTGRACIE tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and came up empty entering the stretch.
OPPENHEIMER flashed brief pace between foes but gave way early. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the
turn, gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
SKIPPY'S STRIKE broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the far turn and held sway to the end under firm handling.
ANTARCTIC, reserved off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, gained position along the rail racing into upper stretch, shifted in racing past
the chute while moving to challenge inside the leader, but altered course when lacking a path in late stages while prevailing for the place honors.
EXPROMPT (FR), off a step slowly, pulled his way inside foes to track just off the leaders as part of the second flight, was prompted to advance while
switching outside the leader racing into the lane but lacked the needed final kick. IRISH MAJOR, reserved off the second flight outside a rival to the
backstretch, was urged to advance nearing upper stretch while exchanging some contact with MR. SHOOK then angled inwards to split foes in the closing
stages to gain some position. MINNESOTA MIRACLE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled inside nearing the lane, shifted out three
wide in upper stretch and had no final response. MR. SHOOK tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight, shifted out while exchanging
bumps nearing upper stretch, then angled four wide entering the lane and had no further response. TENSPEED, caught four wide racing as part of the
second flight racing through the firs turn, was urged to a forward placing prompting the leaders three deep to the second bend but soon gave way.
MASKED, urged to terms prompting the pacesetter from the outset into the backstretch, gave way into the lane and was taken up out of close quarters
entering the lane. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF ANTARCTIC LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
FABLES LOVE AFFAIR tracked off the second flight in early stages, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch gathering momentum and produced a stout
rally to wrest the advantage in time under strong handling. PEARLE DE VEENE was hustled to the lead from between foes, angled to the inside dueling for
command inside a rival into upper stretch, contested the issue grudgingly to late stages but couldn't contain the winner. COCO LOCO MAMA tracked off the
second flight along the inside racing to the turn, swung out five wide entering the lane and continued willingly. XYLINA'S ART exchanged bumps at the start,
was hustled four deep in the opening stages to gain terms with a rival on the pace, forced the issue outside that foe through the turn to upper stretch but
faltered late. DUSTY PRINCESS, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, settled into stride near the inside, gathered momentum while angling out
entering the lane and made some belated progress. DIAMOND DIVA exchanged bumps at the start, was settled outside foes racing to the turn and gained
some position late while making no real impression. ALOTTA SOUL, urged inside rivals tracking the leaders in second flight, gave way into the stretch.
BUTTERCUP UP shifted inwards while being urged in pursuit of the leaders three wide into the turn, gave way entering the lane. SWEET SASSAFRASSY,
urged between foes pursuing the leaders as part of the second flight, gave way early. TAKE ALETTER MARIA exchanged bumps at the start and dropped
out early.

Footnotes
HOTFOOT, unhurried in the opening stages tracking the pacesetter outside foes, made steady progress three wide racing into the lane and wrested the
advantage in the closing stages under firm handling. GREAT BLAKE was settled along the rail racing to the turn, switched out entering the lane, angled four
wide leaving midstretch and just edged a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. SAVED BY ZERO tracked the pacesetter between foes leading the
second flight on a narrow margin into the turn, moved to challenge for command racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. SAMURAI MIKE angled to
the inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, switched outside foes racing through the lane but made no impression. POWER CRY sprinted
clear of the field while angling to the inside in early stages, held sway to upper stretch and abruptly gave out. JUST BLAZE settled last in early stages and
failed to menace.
