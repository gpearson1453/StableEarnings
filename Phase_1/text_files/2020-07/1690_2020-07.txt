Footnotes
KILO BRAVO after an awkward break quickly re gathered and saved the rail to open a good lead took a breather on the turn then drew away again in the
stretch to win handily. WHERE'S FREDDIE chased from the outset got even with the winner between calls but could not go with that one through the
stretch. ROUSING RUBBLE raced along the inside came through on the rail in the stretch with a mild bid. WILDCATINJEANS raced along the inside and
could not make up the needed ground. GRIGSTON made a sweeping six wide move on the turn to get into contention but then faded in the stretch. EZ
QUEEN raced in the three path on the turn and could not make up ground. EVERYDAYISAGOODDAY was fractious in the gates before the start raced
along the inside and could not make up ground. ITS YOUR THING raced four wide on the turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
SON OF ELEANOR raced along the inside just behind the pacesetter while saving the rail took the lead at the top of the stretch and slowly edged clear for
the win. COUNT N GOLD showed the best early speed but never came to the inside and raced in the two path the entire race held gamely when challenged
but could not match strides with the winner. WILLIAM CROTTY chased the pacesetters three wide on the turn but could never go by the top pair while
clearly third best. GOOCH EXPRESS raced in the two path off the pace and never mounted a rally. WAY OUT WEST raced along the rail but could not
make up ground. HESABULLY also raced along the inside and never mounted a rally. MINER'S NOTION was always well back and lugged out entering the
stretch.
