Footnotes
BLAME THE BOOZE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from KING OF MIAMI to the outside, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in under a drive under threat, rebuffed
that challenge to edge away through the final sixteenth to the finish. KING OF MIAMI prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside four to five paths off
the rail before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive
latched on to the eighth pole before being steadily repelled to the finish while well clear of the rest and along second best. PITAMAN brushed at the start by
TAKECAREYALLCHICKN, who broke inwards, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.
CENTAVO chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired. TAKECAREYALLCHICKN broke in at the start brushing with PITAMAN, chased five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung six
wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BITUMEN bumped at the start, went on to press the issue two to three wide, firmly rated for the opening half, struck the front as the second fraction was
being rattled off, came under a ride spinning into the lane, took charge during the ensuing furlong, then kept going well under good handling. FIELD OF
COURAGE underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, swung out five wide for the stretch run, stayed on with some willingness in the last eighth to secure
second. BUSINESS CYCLE guided over to the rail prior to leaving the backstretch, was patiently keeping watch on the front runners, got ridden towards
path six during the initial portion of the stretch, came home with good energy to be along for the show. THOUSAND PERCENT three wide onto the turn,
exited it from path four, lacked the necessary stretch response. DIRECT ORDER sighted along the rail on the turn, angled three wide into the lane to no
avail. OUTRAGEOUS BET cut over sharply into the two path coming up to the half mile pole, raced towards the rear of the field, got steered farther and
farther to the outside once in the stretch until approximately seven wide, had no offering. VICAR'S LEGEND took up the chase from the two path on the
turn, went five wide into the lane and backed away. FOX RED assumed a forward position after making some contact with the top one in the shadow of the
starting gate, was at a slight distance from off the inside disputing the pace against that foe, saw BITUMEN take over as the half was being completed,
stayed into contention for the next furlong before giving out.

HEIRLOOM KITTEN brushed the near side stall under coaxing from the gate, raced forwardly placed two to three wide early on before taking command with
five and a half furlongs remaining, showed the way through the turn just off the inside coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung two to three
wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. BUONA FINA showed the way early on five paths off the inside, got displaced from the front five
and a half furlongs from home, chased three to four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went four wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while holding safe for the place honors. ROAD HOME eight to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four to
five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors.
LITTLE MAZZY three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and tired. FULFILL six to seven paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide five furlongs from home, continued four wide through the turn placed to coaxing midway, angled five
wide for home and tired. TIPAZO chased five to six wide throughout under coaxing from three furlongs out and tired. SEEDISKID chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
MALIBU MISCHIEF overpowered CAMORRA for the top approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, tucked into the two path, sailed along on a
loosely-contested lead during the run around the bend, went into the three path getting roused into the lane, kicked away to its largest advantage during the
ensuing furlong, stayed on in the last stages to remain sufficiently in the clear. MALARKEY chased the winner from the three path on the turn, got set down
at the five-sixteenths marker, swung one path farther off the rail into the stretch, made some headway in the last sixteenth nailing down second. MISS JAK
underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, got sent out into the six path rallying for the show. CAMORRA hustled from the gate, proved no match for the top
one for the front end, rode the rail for the opening half, cut the corner under a drive, tired. COLD HEARTED PEARL travelled four wide on the turn, got
shifted out into the six path from upper to midlane, made no impact. COTTON CANDY CUTIE strung out three to four wide on the turn, was through after
going a half. MY LAST MILLION raced three wide on the turn, angled five to six wide into midlane, had no offering. ZECHA cut over to the inside coming up
to the end of the backstretch, was never in it. STARLITE MISSION sighted two wide on the turn, failed to menace. FIRST FOREVER parked four wide on
the turn, wandered out seven to eight down the lane in retreat.

Footnotes
BOSSY BRIDE five wide in pursuit, advanced at the nine-sixteenths to apply pressure to the leader through the turn, got floated out by that rival to her inside
seven wide into upper stretch, took narrow command at the three-sixteenths, dug in dueling to the sixteenth marker before edging away in the late stages.
FIRST DAWN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home, kicked on belatedly to secure the place
honors. OVERHEATED established the front and showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside, came under pressure through the turn and was
placed to coaxing just past the three-eighths, drifted six wide into upper stretch carrying BOSSY BRIDE seven wide, dug in dueling through to the sixteenth
pole before being shaken off in the late going. HAPPYCREST four to five wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. STERLING BEAUTY chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. WILD NORTH chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went three wide for home, folded and was eased through to the finish.

JEWEL OF ARABIA sparred for command towards the two path, began to drift out entering the stretch, got switched over to stronger handling at the
three-sixteenths pole, drew off despite continuing head for the middle of the strip.. BLITCHTON LADY departed the backstretch from the two path, was on
the move to the outside for the drive, wound up five wide by midstretch, rallied for the place. BELLA DOMENICA saved ground, stepped into the lane and
launched a rail for the show. VIVAZANO bumped with BONUS BABY after bobbling at the start, travelled two wide on turn, shifted out about six wide early in
the stretch, flattened out. VOICE OF SPRING three wide at the half mile pole, had no rally. LOVE THAT FACE along the inside, made no bids. MASTEROF
THE TUNES at or near the two path in pursuit of the front runners, was urged three wide into the stretch, came up empty. BONUS BABY bumped at the
start, was three wide onto the turn, plodded along much wider down the stretch in retreat, then was pulled up quickly. STEAL MY HEART two to three wide
on the turn, failed to contend. ROBIN SPARKLES along the inside, contended for the top matched up with the winner to the quarter pole, faded down the
stretch then was pulled up quickly.

BRASS RING established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path, widened away through the turn, got let out swinging five wide for
home, went clear under a light drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to the finish. GRACETOWN broke in at the start bumping OK HONEY,
chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals
to secure the place honors in the final jumps. SPRING DRAMA five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into
upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. GENTLE ANNIE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for
home, improved position for the last major share. MAKIN' OUT got brushed at the start when OK HONEY was bumped by the breaking inwards
GRACETOWN, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, angled three to four wide for home and
weakened. TIZ A KITTEN coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch

Footnotes
WINSTON'S CHANCE off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch towards the four path, vied as the middle member of three front runners for the
top, got roused while under siege by the second place finisher entering the stretch, desperately clung to the advantage, saw the second place finisher
become a bit wayward between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, trudged on home to stay in the clear. OUR LAST BUCK away without apparent
mishap, moved up as the half was being completed, was in the five path contending as the widest of three on the turn, got turned loose taking aim on the
top one, was staved off during the next furlong, raced a bit erratically from midlane to the sixteenth marker, ventured onward and failed. BLUGRASCAT'S
SMILE took up the chase from the two path on the turn, was about as wide stepping into the stretch, proved no match securing the show. DOUPS POINT
travelled three wide on the turn, got sent out into the seven path from upper to midstretch, had no closing punch. TWISTED TOM sluggish early, took the
inside route, abandoned it to elude a spent foe as three-quarters pole, never made its presence felt. BIG MOUNTAIN established the top shortly after the
start, entered the turn from the three path, kept a pair of opponents at bay almost to the quarter pole, spun into the stretch and backed away. NOT THAT
BRADY underwent a two wide pursuit, was coming to a half coming up to the five-sixteenths marker, swung into the lane placed to a protective hold and
allowed to stop to a walk.

LIAM'S PRIDE four then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the top pair through the latter portion of the turn,
swung five wide into upper stretch, got brushed by LONG WEEKEND near the three-sixteenths due to pressure from WONDRWHERECRAIGIS who came
out, dug in under a drive latched on those rivals to the outside through to the finish getting bumped lightly a furlong out and near the sixteenth pole keeping
a straight course in his lane and was just up in the last jumps to prevail. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS coaxed from the gate, dueled two to three wide with
LONG WEEKEND to his outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, came out near the three-sixteenths
bumping LONG WEEKEND into LIAM'S PRIDE, dug in and came out again bumping that rival a furlong out and was corrected with an off sided stick,
fended off the pair coming out near the sixteenth pole and bumping LONG WEEKEND once more into LIAM'S PRIDE, then came out in the final strides
forcing that rival to be steadied at the finish between rivals when nailed on the wire. LONG WEEKEND coaxed from the start, dueled three to four wide with
the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide now between rivals as LIAM'S PRIDE advanced outside,
dug in head to head and was bumped by WONDRWHERECRAIGIS, at the three-sixteenths and in turn brushed LIAM'S PRIDE, dug in between foes and
was bumped at the eighth pole as that same rival came out again, fought on through to the finish getting bumped a third time near the sixteenth pole, then
got forced to steady when squeezed between rivals at the finish as WONDRWHERECRAIGIS drifted out once more. HOPEFUL TREASURE chased five to
six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. NEWSTOME inside shortly after the
start, tipped out to chase three then four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
LISTENTOYOURHEART chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the top three finishers. After review, it was
deemed that WONDRWHERECRAIGIS had interfered with LONG WEEKEND through the stretch and WONDRWHERECRAIGIS was disqualified from
second and placed third prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
FUSI attained a prominent position after making solid contact with BIG RED GIRL at the start, contended for the top four wide on the turn, settled onto the
head of the stretch and was fed her cue, dug in with good determination to preserve the advantage before edging away in the last seventy yards. SHE SO
NAUGHTY took up position in the two path, vied with the winner heads apart, got committed to a drive first, this occurring as the half was being completed,
became unhitched well inside the sixteenth pole, saved second. VINDA MACHINE a pace contender in between opponents early, was allowed to drop back,
sat reserved keeping watch on the top twosome from path two during the run around the bend, tipped out three wide entering the lane, took hold and altered
course into the six path at the furlong grounds, closed in, lost the photo for the place. ADORABLE MAYA crept up three wide on the turn well held, fanned
out into path five early in the stretch, made no headway in the final furlong. TINY MAGOO squeezed in the shadow of the starting gate, was three wide onto
the turn and ridden four wide exiting it, mustered up a mild response. BIG RED GIRL guided over to the rail after bumping with the winner, cut the corner
under a drive, wandered out approximately in the stretch failing to fire appreciably. MIND OF GOLD briefly spotted on the rail while racing on the
backstretch, appeared to get out into path four from the top of the turn to its midway point, was moved out seven wide from upper to midstretch, launched no
bids. WALL EYE along the inside route for the opening half, was hand urged three wide into the stretch, gave way.
