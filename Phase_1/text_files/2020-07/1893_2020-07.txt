Footnotes
TOLD IT ALL stumbled leaving the gate, set the pace, was pressured through the backstretch and engaged at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch, drew
clear a furlong out and held under a drive. NATIVE PRINCE settled in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns, angled out with a furlong to run and closed with
a rush and just missed. GIANT CRITIC, off slowly, forced the early pace, stalked on the first turn, closed up and put pressure on the leader through the
backstretch, challenged at the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch but yielded a furlong out, gave chased but evened out late. ICE BLUE was bumped at the
start then pinched back, raced from off the pace, closed two-wide then moved to the fence on the far and rallied gamely inside. SAN NICOLA BREW broke
outward and bumped TOLD IT ALL, settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, was steadied behind a rival at the top of the stretch then
rallied belatedly. FRAC ATTACK broke inward, stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn then finished evenly.

Footnotes
MISTER OAKLEY stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn, bid near the 1/4 pole but was headed at the top of the stretch, rebid a furlong
out and drove clear then held under a strong drive. BORN TO BE KING, in range, chased two to four-wide on the turn, rallied determinedly and just missed.
LORD OF LEGENDS set a reserved pace, quickened on the turn, turned back MISTER OAKLEY approaching the stretch, was rejoined with a furlong to run
and gave way grudgingly. CANADIAN SECRET bumped at the start, raced in striking range, was hustled from the rail on the turn then closed with some
interest. STORMY EGBERT, bumped at the start, stalked the pace, chased hard angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final
furlong. MAKE IT RAIN broke outward, settled well off the pace and was never in contention.

KID'S MISCHIEF forced the pace, bid midway through the backstretch, dueled, edged clear early turn then held sway under a drive. LAUDERDALE stalked
the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. BENS LAST CALL raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the far
turn but failed to menace in the stretch. MIRIAM'S SKY settled off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then finished
evenly. PRISON PADRE settled in mid pack, dropped back on the far turn then rallied through the stretch. CAPE NERO, rated off the pace, chased
three-wide on the far turn but was never contentious. SEEMEE, in range, chased four-wide on the turn then closed but did not threaten. THEREALQUAFF
pressed the pace the forced the issue into the far turn then backed away under a ride. ABSOLUTION was sent from the gate to the front, set a pressured
pace, dueled from the half but faded along the rail on the turn.

DEEP FREEZE broke outward and bumped KING AND HIS COURT, showed speed and set a pressured pace, was joined at the top of the stretch, drove
clear quickly then held under steady pressure. FLORIDA WON broke inward, stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, angled out and rallied
gamely. GORGEOUS KITTEN settled in mid pack, chased angling from two to four-wide on the far turn, then rallied determinedly outside. DOT'S VISION
forced the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, challenged at the top of the stretch but failed to sustain the bid. ROCKET PLAN raced in mid pack,
angled from the rail to three-wide late turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and finished gamely. KING AND HIS COURT, bumped at the start, settled off the
pace, rode the rail throughout and tendered a mild close. BEN LOMOND stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn, ran into traffic mid stretch and
evened out. FOUR KNIGHTS broke slowly, settled in mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn but lacked a response in the stretch.

CASH DIVIDEND, at the back of the pack in the early going, closed two and three-wide on the turn, took command a furlong out and widened under a hand
ride. ELEKTRONIC, in range, was hustled along the rail through the turn, ran into traffic and altered course upper stretch then rallied gamely. NEVAEH'S
DREAM forced the pace, pressed the leader on the turn, chased into the stretch then evened out in the final 16th. SILENCE BREAKERS set a pressured
pace, shook clear early turn, was passed upper stretch and gave way. MY SILENCER broke outward, stalked the pace, dropped back four-wide
approaching the turn, was hustled along but did not menace. THE BOSS FACTOR pressed the pace briefly, was hustled three-wide on the turn then tired at
the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC SLEW pressed the pace, came two-wide through the turn, launched a determined drive, gained steadily and was up just in time. FRONT NINE
led quickly, set a pressured pace but was caught near the wire. STATION ROCK settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn, was under a strong
drive and was gaining steadily. LOKINFORPURSEMONEE lost his path just out of the gate, settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn then
rallied gamely. FINE GRIT broke outward then settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn then chased through the stretch. PHIL IN THE BLANK hopped at
the outset, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. CORDERO (IRE) stalked the pace, was hustled three and
four-wide on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong.
