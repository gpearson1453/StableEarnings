Footnotes
CAPTAIN TYREE settled off the pace and the inside, shortened stride abruptly and fell with a half mile remaining while in distress, vanned off. HUNTERS
APPEAL outrun early, began a steady advanced into contention three wide far turn, took over into the lane, drew steadily clear while being kept to pressure.
DON'T SPLIT TENS chased the leader just off the inside, advanced and challenged between rivals and inside the winner turning for home, proved no match
for the winner in the drive, clearly second best. FOOLISH PRINCE void of speed, four wide turning for home, went evenly through the lane to pose no threat
to the top pair. UNCLE NEARIS away in good order, cleared to the inside past the wire the first time, continued to show the way up the backstretch, gave
way when confronted by the top two exiting the final turn.

Footnotes
FAMILIAR RHYTHM broke out and a bit tardy, continued to trail early, moved closer four wide through the turn, wider in the drive, gained the advantage just
inside the furlong marker while continuing well wide, increased advantage under steady handling. CHIEF ENVOY broke on top, dueled up front closest to
the inside, garnered a larger advantage over the other speed when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, held sway for
the place. CAJUN CARMELIZED away in good order, dueled up front outside the runner up, also proved no match for the winner late, outkicked for the
place spot. JALEN HURTS in the second flight while off the inside, slightly closer three wide through the turn, continued one paced through the stretch in
lacking a late punch. SR. CLARKY also in the second group, lacked clear room when boxed in through much of the turn, came up empty when clear for the
drive. SO SORRY RUSTON finished early, trailed home.

STONE DREAMER away in good order, cleared to the inside, shrugged off a rival turning for home, drifted out slightly, drew off through the lane under
steady handling. PALACE WIND broke out, was straightened, raced three wide through the turn, lugged slightly upper stretch, staged a mild rally to earn the
place while not a threat to the winner. D'FESTIVE CAT broke back, fell back off the winner and the other speed into the turn, went evenly in the drive,
outfinished for the place. GOOD TIMES ROLLIN broke back, raced four wide throughout in lacking a serious closing response. MR. CURLIN broke back off
the leaders, was used to move up outside the winner to duel with that one through the turn, had little left for the drive. RUN AWAY SON broke back, failed to
menace. JUSTIN'SMEMORIES a bit reluctant to load, bothered at the start to be last away, trailed throughout, well beaten.

HERO OF GOLD broke alertly, allowed the pace to go early, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, quickly drove well clear. BIND ME UP fell
back off the pace and the inside, moved closer four wide exiting the turn, had little for the winner the final furlong, edged clear for the place. RATTLESNAKE
SHOW with the leaders out of the chute, dueled in the two path through the turn, also proved no match for the victress in the drive, could not contain the
runner up, saved the show. RUNNING ROSADO last to leave, lacked early foot, in some traffic midway on the turn, came three wide into the lane, improved
position a bit while not a serious threat. KOHENSRISING flashed some early foot while closest to the inside of the first flight, began to fade after a half.
SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK broke back, failed to menace. SPLASHDOWN vied in the run up the backstretch between horses, dueled through the turn,
stopped in midstretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
FAST DUDE with the pace from the start, vied up front three wide, continued to vie on the outside in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, put a head
in front turning for home, long drive, held the runner up at bay while fully extended late. MYTHAJACUL also a pace factor from the break, vied inside, raced
on equal terms with the winner out of the final turn and gave ground grudgingly to that rival in the run to the wire. FLASHLIGHTSECURITY closest to the
first flight while saving ground, crept slightly closer while continuing inside entering the stretch, proved no match for the top pair in the drive, comfortably
clear of the others. MESSED UP went one paced throughout while racing off the inside, lacked closing kick. LIGHTNING LEE lacked early foot, improved
position a bit through the final turn, failed to sustain that modest advance in the stretch. ATTEMPTED SIN void of speed for six furlongs, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. GALLOPING BOOTS settled in in mid pack, had nothing for the drive. TOO TUFF TO CRY with the pace
between the top two for six furlongs, gave way in the drive. TENSAS GOLD four wide through the first turn, stopped after a half, jogged in while far back.

Footnotes
THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER forwardly placed from the outside exiting the chute, prompted the issue into the turn while four wide, continued in the four path
through the bend, challenged into the stretch, slight drift, held the runner up safe late under brisk handling. PRE HEAT last to leave, raced back early, bit
closer in some traffic through the turn, continued behind rivals late in the bend, clear for the drive, closer nearing the furlong marker, little late gain.
BROADWAY JONES moved up steadily in the early going to become a forward factor, vied through the turn and upper stretch, could not keep up the final
furlong with the winner nor contain the runner up, comfortably saved the show. BUY IN used early to also move up and become a forward factor by late on
the backstretch, contested the issue three wide early in the turn, fell back a bit late in the bend, moved out to be four wide into the stretch and went evenly to
the wire. SEELEY cleared out of the chute, showed the way up the backstetch toward but not on the inside, continued to vie through the turn and upper
stretch, faltered the final furlong. TOO MUCH BOURBON broke on top, pressed the early pace inside, shuffled back with a half mile remaining and then
went evenly the rest of the way. G CISIVE broke back, trialed and was never a threat.

Footnotes
LONE STAR DIVA broke out to bother REASON TO WALTZ, lacked early foot, closer in some traffic second turn, angled out to be five wide into the lane,
challenged while widest past the furlong marker, drove strongly clear. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground into and
through the final turn, slipped through along the rail into the lane, shifted out a bit for room and finished willingly to earn the place, no threat to the winner.
LUCKY HARBORAGE forwardly placed on the outside from the outset, pressed in the run up the backstretch, moved to engage the leader and duel through
the final turn, showed the way into the lane, offered little resistance to the winner when that one challenged nearing the furlong marker, caught late for the
place. FLIRTYFLIRT forwardly placed early along the inside, second flight while continuing to save ground into the far turn, in some traffic late in that bend,
two path into the lane, went evenly to the wire when clear. ARCTIC GUITAR settled in mid pack early, fell back the middle half, came four wide into the lane,
improved position a bit while not a serious threat. MIZZEN MONARCH five wide into the first turn, continued to race outside, within striking distance into the
far turn, had little left for the drive. VITA back off the early pace, moved closer on the outside before a half, remained within striking distance through the final
turn then had little left for the stretch run. LABRUNA broke on top, clear into the first turn, continued to lead by daylight up the backstretch, dueled through
the final turn closest to the inside then gave way when the real running began entering the straight. PARTY WITH KASSIDY wide through both turns while
back off the pace, failed to rally. REASON TO WALTZ bothered at the start, fell well back and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
OIL MONEY took control just after the start, set all the pace in the two path, clear when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire while being
kept to task. SPEEDY FELLAR broke alertly, fell back off the issue while still forwardly placed, stalked three wide into the turn, could do little with the winner
through the stretch, edging away late for the place. WILD BERT void of speed, came four wide out of the turn, outkicked to the wire for the place, clear of
the others. FLASHY BREW broke with the leaders, fell back off the pace, fell further back midway on the turn, asked along late in the bend, split foes
nearing the furlong marker to improved slightly, no real threat. WIN LION WIN chased the winner for three furlongs and had little left for the stretch run.
IMMA BLING off the pace, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SILENT TRICK in the second flight up the backstretch outside, confidently handled when moving closer late in the turn, asked along into the lane while four
wide, angled in to engage the leader upper stretch, strongly clear, kept to task. GABY VEE void of speed, continued back while off the inside turn, roused
four wide into the lane, staged a late rally to be going away for the place, not a threat to the winner. MISSGREELEY'SSONG also lacked any early speed,
angled out to be five wide into the lane, mild late interest midtrack to be along for the show. CABO SUNSET in the second flight while toward the inside, in
some traffic late in the bend, came up empty when clear for the drive. TENACIOUS FAITH within striking distance while closest to the first flight, angled out
and took over four wide into the lane, led between calls upper stretch, faltered the final furlong to lose a few positions. SUNDIAL STAR dwelt at the start to
spot the field several lengths, continued well back turn, swung out to be six wide into the lane, improved a bit down the center of the strip. GALAXY STAR
set or forced the pace four a half while between rivals and gave way. CONSPICUOUS LINE with the pace while three wide for four furlongs, also backed up
through the stretch. ZUMBERTA vied up front closest to the inside for a half and then stopped in the drive.
