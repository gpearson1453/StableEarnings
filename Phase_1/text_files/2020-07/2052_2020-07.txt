Footnotes
COACH MACHEN broke well pressing outside of foe early edging clear on the turn widening in the two path upper stretch barely holding on at the wire.
UNBRIDLEDSELECTION pressed early then chased on the turn ceding a clear lead to rival in upper stretch angling out to the four path giving a late surge
to just miss. STRONG HEART tracked evenly through the turn angling to mid track in upper stretch looming late needing more. UNCLE EUGE went evenly
through the turn racing inside to upper stretch lacking surge in the two path holding the others well safe. BOOK ON ME varied little in mid pack playing no
factor. NORTHERN RIDGE slow early was never involved racing nine wide down the lane. TWO GOLD SPOTS was always a step slow. JOVIAL JOHN
showed little. THATS AMAZING chased early then faded on the turn.
