Footnotes
DISCERNMENT chased the pace from the three path through the turn, moved to the pacesetter in late turn, gained the lead once straightened then drew
away while being kept to the task until late. MAJESTIC BLEND was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and moved up for the place spot.
KINDA LUCKY was close early, steadied near the half-mile pole when intimidated along the rail, continued near the inside through the turn, could not gain
on the top one the just saved the show spot. TIPAZAR steadied behind a rival who checked, raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from
the five path and was never a serious threat. BELLEINTHECITY was contending for the top positions early when having to check sharply near the half-mile
pole, dropped back into the turn and never contended thereafter. ESTARDO dropped in towards the rail when going for the lead, continued near the inside
through the turn and into the lane, was no match for the winner straightening in the lane then was done approaching the eighth pole. PLEXUS was in the
two or three path through the turn while trailing. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE NEAR THE HALF-MILE POLE RESULTED
IN NO CHANGE AS THE CONTRIBUTOR FINISHED BEHIND EFFECTED RIVALS. THE FIRST QUARTER FRACTION WAS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
JUNKET was in mid-pack when never far back, raced in the three path into the far turn, was asked for more after mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane,
edged to the front from the seven path just outside the eighth pole then widened to the wire. SAXON LORD set the pace from the two path through the far
turn, could not keep up with the winner then gamely held the place spot. DREAMMEISTER broke a bit outward, raced along the inside into the far turn,
asked for more in mid-turn, gained a short lead into the lane then could not keep up and lost the place spot late. SWITHERAL was steadied early and soon
after the start, raced off the inside into the far turn, moved through the four path into the lane and settled for the bottom piece of the super. POP LIFE was
near the rail through the turns and never was a threat. OFF SIXES was in the two path through the far turns and never was a factor. ON JOHN pressed the
pace from the three path into the far turn and was done approaching the quarter pole. DETERMINANT made little impact while along the inside.

Footnotes
CLEAR STEPS set the pace while in the two path through the turn, dropped into closer to the rail entering the lane then slowly widened the advantage to the
wire. LETTERED OLIVE tracked the winner along the inside through the turn, angled two wide into the lane while asking for more, could not gain on the top
one but kept on to be clear for the place spot. WILD TAPIT was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, dropped the rail entering the lane, gained
momentum and moved off the inside approaching the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. LONG MONDAY was along the inside through the turn
and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. GOD WINK chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and
weakened. MY GUATEMALAN GIRL was in the two path through the turn when behind mid-pack, angled into the five path entering the lane and lacked a
closing kick. SLEWPY'S HALO was never a factor while in the three or four path through the turn. DATA LADY was never a menace while traveling through
the three path through the turn. TIZ THIRSTY was in mid-pack while racing between rivals through the turn then tired through the lane. BRODY'S GIRL
trailed while in the three path through the turn and made little impact. MISS MAGDALENA stumbled at the start, raced well back while along the inside.
SHAKE IT OUT WEST chased the pace from the three path through the turn and steadily faded. THE FIRST QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO A
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS set the pace from the outset, raced near the inside while maintaining the clear advantage through the far turn, continued to save
ground into the lane and slowly widened to the wire. KANFU chased the winner from the outset while racing in the two path, was asked for more entering
the lane, drifted to the five path under a drive but could not offer any gain while saving the place spot. HAWAIIAN MEMORIES was in the two path through
the far turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and was gaining on the place rival to the end but was never a threat to the top one. AT FIRST
BLUSH was in the two path through the turn, moved up into the lane then lost the show spot late. SAVEDBESTFORLAST chased the pace from the three
path through the far turn then tired through the lane. IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN was near the back and in the two path, continued towards the back and did
not make headway. WISHED was in the three path into the far turn while in mid-pack then was done after passing the three-eighths pole. REAL BELLA
chased the pace along the inside into the far turn and was suddenly done in mid-turn.
