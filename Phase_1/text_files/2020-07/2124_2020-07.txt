Footnotes
IN HIM WITH HIM prompted the pace two wide, moved between rivals under a hustling ride and poled a head in front leaving the far turn, dueled to the
inside of TWIN VALOR while about three wide into the lane, spurted clear under strong handling three sixteenths out, kept on under a drive past the
sixteenth marker, switched to his left lead in the final jumps and narrowly prevailed. RIDGEMONT HIGH pulled her way forward to the inside of rivals in the
opening quarter mile, moved off the rail approaching mid turn, shifted five wide into the stretch, made a grinding run on her left lead and just missed. LUCID
DREAM settled off the pace, came under a ride around the turn, angled six wide and rallied mildly. TWIN VALOR tracked from the outside, bid three deep
after a half mile, dueled on near even terms past the quarter pole, could not kick on with the winner approaching mid stretch then faded late. QUIT YOUR
MOANIN broke a step slow, edged up four wide nearing the five eighths pole, was under coaxing past the three eighths, lugged in nearing the furlong
grounds and faded. BATTLE READY was sent up between rivals soon after the break and cleared, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on by a pair of
rivals nearing the far turn, ceded the lead soon after, stopped, was eased through the drive and was reported by the stewards to have bled.

Footnotes
SWEET TALKING GIRL lacked speed, circled the far turn four deep, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, closed outside horses and was up late.
BECKON gained the lead leaving the backstretch, was in the two path in upper stretch, impeded SOMEWHERE GOLDEN when drifting in near the eighth
pole and gave way grudgingly. GALE lacked speed, was well off the rail turning for home, angled to the six path in upper stretch and rallied. MONA LUNA ,
four wide the first turn, chased the pace three wide around the far turn, was well positioned in mid stretch and weakened late. ZOLA B , steadied when
shuffled back entering the first turn, steadied in traffic mid way on the first turn, steadied lacking room leaving the backstretch, was taken outside in mid
stretch and finished willingly. MOSALAH stalked the pace racing inside horses and failed to rally. PATRIOTIC PUNCH , three wide the first turn, chased the
pace to the eighth pole then gave way. SOMEWHERE GOLDEN was moving nicely along the inner rail in upper stretch then stumbled when clipping the
heels of BECKON approaching the eighth pole. HETTY LANGE was never a factor. EXTRAVAGANT MISS , angled to the inner rail after sprinting clear on
the first turn, showed speed to the far turn, tired and was checked near the three eighths ple. Following a stewards' inquiry, BECKON was disqualified and
placed eighth.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD HOOPLA prompted the pace two to three wide outside GLITTERING JUDY, moved alongside into the lane, gained a slim lead near the three
sixteenths, sparred outside FLYINGONTHEGROUND through the final furlong and stayed tenaciously under pressure to narrowly prove best.
FLYINGONTHEGROUND rated close up while saving ground, eased out for room in upper stretch, bid between rivals heading towards the eighth pole,
moved to slim lead while dueling inside the winner near the sixteenth marker, kept on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. BREAK CURFEW stalked
outside, was under pressure five wide in upper stretch and closed steadily. OLIVE KAT broke a step slow, was sent up soon after to reach a forward spot,
tapped the brakes briefly then dropped back some around the turn, came off the inside for the drive, edged up behind rivals in mid stretch, altered back in
and continued with interest. MIDSHIP LADY , off the pace about three wide, shifted out for the final furlong, switched over to correct lead inside the sixteenth
pole and rallied. MARKET MONEY was shuffled back some early on, angled out under heavy pressure in upper stretch, moved up a bit past mid stretch
then flattened out. GLITTERING JUDY broke on top despite a stumble, set the pace towards the inside, dueled to the inside of the winner in upper stretch,
failed to kick on nearing mid stretch then wilted. GLORIOUSLY , four to five wide, was not a factor.

Footnotes
ONE LAST TRIAL rated close up while towards the inside, angled out and was under pressure heading towards the lane, straightened away to be about
four wide, closed in steadily under left handed rousing, overtook the embattled leaders inside the sixteenth pole and went clear at the wire. QUIET
COMPANY cleared early and dropped in towards the rail, set soft fractions while being shadowed by WAITING FOR A STAR, got engaged in a duel while
the pace quickened leaving the far turn, maintained a short advantage past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. WAITING FOR A STAR tracked
the leader two wide, moved alongside around the far turn, battled head to head from the five sixteenths to mid stretch, kept on trying through the final
sixteenth and just missed second. IRONY OF REALITY was taken back off heels soon after the break then steadied back between foes near the five
eighths, angled out and was put to pressure leaving the five eighths, circled into the lane, drifted in from right handed rousing near the sixteenth pole and
brushed with LUNAR RILLE, straightened and finished with good energy. LUNAR RILLE stalked outside a rival, shifted out about four wide in upper stretch,,
was brushed near the sixteenth pole and came up empty. WHO U GONNA CALL , four wide the first turn, remained removed from the rail but lacked a bid.
JUMPSTARTMYHEART pulled her way forward while between rivals near the five eighths, was under pressure around the final turn but failed to respond.
SUNRISEBERNSTEINI secured the rail early on and was taken to rate, raced in range into the far turn, failed to kick on under coaxing past the five
sixteenths and faded.
