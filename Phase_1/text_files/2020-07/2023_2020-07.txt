Footnotes
EMPTY NESTR settled off the tearaway pacesetter outside, cruised up in the three path around the far turn, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole
and drew off under moderate urging. BAD SUENO saved ground nearest the pacesetter early, continued to save ground in midpack around the far turn,
tipped out in upper stretch and rallied for the place. BILETNIKOFF raced off the pace two and three wide and was along for the show. GIANT VIKING
sprinted clear soon after the start, flew through a second quarter to take a double-digit lead down the backstretch, held clear around the far turn and wilted in
the lane. STUCCO played no factor while racing two wide. CSABAWABA was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
KEVIN WITTE settled off the pace toward the inside, advanced two wide around the far turn, angled out leaving the eighth pole, closed outside and was up
on the wire. BELMULLET stalked the pace four wide, lugged in near the eighth pole, drew clear leaving that marker, lugged in again under right-handed
urging in deep stretch and led until the final stride. BATS CHANCE lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn and rallied for the show.
MAJESTIC JAZZ was bumped after the start, raced four and five wide in midpack and rallied belatedly. KATHAK set the pace along the rail, led to
midstretch and weakened. JOHN'S PROMISE was fractious in the gate, saved ground and never threatened. READY TO RUN stalked the pace two wide
and faded in the lane. WONDERMEISTER was outrun inside. MCCLURE was bumped after the start, prompted the pace three wide and tired in the lane.
HOSKINS was outrun inside.

SLEEP settled off the pace three wide, was briefly forced further out rounding the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, chased the winner three
wide around the far turn and rallied for the place. KELCIE'S MANDATE tracked the pace while saving ground, bid inside in upper stretch then flattened out
late. WEE ARCH saved ground to no avail. STARLET LADY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ACTION ABSOLUTE DS played no factor
while racing three wide. HARDY JOJO chased the pace two wide and tired. NIGHT BLOOM was outrun while racing three wide. BOHEMIAN DANCER
steadied at the start, saved ground and made little impact. TOURBILLON ROSE had early speed three wide and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
EVEN THUNDER set the pace in the three path, drew off under minor urging in upper stretch and held well clear despite being taken firmly in hand through
the final sixteenth. LINDA'S NEKIA settled off the pace inside, raced three wide between foes around the far turn, never threatened the winner but won a
long duel for the place. CREDIT CYCLE chased the pace two and three wide, lacked a rally and lost the place duel. CORT'N ASONG stalked the pace four
wide and was no match for the winner. MIAMI TIGER failed to menace while racing two wide. HERO'S HOPE was outrun while racing two and three wide.
SO SUBLIME trailed.
