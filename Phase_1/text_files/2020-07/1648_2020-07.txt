Footnotes
VEGAS VIXEN sprinted clear, extended her advantage into the stretch and was all out late to prevail. LIL' FANCY chased while three wide, moved four wide
into the stretch and closed ground willingly. LITTLE SLEW outpaced while four wide, swung five wide into the stretch and finished well. ZANEY RIDE saved
ground, remained inside for the stretch run and lacked a rally. ALWAYS GRACE never menaced. MINGO MAGIC raced forwardly while four wide and
weakened. KELLY BE KRUSIN swerved in at the start and proved no factor. RED LINGERIE stalked the early pace, could not keep up and retreated.
SUPREME IRENE was always outrun.
