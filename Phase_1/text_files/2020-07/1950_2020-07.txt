WILLOUGHBY GAP well placed, responded readily when set down in the four path, made the lead in deep stretch and drew clear under left handed urging.
LUV LYES pressed the pace three wide into the turn, made the lead, dropped inside, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
GAGLIANO unhurried early, had a mild rally through the stretch in the three path. JUSTICEINACTION went evenly. CHOLMONDELEY pressed the pace
between horses two wide into the turn then weakened. MRS. ROBINSON failed to menace. MAGICAL JUSTICE was no factor. YACHT was outrun. JOT
made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside into the turn then stopped.

PROUD MAID MARIAN chased the pace two wide, swung wide entering the stretch, dug in determinedly under strong handling to make the lead in the nine
path past the furlong marker and proved best under a brisk hand ride. OUR PRINCESS BELLE stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally
between horses in the eight path and got up for second. VAPNYARKA made the lead soon after the start, set the pace while getting out until deep stretch,
drifted to the seven path and was outfinished. RAGS TO ROSES checked leaving the chute and had a mild later rally inside. VELVET SAMI failed to
menace. FACTUM'S REWARD well placed, had no rally. STURN DONNA was no factor. GRADY'S LADY had brief speed. JILLY FROM JERSEY had
speed near the inside into the turn then gave way. SEALED WITH A KISS was always outrun, eased to the wire and walked off.

SOUL OF DISCRETION broke in front, set all the pace unchallenged and maintained his advantage under right handed urging. EMPIREMEISTER trailed
inside into the turn, moved up along the rail, drifted to the three path entering the stretch, rallied late and got up for second. DAPPER JACK broke in a
tangle, was taken outside soon thereafter then had a mild late rally in the six path. CHESTER MON failed to menace. ADVENTUROUS FOX chased the
pace near the inside into the stretch, drifted to the four path then faded. DOUBLE TAKE chased the pace for a half then gave way.

Footnotes
LIME AND TEQUILA checked at the five eighths pole, shifted out to the four path, was always within striking distance, responded with a burst of speed three
wide inside the final furlong and was along in time. CAPT BILLY BUD never far back, circled rivals in the seven path through deep stretch and got up for
second. WINGS OF FREEDOM trailed into the stretch then closed a gap late in the four path. OSTEENS MESSAGE pressed the pace along the rail into the
turn, shifted outside the leader then was outfinished two wide. BRINGYOUROWNSAND broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch along the rail and
weakened only slightly.
