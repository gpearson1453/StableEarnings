Footnotes
GUN HILL was in the two or three path through the far turn, bid three wide into the lane, cleared before the eighth pole and slowly widened to the wire.
CLEARING WAIVERS vied for the lead while two wide into the far turn, continued between rivals into the lane, shook off the inside challenger when
straightening in the lane then was no match for the winner and kept on for the place spot. SUNSIGN vied for the lead while along the inside through the turn,
was with the top two into the lane then yielded to them near the three-sixteenths pole. B R COOPER was in the three path through the far turn and into the
lane and lacked a closing response. BOAT WAMPUM never a factor while in the three path through the turns. JULIANO was along the inside through the
turns and was empty into the lane. FHACO chased the pace along the inside into the far turn then was done.

Footnotes
WESTWOOD PROUD was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, caught the leader with minimal
encouragement then was hand urged to the end. BARRY LEE vied for the early lead three wide into the turn, cleared in late turn, was no match for the top
one but kept on to save the place spot. PRESIDENT ELECT was along the inside through the turn and into the lane, shifted off the rail inside the sixteenth
pole and moved up a couple of spots. TOUCHING RAINBOWS vied along the inside into the turn, chased the pace through late turn and into the lane and
weakened. STATESBORO was close up early while in the four path, continued in the four path through the turn and into the lane and tired. STEEL SHOT
pressed the pace from between rivals into the turn, settled back through the turn while in the two path then faded through the lane.

Footnotes
LADY LEAH vied for the lead two wide through the first turn, cleared into the backstretch, widened into the far turn, continued to maintain the advantage into
the lane then held. VIOLATION vied for the early lead while near the inside, chased the winner through the turns and into the lane and could not make up
ground while remaining clear for the place spot. LITTLE CODE trailed while in the two path through the far turn, angled into the five path for the drive and
gained belatedly for the minor share. MY WYNTER ROSE raced in the three to the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and
offered a mild gain. AIR TURBULENCE was in the two down the backstretch, came in nearing the three-eighths pole causing rival to check, raced in the
three path through the turn, was in good position into the lane then hung in the latter stages. BEHOLD raced in the four path through the far turn and into the
lane when never far back and failed to respond. TIZ TAKEN BACK chased the pace along the inside down the backstretch, was put in tight near the
three-eighths pole, clipped heels and checked sharply and dropped back. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING THE RUNNING ON THE FAR
TURN #5 AIR TURBULENCE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5TH AND PLACE 7TH FOR INTERFERENCE WITH #1 TIZ TAKEN BACK NEAR THE
THREE-EIGHTS POLE. RUNNING FRACTIONS, EXCLUDING THE FINAL TIME WERE EXCLUDED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
AIR WONDERFUL chased the pace from the three path, bid three wide near the quarter pole, gained the lead with minimum urging and was ridden out to
the end. GAMERA set the pace while racing in the two path, continued under some pressure from the inside, dueled briefly with the winner nearing the
quarter pole, was no match for the winner then kept on to be clear for the place spot. DARKNSTORMYTIME was unhurried while off the rail into the far turn,
moved from the two to the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and moved up for the show spot. BAHNKE chased then
pressed the pace while along the inside, continued as a serious contender into the lane then weakened. TUF INTENSITY was near the rail and never was a
factor. JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY was near the rail through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. MR. CREATIVE was off the rail through the far
turn and was empty nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MORNING SOCIAL tracked the pace along the inside into the turn, took aim on the leader coming into the lane then ran that one down in the final strides.
NASHVEGAS pressed the pace from along the inside down the backstretch, was asked for more nearing mid-turn, quickly cleared for the lead and extended
into the lane, widened straightening and opened a comfortable lead with an eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe while clearly 2nd best. COMES
N THREES was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, continued in the two path into the lane, split rivals near the eighth pole to get nearest the
top two and settled for the distant show. OXIDE was in the two path into the far turn when not far back then lacked a closing response. REAL OF IT raced in
the three path through the turns and weakened in the lane. CRUEL SUMMER was never a factor while in the three path through the turns. NOT VERY
GENTLE raced in the two path through the turns and was done approaching the quarter pole. CRYPTO set the pace into the backstretch and was done
entering the far turn.
