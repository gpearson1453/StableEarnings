became a bit edgy in the gate and was bumped at the start, quickly took the lead and moved to the inside to set the pace, raced clear past the five
sixteenths pole but was caught while flattening stride mid-stretch. IRMA GIRL was bumped inward and into What You Own leaving the gate then saved
ground and raced evenly down the lane. HATTA DOUBLE lacked speed early on but managed to close the gap through the lane. The stewards posted the
inquiry to review the start, prior to making this race official.
