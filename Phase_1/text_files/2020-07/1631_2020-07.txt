Footnotes
OUR EYES TOUCHED stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the final turn, rallied in the stretch and got up late, driving. OXESOME showed
speed, set a pressured pace, drove clear at the top of the stretch but failed to hold the winner safe. VINYASA forced the issue while two-wide, chased into
the stretch but evened out in the late stages. DONT GET SMART stalked the pace from the rail, chased late turn, finished all out along the wood but also
evened out in deep stretch. CLASSY VISION got away slowly and was rated well off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn
and finished gamely to no avail. PETITE AMIE, off slowly, settled in mid pack, was hustled along through the far turn but failed to menace.

Footnotes
LOKINFORPURSEMONEE, at the rear early, closed three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch, drove clear in the final furlong and was taken in hand.
AREOCENTRIC stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide late turn, chased into the stretch, bid quickly but was outkicked. CAT ZAPPER settled at the back
of the pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive but did not menace. MAJESTIC FEVER, also at the rear early, chased
hard three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely from the outside. BE THE CHANGE raced at the rear in the early going, angled from the rail to
three-wide on the turn, encountered traffic upper stretch and evened out. OPTIC was sent to the rail with a clear lead, set a reserved pace, was engaged
upper stretch and gave way after a brief battle. JUROJIN stalked the pace, dropped back along the rail through the turn and lacked a rally.

COURT RETURN broke a step slowly, moved up and stalked the pace, closed fast while three and four-wide on the turn, swept to the lead in the final
furlong, widened when asked then was taken in hand near the end. ATTENTIONSEEKER, bothered at the start, closed up and forced the pace, dueled late
backstretch and shook clear into the turn, set the pace but was passed moving into the final furlong and just held place. JOY'S SOLUTION, off slowly,
settled at the rear of the pack, was hustled on the turn, encountered traffic nearing the stretch then finished gamely. JLOHR JAN stalked the pace, was
hustled angling two to four-wide through the far turn and finished under a determined drive. BIG CHEEKS settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide
on the far turn but never reached contention. SAMANTHA'S JOY set a pressured pace, was engaged midway through the backstretch, dueled, was headed
near the far turn, chased, but tired with a furlong to run. NICALI'S DISCOVERY broke outward and settled at the rear, chased three-wide on the far turn,
appeared to take a bad step and was injured at the top of the stretch, lost her rider and was vanned off.

Footnotes
VICTORIAN MOON broke outward and settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn, swept to the lead in mid stretch and finished under a
hand ride. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA led into the turn, set a pressured pace from the rail, was passed mid stretch and chased to the wire. DARLIN FOREVER,
pinched back at the outset, raced in range, stalked three-wide on the turn, launched an all out drive but evened out in the late stages. MERINO WOOL,
away slowly, settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn then closed with some interest late. FLAT OUT FABULOUS showed brief speed,
was headed and stalked the new leader, was hustled three-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. MAHONE BAY held a short early lead but was
headed as she moved towards the turn then was pinched back along the rail, chased late turn but offered no closing response. I AM I SAID shied outward
leaving the gate, raced from off the pace, was steadied near the top of the stretch and flattened out. CICIBONNE pressed the pace, dropped back late turn
and faded in the stretch.

STATION ROCK, rated at the rear on the backstretch, closed three then two-wide on the turn, rallied smartly and was up late, driving. GASCONADE stalked
the pace, took command along the rail mid turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but failed to hold the winner safe in the final yards. RAPID BEAT
stumbled leaving the gate but showed speed, set a pressured pace, was headed mid turn, drifted out a bit approaching the top of the stretch then evened
out. ROYAL FUERST stalked the pace, came four and five-wide through the turn, lost ground at the top of the stretch but failed to menace. SANDRETTI
forced the pace to mid turn, dropped back and lacked a closing response. MEET CUTE settled off the pace, chased along the rail on the turn but lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
DOUBLE THE HEART raced in mid pack, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, swept to the lead mid stretch and
finished in hand. MR WILL bumped with CHAIRMAN FIFTYFIVE leaving the gate, forced the pace, chased two-wide on the turn, launched a full out stretch
drive but was outkicked. CANADIAN SECRET stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn, was steadied behind traffic mid stretch but got clear
late and was up in time for the show. JERSEY DIAMOND held a short early lead, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was passed
a 16th out. WESTERN SOCIETY stalked the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th.
CHAIRMAN FIFTYFIVE, bumped with MR WILL at the start then settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn but failed to threaten. UNCLE
HOWARD raced in mid pack, was hustled along three and four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. CRIMINAL MIND broke outward, veered in
shortly after straightening away, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but did not menace. JOIN THE CLUB, pinched back at the start, was herded
inward still in the early stages by CRIMINAL MIND, settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the turn then lacked a rally. FRACTION settled well
off the pace, was hustled three then two-wide on the turn but tired in the stretch.
