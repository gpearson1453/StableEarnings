Footnotes
BROADWAY BURN set all the pace while racing along the inside and built a long lead through the stretch under steady handling. FIERA PRADO tracked
the early leader while racing two wide down the backstretch, dug in late to hold the place position but was no match for the winner. FASHION ISLAND
stalked the pace, raced four wide through the stretch and had no late gain. GIO ANGEL stalked the pace, saved ground in the stretch and had no late
response. TRUE RUNNER stalked the pace, raced three deep in the drive and had not enough. SHAKE IT UP TRACY raced four wide around the first turn,
stalked the early pace, raced five wide just past the eighth pole and weakened late. VIV was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside around the far
turn into the stretch and never was a factor. SPECTACULAR TEMPER was unhurried early, raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
ORATORY GLORY dropped back early, raced five deep into the lane and never menaced. OUR LIZZY LOU settled off the early pace, raced four wide in
the drive and failed to have a response. NOTORIOUS GAL failed to menace.

VISUAL MAGIC pressed the pace, raced three wide through the stretch and finished well to prevail under all out pressure. WEEKEND FUN stalked the
pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. DREAM WALKING stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. SALACIOUSACUSATION stalked the pace, raced three wide through the lane and had no final winning bid. SCAT THRU TRAFFIC
stumbled at the break, raced three deep and never was a factor. GLORIOUS ROSE was allowed to settle early, raced five wide in the lane and never
threatened. NELLIE DEE saved ground and never was a factor. GWINNETT'S MAP set all the pace from the outside and tired readily.

Footnotes
BRAVE DAISEY pressed the early pace, gained command through the far turn, raced in the three path in the stretch and drove clear late under strong
urging. IMA DISCREET LADY was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the break, settled towards the rear in the early stages, moved up
three wide at the quarter pole, raced four wide at the eighth and couldn't match strides with the winner late. STORM TRAFFIC was slow early, raced four
wide into the upper stretch and made a mild late bid. LIGHT UP THE DEVIL stalked the pace while saving ground and had no respponse. EATON'S
MEMORY showed good speed along the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
SUNLIT SONG raced in tight quarters soon after the break, saved ground down the backstretch, angled three wide nearing the eighth pole and got up late
under strong handling. REDATORY showed good early speed, raced in the two path in the drive, dug in inside the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game
effort. MOOJAB JR was allowed to settled off the early going, made a good rail bid late. KENAI BOB tracked the leader while racing two wide down the
backstretch, raced in the four path through the stretch and weakened a bit late. RIGHT LANE LUKASZ was slow early, raced four wide into the upper
stretch and never was a factor. MUCHO DINERO settled off the early pace, saved ground and never threatened. BONJOUR BABY failed to sustain a bid.
