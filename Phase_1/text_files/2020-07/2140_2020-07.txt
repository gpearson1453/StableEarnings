Footnotes
QUEEN OF TOMORROW went right to the early lead, set the pace well off the rail, was asked for run turning for home and eagerly pulled away with
something in reserve. HYDRA came in leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and held
the place. LADY FOX , pinched back leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, angled in in upper stretch and finished willingly. CATCH
THE SKY bore out leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally. PLATINUM
PAYNTER bore out leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail while chasing the pace and gave way entering the stretch. WE ARE FAMILY bore out
leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
ABSALOM , a bit keen early, opened up a solid advantage past the five eighths, took to rating around the turn, turned away some threats while two wide into
the lane, kicked back away under solid handling in mid stretch then held firm. PARATYCACHACA settled off the early pace, advanced between rivals mid
turn, took closer order four wide nearing the lane and churned on to earn the place. MINE TO HOLD saved ground off the pace, edged up into the lane but
lacked a solid finish. I'VE GOTTA PLAN , in closest pursuit early, gained three wide and had aim past the three eighths, pursued past mid stretch then faded
late. MARYLAND BANDIT , five wide, made a mild run approaching the stretch, failed to sustain leaving the quarter pole, drifted and weakened. IRISH
CROSSING was outrun inside. SENOR SEVILLE , wide and well back, never made an impact.

Footnotes
BEACON OF TRUTH bobbled slightly at the break, quickly recovered and tracked the leader, bid to engage near the quarter pole, took over soon into the
lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch and proved best while kept to task. ESPRESSOANDACHECK broke a step slow, was hustled up between
rivals soon after, edged closer to the inside of a foel mid turn, angled three wide, gave willing but futile chase and was second best. INCONTROVERTIBLE
dropped well off the early pace, gathered some steam three wide into the lane, split horses in mid stretch and kept on with interest. TRELLIS sped clear
early, set the pace towards the rail, could not fend off the winner entering the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way. YOU'RE DOING FINE
bore in at the break, hustled up soon after, chased towards the rail and faded around the turn. A P GEM , four wide with hard pursuit mid turn, failed to go on
leaving the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL ZIP , quickly to the front, set the pace towards the inside, moved clear past the five sixteenths, drifted out a bit entering the lane, was
corrected with left handed rousing, turned away VICTORY GIVEN past mid stretch and widened under a drive. VICTORY GIVEN , off slow when having his
head turned slightly as the gates sprung, corrected and advanced towards the inside to gain a stalking spot, angled out in upper stretch and gave willing
chase to the end. COOKE BROTHERS , four to five wide, made a mild run nearing the lane, shifted in near mid stretch, failed to seriously kick on but did
manage to gain the show between runners. COOL MAN CLETUS had speed and prompted the pace outside the winner, saw that one get away entering the
stretch, drifted out some and gave way. JERICHO MARSH leaned in at the break and was soundly bumped, straightened and settled off the pace, moved
up a bit between runners near the quarter pole but needed more in the final eighth. GIRLS LOVE ME came out at the break and bumped with a rival,
corrected and was sent up towards contention, chased three wide and faded. MR. CHESAPEAKECITY , bumped from both sides and pinched back at the
break, failed to recover. CASPER SLEW came in at the break and bumped with a couple runners, was taken to rate, saved ground and gave way. An
objection by the rider of MR. CHESAPEAKECITY against JERICHO MARSH for alleged interference leaving the gate was not allowed

ARTFUL SPLATTER relaxed outside the leader while about three wide, moved to engage leaving the far turn, cruised clear with three eighths remaining,
responded when set down near the three sixteenths, opened up to a large advantage and was kept alert to deep stretch. MONEY FROMHEAVEN chased
outside a rival mid turn, angled four wide into the lane, kept on with effort and was second best. MATTY'S MAGNUM saved ground off the pace, angled five
wide for the drive but lacked a response. BUFF'S IN LOVE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, could not resist the winner heading to the three
eighths and faltered.

PARDON THE PUN broke running, set a rated pace, responded when shoved on three wide into the lane, opened up a commanding lead in mid stretch and
proved much the best while geared down in the final yards. SECURITY BREACH settled off the rail, advanced to the inside of a rival mid turn, angled five
wide into the lane, gave hard chase from there and was clearly second best. AUCHINCRUIVE , off the pace while saving some ground, angled three wide
approaching the lane, advanced between runners in mid stretch and churned on to get the show. TRUE SHIPMAN stalked three pace three wide and faded.
SWEET ASTA , with the early pace well off the rail, pursued six wide into the lane and gave way. RECKLESS LIFE , between foes early, was under
pressure past the half mile marker, shifted in and gave way. THAI ONE ON failed to menace. MY MOONSHINE broke a step slow, raced wide past the five
eighths and dropped back. PER RULING #20-114 FROM THE MARYLAND STATE RACING COMISSION PARDON THE PUN WAS DQD DUE TO A

Footnotes
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA settled off the pace about four wide, commenced a run leaving the three eighths, shifted out very wide for the drive, leveled off
under left handed rousing in mid stretch and forged ahead in the final yards. SUSIKIN sped to the early lead then was joined from her inside by COURTESY
SHUFFLE, kicked clear of that one past the five sixteenths, opened up past the three sixteenths, wandered outward in the final furlong then just failed in a
game effort. WICKED T broke slowly, lagged well back while saving ground, got through along the rail near mid stretch and finished well to be gaining.
DETERMINED MISSION rated early, moved up between rivals mid turn, angled four wide but came up empty. HAND RAIL saved ground pursuing, eased
out in the drive but lacked a solid finish. COURTESY SHUFFLE was sent up to the inside of SUSIKIN, sparred with that one past the three eighths, altered
out into the lane, came back some in mid stretch, drifted and flattened out. KEENEASABEAN , off the pace, angled out near mid stretch and had some
belated action. VAUNT chased the dueling leaders three wide and weakened. JAH GRACE broke slowly, raced three wide into the lane but failed to
threaten. FANCY OUTFLANKER flashed speed, pursued off the inside to mid turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
GIFTED HEART had speed three wide then was taken to rate and stalk the leader, bid three deep near the quarter pole, seized command outside rivals
leaving the three sixteenths, could not shake clear of BUNTING to her inside but held that one safe under a drive. BUNTING prompted two to three wide,
was under a ride past the five sixteenths, challenged between runners entering the lane then fought gamely inside the winner through the final furlong.
MAYBE AN OMEN broke awkwardly and to the inside, raced between rivals nearing the half mile marker, came three wide for the drive and kept on with
effort to gain the show. MARGIE'S HEAVEN sped clear early and set the pace towards the rail, was collared nearing the quarter pole then faded in the last
eighth. ELEGANT GAL , four to five wide, made a mild run nearing the lane then flattened out. GLORIA'S GAL dropped back into the turn and raced wide.
DANCE OR STROLL saved ground without making an impact.

SAILINGINTOTHEWIND broke alertly and dictated the pace, moved away a bit nearing the lane, responded when set down three wide in upper stretch and
steadily widened while kept to task. CANDY FLOWER prompted the pace outside the winner, was under pressure four wide into the lane, continued with
effort but was second best. BEGONIA drifted out a bit at the break then steadied briefly, regrouped and moved up towards the inside, came under pressure
around the turn, saw the leaders get away approaching the stretch, angled out and gave way.
