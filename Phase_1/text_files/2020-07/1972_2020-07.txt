Footnotes
SECRET PARANOIA broke sharply to press the pace of EMMA'S A BEAST while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, vied and edged away through the closing yards. EMMA'S A BEAST was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail,
responded when challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that foe and gave way grudgingly in the drive. WAVERLY WAY was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. LUCILLE was off a step slow, raced five-wide through
the turn and finished evenly late. INVITE ME lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. STORMY MIST showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
WEST COAST INDY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch, reached the fore
with a furlong to run and drew off as a handy winner. EDDIE AND THE KING broke sharply to dispute the pace with DOCTOR BRUCE S. while racing
three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. IF YOU WANT IT raced four-wide through the first turn,
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. DOCTOR BRUCE S. was away in good order to duel for the lead
with EDDIE AND THE KING from off the rail and gave way through the final furlong. HOTNTHIRSTY was forwardly placed from the inside and lacked the
needed rally. STAY IN POWER showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. RACING RAY settled off the
pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CODY'S CHOICE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole, drifted out slightly
in the drive and held safely to the wire. ITS ALLABOUT JERRY raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch
and again nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy to gain the place. MEGATRON RULER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
turn and finished with a steady bid. HARNERSBACH was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response.
GUARDINGTHEMONEY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GENERAL MACH FOUR settled off the leaders
early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. REDROCK TRAIL pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a quarter.

Footnotes
THE METAL MAN set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was ridden out to the wire.
HAVEULOSTYOURMIND lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a late bid. URBAN
SPLENDOR was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good courage. DERBY DREAMING
was fractious while loading then bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and failed to gain
late. MAJESTIC CAFE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. STANLEY'S WAVE was forwardly placed
early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. FIREBALL RED was bumped at the break then raced just off the leaders from between
foes, angled out sharply into the stretch and weakened. DROPYOURBUFFS was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and
weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
AZADI broke inward, dueled for the lead from the inside with LOBANESS, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin into the stretch and
drew off as a handy winner. TIZ BRILLIANT settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. LOBANESS broke
in, disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide, drifted out approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. MOLAF broke inward, raced just
off the leaders early, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. MAE BELLE PASSE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not
menace. SILVER ATTACHE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. RI' PIN SNAP was forwardly placed
early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. COLEINATOR showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
HURRICANE FORCE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and drew clear.
DUSTIN'S PASSION was never far back while racing along the inside, angled out into the stretch, gained a brief lead in mid-stretch but could not match
strides with the winner late. DALLON'S GOLD was away in good order to duel for the early advantage from the inside and gave way through the final
sixteenth. TRUST N LIBERTY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. KALAKALA was void of early speed, raced
off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. LUCK LASTS lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. CATS GULCH
pressed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. EMPIRE RULER lagged early, raced four-wide through
the turn and did not offer a bid. MANY MOODS broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide, was pulled up after going three furlongs and
vanned off.

Footnotes
SOMETHIN'BOUT IRIS was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by DANCIN IN PARADISE nearing
the quarter, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive and proved best. DANCIN IN PARADISE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up
four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the winner and just missed through a vigorous drive. O'S SO SERIOUS was off slow, raced unhurried
early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with good late energy. FORTUNE IN SILK settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly. MY SECSEA SENORITA showed no early speed, saved
ground into the lane and showed some late interest. SIGRID'S GOLD pressed the pace while racing five-wide for a half and weakened. LINCHPINS JEWEL
lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, checked from between foes nearing the quarter and did not menace. WHATA FLIRT bobbled at
the start, raced off the pacesetters and gradually weakened. DAZZLING DEBBI settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened. JADEY AT THE BAR hopped at the start, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, did not offer a bid and was eased through
the lane. SMARTY JEANS broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, weakened after the opening quarter and was eased
through the lane.

with a belated bid. OLD SCHOOL IKE sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CLOCKER'S CHOICE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter, wore down ON YOUR TOES in the
closing yards to be going away late. ON YOUR TOES was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin into the
stretch but could not resist the winner late. DRAGON LADY raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached a striking position
but finished evenly late. TIPPYTAP ON SAND disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. SAN JUAN STORM was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SHOE PHONE raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in
nearing the quarter and did not menace. TRICKEY DAHLING lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and
did not offer a bid. PLATINUM PEACH vied for the lead while racing three-wide, weakened after the opening quarter and was eased through the lane.
PULPIT LINE was off slow and veered in and lagged far back throughout.
