Footnotes
CALL ON CLARA was unhurried after a slow break, began a run two wide between rivals into the far turn, angled to the rail entering the stretch, took over
before a mile and drove clear. BETTY'S GOT RYTHM wasn't far back two wide between rivals, moved to a clear lead early on the turn, ran out into the
stretch, began to drift into the final furlong and continued to get out to the end. AMPLIO ESQUEMA wasn't far back two wide to the stretch, angled out
through the final furlong, bumped SOLO TRY approaching the wide and bobbled. SOLO TRY was slow early, angled out through the lane, was bumped
soundly and bobbled approaching the wire. An objection by Wolfsont against the third finisher was not allowed. ECLIPTICALS DANCER improved position
three wide into the far turn, raced wide into the stretch and stopped. GIULIA AMMANNATI chased the early leader into the far turn from along the rail and
was finished after three-quarters. RACING MY FATHER made the pace two wide for about five furlongs, stopped suddenly, was eased up through the lane
then was vanned off lame after the finish.

Footnotes
BENEVOLENT PRINCE advanced the three path around the turn, closed outside through the lane and wore down KONKIE in the final yards. KONKIE took
command at once, stayed out from the inside while making the way into deep stretch but couldn't last. SEISMIC JOLT pressed inside the early leader to the
turn, fell back and continued evenly. CHITOWN raced the four path around the turn then made up ground late between horses. DROSSELMOON lagged
early, swung out leaving the turn and finished with good energy. HARPER P M was no factor. GET THE POINT was close up between horses into the turn
then stopped. SOCAROO fell far back.
