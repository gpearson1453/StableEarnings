Footnotes
GRAY GARY settled off the runaway pacesetter in the clear three wide, ranged up to take the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole while racing in about the
four path, lost the lead upper stretch, dueled outside through the lane at a slight disadvantage for much of the journey and prevailed late in a game effort.
YONDERING settled off the pace along the inside, made progress down the backstretch, went two wide around the far turn, split rivals near the quarter
pole, took the lead in upper stretch, dueled inside of the winner through the stretch, leading most of the way and was outfinished late. GRAND OASIS raced
off the pace three wide, moved into contention down the backstretch, chased three wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. YEI YEI sprinted clear soon
after the start, set the pace in the two path and tired nearing the lane. HUNT ME DOWN hopped at the start, raced two and three wide and never
threatened. NEAT STREET trailed well off the rail.

midstretch, rallied inside and was up on the wire. LOOKS GOOD dueled three wide between rivals, put away the pace competition near the sixteenth pole
and led until the final stride. DRIVEN BY THUNDER vied two wide between rivals past midstretch but was outfinished. TISDALE raced three wide and never
threatened. C C'S WARRIOR dueled along the rail and weakened in the lane. EQUUS NOVUS pressed the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane.

HIPNOTIZADA set the pace two wide, shrugged off a bid from the runner-up near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under left-handed urging. LOVELY
DEE stalked the pace three wide, bid midway around the turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be a clear second. MALIBU BEAUTY had
early speed inside of the winner, chased two wide around the turn and lacked a rally. HONOR YOUR MOTHER saved ground and failed to menace. MY
EXPENSIVE GIFT played no factor while racing two wide. LADY LYNNE was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BLUES MARY dueled inside of BIG AFFAIR while racing in the two path, drew clear in midstretch, ducked out under left-handed nearing the sixteenth pole,
steadied to straighten out and held firm under continued left-handed pressure. BIG AFFAIR was bumped at the start, dueled outside of the winner in the
three path and was clearly second best in the lane. PASSION'S IMAGE stalked the pace two wide, tipped further out in upper stretch and finished evenly to
gain the show. ITSAKEYPER stalked the pace three wide and was one-paced in the lane. THEDEVILMADEMEDOIT never threatened while racing two
wide. LE PETITE PAPILLON played no factor while racing three wide. WINNING TOUGH saved ground and failed to menace. TOOGOODOO was bumped
at the start, raced two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CANDY broke slowly, advanced inside around the turn, rallied along the rail, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and just lasted for a share of the
win. TUDOX EXPECTATIONS lacked early speed, raced four wide around most of the turn, came five wide into the lane, closed down the center of the
track and was up for a share of the win on the wire. PERFECT COVER sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth
pole and held well for the show. CHARGE TO VICTORY stalked the pace three wide between rivals and was one-paced in the lane. SHANE'S JEWEL
chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. STAR FITZSTALL was outrun inside.

SMART WARRIOR dueled three wide between rivals down the backstretch and around the turn, was headed by UNCONQUERED SPIRIT nearing the
eighth pole, dueled outside of that foe through the final furlong and won the head bob. UNCONQUERED SPIRIT stalked the pace from the rail, came
through inside in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, dueled inside of the winner through the lane, led until the final stride and lost the bob.
TIGER KINGDOM pressed the pace four wide, was no match for the top two in the lane but held for the show. WINSTON'S WAY raced two wide in midpack
and had a mild rally. DUCK DUCKY GOOSE dueled inside of the winner in the two path and weakened in the drive. FAVOR MAKER never threatened while
racing two wide. VERN H was rank at the start, checked back to a clear last, went five wide around the turn and improved position. WOODHAVEN KID was
shut off at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. TARGET ROCK played no factor while racing three wide. LAMBANO was bumped at the start
and had brief speed three wide. CURRY'S MOUNTAIN veered in at the start, bumping LAMBANO and shutting off WOODHAVEN KID, raced four wide and
played no further factor. STYLEMEISTER was outrun inside.

Footnotes
MR. HAND FULL stalked the pace three wide, seized command nearing the lane, drifted in and out in the lane and held well clear under a hand urging.
MAMAIGOTTHIS was bumped at the start, caught five wide into the first turn, angled into the three path soon after, advanced between foes down the
backstretch and still three wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to be clearly second best. GOOFY BOY was crowded
at the start, was in range between foes, steadied off heels midway around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and was along for the show.
GOTTAWAY raced in range between foes and came up empty. ORBIDORE set the pace in the two path and tired in the lane. SERGEANT AZER was
outrun outside. DAVID'S PROSPEC was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. OLD FORT was outrun inside. DISTORED HALF had
early speed inside and was through after a half.
