Footnotes
PUMPKIN STAR settled off the pace while racing three wide around the first turn, bid four wide into the far turn, reached near even terms leaving the quarter
pole, battled outside a stubborn pacesetter, put a head in front near the sixteenth pole and prevailed under a drive. CORT'N ASONG set the pace in the two
path, dug in inside of the winner when that foe bid near the quarter, led to the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. BRANDT stalked the pace two
wide between foes, shifted out for a clear run outside of the top two in upper stretch and was one-paced through the stretch. LUCID DREAM lagged off the
pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn but lacked a closing bid. TWIN VALOR pressed the pace from the rail and faded around the far turn.
MONKEY'S MEDAL played no factor while racing two wide. FLEDERMAUS stalked the pace three wide and retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
NORTHERN HEART was squeezed back at the start, dropped far back early, raced in the two path around the turn, rallied between foes, surged late and
was up on the wire. MAJESTIC PIC was pinched back at the start, raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide nearing the lane, closed outside and just
missed. MISS LAMBORGHINI set a clear pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch, held well clear to deep stretch, shortened stride late and was nailed.
JAZZY JUDER broke in a bit and bumped MAJESTIC PIC, advanced outside nearing the turn, bid four wide approaching the lane and flattened out. R
TRUE SENSATION veered out at the start, slamming NORTHERN HEAT and causing that one to be seriously squeezed back, stalked the pace two wide
between rivals and lacked a stretch kick. I ZOOM chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. TIKA played no factor while racing four wide.
DESERT IMAGE had some speed outside, angled to the rail entering the turn and faded. The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start and took no
action.

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY settled off the pace two wide, bid three wide into the far turn, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and edged ahead under a drive. VI
HAINES stalked the pace from the rail, cut the corner to bid in upper stretch, was bumped nearing the eighth pole, ducked into the chute soon after, angled
back out and finished willingly inside the winner. TEMPLEMORE saved ground in midpack, advanced two wide around the far turn, angled out in upper
stretch and rallied for the show. FRANCATELLI prompted the pace in the three path, bid between foes near the three-eights pole, vied past the
three-sixteenths pole, lugged in and bumped MOSBY'S RANGER into VI HAINES near the eighth pole, steadied and lacked a further bid. MY BOY PADDY
lacked early speed while saving ground, angled out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SACRA HOXEN was in range two and three wide, lugged in upper
stretch, veered out from behind the bumping in midstretch and never threatened. MOSBY'S RANGER set the pace in the two path, battled on between foes
around the far turn and through the midstretch, was bumped nearing the eighth pole, came into the gap and dropped back. WINSTON PEGG was outrun
while racing two wide. HOUSE ARREST failed to menace while racing two and three wide. TAKECHARGE CHARLIE broke in and bumped DANCE ON
THE MOON at the start, saved ground and played no further factor. DANCE ON THE MOON was bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little
impact. The rider of MOSBY'S RANGER claimed foul against FRANCATELLI for alleged interference in the stretch but the Stewards allowed the original
order of finish to stand.

Footnotes
ACE NINE NINE settled off the early pace inside, tipped out near the five-sixteenths pole, shifted further out in upper stretch, closed outside, put a head in
front near the sixteenth pole and outfinished PATAZ under a drive. PATAZ was extremely fractious behind the starting gate, pressed the pace three wide,
took the lead leaving the three-eighths pole briefly drew clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and battled on inside of the winner. JOHNNY CAB
set the pace along the rail, could not keep pace around the turn but bested the rest to hold third. ZAYA chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a
rally. VEGAS LIFE pressed the pace two wide between foes and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
COLONEL TOM set the pace along the rail, drew clear around the turn, drifted out when hit left-handed in upper stretch and again in midstretch then
straightened out and held clear under hand urging. MASTER GUNS tracked the pace inside, was no match for the winner but finished willingly to save the
place. THE WANT OF A NAIL broke slowly, made good progress outside down the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn and lacked the needed rally.
A SONG FOR ARCH pressed the pace two wide between foes down the backstretch, bore out near the three-eighths pole, angled back in soon after and
lacked a rally. BOPPIN ANDA WEAVIN pressed the pace three wide, dropped back when carried very wide near the three-eighths pole, raced four wide
around most of the bend and had no further bids. STONE COURAGEOUS played no factor while racing two wide. GOLDEN SURGE was outrun while
racing two wide. EKATERINOSLAV failed to menace while racing three wide.

Footnotes
STEADYTILLREADY stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the eighth pole, vied outside of MIAMI MUMBLES through the final furlong and edged ahead
late under a drive. MIAMI MUMBLES set the pace in the two path, settled patiently when a foe took the lead near the three-eighths pole, retook the lead
leaving the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. KING NEKIA stalked the pace two wide between foes to upper stretch and
finished evenly. SPINSTER ROAD raced off the pace inside, swung out nearing the quarter pole and passed tiring rivals. VISION OF THANOS was
reluctant to load, had speed inside and weakened. BIG RAY lagged outside, was getting out late on the turn and failed to menace. DYNAMIC DYNASTY
prompted the pace four wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, angled into the three path then tired leaving the quarter pole.

Footnotes
AWESOME D J settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, angled into the two path near the three-sixteenths pole,
rallied inside, struck the front leaving the eighth pole and held firm under a drive. SUPER JOHN stalked the pace four wide, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole, drifted out in midstretch, battled on outside but settled for second best. D T GOODIE raced in range two wide early, bid five wide
around the far turn and flattened out a bit in the lane. HANALEI'S HOUDINI lacked early speed while racing two wide, advanced three wide while racing just
inside of the winner around the far turn, reached the top of the stretch on near even terms with that foe but lacked a rally. WEATHER WIZ pressed the pace
three wide between foes and weakened in the drive. MARCO ISLAND pressed the pace from the rail, took the lead midway down the backstretch and tired
around the far turn. EXCHEQUER set the pace two wide between foes and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
DREAMING DIAMONDS settled off the early pace inside, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, rallied outside, struck the front near the eighth
pole and quickly drew off under a drive. STARTING TOUR stalked the pace in the three path, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led to midstretch,
was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clearly second best. I'LLMAKEYOUSMILE lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn and
was along for the show. SECUENCIA bobbled at the break, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. HEATHER HILLS chased the pace three wide
and came up empty. CULTURAL MANDATE set the pace in the two path and retreated after three furlongs.
