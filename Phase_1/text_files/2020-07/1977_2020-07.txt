Footnotes
HARDLY BLUE dueled from the inside early, battled up the backstretch, fought through the second turn, remained engaged entering the drive, responded
and inched clear late. BRITTS A CLOSER chased the early pace from the inside, inched closer entering the second turn, responded to challenge the winner
but could not match strides. YOU SAY dueled from the outside early, battled up the backstretch, remained forward for the drive but came up empty.
NORTHERN BIG IRON chased the early pace outside but could only improve position. FREE TO GO was no factor. ZARAZI was never close.
