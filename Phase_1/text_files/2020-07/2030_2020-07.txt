Footnotes
UNREQUITED LOVE contested the pace two deep in a long determined duel to take the nod later yards. FLASH TOWN contested the pace inside from the
very start, dueled with the edge nearest the rail on the turn and dug in gamely to the finish, though, reluctantly ceded. BAYTOWN EMMALEE gave chase
about the three path and dueled for second approaching mid-stretch, while no match for the top two. SHAKE IT OUT WEST chased the pace toward the
inside, raced at the rail rounding the turn then flattened out mid-stretch. AIR FORCE PINK gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the
three path. LOOKS DON'T LIE gave chase and raced off the rail through the turn. WATERLOO ROSE lacked speed after a somewhat sluggish start.

Footnotes
FREEDOM IS RINGING steadied briefly off the heels of the early leader then picked up the chase off the rail, dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths
pole, drew clear midway on the turn and was steadily handled to late stretch. MORGAN COUNTY gave chase outside down the backstretch, came through
the turn in the four path, dueled for second mid-stretch and was gaining mildly on the winner. LUFTY'S KISSES chased the leaders through the backstretch
then angled five wide on the turn and dug in down the lane to finish well. BOLD VALOR gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail, angled out from the
heels of rivals mid-stretch and finished evenly. FROSTY'S MAJESTY angled sharply to the inside to set a pressured pace and was met at even terms at the
five sixteenths pole, dropped back midway on the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY set a pressured pace at mostly even terms with Uncle Funky, drew clear of that one inside the eighth pole then drew away.
OFFICER APPEAL gave chase and rounded the turn at the rail then dug in to take second the final yards. PISTOL P chased the pace and raced in the five
path of the turn and was along for third the final strides. UNCLE FUNKY dueled with the winner inside through the middle of the far turn but dropped back at
that point and flattened stride the final sixteenth. ALLEN CAN DO IT gave chase toward mid track, rounded the turn in the three path and finished evenly.
VIDMER'S COURAGE gave chase and raced in the four path of the turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth. STRIDE ON BY chased the pace through
the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail and came evenly through the lane. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS raced in the four path of the turn and was not a
factor. IN THE GOSPEL broke in to make contact with Supercharged then picked up the chase, rounded the turn in the six path, lugged in a furlong away
and weakened. SUPERCHARGED was bumped and pinched back at the break then picked up the chase outside, rounded the turn about the eight path but
was taken up lame in the left hind and was euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
MARY'S LISTED NEXT pressured the pace inside from the three eighths pole but lost momentum off the inside flank of the runner-up nearing the quarter
pole, took aim in the three path approaching the head of the lane then dug in for the lead mid-stretch and was inching ahead nearing the wire. DANCING
DESTINY set a pressured pace from the three eighths pole and drew clear toward the quarter pole, was met by the winner just inside the sixteenth pole and
ceded; reluctantly. STYLISH PAINT chased the earlier pace toward the inside and raced near the rail into the turn, angled to the five path nearing the head
of the lane then dug in to duel for third later yards. QUEEN BOBBY gave chase about the three path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. PURE
ROMANCE chased the pace and raced just off the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. WITCHY WINDSOR gave chase inside and
raced at the rail on the turn. THAT TRICKY LADY came away slowly and dropped well back.

Footnotes
ANY WAY NOW angled to the inside to rate the pace then came under a bit of pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was driven leaving the far turn then
hand urged the final sixteenth. CASTLE REVIEW stalked the early pace from the two and three paths then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, though, had to settle for second best. ALL ABOUT TAP raced boxed at the rail leaving the three quarter pole then rated close four wide into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and showed little more. GHOST MINE raced off the
pace about the three path the opening turn then showed little response through the backstretch. SIENTE EL SOL was a bit reluctant to load and appeared
fractious once in the gate, hit the stall door upon exit then came away to stalk the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole but faded on the far turn. MAN OF THE NIGHT settled off the pace about the four path then faded through the far turn. SHORT CAKE'S MAN rounded
the opening turn in the five path and proved to be no factor.

Footnotes
PRIME LIME rated the pace and proved much the best under a confident, ridden out hand ride. GIN N SPICE gave chase and rounded the turn in the three
path then dug in through the lane and just held on for second. OUR BAD GIRL angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path,
finished evenly and just missed second. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE chased the pace and raced in the four path most of the turn, but angled to the outside
leaving the turn and passed some rivals widest. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little
more. WOLFBLADE chased the pace through the backstretch then weakened leaving the turn. ESTATE OF SONDE chased the leaders toward the inside
but dropped back at the rail on the turn then weakened.

Footnotes
SNIFF stalked the pace off the rail then closed to the front three wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear nearing the head of the lane and
dug in under steady encouragement to hold on well. ALLISON K settled back toward the inside then bid into the backstretch, came through the far turn
about the four path then dug in down the lane just in time to share second at the wire. ALPINE MOON settled off the earlier pace in the four path then bid
leaving the three eighths pole, raced close through the far turn, bore out into the lane but recovered stride past the eighth pole and held on to share second.
SILK STOCKING rounded the opening turn in the four path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the
far turn in the five path and finished well. TIZ JOHNNIE saved ground off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the three
path then raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. DON'T SPIN ME stalked the early pace from the two and three paths then challenged to take a
slim brief lead between horses past the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn. FLOATING BY never factored.
PARTY ROCK rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ceded control past the three eighths pole and gave way
from there.

Footnotes
LOVE HAPPY gave close early chase outside and took the lead leaving the quarter pole, then dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. HOUSE OF
LOVE angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn in the six path, finished strong and just missed. ODDSEVERINURFAVOR gave close chase off
the rail then rounded the turn in the three and four paths, drifted a bit wider leaving the turn but finished evenly. SOPHIA REGINA gave close early chase
then faded past the quarter pole. CROSSBOW'S WILDCAT was hustled along to contest the pace but was caught leaving the five sixteenths pole and faded
at the rail on the turn. AT THE HALF stumbled from the gate and lost her rider. The inquiry was lit before this race was declared official.
