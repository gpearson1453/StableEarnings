Footnotes
ALICIA'S KID showed brief speed then settled and stalked the pace, advanced two to four-wide late turn, had command upper stretch and held under a
drive. SOUPER HOT stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then closed through the stretch. GASCONADE settled off the pace, was
hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn and rallied determinedly. CAPTAIN HANDSOME settled off the pace, chased three and four-wide on
the turn, cut to the rail at the top of the stretch then finished with a mild rally. FOUR ACES HIGH set a pressured pace, was headed at the turn, forced the
issue, then gave way grudgingly in the stretch. ROCKCREST forced the pace into the turn, took a short lead, was passed upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
SLIP KID broke outward and settled off the pace, rode the rail on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied outside and got up late. BAY OF RUM
was off slowly and settled in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied determinedly but was outkicked. BEN LOMOND, in
range, closed three-wide late turn, lodged his bid mid stretch and gained a narrow lead but was passed in deep stretch. STEADY EARNER stalked the
pace, came two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and was up close, did not challenge and evened out late. NASHVILLE KNIGHT dueled early,
forced the pace on the turn, rebid upper stretch, battled, but was passed a furlong out and gave way. CAPTAIN SIDNEY raced from off the pace, was
hustled two and three-wide on the turn then chased gamely through the stretch. R U WATCHINGBUD settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide
on the turn but failed to menace. DISTINCT PASSION showed brief speed then stalked the pace, hugged the rail on the turn, lost his path and was steadied
as it began to close in the stretch, angled out a bit and rallied gamely. COLTON'S CORNER dueled, held a short lead from the rail on the turn, was rejoined
upper stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
MR RITZ (GB) led quickly, set a pressured pace, drew away upper stretch and held sway under a drive. SKYWIRE stalked early, was hustled along the rail
from midway of the far turn and finished gamely. COOLER MIKE stalked the pace, chased three-wide late on the final turn and finished under a determined
drive. AVIE'S FLATTER broke outward and bumped TIZ A SLAM then settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn but flattened out in mid stretch.
JUNGLE FIGHTER raced in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the far turn but failed to menace. TIZ A SLAM, bumped at the start, raced in mid
pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then lacked a rally. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) settled well off the pace, was hustled through the far turn but
never reached contention. EXPLODE forced the pace in hand, backed away late turn and lacked a closing response.

and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. DATA BOY settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide through the
turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. JUDICATOR raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn then evened out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AVIE'S SAMURAI was crowded soon after the start, recovered quickly to join the early leaders but was taken back to sit mid pack, advanced three wide into
contention on the turn, bid outside nearing the sixteenth pole and got by the front runners in the final strides. SAV stalked the early leader until pressing that
one mid turn, bid for the front at the quarter pole and led as they turned for home, not really shaking off her pace buddy at any point and succumbing in the
final yards to the winner. O'KEEFFE broke in at the start but recovered and took the lead quickly, was stalked and pressed around the turn, headed by the
eventual place finisher as they turned for home but stayed on as game as they come to the wire. WESTERN CURL was off the pace before rallying four
wide into mid pack on the turn, continued to close ground down the lane without threatening the top trio but easily the best of the rest. MAGIC SPELL settled
off the pace before rallying into range along the rail on the turn, but couldn't sustain her bid running evenly in the final eighth. PEARL HEIST had a perfect
rail trip nestled in behind the leaders, but when asked to respond in the stretch there was no punch forthcoming. BEAR PAW came from off the pace and
three wide trying to get into it on the turn, but her rally was weak, only enough to pass a few tired foes down the lane. WINANDYOURIN GIN's tack slipped
early, raced wide and blew the turn then galloped across the wire. NICE BROWN GIRL was pinched back at the start before rushing up between rivals to
stalk three wide, stayed in contention until turning for home and dropped back down the lane. BOOGIE WITH ME was along the rail at the back of the pack
on the turn before dropping back, losing contact with the field down the stretch.
