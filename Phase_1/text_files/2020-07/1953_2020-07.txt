FLAT OUT BEAUTY cleared ahead of the second flight nearing the far turn, ranged up towards the leaders while in the four path, and took over and drew off
from the eighth pole. SPIT'S IMAGE raced unhurried off the rail, began a rally entering the far turn, came wide into the stretch, drifted out and passed
evened out horses late to gain the place. POWER BANKER was the pace off the rail, was pressed by a horse mid backstretch, vied with that one nearing
the stretch, stayed inside but evened out to lose the place late. STAR OF PRIDE chased, ,then pressed, then vied with the leader nearing the stretch and
evened out late. YELLAH came five wide onto the backstretch and was not a threat. SUNSHINE SEEKER steadied after the start, tracked in third and was
left behind on the far turn.

ABSOLUTE LOVE tracked off the leader, got closer on the far turn, readily took the lead and drew off down the stretch. MERADA was unhurried early while
inside, was roused to cut the corner into the stretch, and gained inside of horses flattening out to just get the place at the wire.. SUN DRESS stalked from
third, was just off the leader while three wide on the turn, gained second in the stretch but gave it up very late while lfattening out. LADY CLEOPATRA was
the speed off the rail to the far turn, was readily passed by the winner on the turn, and had just enough to hold fourth at the wire after losing position down
the lane. TWELVE MONARCHS was five wide while last on the backstretch and gained on foes that flattened out down the stretch. MOMENTA KAT was
between horses at the rear of the field on the backstretch, was asked for rally on the turn and faltered in the stretch. DATA DAMSEL dwelt, refusing to race.

GOFAR KRISTA raced off the pace, ranged up on the turn three wide, took the lead in the stretch under minor whip urging, winning a slow race. ALEXIS
ROAD WEST dueled outside a foe, backed off to press instead, could not contain the winner on the turn, was moving up and down late but held place.
FRIENDLY MERGER dueled inside, led at mid turn, but evened out in the stretch. RACEY WEEKEND bounced off the rail early, steadied on the
backstretch while racing in the second flight, and lacked the needed kick to threaten the top three when called upon late . PAIG'S SONG was urged with
whip taps from the gate, was roused on the turn and came five wide into the stretch. MADICHASINGDREAMS lunged at the start and was no real threat.
GETAWAY'S GIFT contended briefly and tired. The times for this race are correct.

GONE TOO SOON was bothered after the start, was urged a bit on the backstretch to get closer to the leaders, was roused entering the stretch to chase
the front runners in earnest and got by the dueling leaders late for the win. LET'SCALLITEVEN easily got the lead at the rail, clearing the field at the start,
was confronted by a foe in the first turn, angled out for room on the upper backstretch, continued to battle with that horse into the stretch, exchanged light
bumps and took second while beat for the win by another horse,. DIAMOND DUST headed the leader on the first turn, vied with that one to the stretch,
exchanged light bumps and faltered as both were passed by the winner. TWO EAGLES was into stride slow, raced inside gapped off the leaders, moved up
on the rail, lacked room inside in the stretch, and evened out late. SEND ME ON was well back, moved up in tandem with a foe on the far turn and held
position. GLIDING ALONE was unhurried, rallied on the far turn and evened out.

Footnotes
HER GOLD MINE was unhurried, raced in the three path on the turn, came into the stretch in the eight path and gained enough to pass duelers in deep
stretch. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE never far back, made a four wide rally on the turn, passed the dueling leaders, briefly led but lost the win nearing the
wire. DEAR THEODOSIA vied between horses, dueled a foe down the stretch, led late but gave way nearing the wire, keeping third. BIZBY vied inside two
foes on the backstretch, continued a duel with one of those foes down the stretch, but tired late. DON'T TELL ME was off slow, last early, came widest into
the stretch and had some gain. NURSE LIZ rallied three wide on the turn but was no real threat. G CODE was up close on the rail to the stretch and tired.
SHE'S EDGY raced three wide toward the front and stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
REWARDED was slow into stride, huslted early, raced up close inside, came off the rail to go three wide on the turn, rallied to lead at the three sixteenths
pole and had the whip put away for the final sixteenth. MI BELLA bumped a horse at the start, edged toward the leaders on the backstretch, raced between
horses on the turn before moving out four wide and advancing steadily down the stretch to take second. COMPETITIVE QUEEN vied outside a foe, led on
the turn, then leveled out in the final furlong. RHODA'S JEWELL was bumped by a horse at the start, raced unhurried, came into the stretch very wide and
gained late. SHE GOT IT raced off the rail to the stretch and tired in the final furlong. ON THE COME came very wide into the stretch and improved position.
MADAM NOVETZKE was up close early and faltered in the stretch. ELLIE'S STROLL was bumped by a horse at the start, ran last early and was no factor.
MAGNA BELLE was bumped at the start, led inside, and backed out on the turn.
