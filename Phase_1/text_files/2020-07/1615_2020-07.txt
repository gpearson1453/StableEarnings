Footnotes
CAPTAIN THUNDER raced two wide between horses from the outset, moved to a short lead approaching the lane and held stubbornly after a long hard
drive. FEDERAL DOMINANCE wasn't far back along the inside to the far turn, came out into the three path while commencing his rally, loomed boldly
outside the winner into the final furlong but hung. ATTA KID was unhurried following a slow break, angled in two wide while beginning a strong run between
horses into the far turn, moved closer between horses into the final sixteenth but hung. KNOWN QUANTITY raced three wide between horses with the pace
onto the backstretch, angled to the inside, wasn't far back into the final furlong, angled out for room in midstretch and continued evenly. GILGIMESH made
the pace along the rail for over three quarters, remained prominent into midstretch then weakened. THUNDER GRUNDER was slow early, made a mild two
wide run between horses around the final turn but failed to sustain through the lane. ACROSS THE AISLE broke slowly and was shuffled back from
between horses entering the far turn. RANDOM THOUGHTS fell back from between horses on the backstretch, raced wide into the stretch and tired.
SHANGHAISCHOOL stayed outside into the far turn, came out wide and stopped. PITCHING was hustled along while caught four wide on the front end
around the first turn and was finished after five furlongs.

ARTIFUL MOVE took command soon after the break, stayed along the inside while increasing her advantage into the final furlong and was under strong
urging through the lane. NEW FOUND TREASURE settled outside, improved position into the far turn, angled to the inside but couldn't gain through the
lane. SUPERLING was content to lag badly following a slow break, made a wide run around the final turn, came well out into the track in early stretch and
finished willingly. TEX MEE A KISS was caught in tight along the rail around the first turn, was in tight entering the far turn, came out wide on the final bend,
remained wide into the stretch and gained late between rivals. IVANYA was slow early, began a strong run from the outside after a half, moved closed into
the far turn then had nothing left for the drive. GOLIGHTLY pressed outside the winner early, fell back nearing the end of the backstretch, swung wide into
the stretch and stopped. L. A. HOUSE was close up along the rail for about five furlongs then stopped. MAXIMUM ENTROPY made a mild two wide run
between rivals into the far turn, stopped and was eased up. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE was caught in tight between rivals before going a quarter, came out
three wide for room entering the first turn and was stopping when caught in tight into the far turn.

JEBOLOGIST bobbled leaving the gate, settled, ran out while rallying into the stretch, drew clear from the outside before five furlongs and widened under
mild urging. EAGLES CRY stalked in hand outside the early leader, moved two wide to command just before a half but was little match in the lane while
clearly second best. UNSUNG HERO outlasted tired ones in an even effort. FLASHINTHENIGHT made the pace along the inside for about a half then
stopped. YES SIR COLONEL was fractious in the gate then failed to matter. TOMASCO was outrun after a slow break. SUCCESSFUL CURE was reloaded
before the break then was wide and outrun. GOLDMINE KAZ was no factor. SHADYS KEEPER was close up outside early then stopped. LUPI was finished
early.

BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN advanced early while in hand on the outside, ran out entering the stretch, took over entering the final furlong and held under brisk
urging. MADAME TIGER sped to a clear lead soon after the break, angled to the rail while inside the winner on the turn then grudgingly gave way through
the lane. STORMBEAM steadied in tight between rivals midway on the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn then gained outside through the lane.
MISS CRAIGIE was brushed while advancing between rivals on the backstretch, stayed well out from the rail around the turn and tired. GIZMO'S DESTINY
had early position in hand along the inside, came out, brushed MISS CRAIGIE midway on the backstretch, remained prominent into the turn then tired.

GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST settled, was brushed while advancing outside on the backstretch, moved to the front in the three path midway on the final turn and
widened under mild urging. SWITCHBLADE stayed out from the rail while making the pace into the far turn then was no match for the winner. SNOOP
steadied in tight while unhurried early on the first turn, made a three wide run around the final turn to get closer then flattened out. ONLY THE TRUTH
chased early, bore out into the winner midway on the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the far turn then tired. BLUEGRASS POSSE raced three
wide around the first turn and failed to menace. MAJESTIC CALLING was outrun. KING OLLIE wasn't far back along the rail for over a half then stopped.
