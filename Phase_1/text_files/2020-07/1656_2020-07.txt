Footnotes
ROYAL COMMISSION set the pace two wide between horses, drew clear while in hand turning for home, then widened his advantage through the lane
under driving pressure while hanging on his left lead. NOT AGAIN JACKIE saved ground far off of the pace, shifted off of the rail to pass a tiring foe at the
quarter pole, then produced a mild rally along the inside of UNCLE MOMO to edge place from him at the sixteenth pole. UNCLE MOMO prompted the pace
three wide, but was no match for an inner foe turning for home, then tired and lost place at the sixteenth pole. BIZ OPS tracked from midpack in the three to
four path, and finished up evenly for a minor reward. ABOUNDING vied for the lead inside of a pair of foes early on, but failed to keep pace with those rivals
at the five sixteenths pole, then wilted through the lane. COWBOY HARVEST was outrun throughout and showed little.

MONEY WELL SPENT broke outwards but was forwardly placed along the inside, brushed the rail in the early stages, stalked the leaders from along the
inside around the turn, shifted two wide straightening into the lane to produce a bid at the furlong pole, forged an advantage and held between horses under
driving pressure late. UNEXPECTEDLY tracked from midpack two wide, waited for racing room turning for home, stayed in a commenced a rally inside of
rivals turning for home, shifted to the three path approaching the furlong pole, then altered course outwards at the sixteenth pole when the leader drifted,
then kept on determinedly to prevail for place. MAVALOUS MAVALOUS bumped an inner foe at the start, dueled for the lead inside of rivals, repelled those
foes turning for home, but was headed by the eventual winner at the furlong pole, then kept on, but was outfinished for place. STICK UP dueled for the lead
two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with her inner rival turning for home, then just held show under a mild drive through deep stretch.
AMERICAN VALUES tracked from off of the pace tow wide, came into the lane in the four path, then stayed on mildly. EYE HAVE CANDY took bumps from
both sides at the start, raced far off of the pace early on, shifted off of the rail into the turn then rallied five wide turning for home, but flattened out in upper
stretch. ROZAFA was bumped between horses at the start, then saved ground around the turn while far off of the pace, but to no avail. LUSCIOUS tracked
from midpack in the four path, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. TETON THAI prompted the pace three wide, but weakened between
horses in upper stretch. SECRET REVOLUTION had a slow start, trailed throughout, and was no factor.

Footnotes
HARD STRIKE advanced to striking range two wide between horses into the far turn when the pace softened, waited for racing room turning for home, was
hesitant to split the leaders in upper stretch, but did so easily when the outer leader drifted further out at the furlong pole, then drew off through the closing
stages. BREW PUB vied for the lead outside of CROSS OF GALILEE, inched a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but drifted out passing the furlong pole,
was headed, then held place through deep stretch. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) trailed early on, patiently waited for racing room while far off of the pace and
along the inside through the far turn, shifted three wide turning for home, and rallied between horses through the lane. REALLY SLOW stalked along the
inside, was blocked behind horses in upper stretch, shifted two wide at the furlong pole, rallied inside of MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) but was outfinished by
that foe for show. OKUDAH stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, shied outwards when that foe drifted out at the
furlong pole, lugged inwards causing correction inside the furlong pole, and finished under a mild drive. FLINT STROLL failed to factor after shifting from the
two path to the five path turning for home. CROSS OF GALILEE vied for the lead inside of a rival, but failed to keep pace with that foe turning for home, then
further weakened at the sixteenth pole. KISSIN ALEX tracked the pace from the two path around the first turn, then the four path around the far turn, but
weakened at the quarter pole. PASSAGEWAY raced far off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, then weakened further in the five path into the
far turn, and was eased through the lane.

HIGHEST MANDATE dueled for the lead outside of CLAW, took over from that foe in upper stretch, and was driven to the wire. CLAW dueled for the lead
inside of HIGHEST MANDATE, but proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, then held place. ATWATER trailed his pair of rivals early on, came under a
drive to keep touch with those foes at the half mile pole, managed to narrow the gap through the turn, shifted three wide turning for home, but only mounted
a mild rally and failed to reach place. Due to a timer malfunction, the quarter mile fraction is unavailable.
