Footnotes
STYLISH RAGS lost her footing ever so slightly at the start then was asked before being taken in hand, raced just behind horses while rated under restraint,
drafted in the two path while still on hold around the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths. shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole then rallied inside of
KRUBERA into the stretch, made a bid under a right-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, was switched to left-handed whip and given one crack while
fighting outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, quickly switched back to a right-handed whip, drifted in closer to that foe at the sixteenth-pole and put
that one in close quarters, rubbed saddles with that foe while battling to the wire and narrowly prevailed. DOYOUKNOWWHOIAM broke well then was
hustled, contested the pace on the inside of foes while along the rail, responded well when set down into upper stretch, came under a left-handed whip
inside the three-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner in the final furlong, was put in tighter quarters by that foe starting at the sixteenth-pole, rubbed
saddles with that opponent while fighting on to the wire but was denied while clear for the place. DASH TO THE TOP was hustled from the start, dropped off
the pace when KRUBERA moved in front early then settled behind foes, went three wide for most of the turn then paused behind horses while shifting four
wide outside the quarter-pole, swerved out six wide from behind foes while roused into the stretch, came under a right-handed whip around the
three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed whip outside the furlong marker, drifted in some in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick
but finished willingly for the show. OUR BELLA NICOLE broke in the air and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths then darted quickly to the inside,
settled into stride at the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into the stretch then came under the whip at the
three-sixteenths, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. SPRING BREAK was hustled from the start, disputed the pace on
the outside of a foe while loosely between horses, vied in the two path on the turn, was set down into upper stretch, dropped back under a drive outside the
furlong marker and tired. PAZZION broke a half-step slow, was urged along early, steadied while getting kickback when KRUBERA crossed in front midway
down the backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, was put to a right-handed whip inside the five-sixteenths, steadied while fanned out nearing the
quarter-pole then shied out seven wide into the stretch and had nothing left. KRUBERA lunged inward at the start and hit the gate while off a half-step slow,
moved up on the outside under urging to press the pace, vied three wide on the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, moved to four wide outside the
quarter-pole then spun five wide into the stretch under the whip, dropped back while still on her inside lead passing the three-sixteenths and capitulated.

Footnotes
VINCERO away well, attained a prominent position proceeding along the backstretch, was patiently ridden keeping an eye on the front runners contending
for the top, himself spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got roused angling to the outside as the half was being completed, settled in upper stretch
and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, was momentarily in the middle of foes appearing to poke a head down in the front with a furlong to go, dug in
with good determination while kept to strong handling to prevail. BRUSH COUNTRY tucked into the two path after the field had been sent off and running,
chased the pace from midpack, swung into action by swinging four wide into the stretch, closed in boldly during the ensuing furlong, arriving at the eighth
pole as the widest of three on near even terms with each other, went at it one on one with the winner from that station onward, got staved off. ZONIC made
it over to the inside route by the top of the turn, flashed interest as the second fraction was being finalized, fanned out five wide from upper to midlane,
rallied belated for the show. GETOFFMYBACK spotted in the two path, sparred for the advantage until midstretch before giving way. TALE OF MIST set to
a brisk hand ride leaving the gate, was not motivated by said action, took the inside route for the opening half, shifted into the two path at the top of the lane,
altered course over to the five path in deep stretch, made no impact. MISSLE BOMB disputed the pace from along the rail to the general area of the eighth
pole, faltered. BUSINESS CYCLE guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, got sent out into path six during the opening half of the stretch run, wound up
trailing nearly throughout.

SURSUM CORDA saved ground at the tail of the field patiently handled until put to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled out four wide into upper stretch
set down for the drive, offered up a good finish being flashed the whip to the off side, came in slightly as SENGEKONTACKET came outwards just outside
the sixteenth pole and forced CHAMPAGNE DIET to steady off the heels of both rivals when losing her seam between them, then got up in the very last
jump to prevail. PRAIRIE WINGS established the front and showed the way along the inside under rating, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was nailed in the very last stride to the finish. SENGEKONTACKET forwardly placed just off the
inside, tracked the leader from the outside under restraint in closest aim until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the
inside for home, dug in under a drive, came out slightly near the sixteenth pole as SURSUM CORDA came inwards from the outside and forced
CHAMPAGNE DIET to steady off their heels in tandem at that station, then kept on to secure the show honors. FASHION MO tracked the pace along the
inside from the pocket, got put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and was outkicked. CHAMPAGNE DIET brushed the near
side stall at the start before brushing EMPIRE LADY, saved ground under rating in mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive moving for a seam between rivals when SENGEKONTACKET came out slightly and SURSUM CORDA came
in slightly, got forced to steady off the heels of those foes just outside the sixteenth marker, then got outfinished late unable to recover her momentum.
WICKED HAPPY tracked the pace two to three wide from near the rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. EMPIRE LADY got brushed at the start by CHAMPAGNE DIET who broke inwards, settled in the one and one under rating just outside
the pocket, tipped three wide at the three-eighths placed to coaxing, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
UNHOLY ALLIANCE broke out at the start, was lightly rated just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the turn, dropped to the rail and bumped LADY T N
T at the quarter-pole then forced that foe to check while she was dropping back, chased the leading duo against the rail passing the three-sixteenths, altered
course outside those two foes despite some room inside them outside the furlong marker, rallied outside under a vigorous right-handed whip, showed good
acceleration into the final sixteenth and closed fast to get up. PACIFIC GALE pressed the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, was asked
at the quarter-pole then dropped in a path after turning into the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths then was put to a left-handed whip outside the
furlong marker, led under a drive until four strides from the wire but was caught while able to get the place. LIZA STAR showed good speed, disputed the
pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given her cue at the quarter-pole then dropped in a path while put to the whip, fought on under a
drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the show. WHAT A FOX settled off the early pace, moved up just off the heels of the
leader near the nine-sixteenths then became rank under stout restraint, continued keen off heels while inside into the turn, shifted three wide while roused
around the five-sixteenths then came under a right-handed whip outside the quarter-pole, chased four to five wide into upper stretch and came up empty.
LADY T N T bobbled at the start but recovered quickly, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was the first of the quintet to
be asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip outside the quarter-pole, was bumped by the winner while dropping back at the top of the stretch then
checked and capitulated. Following a stewards' inquiry into the incident at the top of the stretch, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
IMINCOMUNICADO remained forwardly placed after being one of the quickest springing from the starting gate, cut over into the two path, pressed the pace
hitched up to FUNNY PURSUIT, turned into the lane still directly abreast of the earlier-mentioned foe, responded when given her cue in the general area of
the three-sixteenths pole to take charge and then kick away to its largest advantage, felt the presence of HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH in deep stretch, dug in
late to preserve the decision. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH took up the chase from path three in midpack, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside,
had a good finish down the center of the course, missed. LOVE ME TOMORROW went over to the inside prior to departing the backstretch, was steadied at
the top of the turn settling into the pocket, kept watch on the front runners within striking distance, tipped into the two path for the drive, stayed on well to
secure the show. LITTLE RED BUTTON was in path three taking up the chase during the run around the bend, got worked into path during the early stages
of the stretch run, rallied with willingness after completing the move. SANDRA'S MINE pursued the pace from path two on the bend, angled out four wide
into upper, gained but without much impact. EXCITED FEELING patiently ridden tracking the pace from along the inside route, spun three wide into the
lane, slowly crept up towards the ones to catch, altered course six wide late, then continue to mostly improve position. SILENT EMPRESS guided over to
the rail, stayed on it all the way to the end of the bend, was under hand urging cutting the corner into the lane, drafted along during the ensuing furlong,
shifted to the outside searching for better racing room, never really found it. MENZAMENZ stalked the pace three wide on the turn, stepped into the lane,
had no offering. FUNNY PURSUIT off a half length the fastest, moved over to the rail with after maintaining the advantage, showed the way, feeling
pressure from the top one out in path two, succumbed when put to the test by that opponent in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, then steadily backed
away. DEVILS RENDEZVOUS along the outside throughout, raced somewhat keen in the early going, leading the pilot to steady the mount twice prior to
reaching the seven-sixteenths pole, went on race three wide on the turn, was maneuvered eight wide once in the stretch to no avail. NIKKI'S DREAM four
wide onto the turn, was sent out six wide after exiting it, gave way.

ZEALOUS just off the pace just off the inside in pursuit, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and attempted to nudge and lean his way out to the three path but was denied the move by CAVARADOSSI, dug in behind the
top pair until able to tip to the three path a furlong out, rallied to engage and collar the dueling leaders in the final jumps to the wire. COBBLE HILL chased
just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced on that rival and got roused continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
dueling with EMPIRE LINE through the stretch getting bumped by that rival lightly inside the eighth pole, was just in the midst of taking advantage when
collared in tandem with his main rival by the eventual winner before prevailing in the battle for the place honors. EMPIRE LINE coaxed from the gate, ranged
up to take over command with six furlongs remaining, showed the way in hand along the inside, got given a notch to work with into the turn before being
placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, came under challenge and cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads with the
aforementioned rival through the length of the stretch, came out under a near sided stick and bumped with COBBLE HILL just inside the eighth pole before
being corrected with an off sided stick, got caught in the late stages as a pair by the winner and then lost the battle for the place honors in the final jumps.
CAVARADOSSI showed the way early on before being headed for command by EMPIRE LINE with six furlongs to run, remained patiently handled in
pursuit three then two wide, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out spinning four to five wide into upper stretch, then stayed on one paced
through to the finish. JEROME AVENUE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, got brushed
as ZEALOUS attempted to nudge and lean his way out from the two path and denied the move, then weakened in the final furlong. CAUSE OF ACTION
chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. TAPIZEARANCE bobbled at the start losing his lane to rivals, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths,

DYNADRIVE went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, rallied five wide
into the stretch, closed strongly on the outside under a strong hand ride, made a bid while put to a left-handed whip at the eighth-pole, dueled gamely with
the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. BAD BEAT BRIAN went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the
pace on the outside, ranged up in the two to three path on the far turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, took the lead at the top of the stretch then
was asked for his best, came under the whip outside the eighth-pole, dueled with the winner in the final furlong and was denied while clear for the place.
PEPPER PIKE saved ground on the first turn, was lightly rated just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked in the three path at
the quarter-pole, chased the leaders under the whip in the stretch and was out-kicked but earned the show. VINTAGE KITTEN angled in early, saved
ground on the first turn, was unhurried towards the rear, saved ground on early the far turn, shifted three wide around the five-sixteenths then swung five
wide into the stretch, shifted further out under a drive around the three-sixteenths then came under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip near
the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. BLANKET OF ROSES dropped back under urging early, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled at
the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn then moved to four wide around the five-sixteenths, dropped in while put to the
whip into the stretch and lacked the needed response. KING OF RANCH went to the front, raced inside on the first turn, was well rated while setting an
uncontested pace, came under some urging with three furlongs to run, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped back under a
drive into the final furlong and gave way. ME AND MR. C moved in on the initial straightaway, traveled around the first turn in the two path under restraint,
was reserved off the pace, raced in the two path for most of the far turn then shifted three wide, was roused while four wide into the stretch then shifted
further out, was corrected outward while off the heels of a drifting foe outside the sixteenth-pole and also lacked the needed response. FUTURE BOOK was
hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside under some restraint, raced three wide on the far turn, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths, chased four wide into the stretch, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole then was corrected
by the rider and weakened. (Rail at 18 Feet)

JEWEL OF ARABIA broke in line with FLASHPACKINBARBIE at the start, went on dispute the matched up with that one, as well as with HAPPY SOPHIA
for a good portion of the backstretch too, went about the task mostly from the two path, headed the nemesis as the half was being completed, ventured
onward to the three-sixteenths pole before being turned loose, responded, lengthening away to a comfortable lead before getting geared down in the final
seventy yards. FLASHPACKINBARBIE vied with the winner towards the inside nearly from the get-go, proved no match once the top one was called upon
for more in upper stretch, stayed on well to salvage second. SHESASUPERFREAK lightly bumped at the start, pursued the pace three wide on the turn, got
maneuvered into path five for the drive, narrowly held the show. BUSTIN SCONES set up in the two path at the half mile pole, was between rivals from
midpoint on the turn until the quarter pole, stepped into the lane, clawed its way forward, fell short of snagging away third. HAPPY SOPHIA involved early
with the first two finishers during the initial stages for the lead, was eased back approaching the half mile pole, tracked them afterwards from the pocket,
tipped towards path two when cued up for the drive home, got outfinished. CLASSY SADIE strung out four wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from
upper to midstretch, maintaining its status of the being the widest at all times, lacked a response. FAIR LASSIE made contact with HAPPY SOPHIA after
bobbling in at the break, travelled three wide on the turn, got set down leaving the five-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the lane, backed away.
RUVIES IN TIME off a half length the tardiest, got spotted along the rail, rode it with the pilot applying a firm grip, swung three wide into the lane, had no
offering and wound up trailing throughout.

Footnotes
SHE'S MY TYPE (FR) three to four wide in pursuit in the early stages, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, remained patiently handled just off the
inside through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch briefly coaxed before pausing awaiting a tight seam to open up, got carried in as ARTIE'S
PRINCESS came in and bumped BREDENBURY who was in the two path into LEXI ON THE MOVE down along the fence, got a fortuitous opening just
after the incident as ARTIE'S PRINCESS corrected and burst on through roused to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth seizing command when
surging late to get up in the final jumps and score. MISS J MCKAY two then three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide into upper stretch, altered out half a path slightly as ARTIE'S PRINCESS corrected after carrying in a trio near the eighth pole and finished
with good energy to secure the place honors. SHIPPY hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under pressure
from BREDENBURY to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in and was caught by a pair in the late stages. ARTIE'S PRINCESS three wide in range of the front, got set down spinning three to four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and came inwards carrying in SHE'S MY TYPE and bumping that rival into BREDENBURY and in turn LEXI ON THE
MOVE, had the rider pull on the off side rein in correction just after forcing MISS J MCKAY to alter out slightly, then got outfinished in the late going. FLY SO
PRETTY chased along the inside and grew rank briefly into the turn tossing her head in revolt, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three
wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LEXI ON THE MOVE tracked the pace along the inside in range of the front, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, dug in under a drive and was bumped solidly into the rail by BREDENBURY who in turn got bumped by SHE'S MY TYPE all due to
pressure initiated when ARTIE'S PRINCESS came inwards carrying in SHE'S MY TYPE near the eighth pole, got taken in hand just after the solid bump
when off stride and weakened in the late stages having lost momentum. BREDENBURY (IRE) pressed the pace just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive in contention when nudged by SHE'S MY TYPE as that rival was carried in by
ARTIE'S PRINCESS and in turn bumped LEXI ON THE MOVE solidly into the rail, and was taken in hand briefly before backing away due to the lost
momentum of the incident. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of LEXI ON THE MOVE alleging interference against ARTIE'S PRINCESS at the
eighth pole as well as a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run. After review, it was deemed that ARTIE'S PRINCESS had interfered with both LEXI ON THE
MOVE and BREDENBURY and as a result ARTIE'S PRINCESS was disqualified from fourth and placed last.

Footnotes
OCEAN FIRE was taken under a tight hold early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated under stout restraint then became very keen from the
five-eighths to the nine-sixteenths, continued under restraint while off the pace, started the far turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide late on that
bend, was roused nearing the quarter-pole then came under the whip at the top of the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed whip into the final furlong
and closed well to get up while winning the head-bob at the wire. PRINCESS FAWZIA broke a bit awkwardly but went to the front, set the pace in the two
path through moderate fractions, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed whip while battling inside of COME STORMING
in upper stretch, fought hard with that foe into the final sixteenth then got the best of the rival but was denied at the wire while able to get the place. COME
STORMING was hard held between foes in the two path through the first turn then rated under tight restraint, went three wide for most of the far turn while
let out then moved to four wide outside the quarter-pole, was asked at the top of the stretch then made an outside bid, battled with runner-up under a
right-handed whip, fought on well in the final furlong but missed while able to get the show. HURRICANE BREEZE was taken in hand early, saved ground
on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path while still on hold, was asked in the four path into the stretch then driven
between horses passing the three-sixteenths, moved out into the final furlong and finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. LIDO KEY
went around the first turn in the two path, settled in the back half the field, went three wide early on the far turn, moved to four then five wide late on that
bend, was roused near the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. STRIKE MAGIC was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted behind the
leader on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, chased under the whip into the final furlong and weakened. COREY SCORES moved
in early, went three wide on the first turn, was unhurried at the back of the field, traveled around the far turn in the three path, was roused while swinging six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LEEWAY brushed with a foe at the start, was taken under a snug hold early, bobbled a few times under tight
restraint between horses then was pinched back nearing the seven-eighths pole, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace, saved
ground on the far turn, waited for room coming to the three-sixteenths, was roused outside the furlong marker, altered out a few paths near the
sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. STERLING BEAUTY went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside then in the two path on the far turn,
was asked at the five-sixteenths then moved closer to the three path, chased into upper stretch and tired. ROZIERE broke in and brushed with a foe at the
start, was taken under a tight hold early, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged along while four wide on the far turn,
dropped back while five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 18 Feet)
