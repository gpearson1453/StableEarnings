Footnotes
JAVISTHA veered out at start, was bothered by the errant TOMEY'S LEXUS at the seven-eighths pole, was settled well between rivals, responded to her
cue at the quarter mile marker, made a four wide bid and was up late. FIGHT ON PENN gained the early lead, was challenged far turn, responded when
asked turning for home, edged clear but was reeled in late. GYPSY WIND reserved, lodged a steady four wide bid on the far turn and stayed on. MY MIA
MYAH stalked the pace and came up empty in the stretch. TOMEY'S LEXUS ducked out at the seven-eighths pole, saved ground and kept on in the stretch.
BIG LUCK never menaced. BE DONE WITH IT lacked room at the start and showed little.
