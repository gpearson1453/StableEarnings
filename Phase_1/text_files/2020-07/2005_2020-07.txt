Footnotes
BOURBON TRAIL stalked the leading duelers after shifting to the three path into the turn, made a three wide bid passing the five sixteenths pole, dueled
outside of IN THE GAME in upper stretch as that foe dug in, but drew clear in the final sixteenth. TWO DOT prompted the pace setter two wide before
inching closer to duel for the lead passing ht half mile pole, but failed to keep pace between horses at the sixteenth pole as BOURBON TRAIL made a wide
bid, then kept on through the lane to reclaim place in the late stages. IN THE GAME set the pace along the inside early on, dueled inside of TWO DOT into
the turn, got the better of that foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, but was engaged by BOURBON TRAIL passing that marker, dug in to hold a narrow
advantage in upper stretch, but was headed passing the furlong pole, then weakened in the final sixteenth. MAGIC JACK was off slowly, lagged behind his
trio of foes throughout, and showed little.

Footnotes
EXCELERITA took up after being impeded by GLORIOUS TAPIZAR early on, saved ground through the turn while far off of the pace, darted to the seven
path when straightening into the stretch to be outside of the leaders while still inside of SOUL ALIBI, then rallied through the lane to get up approaching the
wire while holding that foe at bay. TRULY'S SPIRIT set a pressure pace along the inside, dug in gamely through the lane to hold an advantage to deep
stretch, but was nailed on the wire by an outer on charging foe while just holding place. SOUL ALIBI trailed the field in the two to three path around the turn,
was floated to the eight path in upper stretch when an inner foe swung out, then rallied widest outside of that rival, but was outkicked by her, sustained her
bid through deep stretch, but just missed place. ABRAMAX brushed the gate at the start, pulled forward inside of rivals to achieve pocket stalking position
into the turn, shifted off of the rail turning for home to split the leaders in upper stretch, bumped her outer rival in the process, produced a bid approaching
the furlong pole, but failed to reach the leader and got outfinished by outer foes for minor rewards. OSPREY COURT tracked from midpack in the two path
behind the leading group, shifted three wide and split foes at the quarter pole to produce a bid, but flattened out four wide in upper stretch. CARSON
RESERVE prompted the pace two wide, inched forward around the turn to make a bid for the lead between horses turning for home, but was bumped by an
inner rail-vacating foe straightening into the lane, then got outfinished. GLORIOUS TAPIZAR shifted out in the early stages impeding EXCELERITA, tracked
from midpack three to four wide and outside of foes, but drifted out approaching the quarter pole, weakened turning for home, and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
STARLIN was off slowly and trailed the field around both turns, came into the lane five wide, sustained a grinding rally through the stretch to produce a bid
in the late stages, and got up at the wire. COLOMBIANO raced off of the pace in the four path, tracked the leading trio of duelers around the far turn before
producing a four wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage outside of rivals approaching the furlong pole, held an advantage passing the
sixteenth pole under a long drive, but was nailed on the wire by an oncharging outer foe. BORA BORA tracked from midpack three wide, inched forward into
the far turn to produce a bid, dueled for the lead outside of a pair of foes around the turn, dug in between foes in upper stretch, then kept on after being
headed by his outer rival. NEW YEAR'S LUCK settled off of the pace along the inside through the first turn, pulled forward down the backstretch, took the far
turn two to three wide, then passed tired inner foes through the lane for a minor share. SLICK AS A PIN saved ground far off of the pace, and passed tired
foes three wide through the lane. TOWN DRUNK set the pace along the inside, dueled for the lead inside a pair of foes around the far turn, but gave way in
upper stretch. GIANT'S FORREST stalked two wide before bidding between horses into the far turn, dueled two wide and between foes around that bend,
forged a narrow advantage turning for home, but weakened approaching the furlong pole, and wilted. HALF TRICK chased the pace along the inside, but
failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, and steadily faded thereafter.

Footnotes
DEGROM settled far off of the pace, rallied three wide around the turn, swept past the leaders passing the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, then
widened his advantage while being ridden out to the wire. NICE WORK set the pace along the inside, felt pressure from PRINCE PIERCE into the turn,
fended off that foe through the bend, but was headed passing the quarter pole by DEGROM, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, and held place
through the lane. AMERICAN HERITAGE was off a step slowly, chased the pace three wide, was outmoved by inner and outer foes passing the five
sixteenths pole, but kept on through the lane for a minor reward. PRINCE PIERCE stalked then pressed the pace two wide into the turn, but failed to keep
pace between horses at the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane. MIAS MOONBEAM saved ground while far off of the pace around the turns, and
produced a mild rail rally through the lane, but failed to threaten. PAT DADDY advanced along the inside simultaneously with DEGROM's rally around the
far turn, shifted off of the rail to two wide in upper stretch to engage the leader turning for home, but flattened out, and weakened at the furlong pole.
ARTEMUS EAGLE raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to play a factor.

Footnotes
LONG ON LUCK was slow to get going in the early stages and trailed the field around both turns, swung to the seven path turning for home, rallied outside
of foes through the lane, and just got up at the wire. VOLUBILE stalked the pace in the two path, bid for the lead into the far turn and dueled for the lead
outside of SHARP ART through that bend, cleared away from that foe passing the quarter pole and held a clear margin into the final sixteenth under a long
drive, but was nailed on the wire by an outer oncharging rival. RANSACK was forwardly placed along the inside into the first turn, talked the dueling leaders
three wide around the far turn, forged place turning for home as the leader kicked away, but lacked a kick to make headway on that foe before getting
outfinished by an outer oncharging foe in the late stages. ERNIE BANKS settled off of the pace along the inside, gained two wide passing the quarter pole to
produce a bid for the lead inside of the leader passing the furlong marker, but flattened out at the sixteenth pole. MESSIAH raced off of the pace in the three
to four path around the turns, and failed to make an impact. SHARP ART pulled clear in the two path around the first turn, held an advantage from
VOLUBILE into the far turn, dueled inside of that foe around that bend, but weakened turning for home and faded.

Footnotes
GIRL DADDY was off slowly, recovered under her own power to track from midpack four to three wide, inched closer without encouragement into the turn to
make a three wide bid for the lead while in hand at the five sixteenths pole, forged a lead turning for home, kicked clear from her inner battling foe passing
the furlong pole, and was wrapped up approaching the wire. MALIBU BIRD prompted the pace setter two wide, bid between horses at the five sixteenths
pole as GIRL DADDY ranged up alongside, forged a lead, but was quickly headed by that foe passing the quarter pole, dug in and battled on in upper
stretch, but yielded passing the furlong pole, and held place. MEJTHAAM tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted off of the rail around the turn, then
to the three then four path turning for home, forged show in upper stretch, and stayed on to secure that placing while making mild headway on place. GRAN
MANNA chased the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the leaders turning for home while two wide, then kept on through the lane for a
minor reward. GOOD PENNY broke outwards, advanced four wide around the turn, but flattened out five wide in upper stretch. JAIL HOUSE CODE saved
ground while far off of the pace, and failed to make an impact. RACE SMART never played a factor. ROCK OUT set a pressured pace along the inside, but
was headed by multiple foes passing the five sixteenths pole, and wilted through the lane. JEDEDIAH broke well but was outsprinted to midpack two to
three wide early on, then weakened passing the five sixteenths pole, and steadily faded thereafter. SHES A THREAT was always outrun.

Footnotes
NEW ROO stalked three wide, made a three wide bid for the lead while in the four path into the far turn, took over from inner foes in hand passing the five
sixteenths pole, widened her advantage in upper stretch before being driven passing the furlong pole, then ridden out to the wire. SARA SEA was forwardly
placed along the inside, inched forward inside of a trio of foes around the far turn as the rail was left open by the inner leader, produced an inner bid for the
lead at the five sixteenths pole, but quickly proved no match for an outer foe, forged place at the quarter pole, and held that position through the lane as the
leader kicked away. SHACKLETTE prompted the pace two wide, then vied between horses in the three path into the far turn, but proved no match for her
outer foe at the five sixteenths pole, weakened through the lane, but reclaimed show in the late stages. MORE ROSES set the pace inside a pair of foes,
stayed a path off of the inner rail into the far turn, which allowed SARA SEA to produce a rail bid, and weakened between horses passing the five sixteenths
pole. TIZ ELLA trailed in the three path around both turns, was floated to the five path turning for home, and failed to make an impact. ROCKIN READY
tracked from off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path turning for home, but failed to get involved.

Footnotes
RAISON D'ETRE stalked the leading duelers along the inside around the first turn and into the far one, shifted to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to
produce a three wide bid for the lead turning for home, edged clear approaching the furlong pole, then held off charging rivals in the late stages, and lasted.
LONGPANTS REQUIRED tracked from midpack in the two to three path around turns, inched closer turning for home before shifting four wide in upper
stretch, produced a rally through the late stages, made a bid and lunged at the wire, but missed. BROADWAY LADY saved ground while midpack, inched
forward around the far turn along with LONGPANTS REQUIRED to be behind the leaders turning for home, shifted to wide in upper stretch, sustained a rally
inside the aforementioned foe to produce a bid between horses late, but did not have enough to catch the leader. THREE FLAMINGOS tracked from
midpack two wide, advanced to be in range of the leaders turning for home, then stayed on through the late stages to produce a grinding rally, and was
gaining on the leaders late. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL dueled for the lead inside of a foe, but was headed by a wider rival turning for home, then gave way
at the sixteenth pole. HEAVENLY PEACE saved ground far off of the pace, and produced a mild rally, but failed to threaten. TIZ PENNEY saved ground
from off of the pace, came into the lane in the three path, shifted in a the furlong pole, but failed to produce a bid. DADDYMADEMEDOIT saved ground
around the turns while far off of the pace before swinging to the five path turning for home, but lacked a rally. VIOLENZA dueled for the lead two wide, but
weakened between horses turning for home. BLONDE BY NATURE was no factor. SHE'S A DEAL was never involved. CURTAIN BLUFF was off
awkwardly, then trailed the field throughout, and showed little.
