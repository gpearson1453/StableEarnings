Footnotes
ELECTORAL was climbing a bit in the opening furlong, trailed to the turn, had to swing out from the three path to the six path into the stretch then closed
with a rush to win going away. CIRCUS ACT stalked the leaders to the turn, got pushed out to the five path to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then was no
match for the winner while besting the others. SIERRA MELODY attended the pace to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid
stretch then tired. JOHN'S INTUITION was chasing to the turn, came two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. CINDERELLAS PRINCE had
good speed and dueled inside of SIERRA MELODY, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and gave way. BERNIE'S BIG BOY had
no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TEASPOON OF PEPPER was chasing to the turn, bid four then five wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, took over leaving mid stretch and held
driving. EDDIE'S PRINCESS was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out for room and finished willingly for second.
COMMISSIONESS was also chasing the pace, bid four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not threaten. CARIBOU CHIANTI was on
the pace from the outset, raced three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. OUI SAY NO had good speed, dueled inside of
CARIBOU CHIANTI and two wide to the stretch, stayed on inside rivals to mid stretch then tired. MYRA'S BEAUTY stumbled shortly after the start and
unseated her rider. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race but did not alter the results.

DARLING DEMON was used to contest the pace, raced two wide to the stretch then responded while drifting out despite right handed whipping and held
determinedly. CONNIE'S PROMISE stalked the pace to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then responded late to save second.'. MAGNOLIA'S
HOPE chased the winner to the turn, was caught out four then five wide to the stretch and got outfinished in the final sixteenth. TRULY FABULOUS had no
speed, came two then three wide to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch then shifted widest in mid stretch and was making a mild bid. POULAPHOUCA
attended the pace outside the winner and three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then weakened. UNUSUAL DANCER had no speed, was
four wide on the turn and did not rally. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU stumbled at the start, recovered to chase the pace in the two path to the stretch then was being

Footnotes
IRON ALEX never far back to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, dueled the favorite in the final furlong and gamely bested that one. KITTEN'S
ROYAL was settled to the half, circled four wide while rallying on the second turn, dueled the winner from the furlong marker but was outfinished. PRINCE
CHEVAL had good speed, set the pace off the rail to the second turn, stayed on to the stretch then was outkicked but gamely bested SPIDER RICO for the
show. SPIDER RICO was a pace factor early, pressed the leader to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then got outkicked to mid stretch and hung
late to miss third. MY MAN DRAYMOND was outrun to the half, circled five wide on the second turn then swung out widest and showed some late interest.
CATS OUT TONITE had no speed, settled to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive. WINE N DIVINE stalked the
pace to the half, was two then three wide to the stretch but weakened in the lane. MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE had no speed and was never a threat.
MONSAJEM PERVADE got outsprinted early and settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch and gave way. JASON X L chased the
pace three wide to the second turn but tired after six furlongs.
