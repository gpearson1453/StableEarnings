Footnotes
STARLET EXPRESS chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was asked for more entering the lane, slowly inched up on the leader after the
eighth pole, continued to inched up inside the sixteenth pole then surged in deep stretch to clear late. PASSING ON BY set the pace from the outset while
off the inside, continued on a clear lead into the lane, had her largest advantage with and eighth to go then grudgingly gave in to the top one while finishing
clear for the place spot. AMERICA RULES chased the pace through the turn while racing in the three path, continued on in the four path into the lane then
finished evenly. EYE FLIRT saved ground throughout and weakened inside the eighth pole. DANCE MONEY was brushed at the start and settled to the
back, raced erratically through the turn while appearing to get out and having difficulty maintaining a straight path, continued in the lane from the three path,
moved out from behind others inside the eighth pole and gained energy late. MISS DEVIOUS was in the two path through the turn when not far back then
tired after entering the lane.

Footnotes
ACE DESTROYER quickly cleared, remained clear through the turn, asked after straightening, widened to inside eighth pole then was hand urged to the
end. MOST MISCHIEF chased the pace from the three path, continued in the three path into the lane then could only chase the winner to the wire while
finishing clear for the place spot. TREETOP FLYER was in the two path through the turn, moved closer to the inside into the lane, could not gain on the top
two and just lasted for the show spot. SIR BRAHMS was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path then showed late energy to
just miss the show spot. ODIE was along the inside through the turn, angled sharply into the four path entering the lane then weakened inside the eighth
pole. IMPROVISER was never a factor while in the two or three path through the turn.

Footnotes
BETSDOWNLETSRIDE pressed the pace into the turn, moved to vie for the lead into the lane, shook clear outside the eighth pole then widened to the wire.
KINGOFTHERAINBOW set the pace into the turn, vied with the winner into the lane, could not keep up after straightening then settled for second best.
BENNY BOO BOO was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, could not gain on the top ones and finished best of the
rest. INDY REBEL was in the three path through the turn while well back, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. JEFF THE RUNNER
chased the pace from the inside through the turn , was still a contender entering the lane then was empty. RUN RUDY RUN ducked to the rail at the start
and was steadied while settling close to the rail, raced in the two or three path through the turn and was never in it. BENNY'S LEGACY was fractious
loading, broke slowly and spotted the next rival some four lengths, raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and was always well back.

Footnotes
TOHUI tracked the pacesetters through the turn while along the inside, tipped off the rail and into the two path after entering the lane, split rivals and edged
to the front with an eighth to go, cleared late and was all out to hold of the closing runner-up. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE was unhurried while in the two path
through the turn, angled into the six path into the lane then rallied from mid-track. BOA NOVA (IRE) was near the inside through the turn, came off the rail in
lane when passing rival, stayed in the two path through the final eighth and offered a mild gain. LIBERAL LUNACY raced in the two path through the turn,
came into the lane from the four path, shifted in two paths nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining and missed the show spot. ROLIN WITH OLIN
pressed the pace from the two path through the turn, was still a contender after straightening in the lane then weakened. JARETH was unhurried while in
the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the two path, shifted further off inside the sixteenth pole and was never a threat. ROGER BROWN set
the pace along the inside into the lane, still held an advantage with an eighth to go then gave way. SATURDAY TRYST was in the three path through the
turn and never was a factor. DANCE PROUDLY chased the pace from the path through the turn then was pulled up near the eighth pole and eventually
vanned off.
