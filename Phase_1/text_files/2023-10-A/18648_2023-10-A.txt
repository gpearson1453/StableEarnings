WINDY O K C set the pace from the inside, was well handled then drew off in upper stretch and was kept to task in the end. DA RINGO was chasing the
pace while two wide then was blocked behind rivals on the turn, waited for clear running room then rallied two wide, bore out and bumped with SLEW'S
LIAISON in mid stretch and dug in to be a game second. ALL SAINTS rallied on the turn while five wide then stayed five wide in upper stretch, lugged in mid
stretch making a bid but came up empty in the end. TEXAS BBQ was inside and saving ground on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch but came up empty
in late stretch. EVEN TERMS was unhurried early and failed to menace. SLEW'S LIAISON chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, made a bid
then was bumped in mid stretch by DA RINGO and taken up off ALL SAINTS heels then weakened in late stretch. DEROY chased the pace while three
wide into the turn, made a bid then was bumped slightly in mid stretch and faltered in late stretch. A steward's inquiry was held concerning the stretch run.
