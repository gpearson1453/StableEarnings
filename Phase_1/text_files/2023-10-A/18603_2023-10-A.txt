Footnotes
CHERNYAHOVSKIY rated just off the early speed while between rivals, was three wide on the second bend, fanned five wide for the stretch run and edged
ahead of SUPER SILVEWR inside the final sixteenth. SUPER SILVER four wide on both turn, edged ahead upper stretch, lugged in briefly inside the final
eighth then did not have enough left inside the last sixteenth. ZARMAE advanced from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up along the rail on the
second bend, rallied in the lane, edged ahead for third nearing the sixteenth marker and just held his position. SOUPER FORTUNE broke on top, shared the
lead while just off or along the rail, floated out some entering the stretch, slowly began to yield, was steadied briefly when SUPER SILVER came close
inside the last furlong, continued to battle to keep third but lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. OVERTHOUGHT hesitated a bit at the break,
quickly recovered to vie for the lead outside SOUPER FORTUNE but flattened out for the drive. CAMPAIGN SPY taken in hand behind traffic nearing the
first turn, was a brief factor between rivals but soon faded once on the backstretch and had no late bid.

Footnotes
WICKED SKY was kept close while toward the outside, took over three wide on the bend and steadily drew away in the lane while kept to urging until the
final seventy yards. FERGIE ATTACK prominent just off the inside, retreated some along the rail on the turn, swung outside WICKED SKY for the stretch
run, was all out, no match for the latter but easily best of the rest. SILVER EYES pressed from between rivals, did not keep up while two wide on the bend,
fanned outside FERGIE ATTACK for the drive, lacked a rally but moved clear for third inside the last eighth. HOT N FRESH raced in contention from outside
on the backstretch but faded two wide on the turn. MOLLY'S TEMPLE was sent to get the early lead between rivals, took the rail into the bend, was
overtaken nearing the end of a half mile and steadily gave way. FEATURED POWER showed little in a ground-saving trip.

CANTOO shared the early lead inside rivals but just off the rail, did not keep up after a quarter mile, altered out widest upper stretch, rallied and edged
ahead in time under a well-judged ride. BE MY BESTIE vied for the lead from outside, moved clear and stayed just off the rail on the bend, was challenged
from outside in the lane, weaved out and in slightly as she fought to hold on and did not have enough left deep stretch. GHAALEB'S CITY unruly in the gate,
chased the pacesetters from outside on the backstretch, advanced from path four on the turn, angled in some for the drive, battled BE MY BESTIE for the
lead and slowly wore down in the waning yards. COMMISSIONER GULCH forced in at the break, was without early speed, picked up her pace along the rail
on the bend, just off the rail into the lane, altered in when BE MY BESTIE came out some midstretch, came off the rail again in the late going trying to gain a
clear path then was steadied behind BE MY BESTIE approaching the wire. STACY ATTACK broke inward, disputed the pace between rivals, had the rail
into the turn and gave way the last two furlongs.

Footnotes
PEACOCK MAN altered in and bumped PACHI leaving the chute, was settled, commenced his bid three wide on the bend, angled in some entering the
lane, edged ahead of WINGING WAYS inside the final furlong and outlasted CHICKS FOR FREE. The latter was away slowly, settled widest, picked up his
pace three wide on the turn, fanned out further into the stretch, gradually lugged in the last eighth and had to settle for second best. WINGING WAYS soon
sprinted away from the rest, saved ground through the bend, was challenged in the lane, never relented when headed inside the final furlong but did not
have enough left in the waning yards. TAPIT SAM raced closest to the early leader for nearly half a mile, was just off the rail taking the turn, altered outside
PEACOCK MAN at the top of the stretch and continued to gradually yield. W W RUSSIAN GOLD chased from inside, angled out some on the bend, came
four wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. PACHI bumped leaving the chute, was boxed in behind rivals on the backstretch, just
off the inside on the turn, swung out some for the stretch run and had no late bid. KING TITO unruly in the gate, was also away slowly and showed little in a
wide trip. TIZRIK chased from just off the inside then gave way along the rail through the bend.

COOGAN hustled along from outside, progressed four wide on the bend, gradually lugged in as he rallied inside the last eighth and got up in time. RISKY
SPIRIT vied for the early lead between rivals, moved clear with a half mile to go, saved ground taking the turn, widened his lead in the lane, did not have
enough left nearing the wire but was clearly second best. MISS TENA MARIE urged from the gate, soon found herself in the second flight outside rivals,
was three wide through the bend, weakened for the drive but drew away for third the final furlong. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS contested the pace between horses,
did not stay with RISKY SPIRIT nearing the end of a quarter mile, was two wide on the turn then gave way for the stretch run. MOCOWBELL was soon well
back, stayed well off the inside taking the bend and had no rally. JILL ATTACK was a contender from inside on the backstretch but gave way with three
furlongs to go.

TONYS MORNING LINE was bumped shortly after the break and forced into KING DOODLE, progressed toward the outside, was three then four wide
taking the bend and got up nearing the wire. FEVER NATION moved clear of the rest after the first sixteenth of a mile, saved ground through the turn, put to
urging approaching the final furlong and did not have enough left in the waning yards. KING DOODLE bumped solidly with TONYS MORNING LINE leaving
the chute, was settled well off the inside, four then five wide on the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch. MON AMI FUZZIE altered in some to
keep a clear path inside WEST WARPATH shortly after the start, bumped with TONYS MORNING LINE, was an early contender from inside, did not stay
close on the turn and only make up minor ground the last eighth. WEST WARPATH lugged in some after the break, was soon chasing FEVER NATION
from just outside, floated out to path three entering the lane and had no late bid. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY showed little.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY inattentive in the gate, moved to the inside midway on the backstretch once the race began, angled outside KIANA'S LOVE entering the
lane, was bumped by that one and forced out some nearing the eighth pole, moved clear approaching the final sixteenth, received slight urging the rest of
the way and held sway. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE also moved toward the inside midway on the backstretch, advanced two wide on the bend, was forced to
angle out six wide at the top of the stretch, took over second inside the last sixteenth, came up short for the win but was clearly second best. KIANA'S LOVE
gradually drifted out as she vied for the lead inside rivals once on the main track, moved clear of the others from just off the rail on the turn, was challenged
in the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch, bumped LIL BIT TIPSEY, began to fade approaching the last sixteenth, was angled out at
the sixteenth marker and continued to drift out further. WAR COLORS saved ground and only passed inside tires ones the final furlong. SMILE AT THE
STORM contested the pace from outside horses on the backstretch, did not stay with KIANA'S LOVE on the turn, was forced out some by MY LADY SLEW
at the top of the stretch and gave way. MY LADY SLEW displayed early speed between rivals, stayed in path three on the bend, was forced out some as LIL
BIT TIPSEY squeezed through a narrow opening at the head of the lane and also gave way soon after.
