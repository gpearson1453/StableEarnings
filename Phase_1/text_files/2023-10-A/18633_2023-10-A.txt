Footnotes
FORESTER HUMOR travelled inside just behind the leader in the early going, had a perfect trip watching the contesting trio on the turn waiting to pounce,
shifted outside finding a seam in the three path in upper stretch, split foes to take control at the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task late to hold safe
crossing the finish line. ROOKIE RADAR tossed his head at the start, trailed in the beginning, was hard ridden picking up runners three wide with three
furlongs from the finish, loomed in the five path turning for home with momentum, could not sustain the run and was no match for the winner late but finished
a solid second considering the start. IT WORKED was bumped inside on the break, kept a close eye on the frontrunner tracking while in hand down the
backstretch, moved in to collar the pacesetter outside at the top of the lane, poked his head in front briefly inside the eighth pole and could not find more late
and faded to just hold for third money at the wire. GENDRAGON was unhurried early sitting near the rear down the backstretch, could see the field saving
ground through the turn, showed late interest when shifting off the fence with three sixteenths to go and closed in late just missing getting for the show
award in the end. SPANISH PRINCE led this field down the back straight, continued to have a narrow advantage up front throughout the turn, was collared
outside at the top of the stretch, battled on mildly until the furlong marker and faded in deep stretch. TOURIST'S DREAM was forced out to be squeezed on
the break, settled outside the winner in the second flight keeping tabs on the engaging threesome midway on the turn, shifted out to the five path for the
drive to the wire but could not get involved running to the finish line. STYLISH GENT broke outwards in the start, tracked three wide outside down the
backside, took closer order to the lead running three wide through the turn, could not keep up to rivals at the quarter pole and faltered with runners on either
side in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHUNKY MONKEY settled in mid-pack between horses with a half to run, moved early getting a better position on the leaders entering the turn, was urged
right handed at the quarter pole to after the frontrunners, quickly burst between foes in the two path at the top of the lane taking command and drew away
convincingly in deep stretch for a dominant win. DANCIN' DEPUTY chased the speed early on, was throttled back between foes at the half, shuffled back a
few positions three furlongs from the line, rallied four wide to be in the mix of things turning for home and determinedly won the battle for the runners up
share at the wire. BROTHER BELEN settled off the the top two runners inside at the half, rated kindly throughout the turn behind the frontrunners, advanced
on the rail at the quarter pole, shifted just outside off the fading early pacesetter in upper stretch and dueled to the wire for second money just losing the nod
at the wire. COMMANDER AT SEA was void of early speed trailing down the backstretch, was asked left handed starting a run three wide with two furlongs
remaining, ran widest in the five path straightening out for the drive to be in range of the leaders and mildly finished to the wire passing the tiring early
leaders. ONLY LOVE broke outwards on the break, tracked four deep with a half mile to run, prompted the pace three wide running around the bend, had a
brief lead at the quarter pole and gave way between rivals inside the furlong marker. HARD RELOAD broke sharp for the lead, cleared to the rail with seven
sixteenths to go, maintained a slim advantage inside through the turn, was collared outside at the quarter pole and backed away on the fence in mid-stretch.

LADY IN RED was hustled for the lead early, opened up on this strung out field through the backside, rated comfortably setting the pace, getting a breather
while unchallenged on the turn, was headed outside turning for home, never gave in and determinedly held off the rival through the lane inside to prevail at
the finish in a gutsy stretch running performance. RIFLING chased the winner along the backstretch, took closer order reeling in the frontrunner on the turn,
collared the winner in upper stretch, gamely battled to the wire but could not get her head in front at the finish. CLOUD STORAGE settled in midfield on the
rail in the beginning, was on hold inside behind the chasing runner up throughout the turn, shifted out from behind the leaders in the four path at the top of
the lane, stubbornly fought on through the stretch and held on narrowly for third at the wire. OLD SECRETS trailed the field down the backstretch, continued
unhurried seeing the field running around the bend, angled outside for clear run in the four path straightening out for home, shifted inwards under right
handed urging at the furlong marker and just missed closing in for third late settling for a minor role in the end. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH was brushed inside
to begin, stalked near the rear on the rail, made little progress outside throughout the turn, swung out widest in the seven path for the stretch run and was
one paced to the wire never making any impact. CLIFF'S HEAD stalked in the third flight between horses down the backside, took closer order with a brief
rally three wide three furlongs from the finish to be in the mix for a share straightening out for the stretch drive but levelled off in mid stretch. ALBERTA BE
MINE was pushed out on the break, travelled in mid-pack three wide outside rivals down the backside, offered a mild run three furlongs out to be in range at
the quarter pole and retreated in the six path in upper stretch. LOIS hopped outwards on the start, stalked near the rear on the rail down the backside, was
nudged on the fence for more run three furlongs from home, made little headway through the turn and could not get into contention running down the lane.

Footnotes
SOUPER COP moved forward inside under coaxing soon after the start, tracked in behind the leader inside foes but off the fence into the turn, bid inside
coming to the eighth pole, moved clear and held. CADFAEL settled off the pace racing about three wide into the turn, came out in upper stretch, found room
between runners in mid-stretch while forced out a bit, was second best. WHADDYA MEAN broke outwardly, was outsprinted early, angled in and saved
ground on the turn, kept on inside to secure show honors. SUGARTAP was soon clear setting the pace racing off the rail, drifted out a bit in the stretch while
weakening some, ran on. YODDHA stalked from between runners into the turn racing three wide, came out four to five deep turning for home and looming a
threat, lacked the needed late kick. TODAY stalked from outside four then five wide on the turn, weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
CONTAGIOUSLAUGHTER settled at the back, angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground inside near but just off the rail on the turn, came out four
wide in upper stretch, bid between runners in late stretch moving clear then held. ZODIAC BEACH switched out leaving the backstretch, was encouraged
along going three then four wide on the turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, kept on to gain late. LADIES RUM exchanged a bump at the start,
chased from outside a foe off the dueling leaders, put to urging by the five-sixteenths and dropped back, swung out six wide and came again in late stretch
but needed more. WORKING HOLIDAY settled off the dueling leaders, advanced on those saving ground inside through the turn, came out three wide at
the top of the stretch, needed more. GOLDEN SPRING dueled inside a rival, edged away to take command at the top of the stretch, was engulfed late.
GOOD BYE NEW YORK exchanged a bump at the start, ridden along three furlongs out racing at the back and off the inside, failed to rally.
FEATHERWEIGHT was strongly urged from the break, dueled outside a rival, drifted five wide leaving the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
SILENT GUROO took command being hustled out of the gate outside runners down the backstretch, dictated the pace while pressed outside throughout the
turn, put away the pace prompter in mid -stretch and had enough in reserve to hold comfortably for the win. HARD TO CAPTURE broke out to begin,
stalked on the rail down the back straight, was shuffled back on the fence to be close to the back of the field with three eighths remaining, had clear run
straightening out to the finish and was full of run late rallying inside in the final furlong besting the rest at the wire. AMERICAN GAMBLE tracked the top pair
down the backside, was nestled on the fence behind the contesting leaders through the turn and ran on willingly down to the wire to close in and capture
third money nearing the finish line. SUMMER SNOW chased the pace down the backstretch, press the issue outside the frontrunner on the turn, was
repelled by the winner at the furlong marker and faded in deep stretch losing positions late and had to settle on the fringes in the end. MI TORMENTA
stalked all alone in midfield at the half, made no movement keeping pace with the leaders running around the bend and finished with some interest driving to
the wire. MISS BOBBIT broke inwards at the start, travelled near the rear between foes down the back straight, was roused three furlongs from the wire with
runners on either side and lacked a serious bid through the stretch run. FEDALIA settled outside close to the back of the pack in the early going, made little
impression three wide outside runners on the turn and had not much to show for running widest in the five path down the lane. SPEEDY LYNN stalked four
deep outside foes in the beginning, offered an early move around runners at the half until the quarter pole running three wide on the turn and yielded in the
our path in mid-stretch. BABY MO hopped slightly on the break, was pinballed between rivals at the start trailing down the backside, could not catch up to
the field saving ground through the turn and was unable to get into contention down the lane.

Footnotes
HELL N WILD was away alertly leading at the start, contently tracked the frontrunner outside at the half, hounded the pacesetter on the turn forcing the
issue outside, bid three wide at the top of the lane, took command in mid-stretch and had enough in reserve to hold rivals at bay nearing the finish. FOXY
LADY was in a good position alone watching the front two down the back straight, continued to keep tabs on the contesting twosome through the turn,
rallied to bid on the fence in upper stretch, fought on gamely inside down the lane, was no match for the winner late but stubbornly hung on for the place
share crossing the line. GIZMO'S B F F travelled on the inside under a snug hold in the third flight along the backstretch improved when roused with five
sixteenths to go , shifted outside for clear run finding her best stride late and closed strongly nearing the wire to just miss out on the place share at the finish.
HALFINTHEWRAPPER emerged with the lead five furlongs from the wire, set a soft early pace running in hand down the backstretch, continued dictating
terms up front throughout the turn, was clinging to the lead with rivals on either side in the top of the stretch, battled until the eighth pole giving way and
faded late for a minor share at the finish. GABBY SQUARED was allowed to find her stride trailing the field down the backside, caught up to the pack by the
midway point on the turn and finished up mildly on the fence never being a factor throughout. DIAMOND CRUSH leapt up on the break, stalked outside in
the third flight along the backstretch, was coaxed for more run three furlongs outs, offered little response and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN BEAST travelled in midfield three wide between runners down the backside, started to rally shifting inwards to the rail three furlongs from the
prize, was on hold behind runners at the quarter pole, loomed three wide finding a seam turning for home, burst between runners having another gear in
mid-stretch and was pulling away in the final sixteenth. SMOKEN CHLOE tracked on the rail in mid-pack early on, was throttled down a touch at the five
furlong marker inside, made an early move getting a good position all alone tracking the front two through the turn running in hand, pounced to the lead at
the top of the stretch, did not switch leads driving to the wire on the rail through the lane and was caught late by the closing winner. SWEEPING PASSION
settled four wide with runners on each side down the back straight, commenced a run three wide around foes three furlongs to go, was in range with
momentum in the five path at the top of the lane, finished up strongly to be involved in a four horse photo for place at the wire and emerged with the show
award in the end. FOREVER DANISH stalked three wide close to the back of the pack in the beginning, could see the field running four to six wide
throughout the turn, drifted in on the wrong lead while urged left handed down the stretch, was gaining steadily in the late stages and just missed for third in
a valiant effort. MOET MONET tracked the top two at the start, made an early move up the rail to take command at the half, put away the early pace rival
while getting out at the quarter pole, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, gamely fought back between horses at the furlong marker and gave way
grudgingly, losing positions nearing the finish line. CLASSICALCROSSOVER broke a step slow to begin, trailed in the early going, was on hold in tight
quarters on the rail entering the turn, offered a mild turn of foot inside with five sixteenths to run but needed more of a finish to threaten on the fence in the
final furlong. FEW REGRETS was brushed inside at the start, stalked three deep outside rivals near the rear down the backside, made little progression
three to five wide through the turn and could not be a factor in the stretch drive. SWEET BOMBOLINI broke outwards on the break, settled in mid-pack four
deep outside foes down the backstretch, put in a brief rally four wide around runners midturn until the quarter pole, swung out widest in the seven path for
the drive to the wire and emptied out in upper stretch. TATOOSONMYSOUL was brushed outside to begin, pressed the pace inside early on the
backstretch, dueled for the lead outside at the half, gave up chasing the frontrunning leader at the quarter pole and had nothing left in the tank to give for the
drive to the finish. ALMONTE PRINCESS had the early lead leaving the chute, gave way to the top pair at the half, came under a ride but was backing
through the field with three furlongs to go, lost touch with the pack at the top of the lane and galloped across the finish line.
