STAR FINALITY away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of C C SUNRISE entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the
backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, and held a determined ISLAND LIVING off following a stretch long battle to prevail. ISLAND LIVING
away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed
willingly four wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. C C SUNRISE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace in the run down the backside, struggled to match strides with her pace rival entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the
drive to prove best of the rest. SILVER ARROW stalked the early pacesetters while saving ground rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the
final turn, but lacked the needed closing response while finishing three wide in the drive. VISENYA unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always
well back, and failed to make an impact.

BELLAROO broke sharply and tracked the leaders from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, and
closed determinedly four wide in the drive to get up in the final strides to get the better of a stubborn RICHARDS COMMAND. RICHARDS COMMAND
tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, held the narrowest of advantages
into the lane, and just failed to last, in a game effort. ANIMA dueled for the lead from the outside of ANAAMY entering the first turn, forced the issue two
wide in the run down the backstretch, overtook her pace rival approaching the final turn, but was no match for the top two in the late stages. ZETAMARIE
unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished two wide
in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. ANAAMY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, was overtaken
nearing the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

alertly and pressed the leader three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace
rival leaving the turn and entering the lane, but closed with late interest four wide in deep stretch to just miss. ROSE OF TEXAS tracked the leaders in the
run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive in
a solid effort. AMANDA hopped at the start to get away a step slow, settled at the back of a compact field in the run down the backside, commenced her bid
from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed steadily two wide from between rivals in deep stretch to just miss. TEXAS HUMOR away well and
tracked the leaders in the run down the backside, struggled to maintain her position while racing three wide into the final turn, but faded over the final

Footnotes
BROOKE MAGIC stalked the leaders while saving ground along the inside through the stretch the first turn, pulled his way into a tracking trip in the run
down the backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, slipped through at the rail entering the lane, and quickly assumed command and drew
clear late. LIZZIE'S RAYNE away alertly and pressed the pace two wide through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue from the outside of
VIVA LA DIVA in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get the better of her pace rival for
the place in the final strides. VIVA LA DIVA away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace in the
run down the backside and into the final turn, led the filed leaving the turn, was overtaken from along the inside by BROOKE MAGIC entering the lane, and
just failed to hold the place. ACOUSTIC MELODY settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, gained ground on the
leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished evenly four wide in the drive. EDDIE'S GIRL broke sharply and
was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied three wide from the
back of the pack entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. LONIE MO bore out entering the first turn , and raced
extremely wide while being chased into a stalking trip through the stretch the first time, bore out again entering the second turn while racing towards the
outside fence, was pulled up with the assistance of an outrider in the run down the backstretch, and walked off under her own power following the race.
SKYSABLAZING unhurried early while trailing the field through the stretch the first time while saving ground along the inside, sustained an injury midway
down the backstretch and was pulled up, and vanned off.

Footnotes
AUGUST RAIN away well and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, advanced smartly three wide upon
entering the backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the final turn, and drew clear over the final furlong while under confident handling. VECTOR broke
sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, held a stalking trip behind the battling leaders in the run
down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. DIOCLES unhurried early
while settling at the back of the pack entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the rear of the field entering the backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, tipped off the rail leaving the turn, and closed two wide in the drive while being jostled between rivals to
get up for a share. NORTHERN FORCE away alertly and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, rallied three
wide entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive while exchanging bumps with DIOCLES. WEALTHY TEXAN raced to the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and into
the final turn, was unable to match strides with AUGUST RAIN entering the final turn, and faded in the late stages. WHISKEY HARBOR settled off the early
pace while racing three wide entering the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, rallied one out from the rail entering the turn,
but failed to mount a late bid when called upon. BECKETT'S BEST tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail,
forced the issue two wide from between rivals in the run down the backstretch, but weakened over the final furlong.

VIVA LA VINO stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, quickly
overhauled BELCARRA PARK soon after straightening for home, and drew clear late to prove best. FREESTYLE settled off the early speed while saving
ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for the
place late. BELCARRA PARK away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, was overtaken soon after entering the lane, and faded in the late going. ADDENDUM was unprepared at the start, while
leaning in, hit the gate hard in the opening strides while almost unseating her rider, lagged well off the early pace after her early trouble entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the inside in the stretch drive. NO PEOPLE broke sharply and
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, chased the pacesetter two wide into the final turn, but was outfinished over the final
furlong. DREAMB lagged well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but needed more when called
upon. I'M ALL SHOOK UP away well and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, was called upon for run
approaching the final turn, but failed to respond.
