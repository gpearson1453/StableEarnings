Footnotes
JUNIOR HOT SHOT broke out, hitting the gate on the break, recovered to take this field down the back straight, was very comfortable dictating terms
throughout the bend, opened up quickly when asked in mid-stretch and cruised to the wire under a hand ride. COUNTRY LIVING tracked the pacesetter
running on the rail in hand in the beginning, could not maintain inside position when coaxed, shuffled back on the fence entering the turn losing a position,
was set down on the inside battling for second money at the top of the lane and outfinished outside rival for the place share late. BUCK'S FIZZ watched the
top pair three wide outside in the early part of the backstretch, picked up the bit to prompt the frontrunner outside on the turn, was roused right handed trying
to match strides with the winner at the quarter pole, could not make any gains in upper stretch and faded dueling for second money in the final furlong
settling for a clear third in the end. PERFECT FOREST stalked outside near the rear in the early going, advanced inside on the turn, shifted out four wide at
the quarter pole and finished up evenly to the wire for a minor role in a strung out field. ADESSO attempted to veer in leaving the chute, lost action briefly,
regrouped to see the field through the backside, was under a ride catching up to the field at the three furlong marker and could not reach contention passing
only a tired foe in upper stretch. GUARDTHEROCK settled all alone outside through the backstretch watching the front trio, could not get involved when
roused on the turn, was floated out to the five path for the drive and had little to show in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CRY FREEDOM raced at the back of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three and four path, began a bid passing the
quarter pole and kicked clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. GOOD NEWS MONEY raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn,
launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground between horses late. MARDENE chased the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the bend from the two path and kept on in the stretch. TURBO PROP led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while
saving ground around the turn and weakened in late stretch. COCO'S DREAM raced off the pace on the outside early, continued around the turn in the two
path and never threatened. PRINCESSONAMISSION tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and
faded in the lane. STOLEN raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and showed no kick.
ANNIA CORNIFICIA F stalked the leader through the early going, saved ground around the bend and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO stumbled on the break, settled on the rail through the backstretch tracking the front trio, began to creep closer to the front three
lengthening stride midway on the turn, pounced when a path opened up four wide at the top of the lane, burst through to collar the leader in upper stretch
and drew away in the final sixteenth. CALL MY BANKER was allowed to settle trailing the field on the rail down the backside, picked up rivals quickly when
coaxed for more run with five sixteenths to go on the fence, shifted outside at the quarter pole, followed in the four path set by the winner turning for home
and chased in vain to the wire, besting the rest comfortably in the end. RICHIESINTHEHOUSE pressed the pace scenario with runners on either side at the
half, began to inch away from the early speed rivals inside quarter pole, was collared outside by the winner in upper stretch, could not offer any resistance
and faded late losing second money in the last sixteenth. KAWACATOOSE forced the pace three deep down the back straight, continued to battle outside
three wide setting the fractions up front, drifted out when weakening in the six path for the stretch run and was one paced to the wire to settle on the fringes.
COMMANDER TOM was hustled early for the lead, dueled on the rail for the top spot at the half, scrubbed on the rail trying to maintain position on the lead
through the turn, was the first of the threesome setting the pace to give way at the five sixteenths marker and retreated inside in mid-stretch. SOUPER
CLASSY watched the trio contest up front travelling three deep outside rivals at the half, was asked for more run three eighths remaining, could not make
any headway around the bend and could not get involved running to the wire. FITZPATRICK tracked the battling three running between horses at the half,
was roused three furlongs out, offered little response making no impression on the turn and could not be a presence down the stretch.

Footnotes
FOREVER DIXIE was nestled on the rail rating kindly behind the frontrunner in the early going, relaxed under a good rhythm keeping a close eye behind the
leader along the backstretch, waited inside on the turn to make a move, had clear run on the fence in upper stretch, exploded to the lead on the rail at the
furlong marker and was going away for the win at the finish. SOLO ALBUM was content to track the frontrunner outside on the first turn, travelled two wide
down the backstretch all the time measuring the pacesetter, edged closer to the front between horses in the final turn, posed a serious threat in the three
path straightening out for the drive, chased the winner in vain in the final eighth but could not catch the stablemate. LOVE TO SHOP hopped inwards at the
break, settled near the rear in the two path through the first of two turns, took closer order to the pacesetter two wide outside foes down the backstretch,
crept closer three wide on the far turn to loom four wide for the drive to the wire, was no match for the front pair at the furlong marker and gamely fought in
deep stretch to win the battle for third money in a photo. SAL'S BLUE JACKET took command from the onset on the rail, ears pricked setting a soft pace in
the first turn, continued up front unchallenged setting modest fractions down the back straight, was nudged at the quarter pole maintaining a narrow
advantage up front inside, was collared with rivals on each side in the two path with a furlong to go, gave way to the top two horses in deep stretch but
stubbornly dueled just losing out for third in the end. WITCH HAZEL stalked at the rear three wide outside foes on the first turn, could see the pack while
staying in range through the backstretch, was roused on the far turn keeping pace with the field and could not find more through the lane when the pace
quickened to reach contention crossing the finish.

Footnotes
BABBO rated kindly tracking between foes in the two path along the backstretch, inched closer to pressure the pace on the turn, bid for the lead two wide at
the top of the stretch, put away the frontrunner at the eighth pole and opened up on rivals drawing away when crossing the finish line. DRESDEN ROW
settled in mid-pack with runners on either side at the half, began to edge closer running around the turn, was in range of the leaders in the two path at the
top of the lane, shifted out in three wide for clear room nearing the furlong marker driving to the wire and closed belatedly to get up for second money.
WAGNER was snuggled behind the frontrunner on the rail through the backside, continued sitting comfortably on the rail waiting to move through the turn,
angled out for the drive in the three path looming the threat, finished up with intent in deep stretch but was outlicked late for the place share. ROCK TO
FAME cleared to the rail on the lead with five furlongs to go, set the pace under a narrow advantage hounded outside running around the bend, was collared
outside by the winner turning for home, fought on for a while and faded on the fence for hold for a minor role. LOGISTICS tracked three wide in the middle of
the pack down the backstretch, kept pace with challengers three wide run throughout the turn, was in with a chance for a minor share at the top of the lane,
was forced out in the four path bumping outside horse nearing the furlong marker and finished up mildly to the wire. BEYOND ADVERSITY trailed the field
inside in the early going, was scrubbed for more run, improving on the fence with three furlongs remaining and finished with mild interest to pass tiring foe in
deep stretch. MATICULANT tracked three wide outside down the backstretch, prompted the pace hounding the leader three wide on the turn, began to
weaken in the four path turning for home, could not quicken with others starting a rally in upper stretch, was bumped by inside rival nearing the eighth pole
and faltered to the wire. FAST AND READY stalked near the rear four deep between rivals down the back straight, travelled four wide running on the turn
while losing position and could not get interested in the stretch run to be a factor at the finish. MYRA'S BOY settled near the rear five deep outside foes
down the backside, could not get involved running five wide through the turn and showed little driving to the finish.

still in the three path, raced in tight quarters while launching a bid entering the stretch and kicked clear. HUNT MASTER raced in the two path early, tracked
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four path and chased on from there. PERFECT CRIME raced in the four path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a bid from the three and four path coming around the far turn and
improved position in the stretch. PALIO raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the
second turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) saved ground early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle
from the rail around the far turn and weakened in late stretch. READY SHAKESPEARE raced at the back of the pack in the three path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, navigated the far bend from the two path and made no bid. SILENT MIRACLE raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on
the outside up the backstretch and around the far bend and faded in the final furlong. BEAU GUEST saved ground around the first bend, stalked the leader

TOUCH'N RIDE tracked three wide between rivals in the early stages, rated kindly in the second flight between foes down the backstretch, waited for room
behind the contesting trio at the half mile marker, found a seam four wide at the top of the stretch, bid for the lead outside while being pushed out by the
inside leader nearing the eighth pole and determinedly battled to the finish, prevailing in a photo. ELYSIAN FIELD travelled in mid-pack outside horses in the
beginning, improved galloping outside horses getting a better position down the backside, crept closer to the leaders at the half, was coaxed for more,
quickly circled around foes three eighths from the prize, took control in the four path straightening out to the wire, drifted out under left hand urging in
mid-stretch, battled stubbornly to the finish and just missed the nod at the line. TWOWAYCROSSING was allowed to settle close to the rear in the early
stages, began to rally progressing around foes at the half mile marker, found another gear when urged left handed three furlongs from the finish, was
pushed out to the eight path turning for home, exchanged bumps with inside rival in upper stretch and offered a strong closing finish to win the duel for third
money. PHILIP MY DEAR stumbled on the break, stalked at the back of the pack ahead of one runner down the backstretch, saved ground starting a run in
the two path with three furlongs to go, angled out to the eight path finding clear running room three sixteenths from home and showed good late energy to
close in for a minor role in the end. TITO'S CALLING stalked near the rear saving ground down the backstretch, waited in hand behind runners on the fence
through the far turn, shifted out three wide weaving through traffic with five sixteenths to run, angled seven wide for the drive, exchanged bumps with outside
challenger in upper stretch, rallied in the four path at the furlong marker to be in the mix for a small piece of the prize and faded on the rail in deep stretch.
WICKENHEISER travelled three wide outside rivals in the four flight down the backside, put in a strong move around runners three wide at the half to be in
with a chance for a share in the five path at the top of the lane, could not sustain her run and faded some at the furlong marker. KAUKOKAIPUU tracked the
front two on the rail in the beginning, had a good spot nestled on the fence behind the leaders down the back straight away, was nudged to keep pace with
the co-leaders at the half, could not match strides with rivals at the quarter pole and levelled out in the final eighth. BRITISH ARTILLERY was unhurried
trailing the field through the first mile, began to lengthen stride catching up to the pack with three furlongs to run, swung out widest with momentum in the
eight path for the drive to the wire, was in the range for a small award in mid-stretch but stalled at the furlong marker. TIBURON settled in mid-pack with
horses on either side down the backstretch, was hard ridden for more run while losing ground to rivals on the far turn and resurged to pass weary runners in
the last sixteenth. SAMMY STONE was squeezed on the break, stalked between horses in the fourth flight down the backside, was urged but could not go
on with quickening rivals on either side four furlongs from the wire and showed mild interest running one paced through the lane. SIMCOE travelled in the
third flight midfield on the rail down the straight, was roused making little headway on the final turn and could not get involved driving to the finish line.
HEMLO GOLD took this field running inside through the first turn, continued to dictate terms setting an honest pace down the backstretch, came under a
ride clinging to the lead with four furlongs to run, was swallowed up by closing in rivals at the top of the lane and retreated on the rail in upper stretch.
PARAMOUNT PRINCE broke outwards to begin, prompted the pace outside early on, was content to sit off just outside the pacesetter down the backside,
inched closer bobbing heads for the lead between foes with a half mile from the line, fought on in the two path in upper stretch and emptied out by
mid-stretch. MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU broke in at the start, tracked outside in the beginning, took closer order to the front three deep down the back straight
outside rivals, forced the issue three wide at the half, could not find more to keep up with others at the quarter pole and backed away in the five path in
upper stretch. RCOF #12 ELYSIAN FIELD AGAINST #11 TOUCH N RIDE FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED

WINSTON BLUE raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming
around the far turn, dueled in the stretch and got up for the win. COLONEL MUSTARD saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, challenged from the rail coming around the far bend, dueled in the lane and narrowly missed. RAPPER ZAPPER saved ground around the first
bend, settled at the back of the pack from there, swung out to the four and five path coming around the second turn, launched a bid passing the quarter pole
and gained ground steadily to the wire. QUIET INTENT stalked the leader between horses through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the
three path and gained ground between horses late. JIM'S HOPE raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack on the outside, came around the far bend in the four path and improved position in the lane. MAGNIFICENT MARIO raced in the three path early,
tracked the pace setter between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around far bend and finished evenly. POSTURING
tracked the leader on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and was outkicked in the
stretch. SHAMATEUR raced in the two path through the opening stages, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far
turn and weakened in the lane. LESLIE CHOW raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the second bend in the
four path and never threatened. QUIET SUNDAY hit the gate hard leaving it, trailed well behind the field on the rail around the first turn and up the
backstretch, made up some ground while racing in the two path around the far turn and made no bid. SIR SAMUEL saved ground early, settled in the middle
of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the three path and faded in the lane. SOUPER SUNSHINE hit the
gate leaving it, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the second
bend and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SUPER HEADLINE brushed the inside rival on the break, was allowed to settle near the rear on the rail, started to pick up horses outside at the half mile
marker, continued with momentum reaching for ground three wide at the quarter pole and was full of run in the five path through the stretch outside foes to
get up for the well timed late rally. FOUR K FORCE set the fast pace on the rail in the first turn, pressed the issue inside down the back straight, was reined
back, angling outside under a ride gaining at the quarter pole, poked his head in front with a sixteenth from home but could not hold off the late charge by
the winner and was caught at the wire. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE settled in midfield on the rail down the back straight, roused three furlongs out, starting to
rally in the five path straightening out for the drive, closed in on the leaders at the eighth pole, was no match for the winner surging by on the outside late but
did finish up to capture third at the line. HARDWARE GAP brushed outside foe on the start, press the quick pace in the first turn, took control outside setting
swift fractions at the half, was asking for the wire up front at the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch. BENLION travelled alone in the middle of the pack
in the third flight down the backside, closed in on the rail three eighths from the finish, was gaining steadily on the leaders with a furlong to go, lost path in
deep stretch, had to be steadied and could not recover to threaten in the end. GIANT ONE reared at the start spotting the field many lengths in the early
going, caught up to the pack with three furlongs remaining and finished up strongly to be involved at the finish for a share in a solid run considering the
circumstances. AIR FORCE RESERVE travelled in mid-pack three wide outside runners at the half, commenced a rally around horses three furlongs from
the wire, was in range of the tiring leaders at the top of the lane, checked while coming up to horses at the seventy yard pole and could not recover in time
to be a threat. YORKVILLE watched the top two through the backstretch, began to reel in the contesting twosome on the far turn, was in the hunt at the top
of the stretch outside but emptied out in the final furlong. FOREST STAR stalked on the rail near the rear in a spread out field, could not keep pace running
on the fence throughout the final turn and ran on willingly through the stretch gaining on the leaders but not improving position at the finish.
COLLABORATIVE tracked the top two on the rail into the first turn, was content to be well behind watching the dueling leaders down the backside, asked for
more run on the fence three furlongs from the prize, offered little response and backed away on the fence through the far turn. STEWARDS INQUIRY
REGARDING THE START RESULTED IN #3 GIANT ONE WAS DEEMED TO HAVE RECEIVED AN UNFAIR START AND FULL MUTUEL REFUND.
RCOF #9 BENLION AGAINST #1 FOUR K FORCE FOR INTERFERNCE IN THE STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED
