Footnotes
DESANTIS raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over nearing the eighth pole and pulled away under urging. RUNNIN JOKE controlled the pace
for three quarters and weakened. OMERTA CODE dropped far behind inside then showed some late energy. SALTIN' THE RIM settled inside pair of
leaders and continued willingly to the finish. LIBERTY RUNNER saved ground well behind and was never a factor. KANE trailed to the stretch then caught
fading rivals. BOINTHEBACK chased inside briefly then gave way readily. DON'T BLAME FREDDY bobbled at the break, rushed up wide then stopped.

Footnotes
CRYPT settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch then edged away through the final eighth under strong urging. HURRICANE HIGHWAY
trailed far behind inside then closed with a rush too late. DIESEL alternated for the advantage outside and continued gamely to the wire. SATCHEL DE
RITCHES dueled along the inside then weakened slightly in the final furlong. PLAMEN chased four wide down the backstretch and lacked a solid bid.
ABUELO NUNO was urged just off the dueling leaders then stopped abruptly. HOPE FOR GOLD raced off the pace outside and gave way readily.

Footnotes
DIXIE GROOVE far behind early, advanced inside, took over into the stretch and extended her advantage to the finish. TRUE PHENOMENON prompted
the pacesetter outside, bid clear on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. JSK LUCKY'S PUSHPA dropped back early then moved wide to easily
gain the show. THENDARA'S LOST was urged close up for three quarters then faltered. ONLY GIRL saved ground off the pace early and was never a
factor. MAGNOLIA ROAD dropped back early and was always outrun. BIONIC KAT hustled to a clear lead for half a mile then stopped. QUEEN ROCKET
raced off the leaders and gave way readily. OUR SELF ALONE broke awkwardly then trailed far behind losing contact with her field.

leaders, angled wide in the stretch and rallied. SIZZLING ROMA vied three wide for half a mile and yielded. BOSS CARA set a pressured pace inside to the
stretch and faltered. GAVICHI trailed early then passed rivals without menacing. FRANKLY MY DEAR dueled between rivals in the two path and faded after
half a mile. ROSE LEGACY was squeezed back early then never involved.

Footnotes
SUGAR SMILE lacked speed, advanced inside, angled out in the lane, offered a late surge to get up in time. DIALHERUP dueled along the inside, shook
loose in midstretch, continued gamely but was nailed nearing the wire. NAIL POLISH raced in close pursuit of the dueling pacesetters and continued
gamely. SHETALKSTOMUCH lacked speed inside, swung wide on the turn and into the stretch rallying. DANCING ON MY OWN broke slowest, moved in
the two path and was no threat. DENALI RAE dueled outside to the stretch and weakened. AVATAL HERO dropped back very wide and was never in
contention. RUNNIN REDBIRD trailed for half a mile then caught fading rivals. ANGELAS PARTY GIRL was urged close up outside then began faltering on
the turn. SWEET HEIDELBERG flashed speed outside then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
POWWA OF LOVE outrun early, advanced inside, angled out rallying into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her task. ROLLS ROYCE JOYCE
quickly took control inside, shook loose on the turn but proved no match for the winner. TILSA broke slowly and trailed, advanced very wide with a late rush.
SHINY PENNY raced off the leaders very wide and continued well. QUEEN CADENCE saved ground, made a brief bid inside then faltered. PONTIFFANY
crowded between rivals after the start and failed to threaten. FAST INTENTIONS lagged far behind then caught tiring rivals. JET FORCE prompted the pace
three wide then began fading on the turn. BABY FADE forced the pace four wide down the the backstretch and gave way. SEVEN YEARS LATER flashed
speed in the two path and stopped abruptly.
