Footnotes
WICCA WISDOM set the pace while in the two path into the far turn, cleared in mid-turn, widened into the lane then was ridden out while slowly extending
the lead. OCELIA saved ground throughout while never far back, cut the corner into the lane to get nearest the winner then stayed on well to be clear for the
place spot while not a threat to the top one. FREDERICIA trailed into the far turn while off the inside, advanced from the four path through the turn, came
into the lane from the six path and moved up while not a threat. ELUSIVE JUSTICE tracked the pace while along the inside through the far turn then
weakened after coming off the rail into the lane. COLUMN stalked the winner from the three path down the backstretch, moved to press two wide into the far
turn, began to lose momentum after midturn then was empty turning into the lane. BLOODY MARY MORNIN settled early, bid three wide into the far turn
and was done approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MANTA REY was unhurried while racing between rivals through the far turn, was asked for more nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled into the five path
when gaining momentum, continued on with good energy under left-handed urging and just got up. STUD LOVIN chased the pace from the three path into
the turn, moved with another to gain the lead in upper lane, dueled with that one while in the five path through the lane, inched away inside the sixteenth
pole then was caught at the wire. BALSA chased the pace from the two path through the turn, gained the lead with another into the lane, dueled from the
four path through the lane, yielded to the runner-up and finished well clear of the others. FIRST CROWNED sprinted clear at once, remained on the lead
into mid-turn, was no match for the top ones but stayed on to be clear of the others. FIRE BABY was three wide through the turn, was asked for more in late
turn then lacked a response. WILL TAKE CASH stepped in at the start at was steadied, raced near the inside into the turn then settled back.

Footnotes
SWEET SASSY PANTS moved to a clear lead before the first call, was ridden confidently into the lane, asked for more approaching the sixteenth pole then
held clear to the the wire while under a drive. SALTY SUE was unhurried while off the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then
rallied for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. ANTE ANGEL raced in the four path through the turn and into the lane when never far back, bid
straightening in the lane, had aim on the top ones with an eighth to go then could not gain further. JANE'S A DIVA chased the winner from the three path
through the turn and into the lane, was well placed after straightening in the lane then weakened. ABRA ABRA was unhurried while in the two path through
the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and showed late interest while not a menace. SANTIVA DIVA chased the pace along the inside through the
turn and into the lane then faded. KNOTTY BLONDE was shut off at the start and trailed the field by four lengths, raced in the two path through the turn and
and was never in it. TAPRIZE ME raced along the inside through the turn and was done nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
ARDIS set the pace on a clear lead through the turn while in the two path, continued near the inside into the lane while widening her advantage then held to
the wire. FOREVER PINK chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, continued with aim on the top one to the wire, could not gain on that
one and settled for second best. SHANGHAI EXPRESS raced in the three or four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the
four path and stayed on to be up for the show spot. JURADICIAL chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the
top ones and lost the show spot late. SPLASH OF TONIC was in the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, continued in the four path through the
lane and never factored. MIZZTIFY DOLL saved ground to no avail. ICEY ANGEL saved ground and tired. OUT OF PROMISES was outrun while in the four
path.

FACE VALUE chased the three rival duel through the far turn, tipped into the four path for the drive, made the lead inside the eighth pole then drove clear.
HUMBLE WARRIOR vied for the lead three wide throughout, dueled with the winner inside the eighth pole, could not keep up with that one and was all out
to save the place spot. VINTAGE VINYL was in the four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and was gaining late to just miss the
place spot. J'S NAUGHTY BOY was in the four path through the far turn, came into the lane from the six path, gained momentum quickly inside the
sixteenth pole and was closing in. MIDNIGHT CHANNEL saved ground through the turn, angled into the four path for the drive and was gaining to the wire.
SOME R BLESSED saved ground throughout and needed more. BAYOU CHROME raced along the inside through the turn and offered some gain.
LOADEMUPJUSTICE vied for the lead with two others throughout then gave way inside the eighth pole. HOME RUN HANK pressed the pace from between
rivals through the far turn then faded. TIZ A BEAST raced in the four path throughout and lacked a response. BREAKOUT STAR raced in the four path
through the turn, angled into the nine path and never was a menace. BROKEN JUSTICE never a factor while off the rail throughout.
