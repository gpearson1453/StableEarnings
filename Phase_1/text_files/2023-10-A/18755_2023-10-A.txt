outside of DOOQ in deep stretch and was up in the final strides for the win. DOOQ dueled inside for the lead, dueled with PASCHAL MOON on the

off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, closed mildly and got up for fourth. FAST STUDY raced off the pace inside,
saved ground on the far turn and lacked a rally on the rail in the stretch. BOOYAH raced three wide off the pace, chased on the far turn, came four wide into
the stretch and lacked a rally. PASCHAL MOON dueled two wide for command, dueled on the backside, chased on the far turn and faded.

start, steadied soon after, raced off the pace with an inside trip and did not factor. FIFTH ELEMENT was outrun.

Footnotes
LEO MONTE set the pace on the inside while being pushed along, shook free midway on the backside, showed the way into the stretch, responded when
roused, dug in gamely inside and held well late to prevail. HERE COMES BILLY stumbled at the start, bumped a rival and still broke on top, tracked the
pace, chased inside on the far turn, angled out, rallied outside of LEO MONTE in the final furlong and dug in gamely to the finish. INDIANTOWN raced two
wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn, commenced a late rally and was along for the show spot. DUQUESNE was off a bit slow, raced off the
pace with an inside trip, rallied mildly in the lane, then was outkicked for third. I'M ON FIRE raced off the pace inside, chased three wide on the far turn and
finished evenly in the lane. WORD FOR WORD was bumped and steadied at the start, raced off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally.
STEEL DRIVIN MAN hopped and was steadied at the start, raced off the pace and failed to threaten. CASH KID steadied at the start, outrun early and
passed tired ones. PAL raced two wide off the pace, between rivals on the far turn and faded. PERSPICACIOUS pressed the pace, then chased the winner
and gave way on the far turn.

JESTERS HONOR set the pace on the inside racing with a short lead, dueled with ONE TIME WILLARD on the far turn, responded when roused, dug in
gamely inside in the stretch drive and determinedly held off the runner up. ONE TIME WILLARD was a bit fractious in the gate, stalked close up two wide,
bid two wide on the far turn, dug in gamely outside of the winner in the stretch drive and came up second best. GROUCH raced off the pace inside, between
rivals into the stretch, rallied mildly and dug in late to earn the show spot. IRISH RILL tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and was outfinished for
third. WOLFE 'N HAWKE was a bit fractious in the gate, settled two wide off the pace, lacked a rally and faded in the lane.
