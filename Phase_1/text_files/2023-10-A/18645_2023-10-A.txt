Footnotes
ACE NINE NINE assumed the early lead, saved ground on the turn then steadily drew away under brisk urging. FORECLOSURE , four deep around the
turn, offered a mild rally outside horses. UNEQUIVOCAL , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, angled out in upper stretch, chased the
winner and weakened. CAPTAIN CARDO bore in at the break, worked between horses on the turn, eased out for the drive and passed tired foes. EKATI'S
VERVE , between horses around the turn, moved to the six path in upper stretch and came up empty. FERMAT , outside the winner around the turn,
weakened through the stretch. CARIBBEAN (AUS) , pinched back leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide and was outrun. BLAMEITONTHEFUN
, three wide on the turn, stalked the pace to the stretch then gave way. SPECTRIER bore out leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn
and weakened. BAD GUY , unhurried, was no factor. JASONTAKESLONG raced well off the rail throughout and gave way.

Footnotes
FEATHERS (IRE) relaxed three wide in a stalking spot, edged up outside foes nearing the far turn bid in hand to engage the leader nearing the lane,
asserted herself and took command soon after, powered away under right handed asks in mid stretch then kept on eagerly under steady encouragement.
INSTINCTIVE settled in mid pack while off the inside, advanced three wide into the lane, emerged as the closest pursuer in mid stretch, kept on willingly and
held down the place. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT rated towards the rail while not too far back, eased out near the five sixteenths, steadied in traffic in upper
stretch, regrouped to make progress between runners near the sixteenth pole and churned on. CONGRESS HALL settled off the inside, moved up some
three deep into the far turn, came four wide with a run into the lane and kept on with interest. BRUMMAGEM , away last after breaking outward,
straightened and settled off the pace, angled six wide into the lane and closed steadily. BRAMBLE BUSH was rated back after an alert break, saved ground
while in hand, lacked room behind rivals nearing mid stretch then regrouped to keep on between foes. RED WIND rated close up while saving ground,
awaited room near the three eighths, steadied when lacking some room in upper stretch, moved between runners past mid stretch, angled in and continued
with effort. CUPIDS DREAM settled off the rail, raced between rivals leaving the far turn, shifted out four to five wide for the drive but lacked a solid bid.
BEAUTIFUL STAR prompted the pace between rivals, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. ELEGANT TASTE went clear early, set the pace
towards the rail, was taken on approaching the stretch, could not resist the winner soon into the lane, kept on with effort to mid stretch then faded.

Footnotes
BANDONARUN broke inward and bumped with LIGHTRESS, quickly corrected and went clear, dropped in towards the rail and set a rated pace, responded
when asked near the three sixteenths and opened up, wandered outward leaving the furlong grounds, was corrected with right handed encouragement and
continued with intent to the finish. ANGEL ART rated close up while to the inside of a pair of rivals, steadied off heels nearing the turn, regrouped and
tracked inside, eased out three wide to take aim into the lane, came under pressure past the quarter pole, failed to make inroads past the furlong grounds
but continued with good energy to preserve the place. LIGHTRESS , bumped leaving the gate, recovered and edged up behind a trio of runners to be close,
steadied briefly near the turn, advanced towards the inside in mid stretch, chased and flattened out. AWESOME JAZZ , sluggish while off the rail, was under
asking four wide nearing the lane, shifted out wider for the final three sixteenths and kept on with interest. MEETMEATTHEBEACH broke inward bumping
WISE AND ELEGANT, straightened and rated in the clear early on, raced between runners leaving the far turn, crept closer into the lane, dropped in past
mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. WISE AND ELEGANT , bumped at the start, was taken back while saving ground, steadied when attempting to
edge up into the turn, remained inside and in hand mid turn, lacked some room in upper stretch, eased out and had some late action between foes.
BETCHA BY GOLLY , four wide outside runner stalking the pace, chased three deep mid turn, came a bit wider for the drive, lacked a kick near mid stretch
and faded. ZOINNOCENT (IRE) broke slowly, checked when making an inside move nearing the turn, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty.
SASSY ANNIE , between rivals chasing the pace, tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GRAND WISER prompted the pace in the three path between horses down the backstretch, remained three wide around the turn, secured command in
upper stretch and was kept under pressure in the drive. FREE SQUARE , four deep around the turn, chased the pace in a game effort. CHARGE TO
VICTORY bore in at the break brushing the inside of his starting gate stall, hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, was in hand
when caught in a pocket in mid stretch, altered course to the outside near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. GOODLUCKCHUCK hugged the inner
rail, set a pressured pace to upper stretch then gradually weakened. PIT STOP MAN , four wide on the turn, failed to menace. MOCEPHUS lacked speed,
raced between horses down the backstretch, was three wide on the turn and failed to be a factor. AEQUOR was outrun. NOBLE JON prompted the early
pace between horses, failed to keep up on the turn then faltered.

Footnotes
CIRCLE HOME , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground early on, eased out and raced between rivals into the far turn, angled out under pressure
leaving the five sixteenths, shifted out to be five to six wide in upper stretch, responded to right handed asks in mid stretch, closed relentlessly outside rivals,
took command late and was edging away at the wire. LIFELOVENLAUGHTER drafted in to a good spot into the first turn, rated kindly while saving ground
then edged up into the far turn, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, angled out soon into the lane to set her sights on the leader, ranged up and
then engaged that one near the sixteenth marker, dueled, took a slim lead late, kept on but failed to contain the winner's charge. CUT FROM CLASS vied
inside MONEY'S WORTH into the first turn, rated back off that one then angled out to stalk, moved up to prompt the pace after a half mile, gave hard chase
as MONEY'S WORTH got away leaving the three eighths, shifted out with pursuit in mid stretch and continued with effort. MONEY'S WORTH sparred
outside CUT FROM CLASS then cleared nearing the three quarter pole, set a rated pace towards the inside, turned away an initial threat leaving the far
turn, remained clear under a pressure past mid stretch, drifted then was collared a sixteenth out, battled for a bit then faded late. NAVAL EMPIRE , fractious
in the gate, came away in decent order then drafted back, angled off the rail into the first turn, advanced four wide under coaxing into the lane, chased past
mid stretch but came up empty in the final sixteenth. NOBLE BELIEF , in hand saving ground, gained along the rail into the lane, lacked a punch past mid
stretch and weakened. CUSH EFFECT settled off the pace and off the inside, raced three deep into the far turn, drifted in nearing mid stretch and lacked a
finish. ISLAND PHILO was outrun.

Footnotes
SUPER RENEE , a forward factor along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, was shuffled back entering the turn, eased out to the two path approaching
the stretch, swept to command outside SWEE SHUGS inside the eighth pole and eagerly drew out. BRZINA , in the three path between horses prompting
the pace down the backstretch, moved to the two path leaving the turn, angled outside SWEET SHUGS near the sixteenth pole and was up for the place.
SWEET SHUGS bore in leaving the starting gate, sprinted clear on the turn, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened late. HOW SWEET SHE IS ,
bumped by SWEET SHUGS leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. WINKED , rated back
from between horses leaving the backstretch, swung to the five path approaching the stretch and weakened. BREEZY CONNECTION , no factor, floated to
the six path leaving the turn. DESERT DALLIANCE was outrun. WRIGHT UP FRONT , four deep chasing the pace down the backstretch, gave way in the
drive.

Footnotes
BAIL OUT , three wide and in range, took closer order between runners around the final turn, altered in towards the rail and bid inside the embattled leaders
leaving the furlong grounds, struck the top heading to the sixteenth marker and drew clear under a drive. SIGMUND stumbled at the break, quickly
recovered and prompted the pace in hand while about two wide, was given his cue past the five sixteenths and bid between foes into the lane, sparred
under pressure past mid stretch, gained a slim advantage leaving the eighth pole, could not quite kick on with the winner but stayed well to save the place.
LIGHTNING LAD , off the pace saving ground while unhurried, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four to five wide into the stretch and closed steadily
outside rivals. LAW OF THE JUNGLE , three wide stalking the pace, moved up and bid three deep nearing the stretch, battled outside rivals leaving mid
stretch then gave way grudgingly. DRUM AND DRUMMER , keen to go, eagerly cleared then set a rated pace towards the rail, met outside bids nearing the
stretch, clung to a slim lead dueling in mid stretch then faded very late. NEUTRAL saved ground, came under a ride near the five sixteenths, angled out but
lacked a solid run. MALIBU RUMBLE , off the pace and off the inside, edged up four deep around the far turn, failed to sustain into the lane and gave way.
STORMY FIRE stalked inside, was put to a ride near the five sixteenths to maintain position, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened. MOON SIGN
steadied early, raced two wide between rivals and gave way. VOTETHEMALLOUT lagged off the pace, was under a ride leaving the far turn but failed to
respond.
