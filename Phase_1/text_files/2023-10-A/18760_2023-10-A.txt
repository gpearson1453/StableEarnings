Footnotes
ANTENNA broke very fast and went straight to the front, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for
her best in upper stretch, battled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. EXTRA DIRTY was last to commence then
had her path taken, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the four then three path on the turn, fought outside the winner under a drive into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. BY THE GLASS moved in while settling off the pace, passed the nine-sixteenths under urging,
angled from the rail to the three path on the turn, pursued the top two in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. CELESTIAL
EXPRESS was fanned out early, settled on the far outside, came under urging near the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide on the turn and also lacked
the needed kick. UNION BELLE climbed early then settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. DAISY'S ANGEL was
fanned out early, settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and came up empty. ALTHENA was carried out
early, pressed the pace on the outside, vied three then two wide on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired.

POPPY'S PRIDE broke out at the start, showed speed while in hand, set the pace with company to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked
in the three path into upper stretch, responded well when put to the crop outside the furlong marker and held while drifting out some in the drive. TWO
THIRTY FIVE was well placed just off the pace, angled from the two path to the four path on the turn, drifted out some while pursuing the winner in the
stretch and finished willingly for the place. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY was hustled from the gate then coaxed along on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
was driven five into the stretch, gained in the final furlong, needed some extra right-rein pressure in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and got up for the show.
BEACHWALKER was urged along at the rear, rounded most the turn in the two path, shifted three then four wide late on that bend, swung six wide into
upper stretch and improved position with late energy but missed the show. RYAN'S CAT settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and
failed to rally. CHARGING AERO was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn and came up empty. QUICKFLASH was hustled from the
gate, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn and tired. LIFE AND LIGHT broke a step slow, settled near the back, angled out
around the nine-sixteenths, went five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor.
