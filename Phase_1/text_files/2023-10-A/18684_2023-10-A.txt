Footnotes
ROJO PEQUENO had good speed and dueled to the backstretch, inched away to the second turn, turned back SHILSHOLE BAY into the stretch and held
gamely. SHILSHOLE BAY tracked the pace to the second turn, made a run outside the winner to briefly loom a threat into the stretch but was outfinished in
the drive. SHOT OF BRANDY stalked the leaders early, was three wide on the second turn and lacked a closing response. RALLIFIED fanned four wide to
the backstretch, chased to the second turn then weakened. TREASURE MESA had no speed and was never a threat. SODA SPRINGS hustled early,
dueled to the backstretch then gradually gave way.

OUR HY ROLLER pressed the pace two wide, rallied to get on terms into the stretch then battled gamely to edge away. CASH'S CAT set the pace, resisted
the winner to the stretch then was bested. COLTON'S TIGER chased the top two, was asked three wide to the stretch then was outfinished and just got the
nod for third. NEATAPAR had no speed, swung out four wide while rallying on the far turn then finished with interest. MR MAKUNOUCHI broke slow then
saved ground to no avail. SAINT HELEN was five wide throughout and not a threat. POCO DIABLO ROJO had brief speed while four wide but tired after a
half mile.

V BUCKS broke clean an set the pace, saved ground to the stretch then dug in determinedly to hold. SPANISH CHANNEL prompted the winner, bid two
wide to the stretch then closed steadily but too late. FANTASTIC SECRET tracked the leaders three wide early, bid two wide to the stretch but could not
make an impact. SMILING SALSA drifted inward early crowding ANTECEDENCE, chased the pace from the rail for five furlongs then came up empty.
SWEET MEG had no speed, also chased the leaders but saved ground to no avail. FIRE DIAMONDS broke a bit slow, had no speed and was not a factor.
ANTECEDENCE was crowded by SMILING SALSA early and took up then tried to bolt the first turn, was under strong restraint and dropped back to last
then was outrun. WARNING SOUND had no speed and gave way after a half mile. The jockey on ANTECEDENCE lodged an objection against the rider of
SMILING SALSA for alleged interference soon after the start but the stewards made no change to the order of finish.

stumbled at the start, had no speed, rallied three wide to the stretch then closed willingly but missed. BETHEL RIDGE tracked the pace from the rail, had
room but could not get through into the final bend then shifted out for room and closed willingly but too late. CONFIDENCE BUILDER had no speed, was
three or four wide but came up empty in the drive. RED NOVA hustled to show speed for a half mile but gave way thereafter. FIRE ESCAPE was four wide

Footnotes
TIZ INDY prompted the pace early, bid two wide to the stretch then closed willingly and was along in time. SPEEDY TOM hustled to the front, set the pace
from the rail to the stretch, responded but could not stall the winner. BOB'S SNIPER chased the pace for a half, was fanned four wide to the stretch and was
gaining steadily but too late. XTRAFINE XTINA stalked the pace for three furlongs, bid three wide to loom a threat on the second turn then was outfinished
in the drive. SIR LAUGHALOT had no speed, was two then three wide and closed belatedly. SKEESIX got outsprnted early, tried to rally three deep but
came up empty. CAPITAL EXPENSE hesitated then dropped his head when the gates opened, came out about eight lengths last and did not recover.
DIAMOND WILLOW had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
HAKUNUI flashed the best speed, set all the pace, edged away on the second turn then drew clear in the drive. MOLAF stalked the winner from the rail to
the stretch then could make no headway but held second. ANTICIPATED was outsprinted to the backstretch, came two wide to the stretch then lacked a
closing bid. FOYT tracked the pace, asked for speed three wide nearing the second turn but finished evenly. PACKRAT BRANT had no speed, was off the
rail to the stretch and did not threaten. SCRATCH ME had no speed and raced very wide throughout. THE THIRD RING saved ground to no avail.
MIDNIGHT DADDY had brief speed then lugged out on the backstretch and stopped after a half mile.
