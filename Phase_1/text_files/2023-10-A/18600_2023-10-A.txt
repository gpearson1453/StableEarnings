Footnotes
DRAMA CRITIC three wide pressing pace to far turn, took over in the stretch and drove clear under stout handling throughout. RED CHEEKS hustled to the
front, well handled to far turn, no match held place spot. UNUSUAL ACTIVITY saved ground while evenly throughout for the show spot. LIAMS LAD lost
best chance when rearing and lunging at the start and only improved position. SOUTHERN BREEZE rushed into first turn outside to go evenly with no late
kick. MUD PUDDLE dueled to far turn with nothing left and dropped back. RAGING WHIRLWIND never menaced throughout. Race was hand timed due to
a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

ROLO BOLO shoed speed to front, led to half, chased in the stretch between foes and fought on gamely for the nod at the wire under stout handling.
IMAGE OF LOVE chased pace to the stretch, dug in gamely outside to widen in the lane and just missed.at the wire in a three way photo. UNREGRETTED
was extremely rowdy prerace from the paddock with a sluggish start, rushed and led in the stretch, cleared in the final furlong but nailed at the wire with a
good effort. CAUSE IMA ROSE broke slow, raced back to the stretch and only closed the gap late from inside. SKI SLOPE could not keep up and faded
back readily from the turn.

Footnotes
MORNIN' BOSS quick from the gate, outsprinted to the front, chased leader to deep stretch, roused to go clear late under good handling to the wire.
CRYSTAL SNOW had an awkward start from the gate with a lunge, rallied outside to the turn and came running on for place with a good effort. MOTOWN
MISCHIEF good position to the turn, rallied along to close gap for show. WHISKEY DIAMOND sprinted clear from the gate crossed over quickly to the rail,
stayed to deep stretch but gave in readily in the final furlong for show spot. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL no speed to the turn, rallied in the drive to improve late.
MS. THE LAW raced back early with a slight bobble to the turn. BLEST LIFE raced back with trouble into turn, shuffled back with no kick. MISS EASY slow
from the gate and never menaced throughout. MY HEAD HURTS through early and dropped back readily. BALI DOVE (FR) close up early on inside,
troubled into the turn, checked back hard and lost all chance while outrun thereafter. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf
races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm
