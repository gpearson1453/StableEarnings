stretch and found his best stride late in the four path. IT'S OFFICIAL reared at the start, moved up outside rivals on the turn then was used up.

GONE IN A FLASH prompted the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead nearing the far turn, set the balance of the pace and proved best under left
handed urging while fully extended. K KID chased the winner two wide and was steadily cutting into that one's advantage late. MASTER OF WAR vied for
the lead along the inside into the far turn, dropped back, angled outside the top pair in upper stretch and came on again late. DISTORTED LIMITS failed to
menace. LEMON DROP SHOT unhurried early, moved up three wide into the far turn, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then came up empty.
HENRY THE CAT away alertly, set the pace along the inside for nearly five and one half furlongs, kept on into the stretch then gave way late.

determinedly in the five path through the stretch and got up for second. SIMPLY VALID battled for the lead along the rail until deep stretch then was
outfinished. SUSIE'S KID chased the pace near the inside and failed to respond. RAISE THE PURSES was fractious in the gate and no threat. ZAKARIA
