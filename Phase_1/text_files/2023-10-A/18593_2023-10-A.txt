Footnotes
CAMBIASO tracked the leaders from a clear pocket down the backside, rallied turning for home while angling four wide, took command in upper stretch and
drew clear convincingly. SMALL SAILOR pressed the pace from three wide to the far turn, assumed command from tiring pacesetter nearing the quarter
pole, responded when engaged by the winner but could not go with that one and finished willingly as second best. CATEGORY TEN reserved from the pace
for the first half mile, rallied up the fence midway on the turn and made a steady gain down the lane. GENERATION prompted the pace from between
horses into the far turn, was set to an early drive midway on the bend and failed to respond when called upon finishing one-paced. LUCIOS ZORAN set a
pressured pace from the fence to the head of the lane and tired through the stretch. SUPER LIAISON trailed to the quarter pole and passed tired rivals in
the lane. MAJESTIC MR. JONES raced mid-pack early and steadily faded without posing a threat. GJALLARHORN was never a factor.

Footnotes
GOLDCREST stalked the pace down the backside from two wide, circled three wide in the turn to take command nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in
upper stretch and held on down the lane. WAVE SKIPPER unhurried early to be at the rear of the field for the first half mile, made a steady advance circling
four wide turning for home and finished well down the stretch. AZURA reserved off the pace along the fence near the rear of the pack to the far turn, split
rivals turning for home and closed through the lane. SAY CHEESE tracked the leaders from the fence to the far turn, was called upon midway on the bend
and failed to close ground. BUOY prompted the pace to the turn, had no response when called upon and weakened in the lane. GIADA set the pace to
midway on the final turn and flattened out. LT'S CHOICE was never a threat.

Footnotes
DERBY DATE pressed the pace to midway on the turn from two wide, took the lead at the quarter pole, dueled with the runner-up through the lane, was
bumped by CONDEMN at the sixteenth pole when that one drifted in, responded in kind, drifting out to exchange bumps to the wire in a determined drive
while refusing to be bullied. CONDEMN prompted the leaders from three wide through the turn, challenged the winner in upper stretch, drifted in to bump
the winner at the sixteenth pole, was bumped and carried out by the winner in an exchange of bumps inside the final hundred yards in clear retaliation by
DERBY DATE. SOARING BIRD well placed tracking the leaders from the rail in traffic and rallied through the lane to be gaining late. UNPREDICTABLE
BAY chased the leaders from between horses into the turn mounting an early bid and flattened out late in the drive. LEGIONNAIRE slow early to be at the
rear to the head of the stretch and finished well belatedly to be gaining late. COYOTE ROAD rated off the leaders while racing four wide through the turn
and lacked a closing response. TRASHTALKINYANKEE was never a threat. CHATTALOT flashed brief speed to be on the lead for the first quarter and
came up empty. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN REGARDING THE TOP PAIR AND THE RIDER OF CONDEMN
CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS FAILED TO CONDEMN DERBY DATE FOR HIS
ACTIONS DOWN THE LANE AND GRANTED HIM A REPRIEVE MAKING NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TOWN BARBER pressed the pace for the first three-eights, assumed command in the turn, opened a clear advantage in upper stretch and held all the
closers safe. PROTON SPIRIT reserved off the early pace, cut the corner turning for home and closed well through the lane to be gaining late up the fence.
EGYPTIAN KING unhurried early, circled four wide and made up ground late. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF stalked the pace from the rail and failed to gain on the
leaders. CHARTED was well placed when making an early bid from three wide and flattened out. CATCHEM IF YOU CAN flashed speed to be the leader
early, kept on through the turn and weakened late in the drive. MR. COMMANDER tracked the early pace and faded. CLASSY GHOST was never a factor.

Footnotes
HOMERUNHAPPY set a pressured pace down the backside, lost the lead in the turn, battled back to duel through the lane and kept finding more to edge
away in deep stretch in a game effort. PAYNTER'S CANVAS pressed the pace to the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, responded when the
winner battled back and dueled through the lane while conceding late and being a clear second best. FOREVER FRIENDS tracked the leader to upper
stretch and mounted a grinding rally through the lane. DO YA WANNA DANCE well placed along the fence and finished evenly without a rally. AMAZING
JUSTICE unhurried for the first half mile and showed some late interest with a mild bid. SILENT SONATA chased from three wide through the turn and
failed to gain ground. GOLDEN RAPPER was outrun.

DOMHNALL broke alertly to take the lead from the gate, set a pressured pace to the head of the lane, opened a clear lead and held sway through the drive.
MR INSENSITIVE tracked the pace down the backside, lost position briefly into the turn, and rallied late to be gaining at the wire. MO ANGELL pressed the
pace to the far turn, loomed through the turn and weakened coming home. COSMIC STARDUST unhurried for the first half mile and mounted a late rally in
the stretch. LEFT POCKET MONEY raced evenly in mid-pack failing to menace. TOTALITARIAN slow early to trail to the head of the lane and passed
weaker rivals down the stretch. THE MOTTO stalked the pace while well placed for three quarters and flattened out in the lane. GHOST BIKE chased the
leaders from wide down the backside and faded. SMILING STORMY made a move rallying through the turn to be prominent midway down the lane and tired
in the final going. REVS MEDAL was never a threat.

AJIC JAY settled in hand off the early pace, ranged up four wide in the turn to take control and pulled away. FOREVER BLESSED reserved off the leaders
for the first half mile, rallied three wide turning for home, angled to the rail in upper stretch and was gaining late in the lane. D' KITTEN unhurried in the early
going to be near the rear of the field, circled four wide turning for home and finished with a good belated rally. EMPIRE SUNRISE pressed the pace to the
turn, dropped out of the pace duel on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch. TRIP CHARGE slow early to be a the rear and passed weaker rivals
through the lane. TRYINFORJUSTICE stalked the pace to the turn, made a threatening bid turning for home and flattened out. LILMISS SASSYPANTS
dueled on the lead for a half and gave way. QUEEN D was never a threat.

Footnotes
TALKTOMEJUSTICE set a pressured pace the entire way, responded gamely to all challenges and kept finding more in a determined drive. JACK'S
SUMMER pressed the winner from two wide the entire trip, challenged at several points and could not get passed the winner in a good try. SECOND
EXCHANGE unhurried early on to race near the rear of the field most of the way, circled weakening rivals in the turn, angled in to the rail in mid-stretch and
mounted a belated inside rally. BRODY MO rated in mid-pack to the far turn and made a steady gain from three wide down the lane.
SHESACLEVERJUSTICE slow early to be the trailer to the top of the lane and showed good late interest closing down the middle of the track. PURELY
MINE well placed throughout tracking from the fence, made a bid in upper stretch to be prominent and was out-kicked down the lane. LITTLE GRAY
FLOWER caught four wide most of the trip and went evenly without making an impact. GIO'S BABY GIRL chased the leaders from three wide through the
final bend and stopped in the stretch. ALLABOUTTHEIMAGE raced five wide in the first turn and failed to menace. BICKERMENTS was never a factor.
