Footnotes
I'M YOUR CAPTAIN broke on top and was hustled early from outside, moved clear and angled in after a quarter mile then widened command under urging
in the lane. BRIANS WAY broke well then was settled back for two furlongs, progressed two wide on the bend, battled for second inside TRUIST in the
stretch and shook off the latter the final sixteenth. TRUIST was away slowly, advanced from outside to threaten three wide on the turn, fought for second in
the lane then began to wear down the last sixteenth. SENOR MIKE pressed the early pace, gained the rail into the bend, began to yield, angled to the
outside upper stretch and continued to fade. RA'DOM was prominent from inside, checked into the turn, angled out on the bend and had little to offer for the
drive.

Footnotes
GRAYHOP moved to the inside early on, angled out leaving the quarter pole, rallied four wide the last furlong, gradually lugged in once inside the final
sixteenth but took the lead with seventy yards to go. SPAN came off the rail with a half mile to go, was widest taking the bend, surged the last furlong, came
up short but caught DENNIS'S PRIDE for second. DENNIS'S PRIDE emerged with the advantage after the first sixteenth of a mile, moved clear on the turn,
lengthened command upper stretch, floated out slightly and began to wear down inside the final eighth. ITS MAMBO was hustled along to press DENNIS'S
PRIDE from just outside, did not keep up on the bend, moved clear for second upper stretch but also did not have enough left the last furlong. KRUELESS
prominent just outside ITS MAMBO, gave way after a half mile. BRUCE ATTACK reluctant to load, was away slowly once the race began, forwardly placed
from outside on the backstretch, angled in on the bend and had little to offer for the drive.

Footnotes
TORTUGA ISLAND stalked the early speed, went for the lead four wide on the bend, angled in some nearing the end of a half mile, took the advantage,
moved clear under mild urging upper stretch then continued to draw off while ridden out the last furlong. TOO MUCH TUESDAY pressed from between
rivals, was three wide into the turn, angled in behind TORTUGA ISLAND approaching the quarter pole, took over second inside the final eighth, moved clear
inside the last sixteenth and lasted for the place. BABAS GAL hesitated then broke awkwardly, progressed from outside, was three wide leaving the bend,
lodged a mild bid deep stretch and gained third. MOONSHINE MOLLY bumped with CASHMERE JUSTICE at the break, vied for the lead from inside,
edged ahead into the turn, was soon challenged by TORTUGA ISLAND, no match for that one when set down for the drive and began to wear down inside
the last furlong. RARE BEAUTY displayed early speed between horses but gave way with three furlong to go. CASHMERE JUSTICE bumped with
MOONSHINE MOLLY at the start, was a contender from inside for nearly two and a half furlongs then steadily faded. DUE TO AN UNSAFE RAIL
CONDITION, RACES FOUR THROUGH EIGHT WERE CANCELLED. ALL WAGERS EXCEPT A CONSOLATION DAILY DOUBLE FOR RACES THREE
AND FOUR, AS WELL AS A CONSOLATION PICK 3 FOR RACES TWO, THREE AND FOUR, WERE REFUNDED.
