stretch was up for show. LITTLE FIRE had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more.
REMEMBEROLDTYMES stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. EASY ACCESS

moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best. BEYOND BORDERS was in mid pack and roused on the far turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. DE ONLY SOLUTION was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at
the top of the stretch had no late kick. UNION COLONEL was in range and a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to
fire. DOCTOR UPTOWN was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. LOQUACIOUS
was well back and saved ground on the far turn but was never in contention. W W SPRINGTIME set the pace but was headed on the far turn and dropped
back through the stretch.
