Footnotes
SWEET TEMPTATION stalked in the four path, bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole, took a clear lead approaching the quarter, and
extended her advantage while on her left lead and under a drive from the two path down the stretch. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA was hustled along off the
pace inside, under coaxing from the rail midway around the turn, swung out to the four path into the stretch, and chased on for place. TEASING hit the gate
at the start, trailed in the two path, was ridden around the turn, and got up for show. STREET CHARITY chased in the five path, was under right handed
encouragement around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. EVELYN pressed between foes in the three path, faded between foes turning into the lane, lost
the whip passing the eighth pole, but without impact. REE steadied at the start, travelled off the pace in the five path but never menaced. ABBY'S PLAID set
the pace in the two path, lost the lead while ridden along from the rail midway around the turn, and gaveway at the top of the lane.

best in the lane. I LOVE IRELAND raced well back three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn and was along for the show. LTE STARK WINTER
was bumped entering the first turn and then again midway around the bend, raced in range three wide and weakened in the stretch. EMPIRE GIRL raced up
close inside and came up empty in the lane. INSATIABLE EVA saved ground off the pace, was bumped midway down the backstretch, continued inside
around the far turn and never threatened. AMARULA SUN was off a bit slowly, was very hard to handle, bumped a foe entering the first turn, clipped heels
soon after, became even ranker soon after, bumped again midway around the first turn, bumped another foe midway down the bacsktretch, swung out
entering the far turn and faded outside. OVERRUN chased the pace four wide and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
EMERGENCY RESPONSE set the pace in the three path, was roused while merging inside into the far turn, opened up from the rail turning into the lane,
began to shorten stride in the final sixteenth, but held safe under a drive. GLOBES pressed in the four path, bid under a drive between foes in the two path
early around the far turn, lost touch with the winner while floating out to the four path entering the lane, but chased on for place. ENSIGN SKIP tracked in the
four path, was put to a drive in the three path going into the far turn, fanned out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. BLUTO'S CANDY
had an awkward start, moved up outside of foes around the first turn and laid up close in the five path entering the backstretch, was under coaxing in the
three path early into the far turn, but evened out in the five path down the lane. AMBUSHED rated in the two path, was roused into the far turn, but flattened
passing the eighth pole. HOLIDAY FANTASY raced off the pace in the four path but was never a factor. PAPA KATZ was well behind in the three path and
never threatened. SHARP AZ NAILS stalked inside but was done after a half.

Footnotes
LAS OLAS tracked the pacesetter in the three path, took over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. PARADISE DRIVE was off slowly, raced well
back three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up late for the place. BULLETONTHECHARTS
checked early, raced off the pace four wide and rallied for the show. NOBLE AND KIND raced in range three wide and was one-paced through the lane to
miss second and third. MUCHOMACHOMAC went evenly inside. BROOKLYN DREAMS failed to menace while racing three and four wide. SIR AUSTIN set
a clear pace in the two path and gave way near the quarter pole. VANISHING INTEREST was off a step slow, saved ground off the pace, tipped out near
the quarter pole and was blocked through the final furlong. KADAR INDY raced in range two wide and faded inside around the far turn. DONTONIO was
outrun inside. MIRO played no factor while racing four and five wide.

Footnotes
RIGBY laid up close in the five path, bid in the three path passing the three eighths pole, took the lead under a drive from the two path entering the lane,
and was driven clear. TOVIA set the pace in the three path, was challenged by an outer foe while in the two path passing the three eighths, lost the lead
entering the stretch, angled out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and held place. VACATION SUITE tracked in the two path, was coaxed passing the
three eighths pole, swung out to the five path into the stretch, but flattened for show. HOLLYWOOD HONEY was prompted along in the six path but made
no impact. LIL ANNIE ROSE trailed along the rail and never factored. TRIBUTE chased from out in the eight path into the turn, shifted into the four path
under rousing early around the turn, but was tired at the top of the lane. LAW MACHINE rated from the seven path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
FREEDOM PRINCIPLE was bumped at the start, raced in range two wide around the first turn, moved to the front midway down the backstretch, quickly
cleared and angled in, drew off around the far turn and held well clear while ridden out. STRATEGY JAK raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied
for the place. NEVER SAY NEVER raced up close four wide around the first turn, angled in to chase at the rail around the far turn, lacked a rally and held
third. ALI'I NUI set the early pace along the rail, tipped two wide when the winner cleared nearing the far turn, chased two wide around that bend and lacked
a closing bid. PEYTON'S DAY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. PAPALOTE hit the starting gate, checked early, raced off the pace two
wide, went four wide around the far turn and had no response. MAGIC HEART hesitated at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. YAKOZUKI
was bumped at the start, raced very wide into the first turn, angled into the three path midway around that bend then retreated inside around the far turn.
GRAND TOWER was up close three wide and was through after a half. LE MISTRAL was outrun inside. MACUTO was bumped at the start, saved ground
and was never close.

Footnotes
TOSCANITO was prominent outside of foes in the six path, led going into the turn, opened up from the three path around the turn, was roused in the four
path at the top of the lane, and held sway. MAJOR KING stalked inside, was put to a ride early around the turn, and kept on inside of foes from the two path
down the stretch for place. FORT ATTITUDE vied for the lead in the two path early, was roused while losing touch with the eventual winner midway around
the turn, floated out to the six path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. SEBARAY trailed inside, angled out to the seven path under a drive turning
into the lane, but made no impact. SUN VIKING chased in the five path, was ridden around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. THE RED MAN prompted
the pace between foes in the four path, but faded turning into the lane. NATURE BOY tracked in the three path, but was empty turning into the stretch.
