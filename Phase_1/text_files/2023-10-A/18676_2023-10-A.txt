Footnotes
INDY CHAMPAGNE travelled in midfield in the beginning, improved on the outside down the backstretch closing in on the leaders, cruised to the lead three
wide at the top of the lane, opened up in upper stretch and drew away for a comfortable win at the finish. ETHERIC was tucked in on the rail behind the
pacesetter in the beginning, rated kindly in the second flight inside down the back straight, was nudged on the fence midway on the far turn, shifted outside
to the four path for the drive and chased the winner in vain from the eighth pole to the wire. FISH MOONEY trailed the field outside on the first turn, travelled
in the third flight outside rivals down the backside, made a mild run three wide midway on the turn to be in range at the top of the stretch and finished up
willingly to the wire to be a non threatening third in the end. SILVER MAGNATIZED tracked the pacesetter just outside on the first turn, was under a tight
rein content sitting just off and outside the frontrunner down the back straight, bid for the lead between rivals at the quarter pole, could not quicken with the
outside winner turning for home and tired in the final eighth. MILAGRE DO SOL took this field in hand into the first turn setting a soft pace into the wind,
comfortably set the fractions down the backstretch, was clinging to the lead getting out a touch at the quarter pole, offered no resistance to outside
challengers at the top of the lane and retreated on the fence at the furlong marker. AMAZIN QUEEN stalked on the rail near the rear in this compact field
early on, settled inside down the backstretch in the third flight, made little impression saving ground on the far turn and could not get involved driving to the
wire.

Footnotes
FORESTER'S TURN broke outwards to start, stalked near the rear in the beginning, began to pick up runners three wide with three furlongs from the wire,
continued a strong move circling foes to bid in the five path turning for home and took control at the furlong marker, keeping to the task late and held on at
the wire. ROCKSTAR RO bobbled on the break, settled in midfield getting to the rail at the half, progressed smartly on the rail through the turn, slipped up
the fence at the top of the lane, lost path briefly in upper stretch and rallied late to just miss out for the win at the finish. CHANCEL had a good position
watching the contesting threesome down the back straight running three wide, was asked for more run midway on the turn taking closer order to the front,
was in the hunt four wide straightening out for the drive and finished up with intent to get up between runners for third. ALICIA'S KID forced the pace outside
in the early going, hounded the leader outside throughout the turn, assumed the front three wide turning for home, fought on gamely between foes down the
stretch but gave way grudgingly in the last sixteenth to settle for a minor role. TRANQUILITY BASE travelled in the middle of the pack on the fence down the
backside, roused five sixteenths from home saving ground on the turn, shifted just outside off a fading runner at the furlong marker and finished up mildly in
deep stretch. EXCEED stalked between runners near the rear in the early going, made little headway running on the turn and passed the tiring early speed
horses through the stretch. HAPPYMAC pressed the pace inside at the half, poked his head in front midway on the turn, battled for the top spot inside until
mid-stretch and faded in the final sixteenth. EXECUTIVE SIGHT broke a step slow to begin, was throttled back inside at the five furlong marker to trail down
the back straight, could not find another gear on the turn and did not get into contention running down the lane. BIG INVESTMENT emerged with a slim lead
with rivals on either side down the backstretch, was the first of the front trio to give way with five sixteenths remaining and emptied out backing through the
field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL ADVICE (FR) settled outside off the pace racing three then four wide in the early going, began to advance outside four deep on the far turn, bid
coming to the eighth pole, drifted out late, held a rival under steady urging. PAINTED GLORY was bumped and in tight after the start, settled near but off the
rail racing inside foes and off the pace, bided time through the far turn, swung out six wide leaving that bend, gained through upper- to mid-stretch looming a
major threat, drew nearly even a sixteenth out but failed to go past. SASSINESS broke outwardly, angled in and was held up behind a foe near the inside
early on the first turn, moved out and advanced four then five wide on the far turn, needed more late. PLAYMATE stalked mid-pack from outside racing
mostly three wide, kept on evenly. MRS. C broke on top, ceded the lead entering the first turn to an outside foe, switched outside that one to stalk, moved to
challenge coming to the three-eighths, took the lead about the five-sixteenths, was overtaken a furlong from home and had no extra. MONEY BEETS
bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward outside a foe into the first turn, set the pace near the inside, was challenged three furlongs out, came up
empty. FLIP FLOPPIN FAST bumped with inside and outside rivals at the start, settled mid-division inside, came out for the drive, failed to rally.

KANTBACKOFF hopped slightly on the break, settled in mid-pack on hold behind the wall of front runners four furlongs from the line, weaved smartly
through traffic at the three eighths marker, loomed the threat three wide at the quarter pole, took control outside with a furlong to run and held comfortably at
the finish. HITS DIFFERENT travelled in midfield waiting on the outside at the half, roused three furlongs out starting to make a run gaining on horses,
began to lengthen stride in the four path straightening out for the drive and closed belatedly to be a solid second at the wire. ONDINE LADY tracked near
the front four deep in the backstretch, battled outside for the lead around the bend, inched clear from inside rival at the quarter pole, braced for the
oncoming winner outside turning for home, could not find more late and faded on the fence late holding for third money. TAPPING A RHYTHM bumped
outside rival on the break, had a brief lead on the rail at the half mile marker, checked on the fence with three eighths to run, lost momentum, could see the
field midway on the turn, roused at the quarter marker gaining, slipped up the fence at the top of the stretch, angled outside with a furlong to go, bumped
rival and put in a good late run for a minor share. HASLEMERE prompted the pace three deep four furlongs from the finish, dueled inside for the lead
through the turn, could not keep up with co-leaders at the quarter pole and tired inside the final sixteenth. MOONBRIGHT bumped inside foe at the start,
pressed the pace two wide between rivals at the 1/2, was shuffled back in tight quarters with seven sixteenths remaining, regrouped to sit behind the front
trio at the quarter pole, bumped soundly at the furlong marker inside and could not recover to pose a threat in deep stretch. SHAMELESS AFFAIR broke a
step slow trailing down the back straight, roused catching up to the field midway on the turn, swung out widest in the six path for the drive but offered little
finish to the wire. WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY bobbled on the break, stalked near the rear down the backside, took closer order four wide through the turn, was
in the mix for a smaller share in the five path at the top of the lane and yielded in mid-stretch. GAVEL GIRL cleared to the lead from the outside with five
furlongs to run, was getting out along the backstretch, bolted on the turn, was eased, cantered down the stretch crossing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUNDS PRACTICAL got away alertly, set the pace from outside foes early, cleared and moved nearer the rail, was shadowed by a foe on the turn, kicked
clear in upper- to mid-stretch, asked for run in mid-stretch and responded to hold sway. INUDATION raced forwardly inside a foe but off the leaders, entered
the turn two wide quickly moving out, ridden along by the five-sixteenths coming four wide to the quarter pole and wider at the top of the stretch, surged late
to get up for place. PRINCESS JADE was very reluctant to load, broke a half-step slowly but moved forward inside to track the leader, came off the rail
turning into upper stretch, kept on gamely to secure show honors. DAZZLING MOVE pressed from inside early, eased back and switched outside the
eventual winner stalking that one, came again three deep midway on the turn to shadow that rival, lacked the needed late kick. HOT DANCE exchanged a
very light bump at the start, raced off the pace, went three wide on the turn, needed more. GOODNIGHTNGODBLESS exchanged light bumps with inside
and outside rivals at the start, moved out from three to four wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. ENGLISH JUBILEE raced off the pace
inside early then two wide coming into upper stretch, was not a threat. CANDID CANDACE moved nearer the rail on the turn racing toward the rear, was
never a threat. SWEET CHARLIZE exchanged a light bump at the start, chased three to four wide, retreated.

Footnotes
SIMPLY IN FRONT stalked close to the back into the first turn, was eager when in tight between runners seven eighths out, relaxed kindly unhurried at the
back down the back straight, quickly moved between rivals at the three furlong pole, swooped five wide around horses at the quarter marker, pounced to the
lead with an eighth to run and was kept to the task for the win at the finish. MY GIRL DELLA stalked two wide near the back in the beginning, could see the
field down the back straight, was hard ridden gaining momentum with five sixteenths to run, was brushed inside in the six path turning for home, found her
best stride late and won the battle for place narrowly at the wire. EVERLAND travelled outside in midfield in the early stages, was shuffled back losing
positions three eighths from the finish, rallied at the quarter pole, swung out widest in the seven path at the top of the lane, was brushed inside in upper
stretch and closed with a rush late to just miss out winning the photo for place crossing the line. VUCCHELLA settled on the rail tracking the leader down the
backside, shifted out off the fence three wide at the half, battled between horses up front midway on the final turn and stubbornly fought back through the
stretch to get up for a minor role in the end. STOLEN VALOUR was content to track the frontrunner outside in the early stages, forced the pace outside with
a half mile to run, poked her head in front three eighths from the prize, could not fend off the winner in mid-stretch and faded at the sixteenth pole.
SACCHARINE was off a touch slow trailing in the beginning, advanced inside through the first turn, was under a snug hold in the middle of the pack on the
rail down the backside, roused at the quarter pole gaining in the five path at the top of the stretch, had no room, was steadied in tight quarters in upper
stretch and could not recover in time to pose a threat. LUNCH WITH BERNIE took command on the rail, set the pace under a comfortable lead down the
backside, had a narrow advantage when collared outside by multiple runners three furlongs out, offered no resistance and faltered on the fence turning for
home. SLEEPWALKER travelled in mid-pack three wide on the first turn, was the first to make a move four wide down the backstretch advancing at the half,
bid for the lead four wide three furlongs from home, could not sustain the run in the four path driving to the wire, was bounced around faded in tight quarters
in upper stretch and had nothing to give afterwards. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL#2 SACCHARINE AGAINST #4 MY GIRL DELIA IN UPPER STRETCH WAS
DISALLOWED

Footnotes
CAMILO was forwardly-positioned tracking inside, moved up the rail to take the lead at the quarter pole, kicked clear in the stretch, was kept to the task.
TOWN'S WARRIOR settled off the pace, gradually moved out on the turn coming to the quarter pole four wide, gained the place while no threat to the
winner. ITS JUST MONEY was keen early pressing from outside, went three wide on the turn, kept on to preserve show honors. THE NEW MAYBE raced
outside off the pace, fanned five wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. MR NOBILITY saved some ground near the inside, came out and ran on with mild
late interest. JAGGERSGOTAGUN set the pace racing off the rail, weakened. QU' APPELLE RIVER was outpaced and never a threat.

Footnotes
DANZIGQUEEN settled near the back of the pack four wide early on, rallied three wide going around horses smartly midway on the turn, loomed the threat
in the five path at the top of the stretch, caught the pacesetter at the sixteenth pole and was edging clear for the win at the finish line. CHERRY GARDENS
took control from the onset, dictated the pace down the backside, was left alone, unchallenged through the turn, had something in reserve to open up mildly
at the top of the lane but could not hold off the late burst from the winner at the sixteenth pole and finished second with a gutsy front end performance.
TRILLING SONG was void of speed trailing down the backstretch, began to extend her stride picking up horses three wide three furlongs from the finish,
swung outside with run in the seven path turning for home and closed in well to capture third in the end. GUNNAWIN tracked the leader down the backside,
chased the pacesetter through the turn but made little gain, stubbornly remained in the hunt three wide straightening out for home and ran on willingly to the
finish to be a fringe player. HURRICANE GIZMO was brushed outside to begin, stalked between rivals three wide down the backstretch, came under a ride
trying to quicken with the winner that was outside midpoint on the turn and could not make any impact running down the lane. LOOKHOWPRETTY broke in
at the start, tracked three wide on the outside down the back straight, was urged for more outside with five sixteenths remaining, had a chance for a piece of
the prize in the four path driving to the wire but lacked a rally through the stretch and could not be a factor in the end. I'M PHANTOM stalked on the fence
close to the rear in the early going, saved ground making little progression through the turn and could not be a presence driving to the wire. BEYOND
REASON was nestled on the the rail in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, was asked to go running inside midway through the turn, put in a mild
run to be involved on the fence for a share turning for home but gave way inside at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S STORM settled in behind mid-division racing off the rail in the two to three path early, was encouraged along passing the three-eighths, moved out
four wide coming to the quarter pole, came out a bit further at the top of the stretch, took aim, surged to the lead just past the sixteenth pole and held.
ALGIERS (IRE) pressed the very early pace then eased off that leader content to track in behind, lacked room coming past the quarter pole, came out a bit
at the three-sixteenths then a bit further in late stretch, ran on well late to get up for second. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST moved forward outside a foe early
then cleared that one and shifted in a bit, set the pace in the clear, maintained an advantage until late stretch, kept on but lugged out a bit and lost place
late. TREASON bumped a rival lightly at the start, moved forward stalking from outside a foe two to three wide, was within range coming to the top of the
stretch, forced out a bit in the lane, needed more. WAR COURT had light bumps at the start, settled outside the eventual winner three to four wide, moved
out from three to five wide on the far turn under urging and getting to within range coming to the top of the stretch but lacked the needed late kick. AVOMAN
bumped a rival lightly at the start, settled outside at the back about two to three wide early, moved out for the far turn going four to six wide on that bend,
failed to threaten while going evenly. NOVO SOL (BRZ) had light bumps at the start, settled at the back racing inside, made no bids.

Footnotes
NO MORE DIAMONDS emerged with the lead entering the backstretch, opened up on rivals in hand midturn, had a commanding lead straightening out for
the drive to the wire and was kept to the task winning comfortably crossing the line. TELLTALE rated kindly inside down the backside in the third flight,
advanced smartly on the fence running on the turn, shifted outside with momentum three wide two furlongs from home and determinedly battled between to
get the runners up share at the wire. KRYPTO GAINS travelled close to the back on the rail in the beginning, improved on the fence passing runners
through the turn, sneaked up the rail at the quarter pole and finished up strongly just being outfinished for second in deep stretch. LILLZ HOPE had a slow
start to begin, trailing down the backside, began to close from the back of the pack starting a run five wide at the quarter pole, continued with run seven wide
for the drive and was gaining late, could not reel in runners in deep stretch and settled for a minor role in the end. TAMANA pressed the pace on the rail,
rallied up the fence chasing the winner midturn, was in range at the top of the stretch in the three path, could not find more running to the wire and stalled at
the sixteenth pole. GAV'S DREAM GIRL hopped on the break, stalked near the back of the pack, came under a ride three wide three furlongs out, offered a
brief run until the top of the lane and levelled out in the six path running to the wire. HELLUVA HOLIDAY was allowed to settle on the rail near the rear down
the backside, made no improvement saving ground running on the turn and passed tired runners down the lane. SILVER SIGN had a good position tracking
the front trio at the half, could not quicken with rivals on the turn losing positions and found no rally running one paced through the stretch. SILENT
WARNING travelled outside in the three path down the back straight, was coaxed for more run three eighths out, showed little turn of foot and had nothing
to give in the stretch drive. SERENADING HALL settled in mid-pack between runners in the early going, was roused three furlongs from the finish, offered
no run through the turn, was steadied on the fence in upper stretch and was not a factor driving to the wire. MAMMA KATZ prompted three wide outside
down the backstretch, gave up the chase three furlongs from the line and retreated between runners at the quarter pole.
