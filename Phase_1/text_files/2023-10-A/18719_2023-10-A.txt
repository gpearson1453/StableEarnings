Footnotes
DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY eased back and angled in entering the first turn racing just off the rail, tracked in behind the leading quartet, came out past the
quarter pole, struck the lead four wide near the eighth pole and drove clear. ZIPPER ZAPPER got loose in the post-parade, broke alertly, contested the
pace inside foes just off the rail, kept on to secure the place while no match for the winner. CITY RAGE broke well despite bobbling slightly, contested the
pace two to three wide on the turns, was outfinished for place. SHANGHAI CANDY was unhurried at the rear angling in and saving ground well off the
leaders, came out in the stretch, kicked on mildly. SENATE CHAMBER was within range pressing from outside four to five wide, came up empty.
SPRINKLEHEAD attended the pace three to four wide on the turns, weakened.

Footnotes
ZAVA got away well, pursued the pace up close from outside, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, vied between runners in the stretch with a narrow
advantage, prevailed. TRY HARDER broke a step slowly, settled off the pace, advanced while shifting out four wide coming to the quarter pole, loomed a
threat in upper stretch but evened out. HAY HAY HARRY moved to the lead setting the pace from off the rail, was pressured by an inside foe late up the
backstretch then overtaken by an outside rival near the quarter pole, kept on gamely in the stretch. THE HONEYMAN lacked early speed racing off the
inside, passed tired foes. DRINKIN N DREAMING moved forward to vie for the lead near the half-mile marker, weakened. COOLKID chased from off the
inside part of the track, faded.

Footnotes
K'S STORM READY got away well and went right to the front, set the pace near inside facing pressure, spurted clear in mid- to late-stretch and held sway.
HOYA was forwardly-positioned stalking about three wide, could not reach the winner but fought on to hold the place. INCHON stalked from outside racing
about four wide through the turns, was outfinished for second. FAVORITE HAUNT tracked from inside on or just off the rail, kicked on willingly. PANTHER
CROSSING pressed the eventual winner, weakened in late stretch. NIGHT MOVER settled inside mid-division saving ground early, went two deep on the
far turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on. AMEN MCLAREN raced between foes early two to three wide, fanned five wide into upper stretch, ran on.
CHEVY MAN settled into stride toward the rear, shifted out going three to four wide on the far turn, ran on. LOVE SHAQ was restless in the gate, broke a
step slowly, was caught three to four wide in the early going, failed to menace. KINDA FONDA WANDA angled in early, saved some ground near the inside,
failed to rally. FINAL OPPORTUNITY chased the pace in behind, retreated. HE'S A WILD CHILD was outpaced and never a threat.

Footnotes
RED WINE TIME broke just a step slowly then allowed to settle at the back, switched off the inside and swept past foes four then five wide late on the far
turn taking command by the top of the stretch, kicked clear and extended the advantage under moderate urging. VOODOO MAMA JUJU settled outside a
foe off the pace racing about three wide, angled five wide leaving the far turn, was no match for the winner but kept on to get up for place. HAPPY UNION
settled inside a rival on or just off the rail, advanced on the far turn moving out for room leaving that bend, ran on for show honors. DESI'S REWARD
bobbled just slightly at the start but quickly moved clear racing off the fence to set the pace, continued to lead racing nearer the fence through the far turn,
weakened in the stretch. SHE SO COOL was caught four wide into the first turn, shifted in and tracked from the rail mid-pack up the backstretch, weakened.
SHAOLIN stalked two to three deep, was encouraged along past the five-sixteenths, lacked the needed late kick.

outfinished. CARLIN CLAN set the pace racing off the rail, faced pressure up the backstretch, was headed near the quarter pole, yielded in the stretch.
GRANDPA'S KID shifted in, saved ground on both turns, ran on for the minor award. REEL WELL settled off the pace outside a rival, went two to three wide
on the turns, showed late interest. TORO FORWARD exchanged a bump after the start, was forwardly-placed stalking outside a foe mid-pack two to three
wide, went evenly. BOLD LICORICE shifted in racing two to three wide early, angled six wide at the top of the stretch, ran on. BUSHWICK BRUISER

Footnotes
GENIEINABRIDLE was forced out at the start, settled well back off the leaders, swung eight wide turning for home, surged late. MADELINE'S GROGU
stalked in behind and inside foes, bid between runners turning into upper stretch, took the lead, was outfinished. TOUISSET raced wide early and off the
leaders, shifted in on the turn but still off the rail, kept on through the lane. GRACEFUL ROSE broke outwardly, raced at the back near the rail, improved
position in the stretch. PROUD MULE was hard sent to the front early, set the pace in the clear, was challenged leaving the turn, gave way in the stretch.
ATHENA'S WISDOM stalked within range, advanced three wide late on the turn commencing a bid, drifted out several paths leaving that bend, lacked the
needed late kick. AWESOME PIC was within range four wide on the turn, floated seven wide leaving that bend, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LIVING WATER exchanged a light bump after the start, stalked from off the pace four wide into the turn, drifted out a bit leaving that bend and under urging,
struck the lead in mid-stretch and drew clear. LOVERBOY LOU was reluctant to load, settled at the back inside a foe but off the rail, swung seven wide into
upper stretch, got up for place. ACT OF VALOR exchanged a bump after the start, stalked going three wide on the turn, made a mild bid at the top of the
stretch, needed more. SNEAKINESS settled inside, came out near the quarter pole and again in late stretch, ran on. APACHE raced outside at the rear,
swung nine wide, ran on. JIMMY THE KID got away well and had the early lead but was soon overtaken, stalked in behind off the pace, shifted in on the
turn to about the two path, evened out in the stretch. MINISTER QUINN bobbled slightly and had light bumps on both sides after the start, soon moved to
the lead to set the pace racing in the clear and off the rail, weakened.
