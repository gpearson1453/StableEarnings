set the balance of the pace and drew clear under mild left handed urging. OTIS OTIS OTIS pressed the early pace two wide, steadied between rivals
entering the turn, shifted out at the top of the stretch then came on again in the five path to gain second. OVER THE HILLS trailed into the turn and found
his best stride late in the six path. SHADOW TRACER sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until late turn, remained a sharp threat into
the stretch and faded late. LAUDA SPEED failed to menace. TOMATO BILL close up four wide, swung wide entering the stretch then stopped.
