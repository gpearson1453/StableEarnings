Footnotes
TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
drew away under steady handling. STYLISH PAINT stalked from the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn,
proved no match for the winner and had to settle for second. FLAT DISCOUNT stalked off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, flattened in the lane and just lasted for third. CASTLE OF CAYLEE settled off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly to improve her position. URKILLINGMEBETH saved early ground,
gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. MARKETABILITY broke a step slow and
raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. SO RED THE ROSE was checked
leaving the gate and never factored.

mid-stretch and was gaining on the top two. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened in the lane. TRAPPE THE
GOLD gave close early chase but flattened in the four path on the turn. DINNER BELL bobbled at the break and raced briefly close while giving chase, but

Footnotes
WILLOW MOON took over on the chute and cleared rivals while angling to the inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, cleared
Ding Ding past the quarter pole and was kept alert to hold on well. SCARLET TANAGER steadied off the inside flank of Adabel approaching the three
eighths pole, quickly recovered stride to give chase and improved in the three path on the turn, then dug in from the head of the lane to take second the final
yards. DING DING closed to the heels of Willow Moon approaching the seven sixteenths pole and steadied, dug in to challenge toward the five sixteenths
but dropped past past the quarter pole and flattened the final sixteenth. MAKE IT A DOUBLE gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the
rail then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. MOJO MATTERS gave chase from well back, raced near the rail on the turn and passed rivals in the lane.
GOLDEN SWEETS chased outside, rounded the turn in the six path and showed little in the lane. MISS WILD chased outside, rounded the turn about the
five path and showed little in the lane. ADABEL gave chase and angled in nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the
stretch. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected claims of foul against the rider of Willow Moon for alleged interference soon after the start, lodged by the
riders of Scarlet Tanager and Ding Ding.

tapering to the inside and rated the pace into the first turn, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
dug in leaving the turn, but was met in later yards and flattened nearing the wire. DALLAS saved ground on the opening turn, gave chase leaving the half
mile pole, raced in the three and four paths on the far turn and showed little more. HOVEL raced well back off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths

rail on the far turn and held on under steady stretch handling. SILIPO was shuffled from early contention and settled well back through the opening turn,

strides while gaining on the winner. ZEN MASTER saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the four path then flattened later yards. FEARNOUGHT saved ground on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the
rail on the far turn and passed some rivals. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN stalked three wide and moved to even terms approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
dueled from the three eighths but dropped back past the quarter and weakened leaving the far turn. SUPER QUALITY rated close inside, gave chase
toward the three eighths pole and remained a factor through the far turn before weakening. CHANGE YOUR LUCK raced with the early pace inside, was

Footnotes
MAKINLIMMARGARITAS took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on. APPEALING ROAD rounded the first turn in the four path and entered the backstretch outside, gave
chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn, dug in for second past the sixteenth pole and was gaining steadily on the
waning winner. ELLIES AT WINDSOR closed toward contention while tapering in and stalked the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. WOODSONG'S CASTLE saved ground racing well back, picked up the chase past the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished evenly. PEARLY GHOST settled off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and came through the far turn at the rail, though, flattened past the eighth pole. HOW IS SHE raced well back
inside on the first turn, bid mildly from the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and could only improve her position. I SHALLBE
RELEASED raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LADY SPARROW raced well back on the opening turn
and was never a factor. MICHEAUX rated just off the early pace off the rail, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded past the three eighths.
