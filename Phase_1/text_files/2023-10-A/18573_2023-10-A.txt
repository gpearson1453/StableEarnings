Footnotes
LIGHTENING ANNA lagged early, advanced quickly in the four path leaving the backstretch, took over at the head of the stretch, and drove clear.
SPORTSCARR sat near the back of pack while three wide, was set down into the final turn, and edged away late for second. FROSTEDBIRD stalked three
wide, moved up closer to challenge the lead, gained a short advantage, and lacked the closing response needed. BEAUGATTI attended the pace from
between foes, and came up empty in the drive. MONEY MUNCHER tracked inside and failed to threaten. WOMANONTHEWARPATH contended the early
pace from along the rail, and tired. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SPORTSCARR against the rider of LIGHTENING ANNA
alleging interference on the final turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
SHARP DRESSED BEAU vied for the early lead outside of PERDITION, emerged the leader then showed the way through the backstretch, responded to
looming threat from GIVE EM HECK BECK, and drove clear under handling. GIVE EM HECK BECK sat in striking position, chased hard on the final turn but
was unable to stall the winner, was kept to steady handling holding on for the place. PERDITION vied inside then settled just off the pace, rallied into the
stretch, and weakened late. HARD TO COME HOME was under a strong hold early then was in close quarters through the opening turn, chased in the last
turn, and lacked a kick. CARSON'S LEGACY went three to four wide into the backstretch, and tired early. NORTH FORK trailed throughout.

MI REYNA contested the lead outside of GO MAMA, gained a short advantage nearing the stretch, and drew away. ADDYDIDIT stalked outside from the
four path, moved up menacingly nearing the quarter pole, rallied through the stretch then edged clear. GO MAMA contended the pace from the rail, was
unable to move on with the eventual winner and gave way. HENRY'S GAMBLE rated well of the pace inside, rallied into the stretch, and finished evenly.
WITT'S TENNY TEN chased three to four wide and was unable to improve position. BOOTIFUL ROSE stumbled leaving, and showed a mild interest late.
JOY IN GRACE lost position nearing the opening turn, chased and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EXAMINER allowed to settle inside early, shifted out three to four wide at the head of the lane, overtook the lead, and won driving. WYE CROSS tracked
three to four wide, swung out in the final turn, closed well late, and was along with time for second. DUNE D'ORO set for outside speed, led the field into the
backstretch, responded to a challenge from BROWING ISLAND but was out-finished in the stretch. LITTLE CHICAGO sat mid-pack and bid belatedly.
EXPLODE trailed the field early, lodged a bid into the far turn, and came up empty for the drive. BROWNING ISLAND fanned four wide into the backstretch,
chased outside moving up alongside DUNE D'ORO, was unable to match strides with rival and gave way. DAD'S LEGACY hurried early then was
outsprinted to the turn, chased three wide and tired. LAST RENEGADE saved ground and had no response when called upon.

Footnotes
WIZARDOFMENLOPARK brushed leaving, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, found racing room inside, shifted out to the two path, and won
driving. SIX SHOTS OF T attended the pace from the rail, inherited the lead entering the last turn, and was caught. TRAPEZE lacked a clear path leaving,
chased leaving the backstretch, angled inside to the three path, and finished evenly for show. BORN ON FIRE lacked early speed, drove inside at the head
of the stretch, and flattened. JOKERS R WILD raced at the back of the pack, drove three to four wide on the final turn, shifted inside, and improved position.
NO MOR DISCO fanned four wide into the opening turn, dropped back through the backstretch, raced wide into the lane, and rallied mildly late. GWIZZ
fanned three-wide, was unable to move on with SIX SHOTS OF T, drifted out at the head of the lane and faded. FAVORITE LIGHT attended the pace from
between foes, and stopped in the final turn. RYE TOAST brushed leaving, chased hard while five wide, was pulled up, did not finish and walked off.

Footnotes
RECIO'S SKYE sat in striking distance from the five path, moved up alongside WISH ON A STAR to challenge the lead, gained a narrow advantage and
prevailed. WISH ON A STAR sat just off the pace in the two path, overtook the lead then responded to a challenge from RECIO'S SKYE into the stretch, lost
the advantage, and finished second best. TENDER LOVE brushed leaving, trailed early, hustled through the far turn, rallied three wide earning show
honors. SMOKIN JOY stalked inside, experienced traffic in the far turn, found seam into the lane and was out-finished for show. DUBD SAINT ANGEL
chased five-wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide at the head of the lane, and yielded late stretch. ASHES TO ASHES saved early, chased three
wide, and failed to threaten in the drive. BLAZING SUN sent for early speed outside, chased the pace from the three path, and wilted in the stretch.
STARMA set the pace from just off the rail, and tired early. CHABI offered little.
