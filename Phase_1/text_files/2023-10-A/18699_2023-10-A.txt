PRINCE OF LUCK had the best speed, set the pace inside to the half then kicked away and held driving. HYDROGEN chased the winner, raced three wide
then could not make an impact while easily second best. HARROVIAN stalked the pace from the rail for a half mile then was outrun by the top two and
came up empty. HASHTAG BAE was used early to stay with the winner in the opening furlong, got outkicked on the backstretch then gave way after five
furlongs. STANLEY RYDER had no speed and was never a threat. ZOE'S PAPA CEE was always outrun.

Footnotes
RESERVOIR flashed good speed, dueled the runnerup through a half mile then dug in gamely and got the nod on the wire. LIVE A GOOD LIFE was outside
the winner throughout, babbled determinedly to the line but was nipped. DONTFORGETHESUGAR lugged out to the backstretch carrying TOO TALL TO
CALL out, chased to the far turn then came up empty in the drive. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY had no speed and saved ground to no avail. SEVENTH HOUSE
was outsprinted while two wide and never threatened. WEGOTBEERONICE hustled to chase the top two for three eighths while dropping to the rail to save
ground but weakened. CABALLERANGO was three wide early while showing no speed and did not menace. TOO TALL TO CALL was carried six wide on
the first turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
RODEO ROSE was well placed to the backstretch, moved up outside rivals to take the lead, edged away to the stretch then held under steady urging.
MEAN SHARON tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch and was gaining ground late. TEASPOON OF PEPPER chased the pace to the backstretch,
rallied three wide and improved position to the line. WARREN'S MEMORABLE had no speed, raced towards the rear then swung out four wide to the
stretch was closed belatedly. DANIELLE'S SECRET had no speed, was two wide and lacked a closing response. MY LITE NITE trailed to the second turn
then picked off a few rivals in the drive. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY had no speed, was three wide to the stretch and finished evenly. LADY BRETT hustled
along to set the pace, dueled inside for a half mile then tired. CHIEFS LIL PEARL was hurried early but got outsprinted on the backstretch and gave way
after five furlongs.

backstretch, chased the pace, rallied inside to the stretch and was an easy second. HEAVENS TO BETSY checked off heels on the first turn, chased the
pace for a half then could not make an impact. SPORTS FOR WOMEN had no speed, was three wide and lacked a late bid. LILY PAD LAKE was pushed
out six wide on the first turn, had no speed and was never a threat. ASTOUNDING ABBY trailed for five furlongs and was not a factor. MISCHIEF MAME

SMOKENSILVER tracked the pace to the second turn, bid two to the stretch and closed steadily to prevail. ELUSIVE GOLD pressed the pace for a half then
lugged six wide to the stretch but dueled to mid stretch and got the nod for second. GOTHAM'S FINALE set the pace, responded to the stretch then dueled,
was caught by the winner and lost second late. ST PATRICKS SWORD tracked the pace, bid inside on the far turn but was outfinished. MAFIA MAN chased
the pace, was roused three wide and was gaining ground belatedly. IKE BUTTE lagged to the far turn while very wide and showed some mild late interest.
WORK YOUR MAGIC was always outrun.
