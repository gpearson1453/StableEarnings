STAR ENTRY broke sharply and settled in behind the dueling leaders entering the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide
entering the final turn, shifted three wide leaving the turn, and closed with a rush to prove best. I'M CORFU away well and pressed the pace from the
outside of FINDING WAYS entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide through the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival
entering the lane, but had little left when tackled and overtaken in mid stretch, while proving clearly second best. FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on his
pace rival entering the lane, and faded in the stretch drive. RACING RIVER was unprepared at the start, and got away poorly, and trailed the field
throughout. The stewards conducted a review into the start of the race, but deemed that all horses received a fair start.

FLY BOY JACK tracked the leader in the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and closed
determinedly one out from the rail in the drive to as he wore down the pacesetter late and inched clear to prove best. STANFORD NORTH away alertly and
raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the
inside through the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off a late surge by FLY BOY JACK while proving clearly second
best. BORROWED EQUITY settled at the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final
turn, and closed from just off the rail to garner a share. DAPPER DON broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two wide in the
run down the backside, rallied four wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. SHOWMAN away well and stalked the
leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

effort. TOBESUNNY stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the rail entering the final
turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for a share. BAKFIRE BABY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the

SUNBIRD tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, raced in a stalking trip through the stretch the second time
and in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid smartly three wide entering the final turn, took control entering the stretch and quickly drew clear as
much the best. AT ATTENTION pressed the pace from the outside of JUST JIMMY in the run down the backstretch the first time, continued to force the
issue through the stretch the second time and in the run down the backside, continued that battle into the final turn, began to get the better of his pace rival
leaving the turn, but was quickly overtaken by SUNBIRD entering the lane, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to prove second best.
ACCIDENTAL HERO stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch the first time, maintained his position through
the stretch the second time and in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to garner a share.
JUST JIMMY away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail in the run down the backstretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace from
along the rail through the third turn and in the run down the backstretch the final turn, continued that battle into the final turn, struggled to match strides with
his pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the late stages. BIG UNION settled off the contested early pace while racing two wide in the run down the
backside the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. PAY MY WAY unhurried early
while dropping back to trail entering the backstretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside the second
time, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. ITSMYDAY settled off the
early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch the first time, held his position through the stretch the second time, rallied four
wide entering the final turn, but was never a serious factor. STAY FANTASTIC stalked the leaders into the backstretch the first time while saving ground at
the rail, maintained his position while continuing to save ground throughout, but weakened over the final furlong.

LASTING LIGHT away alertly and raced to the lead one out from the rail entering the backside, set a pressured pace from the inside of ANIMA in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, opened a clear lead entering the lane, but was all out to hold off a late surge by CARLA'S HONOR to prevail.
CARLA'S HONOR was bumped solidly in the opening strides before assuming a stalking trip from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. ROSE OF TEXAS away well and
stalked the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backside, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished
willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. ANIMA rushed up three wide entering the first turn to force the issue from the outside of LASTING LIGHT
entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival through the final turn, but was outfinished late. TEXAS HUMOR settled off
the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished four wide in the
drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. FILLY FATALE broke sharply and tracked the leaders in the run down the backside while saving ground at
the rail, continued to save ground entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response over the final furlong. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER settled
well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when
called upon. ICE BREAKER unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make an impact.
