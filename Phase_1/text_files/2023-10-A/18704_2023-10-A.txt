Footnotes
CHIEF FORTY settled inside wall of pacesetters, angled out to secure room into the stretch, rallied and edged clear in the final sixteenth. BIG BROOK
eased back in the opening quarter, alternated for the lead inside then weakened slightly. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN prompted the pace four wide between foes and
tired in the stretch. LAST DREAM broke slowest and trailed early then moved wide in the stretch. CRACK THE CODE forced the pace three wide between
rivals and faltered in the stretch. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE was urged early in five way duel down the backstretch then faltered in the stretch. MOB
JUSTICE ducked out while breaking alertly, moved up very wide under a rating hold then stopped.

Footnotes
LA REGALADA raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then wore down that rival through the final furlong. GIRVINIZED lacked speed, moved very wide
and closed well too late. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN raced just off the pace in the two path and continued willingly. ELL GRAY hustled to a clear advantage to
the stretch and faltered. STEPHANIE MY LOVE dropped back early then narrowed gap while no threat. ONTHISHARVESTMOON steadied leaving the
chute, moved up inside then faded. SHELL BELLE hustled three wide off the leaders and gave way. TRECHMO GIRL bobbled badly at the break then
trailed throughout. Claims of foul by the rider of ONTHISHARVESTMOON against the first and fourth finishers for early interference were dismissed.

AKEMI quickly sped to the front with a long lead, widened on the turn and remained far ahead while kept to her task. YOUR INHERITANCE steadied and
bobbled in the opening furlong, rallied wide and was no match for the winner. BOSS LIKE BETH saved ground off the pace and continued willingly missing
the place. BELLA PRIMA chased off the leaders outside and lacked a solid rally. DECOUPAGE urged off the pace and began fading on the turn. THE
SWEATY FOX raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
JULIET'S MUSIC controlled the pace, repelled a challenge in midstretch and finished gamely to gain the decision. TWIRLING WIND settled well back
inside, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. MORE RANSOM far behind early, advanced inside with some late energy.
GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN pursued the winner for half a mile then flattened out in the stretch. TONALA trailed far back then narrowed gap without menacing.
LIVE AID hustled close up three wide for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
BOSSYNESS reserved close up, bid going after leader on the final turn, collared that one in the stretch and edged away through the final furlong.
UNADULTERATED slipped through inside to the lead before the half, moved clear then tired. BABY GUNDIN fanned wide on the first turn, faded on the
final turn then came again for the show. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM led under a hold in the opening quarter, continued willingly but was no threat.
THEGODDESSOFSNAKES trailed early, moved very wide on the final turn and stretch. FLASHNDYNAMITE lacked speed, moved closer into the stretch
then flattened out. CATTI LA BELLE lacked speed, was taken up sharply and lost her action near the three eighths pole and lacked a further response.
CONNELMAURA saved ground, made a brief move before half a mile then faltered. JEANETTEO prompted the pace three wide for half a mile and stopped
abruptly. The rider of CATTI LA BELLE claimed foul against the rider of FLASHNDYNAMITE for interference on the final turn but it was dismissed.

stretch and was just up for the place. POWER AGENDA prompted the pace outside and continued well just missing the place. PORSUPUESTO dropped far
behind, rallied inside and steadied in tight near midstretch. PRIMORDIAL FEAR lacked speed then passed rivals without menacing. TACO BEAN urged just
off the pace inside, bid briefly closer turn then faltered. AVA K'S BOY broke slowly, chased very wide and was no factor. UPSTATE AND BACK lagged far
behind and was never in contention. BUSTINUPISHARDTODO raced off the leaders three wide and lacked a response. REFUND RIGLER saved ground off
the pace and gave way readily. MERU trailed early and raced far behind throughout. DEFEND flashed speed outside then began fading on the turn.

then finished gamely in the final furlong just missing. PUT IT IN DA BOOKS pressed the winner outside to the late stages and weakened slightly. BOSSY
KATE ducked out at the start, chased wide and continued well. GYPSY WANDERER flashed speed outside and came up empty in the stretch.
SHE'SALLATWITTER trailed far behind then offered some late energy. FOR SALE saved ground in midpack and lacked a response. ZIFFY BUG dropped
back early and was always outrun. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY raced well back between rivals and never a factor. PAULA'S SURPRISE broke awkwardly,
chased wide and was always far back. MIKEY'S SONG ran off on way to the paddock and was ordered a late scratch.
