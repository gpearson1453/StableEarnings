SIKUM five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to split foes a furlong out taking command a sixteenth from home, then gamely fended off a rival to prevail on the
wire. QUEENS MASTERPIECE dueled from the two path with BIG BEAN CHRISTINE to her inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clinging to the front from a pair of foes a furlong out, got headed near the sixteenth marker and fought on to the
finish. BIG BEAN CHRISTINE dueled inside of the aforementioned foe coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch,

BOOK'EM DANNO broke out a step at the start and was corrected, raced four then three wide in pursuit advancing near the quarter pole, swung four wide
into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths coming inwards, drew clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages. WORKS
FOR ME coaxed from the gate, cut the pace from the two path under pressure from JIMMYTHETOOTH to the outside, tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got collared at the three-sixteenths and kept on to the finish.
WHERE'S CHRIS coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five
wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. JIMMYTHETOOTH bobbled at the break, prompted the pace from the outside three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. RUDDY BUDDY stumbled badly at the start nearly belly
flopping on the ground before recovering his footing, conceded four to five lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased along the inside
detached at the tail of the field, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish with too much to do.

clear going easy through to the finish. SUNSET LOUISE away to the front, showed the way six paths off the inside before being displaced from command
inside six furlongs to go, tucked five wide remaining nearly latched on her sole rival to the three-eighths marker, then got steadily shaken off placed to brief
urging through the latter portion of the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and proved no match for the top one while eased home.

edged clear under a drive to prevail. TRICKY TEMPER chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, had A PRIMERA VISTA come
inwards attempting to bully her way to the rail nearing the quarter pole and denied the move keeping her rightful lane before taking the inside route into
upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors clear of the rest while unable to threaten the top one. A PRIMERA VISTA chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, was in behind DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT and came inwards attempting to bully her way to the rail
nearing the quarter pole bumping the aforementioned foe into the fence, was denied the move and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then tipped out
to the four path and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. SUGAR HI broke in at the start bumping LESLIE'S LOOT, chased four to
five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. LESLIE'S LOOT got bumped at the start by
SUGAR HI, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LOVE
TO EAT coaxed from the start, dueled four then three wide with DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT to her inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced
from the front in tandem with her main pace rival at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. DEVIL AT MIDNIGHT coaxed from the
gate, dueled three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to her outside, came under coaxing when displaced from command at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was steadied near the eighth pole when backing away and tired. There was an objection by the trainer
of A PRIMERA VISTA alleging interference against TRICKY TEMPER in the latter portion of the turn which was reviewed and dismissed prior to the result
standing and the race being declared official.
