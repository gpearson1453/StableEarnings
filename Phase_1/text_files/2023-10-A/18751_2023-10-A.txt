Footnotes
CASTLE TOY broke on top and tapered to the inside to show the way through the backstretch, contested the edge at the rail on the turn and dug in under
determined handling to eke out the nod over the game challenge of SNOWY JUBA CAT, who gave chase, raced close two deep on the turn and dueled
gamely to the finish. TATOR MADE bobbled leaving the gate then angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the four path and came along
to take third later yards. RIVER REWARDS RVF chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. EMBERLY gave chase, raced in
the four path on the turn, left the turn outside and ran evenly in the lane. GILDED QUEST angled toward the outside to give early chase, raced off the rail on
the turn, angled out past the eighth pole and showed little more. WINDSOR'S PLAY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three path and
weakened inside the eighth pole.

Footnotes
ESPRESSO bore out into the opening turn but corrected course and took a slim lead approaching the half mile pole, dueled from that point but was met at
the three eighths and contested even terms, rounded the far turn two deep, dueled clear mid-stretch and held on driving. CALYPSO JOHN rounded the first
turn about the four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and
dueled through the final furlong for second. GREATANDGOOD raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. JUST MURPHY settled off the rail on the first turn then stalked into the
backstretch, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths, drifted leaving the turn and ran evenly in the
stretch. ALDARIGHTTRICKS took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the early pace, was met toward the half mile pole and dueled at mostly
even terms through the backstretch, contested the rail through the far turn but flattened stride nearing mid-stretch. JUST CALL ME AL had a brief early lead
but was forced out into the opening turn, left the turn outside and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and
showed little more. MOON FALL showed little response through the backstretch. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP was not a factor. I SEE NOTHING saved ground
on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT stumbled and lost his rider at
the break. A Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Espresso for interference into the first turn, lodged by the rider of Just Call
Me Al, resulted in the disqualification of the former to sixth place.

path and could only improve her position. SPARKLEINYOUREYE stumbled to her nose and made contact with Frenchies Gold leaving the gate then saved
ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and showed little in the lane. JUST HAVE FAITH
raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. DEREKA'S BLUFF rounded the first turn in the
four path, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the five path on the far turn. PHILMARY CASTLE rated close to the early
pace inside, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. PRINCESS HALO ducked out and made contact with
Frenchies Gold leaving the gate, raced in the four path the first turn and showed little response.
