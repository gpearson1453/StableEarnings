Footnotes
COACH RUBE chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in for the lead just inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear later yards. FANCY HER UP
was hustled to the lead approaching the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail, was met passing the sixteenth pole and
flattened stride later yards, but managed to hold onto second. GREAT SPIRIT gave chase, rounded the turn about the six path and was outfinished in the
stretch duel for second. BELLA MELA engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and ran evenly down the lane.
MANAROLA chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled to the six path approaching the head of the lane and finished evenly
outside. STRYDA pressured the pace but dropped back past the quarter pole, continued close in the three path on the turn but weakened the final sixteenth.
MACKENZIE'S MUSIC chased through the backstretch, raced two deep on the turn then flattened from mid-stretch. JUBA'S HOUSE chased outside, raced
in the six path on the turn and showed little in the lane. GHOSTLY SQUALL raced well back while saving ground and was eased in the stretch.
