Footnotes
J J'S JOKER tracked in the four to three path around the first turn, chased before ranging up five wide nearing the lane, bid outside of the leader coming to
midstretch and edged ahead. PEEK set the pace along the inside, showed the way around the far turn, entered the lane in the two path before embracing
an outer challenge nearing at the furlong grounds, but was bested in the late stages. GAME WARDEN tracked along the inside, smoothly shifted outside of
the leader to take aim from among rivals turning for home, but lacked a bid and fended off an inner rival for show. RUNNINGFORJOY took contact from an
outer rival while breaking a bit flat-footedly, saved ground in midpack, chased along the fence to bid for show in the final furlong, but was kept at bay.
ARCHIE THE GIZA bumped an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, shifted five wide entering the lane, but lugged inwardly slightly
in upper stretch, straightened course and ran on. CAFE RACER prompted outside of the leader chased the one while among foes around the far turn, got
floated three wide turning for home and gave way on his left lead. BARNSTORMING had his right hind heel clipped by an outer rival shortly after the start,
stalked three wide, chased around the far turn, then faded four wide and between horses in upper stretch. CASHMEUP pursued from midpack in the four to
three path, fanned to the five path around the far turn before being floated six wide entering the lane, and tired. TEXAS PRIDE clipped an inner rival's heels
soon after the start, lagged behind, cut the gap while saving ground around the far turn and made little impact on his left lead. ACTIVE DUTY stumbled at
the start, got keen racing into the first turn, faltered between foes approaching the backstretch and was outrun thereafter. SURFACE TO AIR lacked speed
in the five to four path around the first turn and made little impact. DR KRINGLE lacked speed in the two to four path and faded.

Footnotes
ROYAL SLIPPER sped clear soon after the start, showed the way while tucking to the two path entering the turn, then widened under steadily handling to be
kept to task through the final furlong. LOVELAND chased the clear leader from the inside, then kicked away from the rest of the field in upper stretch and
proved second best. TANYA SHOWERS was a bit tough to load, laid off of the pace in the four path and stayed on between horses to gain show in the final
furlong. CHILLED pursued from midpack in the three path, inched closer in the five path nearing the lane to gain show at the quarter pole, but lacked a
further bid thereafter and yielded. CHARLOTTESAPPROVAL lacked speed three to two wide into the turn, spun to the five path entering the lane and
stayed on willingly. TWIRL AROUND was reluctant to load into the starting gate, then bobbled inwardly once the barriers sprung, shied slightly from an inner
rival in the aftermath, then was urged along off of the pace in the two path into the turn and failed to threaten. SISTER ELLA tracked along the inside,
chased into the final furlong and faded. LEMON MUFFIN broke slowly, saved ground far back, but to no avail. LADY CHAI broke slowly but avoided
crowded quarters by doing so, lacked speed while hung five wide into the turn, moved up while fanning to the six path entering the lane and failed to
menace on her left lead. BRIGHT LADY DAY chased from midpack in the two to three path and faded. WESTERN GAILES stalked two wide but weakened
between horses entering the lane. YAREE D TAT was outrun in the three to two path.

TWO ITEM SAVER tracked at the tail end of the short field and from the two path, picked up stride by splitting foes in the three path passing the three
furlong pole, bid three wide at the five sixteenths pole and drove clear in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead. YES DAY staked along the inside,
attempted a bid inside of the leader through narrow quarters at the five sixteenths pole, but took contact from that one entering the lane while getting
outkicked by a outer bidder and ran on to be second best. NEW BEAT set the pace in the two path, met an inner challenge turning for home, kept that foe in
tight quarters nearing the lane, bumped that one while getting outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane and gave way on her left lead. H. T. XENA
pressed the leader from the three path, chased into the turn, but was floated four wide leaving the three quarter pole and subsequently weakened.

Footnotes
XTREME SMOKE SHOW tracked in the two path, picked up stride in the four path turning for home before fanning six wide entering the lane, rallied outside
of rivals in the final furlong and drove past the leaders crossing the sixteenth pole. OUR KEEPSAKE sparred for the lead two wide and between horses early
on, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart into the turn, took aim outside of that one and from the four path entering the lane, chased as an outer
rival ranged up alongside in the final furlong, bid along with that one at the sixteenth pole and got outkicked. DONE ENOUGH vied three wide, inched away
from inner rivals into the turn, built a clear lead while tucking to the two path passing the three furlong pole, maintained a wide margin through upper stretch,
but tired entering the final furlong and got caught by an outer pair at the sixteenth marker. TWIRLING QUEEN chased in the four to three path, fanned to the
five path entering the lane, but lugged inwardly while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch and lacked a bid. DOROTHY CROWFOOT laid off of the pace
in the five to six path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and failed to threaten. KENWICK was slow early on, lagged behind into the turn and surpassed tiring
rivals. LEMORIAN dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but gave way into the turn. ALMOND FUDGE lacked speed in the two path and tired.

Footnotes
BLING laid unhurried in the two path into the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, fanned out five wide in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes, took aim
on the clear leader in the final furlong, ranged up in the closing sixteenth and wrestled an advantage in the shadow of the wire. SASSY NATURE set the
pace, showed the way with a clear advantage in the two path around the turn, maintained a wide margin through midstretch, but was collared by an outer
bidder in the final sixteenth and got nailed. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) stalked along the inside, then chased while hanging on her left lead and narrowly
saved show at the wire. DETERMINED JESTER pursued from midpack three wide, then stayed on between horses in the final furlong and missed reaching
show. CONDENSATION trailed along the inside, shifted out coming to midstretch, rallied willingly outside of rivals in the final furlong but needed more to
gain show. STONE SILENT stumbled at the start, stalked three wide, chased around the turn, spun to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a bid
before yielding in tight quarters between horses at the furlong grounds. DARING DO tracked two wide and between horses, delayed a lead change until
nearing midstretch, then lacked a bid among foes in the final furlong. L J'S EMMA laid off of the pace in the two path, attempted to close in along the rail in
upper stretch, but encountered traffic leaving the furlong grounds. CUPIDS CRUSH laid off of the pace in the three to two path and between horses and
failed to factor.

Footnotes
BOURBON BREEZE laid close up along the inside, stalked into the turn, vacated the rail turning for home, encountered traffic in the three path in upper
stretch, remained blocked while loaded with run entering the final furlong, split foes three wide leaving that station, drove past the leader at the sixteenth
pole and surged clear. TAMMY LYNN prompted three wide, vied between horses around the turn, led in upper stretch but was caught by an outer bidder at
the sixteenth pole. PIN UP BETTY bobbled at the start, vied two wide and between horses, but got headed by an outer counterpart in upper stretch and
yielded late but saved show. BERLAINE tracked in the three path, tipped five wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase and missed reaching show.
C'EST CHEESE stalked five to four wide, bid nearing the lane, chased among foes and yielded a sixteenth from home. GOLD DEL MAR pursued from the
four path and failed to threaten. CIRCLING was last away while off a step slow, lacked speed, gained into the turn in the five path, sustained progress while
fanning seven wide entering the lane and leveled off. PLAGNE CHAMPAGNE lacked speed two wide and made little impact. POUR SOME WISDOM failed
to factor along the inside. EASY STREET lagged behind and surpassed tiring rivals. CAROLINA CANDY vied with a pair of outer rivals around the turn and
weakened entering the lane. SILVERY MOON pursued from midpack along the inside and weakened on her left lead.

HOIST THE GOLD prompted inside of a pair of foes early on, backed off to stalk approaching the half mile pole, ranged up outside of them turning for home,
bid in the four path entering the lane, drove clear approaching midstretch and held firm from a pair of outer pursuers late. NAKATOMI pursued from midpack
three wide, fanned six wide entering the lane, sustained a grinding rally to vie for place with an inner rival while chasing the leader in the late stages and
edged that position. BANGO tracked two wide, shifted five wide entering the lane, grinded away along with an outer rival into the final furlong, vied for place
with that one in the late stages and got bested. NECKER ISLAND was bumped and put to crowded quarters among foes at the start, lacked speed along the
inside, improved inside of rivals in upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong grounds and ran on. SIBELIUS vied two wide and between horses, then only
inside of a rival around the turn, but got headed in the two path in upper stretch and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. GULFSTREAM WAY
broke outwardly and bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, entered the lane in the four path and failed to threaten. MANNY
WAH tracked along the inside, took aim along fence in upper stretch and lacked a bid. DOCTOR OSCAR vied three to two wide into the turn, then in the
three path between horses entering the lane and gave way. TOP GUNNER took contact from an inner rival while put to crowded quarters at the start, laid off
of the pace in the two to three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. VOODOO ZIP lagged behind and got outrun. BAYTOWN
BEAR laid off of the pace four wide and faded in the six path entering the lane.

Footnotes
CANDIED pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, inched closer to the top trio while under a full head of steam in the four path around the far
turn, bid outside of them entering the lane, wrestled an advantage from an inner V V's DREAM in upper stretch and held firm while hanging on her left lead.
V V'S DREAM stalked three wide, pressed into the far turn, bid turning for home, but was headed by an outer bidder entering upper stretch, fought on
stubbornly through the final furlong but was bested. ALYS BEACH set the pace along the inside, clung to an advantage from an outer pair entering the far
turn, proved no match for wider rivals entering the lane and narrowly lasted for show. SHIMMERING ALLURE leaned outwardly and broke a step slow,
trailed, gained two wide around the far turn, then stayed on to miss reaching show. BRIGHTWORK pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far
turn, but weakened in upper stretch. CRAZY CAMI tracked along the inside, chased the leading trio around the far turn and faded. ALPINE PRINCESS was
fractious in the starting gate requiring her to be backed out for a veterinarian exam, was reloaded without further incident, lacked speed while hung four to
five wide around the first turn, retreated to trail by the five furlong pole and was outrun thereafter. WINE ON TAP laid off of the pace three wide, but faded
four wide into the far turn and was done early.

Footnotes
JOHNY'S FIREBALL stalked along the inside, then three wide around the far turn, rallied to bid along with an outer rival in midstretch, shifted out through
the final furlong and held firm. BEUYS (IRE) pursued from midpack in the two path, crept closer five wide around the far turn, rallied to bid along with an
inner rival at the furlong grounds, but was herded outwardly by that foe in the late stages and was kept at bay. NO ONE TO BLAME settled off of the pace
two wide, awaited racing room entering the lane, tipped three wide approaching midstretch, and rallied but needed more. SCRIPT tracked in the two path,
but faded in the four path and between horses turning for home, yet regained stride in the five path in upper stretch to stay on between horses. POINT
PROVEN saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of rivals entering the lane to gain place, but only managed to chase from there. WAKE SURF laid
off of the pace three wide, fanned to the six path in upper stretch and failed to menace. UNDERDRESSED took light contact from rivals on both sides at the
start, tracked along the inside chased two wide and between horses around the far turn and faded. COLOSSEO set the pace along the inside, but was
headed by an outer pair nearing midstretch and weakened. DRAKON made little impact at the rear four wide. BULLSEYE BUN pressed two wide but
weakened between horses entering the lane. THE RIDER AND TRAINER OF BEUYS (IRE) CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF JOHNYS
FIREBALL FOR INTERFENCE IN THE STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
