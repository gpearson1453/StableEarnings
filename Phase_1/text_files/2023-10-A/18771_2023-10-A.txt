Footnotes
DUKES GONNA TAPIT tracked the pace four wide, rallied while drifting in a bit through the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a
drive. LAST GLORY was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up for the place in the final
strides. QUICK RECOVERY raced up close between foes early, checked and bumped late on the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn, angled out
in upper stretch, lugged in through the stretch run, rallied for a share but was outkicked for the place late. CROWN JAK had speed at the rail, chased inside
around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. PLATINUM ROCKER prompted the pace three wide, steadied off heels nearing the eighth pole and
lacked a clear path from there. TAKING IT ALL was crowded at the start, sped forward between foes not long after, set the pace in the two path and gave
way nearing the sixteenth pole. AIR FORCE BABE raced in range outside early, was bumped nearing the turn, raced four wide around the bend and lacked
a rally. DREAMY failed to menace while racing six wide. MY SWEETHEART DANI played no factor while racing five wide. REVOLU was outrun inside.
GOOD MAGIC WOMAN was bumped at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
ONE TRACK MINE stalked in the three path, bid under rousing from the two path into the far turn, took the lead turning into the lane, and was driven clear.
NOTHING BUT PUMPS rated inside, stumbled going into the far turn, advanced inside of foes passing the quarter before swinging out to the four path into
the lane, and kept on for place. CAPTURE THIS set an open pace in the two path, was roused along the inside going into the far turn, but lost the lead
turning into the lane, and evened out for show. KRABI laid in range under a hold along the rail, was coaxed in the two path early around the far turn, swung
out to the five path entering the stretch, but flattened out on her left lead. GRATIA was a bit rank while off the pace in the five path turning into the
backstretch, and made on impact. ROUGH ENOUGH tracked in the four path, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, but faded on her left lead.
FUNTASTICA laid off the pace between foes in the three path, tipped out to the five path under coaxing early into the far turn, but was empty in the two path
at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
BEASTLY SPEED had an awkward start and was bumped by an inner foe, tracked in the five path, was roused to bid in the four path passing the three
eighths pole, took the lead passing the quarter, and opened up in the two path down the lane under a drive. SOUTHERN DREAM chased inside, angled out
midway around the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and kept on for place. BETTA GO GO GO broke out and bumped an outer foe, pressed in
the four path, took over the lead while in the three path early into the turn, lost the lead passing the quarter, flattened into the final furlong, but held show in a
photo. SONG ON THE RADIO was prompted along from in range in the three path, ridden around the turn, tipped out to the four path entering the stretch,
drifted out late while finishing evenly, and just missed getting up for show in a photo. VINICIO had an awkward start, raced well behind in the four path, and
made no impact from the six path in the stretch. TIZADUKE set the pace in the two path, but lost the lead early into the turn, and faded turning into the
stretch.

Footnotes
LACE UP stalked the pace three wide, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew off under a drive. KHOOLZAN set the pace in the two path, was
collared leaving the eighth pole and kept on well to be clearly second best. REEF RUNNER raced in range five wide around the turn, continued on the left
lead in the lane and was up for the show. KING FALIERO chased the pace from the rail and weakened in the drive. EKATI KING raced off the pace three
wide and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. AWESOME TRAIN hit the starting gate, raced two wide and never threatened. LENA'S JAZZ was off a step
slow, raced well back three wide and lacked a closing bid. CURLINS CRUZIN had only brief speed four wide. JIGSAW chased the pace four wide and came
up empty in the stretch. SMOKIN JACK FLASH threw his head at the start, raced a bit erratically down the backstretch, went two wide around the turn and
had little left for the drive. NATIONAL was sluggish at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
BATTLE CRY tracked in the three path, was coaxed early into the far turn, tipped out to the four path nearing the eighth pole, and rallied past an inner duo
in the final strides. GO BIG GREEN prompted the pace in the four path, bid under a ride early around the far turn, kept on from the three path into the lane,
took a short lead passing the sixteenth, but was quickly caught by a surging outer foe to place. CHICK'S SHADOW set the pace in the three path, was
challenged by an outer foe while in the two path early into the far turn, dug in to hold onto the lead going into the final furlong, but faded late to show.
MIDNIGHT BELLA stalked in the five path, was roused midway around the far turn, under right handed encouragement while still in the five path entering
the lane, but was one paced. LOVE HER LOTS chased in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch,
but flattened. DON'T GET PICKLED trailed in the two path, moved up a spot turning into the stretch, but did not threaten. GOLDEN HAVEN rated inside of
foes from the two path, but was no menace.

the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner through the stretch but was unable to gain on that foes. KHOSEA raced off the pace four and five wide, could
not threaten the winner but stayed on to gain the show. GOLDEN VOICE raced in range four wide, dropped back three wide between foes around the far
turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and had a slight gain inside of foes. CRYSTAL COAST raced in range two wide, continued on the left lead in the
lane, made some progress in upper stretch then flattened out. SHE FLED THE SCENE saved ground and failed to menace. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS
played no factor while racing three and four wide. LADY DOMINANCE had her head turned at the start and was off very slowly, saved ground off the pace
and never threatened. ZISISIT (IRE) tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. STREAKING GREY steadied along inside through the
opening quarter and had no response around the far turn.

Footnotes
ANAMNESTIC tracked in the four path, was roused into the far turn, took the lead midway around the far turn, was challenged by an outer foe going into the
stretch, lost the lead passing the eighth pole, but dug in to get back up on the wire. BACKCHAT trailed in the four path, circled inner foes in the six path
around the far turn, bid at the top of the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, but hung late to be caught by an inner foe. STARSHIP WIZARD bumped
with an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack in the two path, was ridden between foes in the four path turning into the lane, tipped inwards, and kept on for
show. HAPPYISASHAPPYDOES hopped at the start, chased in the two path, angled out under drive around the far turn, swung from the seven path into the
lane, but was one paced. C MY MEISTER rated in the three path, dopped back and was under coaxing early around the far turn, fanned out to the eight
path into the stretch, but made no impact. CAPTURE THE TIME prompted the pace between foes in the three path, was driven from said position into the
stretch, but faded in the final furlong. GENTLEMAN GERRY stalked inside, was under coaxing in the two path early around the far turn, but flattened down
the lane. THE MAR raced off the pace in the five path and did not threaten. HONESTO had a slow start, moved up outside of foes around the first turn to vie
for the lead in the five path down the backstretch, led from the three path into the far turn, but yielded entering the lane. WICKED SUPRISE bumped with an
outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead in the two path down the backstretch but gaveway around the far turn.

STEAL SUNSHINE settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under a drive.
POSITIVE REVIEW stalked the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, led to upper stretch, was no match for the winner but
stayed on to hold the place. EASTSIDE COOL stalked the pace from the rail, bid nearing the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper
stretch but kept trying inside of foes to hold the show. LIGHTNING TONES failed to menace while racing four wide. BROOKLYN STRONG was fractious in
the gate, broke awkwardly and was outrun while racing two and three wide. GRAND DAVID set the pace in the two path and gave way near the
three-eighths marker.

Footnotes
MUTAAWID raced wellback in the four path, was roused into the far turn, fanned out to the nine path entering the lane, rallied wile drifting inwards, and was
up around the final sixteenth. CALIFORNIA FROLIC chased in the two path, was driven in the three path around the far turn, shifted out to the six path
entering the stretch, and ran on for place. HOT BLOODED tracked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, and kept on from the rail into the stretch for
show. STAT set an open pace in the two path, was confidently nudged around the far turn, cued at the top of the lane, but faded in the final furlong.
ELDON'S PRINCE bumped at the start with an outer foe, trailed in the five path, circled inner foes from the six path around the far turn, floated out to the
eight path entering the stretch, and stayed on. MARWAD (GB) bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the five path, was under left handed urging
turning into the stretch, but flattened. LOVE ME NOT laid up close in the four path early, was under a heavy drive turning into the stretch, and faded. NIGHT
JUMPER was held up off the pace in the three path but never threatened. LOGICO rated in the four path but was no menace. FIGURETI (CHI) raced in
midpack from the three path, but backed up early into the far turn.

Footnotes
MACASSA broke well but settled off the early pace outside, angled in midway around the turn, cut the corner into the lane, took over inside of foes nearing
the eighth pole, tipped into the two path and drove clear. ACTION ROSE was bumped at the start, raced up close inside, tipped two wide near the quarter
pole, bid between foes in midstretch and was outkicked. INTO TOURING was bumped at the start, raced well back four wide and rallied for the show. VAL'S
GAL broke awkwardly, dueled in the three path, led to midstretch and weakened. SHE'S SO BEARRISH stalked the duel three wide and faded in the
stretch. TAYYARA was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) was shuffled back not long after the start,
raced off the pace three and four wide and lacked a rally. YLANG YLANG had her head turned at the start, saved ground and made little impact. OUR
FORTUNE COOKIE dueled inside in the two path and faltered in upper stretch. MUSICAL JOURNEY was outrun while racing two wide. DELTA RED trailed
outside.
