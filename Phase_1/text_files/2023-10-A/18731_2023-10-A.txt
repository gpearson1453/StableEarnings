PROVIDING chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the bend, drew off in the lane and was vanned
off after the wire. WIN OR CELLAR tracked the pace setters on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, moved up while racing in the two path
around the turn and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased that rival home from there. THROWBACK pressed the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, bumping with ANGELIC GAL when G G'S DARK STAR drifted out, navigated the bend from the three and four path and was outkicked in the
lane. G G'S DARK STAR dueled on the inside up the backstretch, drifted out bumping with ANGELIC GAL and THROWBACK in the process, raced in the
three path around the turn and gave way entering the stretch. ANGELIC GAL dueled between horses early, bumping with both THROWBACK and G G'S
DARK STAR when her inside rival drifted out, came around the turn in the three and four path and tired in the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE
INTO THE BACKSTRETCH. UPON REVIEW, HORSE 1, G G'S DARK STAR WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE.

DON'T TELL KELLY saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, took over while saving ground around the far bend and
drew off in the stretch, much the best. TURBO MILLIE saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far
bend in the two path and kept on in the lane, no match for the winner. EASTERN SUNRISE dueled on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, chased the frontrunner from the two path around the second turn and weakened in the lane. AMORICA bobbled slightly leaving the gate, raced
in the two path around the first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three and four path
and showed no kick. FOREVER HOPEFUL stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening half mile, dropped back while racing in the two and three
path around the far turn and continued to flatten out from there. INTOLERANT saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch and around
the second bend off the pace on the inside and made no bid.

Footnotes
JUST PLAIN ORNERY saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, shook clear while saving ground around the far bend and drew
off in the lane, under wraps at the wire. LAWLESSNESS saved ground early, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around
the far bend in the two path and improved position in the lane. RUTHENIAN raced in the two path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the second turn from the three path and finished evenly. HONOR MY WORLD pressed the pace on the outside
through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the two path and weakened in the stretch. HE'S ON FIRE bobbled slightly at the start,
raced in the four path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and was outkicked from there.
STREET LAMP raced in the three path around the first bend, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
faded in the lane. STARSHIP GOTHAM raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, navigated the second bend from the three and four
path and made no bid. PAPA JIMMY saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began
to drop back while racing on the rail around the far bend and continued to tire in the lane.

WICKED T saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and improved position in the
stretch but was no match for the winner. MIKEY'S JEWEL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the second
bend in the four path and chased the winner home in the lane, no match for that rival. CAGED PIXIE raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far bend still in the two path and weakened in the stretch. NURSE RACHETT stalked the pace setter
on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the second bend and faded in the lane. FREE KITTY raced in the
two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began to tire while saving ground around the far bend and was
eased across the finish.
