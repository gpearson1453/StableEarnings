Footnotes
SMILING FELON settled off of the early pace leaving the start, tracked the decent pace from the inside and was well positioned heading into the turn, raced
in the two path heading to the quarter marker, was guided back to the inside into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded to firm
urging into the final sixteenth, overtook the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final strides to prevail. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE was sent
leaving the break, was engaged by DEFENSOR FORTIS in the early stages and set a pressured pace to the half-mile marker, showed the way from the two
path into the turn and was confronted nearing the quarter marker by RESERVE PROOF, shook free of that rival into the stretch and extended the lead at the
furlong grounds, held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, was confronted in deep stretch by SMILING FELON and was tagged for the win in the final strides,
while besting the rest. RESERVE PROOF stalked the decent early pace while outside of runners, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, lost
ground into the stretch and chased CHELSIESDANZIGLITE to the furlong pole, weakened in the final stages and was clear in the end for third. DEFENSOR
FORTIS was prominent away from the gate and pressed the decent early pace while inside of the pacesetter, lost a bit of ground along the turn, angled four
wide into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. SMILING PREACHER chased the decent early pace while between rivals, lost position into the turn, came
three wide into the stretch and was outrun in the drive.

Footnotes
GRIT AND CURIOSITY was squeezed at the break and was off a step slowly, recovered in the opening furlong and tracked outside of rivals heading to the
half-mile marker, gained ground while three wide along the turn, swung to the five path into upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker while within
range, rallied into deep stretch, surged in the final strides and was up in time for the win. SPEEDING STYLE was forwardly placed away from the start,
tracked the early pace then advanced to contest the pace at the half-mile marker, disputed the pace from the two path along the turn, took a narrow lead
into the stretch and shook free approaching the furlong grounds, was all out into the final sixteenth, met the bid of GRIT AND CURIOSITY into deep stretch
and was just missed in the final strides, while holding for second at the finish. HARBOR SKY settled outside of runners in the early stages, advanced
heading to the half-mile pole and pressed the pace while three wide into the turn, disputed the moderate fractions heading to the quarter marker, lost a bit of
ground to SPEEDING STYLE into the stretch and chased that rival to the furlong grounds while four wide, vied between runners into deep stretch, came in a
bit tight in the final sixteenth and was outfinished by the top pair, while clear of the rest for third. PERFORMATIVE was forwardly placed away from the start
and tracked the pace while inside of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, maintained a two wide path into the turn and chased between runners heading to
the quarter pole, made a mild gain while two wide into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final stages and gave way. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was
prominent leaving the start and disputed the decent early pace, lost position along the turn and chased into upper stretch, re-bid along the rail into
mid-stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened. ARTHUR SPOONER broke alertly and vied for the early lead, raced close to
the decent early pace heading to the half-mile marker, lost position along the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BY MY SIDE was sent leaving the start and contested the solid early pace while outside of SILVER MATY, dueled from the three path along the turn, shook
free into the stretch, was kept to task under firm urging into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive to prevail in a good
debut. ELEGANT BOY was bumped then shuffled back at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to track the early pace while between rivals in the
second flight, improved position on the turn while three wide, was roused four wide into the stretch, finished well in the final furlong, could not reel in the
winner in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for second. JOEY BRACKETS tracked the solid early pace while inside of rivals, improved position on the
turn while two wide, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final furlong, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third.
CRAZY STORM was away in good order and took back off of the solid early pace, tracked four wide along the turn, improved position into the stretch and
offered a mild late rally. SILVER MATY was asked for speed away from the start and was prominent early, disputed the solid early pace with BY MY SIDE
and carved quick fractions into the turn, dueled inside of BY MY SIDE approaching the quarter marker, lost position heading to the furlong grounds, lacked a
response in deep stretch and faded. CLICKING broke slowly and spotted the field away from the gate, raced a bit greenly in the early stages while trailing,
was able to improve position into the stretch but did not threaten. SINGING N DANZING was forwardly placed in the early stages and chased the solid early
pace from the inside, lost position along the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ELEGANCE CODE settled off of the fast early pace and came two wide into the backstretch run, tracked the solid fractions to the half-mile pole, loomed
three wide approaching the quarter marker and took command into the stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, was beginning to tire into deep
stretch and switched to the left lead into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off the runner-up in the final strides and lasted while fully extended to prevail
at the finish. STEIN'S GIRL saved ground while unhurried in the early stages, improved position along the backstretch run, came in a bit tight entering the
far turn and was taken off of the rail heading to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong pole, closed willingly in
the final sixteenth, pressured ELEGANCE CODE in the final strides and just missed for the win, while well clear of the rest. LIGHT UP settled off of the rapid
early pace, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, was steered three wide into the far turn and improved position nearing the top of the lane,
made a five wide bid into the stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair in the final stages and was outkicked, while holding clearly for third. ST HELENA
tracked the quick early pace from a two wide path, was well positioned through the backstretch run while in pursuit of the dueling pacesetters, came two
wide to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and gave way.
LUVAHAPPYENDING broke a step slowly, was hustled outside of rivals into the first turn and engaged with LILA AT THE BEACH to dispute solid fractions
into the backstretch run, dueled through a rapid pace through the half-mile marker and into the far turn, was confronted by ELEGANCE CODE nearing the
quarter marker and was overtaken by that rival into upper stretch, weakened approaching the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. LILA AT THE
BEACH broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, was engaged by LUVAHAPPYENDING along the first turn and contested fast fractions
with that rival into the backstretch run, carved out a fast pace heading to the half-mile pole, was overtaken midway through the far turn, dropped back into
the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COUNTING CARDS was well placed in the early running and stalked the decent pace to the half-mile pole, mounted a three wide bid approaching the
quarter marker and vied for the lead into upper stretch, shifted to the four path at the furlong marker and was kept to task under firm urging to the final
sixteenth, felt pressure from BLAZING JAMIE into deep stretch, found more in the final stages, repelled that rival's bid and edged away in the end to prove
best. BLAZING JAMIE tracked the decent early pace while outside of rivals, improved position along the turn then waited for racing room at the quarter
marker, continued to be blocked into upper stretch, found a seam while three wide heading to the furlong grounds, vied for the lead with COUNTING
CARDS into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and held for second at the finish. TRINIDAD settled off of the decent
early pace and trailed into the turn, was roused leaving the three-furlong pole and loomed four wide nearing the top of the stretch, raced widest into the drive
and continued to gain ground approaching mid-stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong, was outkicked and held clearly at the
finish for third. ARTEMUS GORDON tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, lost position on the turn while two wide, angled to the three path
into upper stretch and finished evenly in the drive. JEDI KNIGHT broke alertly, showed good speed away from the start and dictated terms in the early
going, was engaged by his stablemate and set a pressured pace into the turn, set decent fractions from the two path along the bend, was overtaken into
upper stretch, chased to the furlong marker and faded in the late stages. LUCKY LAD was hustled to be forwardly placed in the early running, raced close to
the early pace and pressed inside of JEDI KNIGHT approaching the turn, lost position heading to the quarter marker, chased the leaders into the stretch and
tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MOB BOSS broke sharply and was well-handled racing on the outside of a trio contesting the early pace, dueled with KHAIKY'S COMMAND through the
turn after OBVIOUS dropped back, put away the former before the quarter pole, opened up in the stretch and held the latter at bay under intermittent urging
to the wire. OBVIOUS broke well and was hustled to the front, became the inside horse in a three way speed duel through the initial furlong, backed off the
pace passing the seven-sixteenths marker, angled off the rail near the quarter pole and re-rallied to challenge MOB BOSS, ran on well down the stretch but
was unable to reel in the winner. DR PESCADO came under pressure early to stay close to the early pace, became hard to place in the run down the
backstretch, took an inside path through the turn, swung into the stretch three wide while still under a ride and chugged home to gain the show. MIGHTY
MATT broke a step slow then made contact with EMERALD MAGIC a few steps out of the gate, began to make up ground from the three furlong pole while
racing wide through the turn, was four wide turning for home and made up some ground in the stretch. EMERALD MAGIC broke out at the start, was
bumped off stride after making contact with MIGHTY MATT, steadied, then was a distant last of a strung out field down the back stretch, started an
extended rally while saving ground through the turn, tipped wide into the stretch and gained some ground in the late stages. KHAIKY'S COMMAND was
very quick into stride and raced between three horses contesting the early pace, went on to duel with MOB BOSS through the turn, began to weaken at the
five-sixteenths pole, continued on with good courage but was spent from earlier efforts. MUAY THAI (IRE) got away well, was pushed to press the pace
through the early running, made a nice move through the turn to get into contention approaching the quarter pole then did not go on and struggled to keep
up down the lane.
