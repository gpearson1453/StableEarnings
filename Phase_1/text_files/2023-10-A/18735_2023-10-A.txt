Footnotes
LOONY settled just off the dueling leaders into the turn, moved through along the rail to gain the lead before mid-turn, cleared in late turn, slowly widened
inside the eighth pole and held. MONUMENTALJUSTICE was unhurried along the inside through the turn, continued along the rail into the lane and finished
with good energy to be clear for the place spot. CHA CHA LARRY vied with another into the turn while in the two path, lost the lead in mid-turn, continued to
chase the winner into the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole. GUN BUDDY saved ground through the turn and into the lane and moved up while not
a serious threat. MR NEGATIVITY vied for the lead into the turn, settled back through late turn then tired through the final eighth. SHOWDOWN JUSTICE
raced in the four path down the backstretch and into the turn when not far back, lost ground through late turn and into the lane and was empty after the
eighth pole while in the five path. BIG CITY HEAT chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn then faded down the lane. ADAMANTLY
CROSS raced in the five path into the far turn and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
TREE OF LIBERTY set the pace from the two path through the turn while under pressure, cleared into the lane while moving into the five path, continued
under strong handling and held. MOPED MO stalked the pace from the four path into the turn, bid into the lane from the six path and was inching up late but
settled for second best. COMMANDER STORM tracked the pacesetters while along the inside, had aim on the top ones into the lane but lacked the needed
kick in a good debut effort. MIDNITESTATEOFMIND saved ground through the turn, gained momentum through the lane and finished with good energy.
BLACK WHITE N GOLD raced in the two path through the turn when near the back, angled into the five path for the drive and offered a mild gain. GIRVIN
CITY LIMITS pressed the winner two the three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and weakened. OUT WORK'M raced in the two
path through the turn and lacked a closing response. BOZAANO raced in the three path through the turn while never far back then tired. MIKE'S CYCLONE
never a factor while racing near the rail through the turn and into the lane. TIZAWHITEFACECAT was off a step slow and to the inside, raced well back
throughout.

Footnotes
BARB'S VORTEX saved ground while tracking the pacesetters through the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, gained a clear lead outside the eighth pole
and held. KENNEDY HEIGHTS was in the three path through the far turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the four path, languished a bid
through the lane then found energy late to be up for the place spot. GOLDEN HEIST set the pace from the two path and under pressure from several,
yielded the top spot to the winner into the lane then stayed on well to last for the show spot. LUNAR LACE saved ground through the turn, was gaining
momentum in late turn when jostled in tight, regained energy down the lane and just was nodded for the show spot. HEAVENLY RICH raced in the two path
through the turn and into the lane, shifted out an into the six path nearing the sixteenth pole and offered a mild gain. SIGNATURE CALL raced in the two
path through the turn and into the lane, was still a threat inside the eighth pole then weakened late. MISS DIAMOND RICH moved four wide through the far
turn to get closer, swung into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. BIRDSOFAFEATHER trailed into the backstretch, continued off the inside
into the far turn, was five wide through the turn, came into the lane from the nine path and made no impact. ZIPSY ROSE LEE never a factor while in the
eight path through the lane. TAMARAC LADY chased the pace from the three path into the turn, was asked for more through mid-turn and was empty after
entering the lane. RAISE N PRAISE was six ide through the first turn and was always outrun. CHIRP CHIRP was in the four path through the far turn when
in mid-pack and was empty turning into the lane.

LIFE'S JOY dueled inside of a rival, bid at the quarter pole, was clear in the stretch, then held off the closers under steady urging. EDGE OF TOWN broke
inward, stalked the pace inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole and rallied late to miss. MUSICAL DIVA broke outward, dueled inside of the winner,
was steadied at the quarter pole in tight quarters, tried to go outside of the winner, then went back to the rail and bid late. BEEHIVE stalked the pace in the
three pace before rallying late. NOTA BELLE hopped at the start, was unrushed in the three path, angled to the rail at the eighth pole and rallied strongly.
RUMBRANDT stalked between foes, then bid belatedly. FOURFIFTYSEVEN was bumped on both sides at the start, stalked and faded. PERFECT
MANHATTAN was through early. TROUBLE WITH SUGAR raced in the four path before fading. The Stewards disallowed an objection by the rider of

Footnotes
CAIRO'S GHOST was unhurried while along the inside, began moving closer in mid-turn, cut the corner into the lane, moved to the leader, dueled with that
one through the final eighth and just inched up. PRESIDER set the pace of a clear lead through the far turn, was still clear with an eighth to go was joined on
both sides inside the sixteenth pole, dueled with those two and gave ground grudgingly. CABLE BOSS saved ground through the turn, came off the rail into
the lane and into the three path, moved to the leader approaching the sixteenth pole and was inching up to the wire. CHANNEL Z was in the three path
through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. AMERICAN RAIDER raced near the inside through the turn an moved up along the rail while not a
menace. LYTE CRUDE tracked the pace along the inside through mid-turn, came off the rail into the lane and tired. SATURDAY LONG LEGS was
restrained early while in the three path, continued to chase the pace while off the inside into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn and was empty
turning into the lane while moving into the seven path. BORDER PATROL raced in the three path through the turns and tired. RAVEN'S NEST never a
factor from off the inside. GUADALAJARA chased the pace from the four path down the backstretch and was done entering the far turn. RODIN raced in the
back into the turn and was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
FAITHFUL RULER was clear early, led inside, was challenged on the turn, then lasted under steady handling. MANUELITO stalked the pace between foes,
altered course to the rail at the eighth pole and rallied strongly. BOURBON SPIRIT pressed the pace five wide, bid at the quarter pole but couldn't get to the
winner. BONNIE BILL stalked the pace inside, then couldn't close late. SINNER'S SIN stalked the pace between rivals, rallied six wide at the quarter pole,
then faltered in the stretch. SAND MOUNTAIN was hard to load, then was off awkwardly and improved position late outside. A FEW TOO MANY raced
evenly four wide. ZAPPINIT pressed the pace in the three path, bid at the quarter pole, then faltered. BRUSTER JUSTICE pressed the pace in the two path
before fading on the turn. MENDENHALL raced in the five path and had no late bid.
