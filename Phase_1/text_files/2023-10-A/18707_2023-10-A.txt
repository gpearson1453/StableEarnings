THAT'S THE WAY trailed into the stretch, closed fast four wide while splitting rivals through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. SURROUNDER
pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead late then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. NAMBITI stalked the pace into the
stretch, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the furlong marker then was outfinished. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE never far back, inched closer four wide through
the turn then failed to sustain that bid. WHAT A RUSH broke in front, set a pressured pace in the two path until deep stretch and weakened late.

SERVE REVENGE COLD set the pace along the inside, was headed by the runner up at the three sixteenths pole, fought back gamely under left handed
urging brushing that one late and proved best in a game effort. GOLD N SILVER pressed the pace two wide to the top of the stretch, gained a narrow lead,
was brushed by the winner late and finished second best. RUMBLE STRIP RON stalked the pace along the inside and went evenly. VISUAL MISSION
moved closer three wide before a half then failed to sustain that bid. SEND ME ON trailed. THE RIDER OF GOLD N SILVER LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

EXPRESS FASHION chased the leader into the stretch, was carried out to the middle of the racetrack by that one past the three sixteenths pole, made the
lead late and prevailed under strong handling. FABULOUS CLOWN broke inward bumping BEAUTIFUL LASS at the start, trailed through the turn, closed
willingly along the inside through the stretch and just missed getting up in time. BEAUTIFUL LASS was bumped at the start, sprinted to a daylight lead soon
thereafter, set the pace into the stretch, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and weakened in the final furlong. KISSTHECROSS failed to menace.

start, trailed into the stretch and found his best stride late in the six path. GIZMO'S MISSION chased the winner from the two path and faded late. HEART
OF AN ANGEL was bumped at the start and no threat. ANGEL'S SOUPERSTAR was no factor. FAIR TO MIDDLIN stalked the pace into the tunr, got out
