Footnotes
LOVING CUP , in a bit tight at the break, recovered and was patiently handled off the pace, edged up behind rivals while in hand leaving the three eighths,
responded to left handed asks near mid stretch then worked between runners, overtook HAPPY CLOUDS in deep stretch then went clear at the wire.
HAPPY CLOUDS rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, advanced between runners leaving the five sixteenths, took command
soon after, spurted away after being set down in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive past the furlong grounds, kept on gamely but was unable to
withstand the winner's charge. SHINY SLAM stalked off the rail, quickly gained three deep and challenged for the lead nearing the quarter pole, wandered
outward in upper stretch, was corrected and pursued to mid stretch then flattened out. ALLIALLIOXENFREE sped to the early lead, was hounded from her
outside then ceded the lead around the far turn, began a retreat leaving mid turn, checked off heels with a quarter to go and faltered. FAST COREY vied
outside a rival then shook clear leaving the far turn, was overtaken past the five sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
P J'S RIDER , bumped at the break, edged up three wide between rivals and took over heading to the half mile marker, went clear under a light hold around
the turn, opened up after being put a ride in upper stretch, kept on under a drive leaving mid stretch, wandered outward through the final seventy yards and
just lasted. HONOR THE TRUTH broke inward and bumped with the winner, corrected and dropped well off the early pace, gathered some momentum
three wide into the lane, worked her way between rivals leaving the three sixteenths, altered out with a furlong remaining, rapidly closed the gap but had her
run fall just short. BLUE HOUR , four wide tracking past the half, dropped in a path and stalked outside the winner, failed to quicken with that one in upper
stretch, pursued past mid stretch then came up empty. VOODOO PRIESTESS lagged outside a rival, raced three wide in upper stretch and got past tiring
rivals. SUPER MONEY broke a step slow, was hustled up early while saving ground, gained a bit mid turn, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded.
PASSIONFORQUALITY , urged along off the pace while saving ground, failed to respond. GINAMAYA had speed inside rivals, ceded command heading to
the half mile pole, wandered outward nearing the lane and tired.

WIRED IN hugged the inner rail stalking the pace for six furlongs, eased out to the two path at the head of the stretch, bid for the lead outside FLEETS BAY
near the sixteenth pole, dueled with that one and narrowly prevailed. FLEETS BAY set the pace along the inner rail, held a clear lead turning for home, was
challenged by the winner, dug in stubbornly and just missed. PIETRELCINA , off slowly, raced three wide the first turn, was four deep leaving the far turn
and rallied outside the top pair. WE GOT LUCKY lacked speed, circled the far turn four deep, floated five wide at the head of the stretch and rallied mildly.
RUN ROCKY RUN chased the pace outside the top pair to the stretch then tired n upper stretch. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE raced in mid pack to the
stretch, moved to the outside in mid stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. HEART OF FIRE raced along the inner rail to mid stretch, angled out and
weakened. HARNESS CREEK , shuffled back soon after the break, was outrun and lost ground on the turns. SPUNKY IRISHMAN , rank and steadied along
the inner rail on the first turn, was outrun. DISCREET LOVE was no factor.

VICTIM OF THE NITE , away last when breaking in the air and spotting the field a couple of lengths, regrouped and tugged his way forward while racing to
the inside of rivals, steadied when keen off foes into the turn, recovered raced well in hand edging up between foes around the turn, dropped in to about the
two path and took aim soon into the stretch, worked outward for room leaving the eighth pole, closed determinedly under a drive and collared the leader
leaving the sixteenth pole, wore that one down and was going away at the wire. FACE ABARRIO sped up to take command between rivals and set the pace
off the inside, was nicely rated two wide around the turn, repelled initial threats approaching the quarter pole, spurted away when put to serious asking in
upper stretch, wandered outward when meeting the winner's bid a sixteenth out, dueled briefly then gave way grudgingly. BOX N BEN drafted back off the
early pace, steadied briefly heading to the half, raced three wide into the lane, swung outside rivals to be in about the six path past mid stretch and churned
on. BILL OF RIGHTS , off a beat slow, lost ground five wide advancing to the half, continued about five wide past the five sixteenths, ranged up to loom
outside runners into the stretch but flattened out through the final furlong. INSPIRED IRISH , four then three wide between runners stalking the pace,
challenged under a hustling ride near the quarter pole, gave hard chase to mid stretch then faded. BY ITS ABSENCE , forward early while saving ground,
dropped back a bit mid turn, failed to kick on along the rail in upper stretch and faded. NICK'S LITTLE BOY , five wide nearing the half, gave hard chase four
wide outside a rival nearing the quarter pole, raced between runners soon into the stretch and weakened. MALIBU COWBOY was rated back off foes early,
angled in heading to the turn, swung very wide in upper stretch but lacked a solid run. DUCKPINS gave hard chase two wide and between rivals and tired
nearing the lane.

CHEERS FOR KITTEN sprinted clear soon after the break, set the pace slightly off the rail, was challenged in mid stretch, dug in tenaciously and lasted.
PUTIN ONLINE , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, moved to the two path entering the
stretch and rallied inside the winner. BOSS IS A PAL , three wide chasing the winner around the turn, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and hung. LIVE
FIRE bore in after stumbling at the start, moved up in the four path between horses in mid stretch and rallied mildly. BOURBON CURRENCY lacked speed,
was well off the inner rail on the turn swung to the six path in mid stretch and gained outside rivals. OUR HOISTED MAST void of speed, was blocked in
upper stretch, swung to the seven path near the eighth pole and passed faders. KINGPIN hugged the inner rail on the turn while stalking the pace,
weakened in mid stretch and was lightly steadied behind PPUTIN ONLINE inside the eighth pole. INDEFATIGABLE , always between horses, was within
striking position in mid stretch and weakened. FLASHINTHENIGHT , four wide on the turn, weakened. INSIDE STUNT trailed after being pinched back at
the start.

CAP CLASSIQUE , patiently handled outside rivals while in range of the dueling leaders, moved up four deep and in hand past the five sixteenths, struck
the top entering the lane, kicked clear after being put to some rousing soon after, was kept alert with a right handed ask leaving mid stretch then eagerly
widen while mildly hand ridden. ROANAN GODDESS stumbled at the break and was away last, recovered and quickly advanced along the rail into the turn,
awaited room behind rivals near the quarter pole, steadied then checked when blocked leaving the three sixteenths, remained stalled past mid stretch,
altered out and finally got clear inside the sixteenth marker, straightened away, finished up with a flourish to nab the place then kept on well through the
gallop out. CALL ANOTHER PLAY , coaxed along early then moved up between runners to stalk the leaders, angled four wide into the lane, ranged up
outside runners leaving mid stretch, kept on willingly but was nipped from her outside for the place. FAINOR'S FILETS disputed the pace three deep, fought
on between runners nearing the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. I'M A CUTIE PIE rushed clear soon after the break, was headed by a pair of
rivals to her outside leaving the four and a half furlong marker, stayed on to prompt, rebid along the rail entering the lane, stayed on willingly to deep stretch
then faded. BEACHFRONT BREEZE moved up between runners to poke a head in front after a furlong, dueled to the inside of FAINOR'S FILETS into and
around the turn, sparred between rivals past the three sixteenths then weakened late. DIVINE MAGIC , wide, failed to keep pace, faltered in upper stretch
and was eased through the final furlong.

along the inner rail, followed the winner in the two path leaving the far turn, moved up to mid stretch then flattened out. JOLLY BY GOLLY , rank and
steadied entering the first turn, raced five wide the far turn and past tired ones late. T REX , unhurried early, raced in the four path turning for home and

Footnotes
SUSTENANCE cleared early and set a rated pace towards the rail, moved away leaving the three eighths, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, drifted out
near the sixteenth pole, was corrected with right handed asks and held sway. GREAT CALL , three wide early while stalking the pace, dropped in near the
far turn, advanced along the rail nearing the lane, came back out nearing mid stretch and closed steadily. STEP AHEAD , three to four wide throughout,
moved up some leaving the far turn, pursued into the lane, came up empty late but had enough left to salvage the show. OBOY settled off the pace while
saving ground, moved up some past the half, angled out, circled five wide with a mild run into the stretch then flattened out through the final furlong.
ICETECA steadied at the break, lagged back early, raced three wide nearing the far turn and failed to menace. KAMIKAZE FOX , four wide early, was
outrun. FOR HONOR AND LUCK prompted the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths, faltered in upper stretch and was eased
late. BUKOVEL steadied soon after the break, lagged off the pace while saving ground and failed to make an impact.
