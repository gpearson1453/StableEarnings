WAR NOVEL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace while nicely rated and prevailed under mild urging. AULD LANGE SYNE settled
three wide, dug in late in the five path and got up for second. EXONERATED PREZ chased the winner into the far turn, loomed boldly two wide nearing the
quarter pole then was outfinished. DISCLOSURE allowed to settle, swung wide and had a mild late rally in the eight path. JACK'S ADVANTAGE saved
ground and went evenly. WILE E PEYOTE broke awkwardly, moved up two wide into the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. FRANCO was no factor.
NIXON JOY (ARG) was no threat.
