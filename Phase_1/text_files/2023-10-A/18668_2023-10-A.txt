around the far turn and never threatened. ICICLES pressed the early leader into the far turn from the outside and faded. DEVIL BLUE DRESS was bumped,
shuffled at the start, saved ground and never threatened. DREAM ON STORMY was forwardly place two deep early on and tired readily in the drive.

Footnotes
NORMANDY HERO tracked the top pair from the inside, confidently handled into the upper stretch, slipped through near the rail and finished well to get up
under strong handling. VALENTINE CANDY set a pressured pace along the inside, dug in two deep late and kept on gamely to the wire. HAUL settled to
race mid pack early, move up six wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. RACCOON RODEO raced off the early going, swung wide
into the upper lane and moved up to improve position. BAXLEY stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole, shifted in through the drive and
weakened. DUNPHY was slow early on, raced two to four wide around the far turn and lacked a rally. STORMQUIST raced near the back of the pack early,
was near the inside past the three eighths pole, raced three to four wide in the drive and had no late rally. LET'S GO MARK pressed outside of foe down the
backstretch and faded. ALDER raced mid pack, was three wide between near the five sixteenths pole and gave way. GENERAL BATTLE AXE was
unhurried early, saved ground and never threatened.

off the early going two deep, shifted five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. JUMBLY (GB) stalked the pace racing between rivals early
on, hard ridden two deep near the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the drive. NEW YEAR'S EVE was off a step slow, raced three to five wide

dug in near the rail inside the eighth pole and kept on gamely to the wire. GENEROUS TIPPER was unhurried early, advanced through the far turn, swung
wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improved position. NORTHERN FLAME raced four wide around the first turn, forwardly placed to lay up close
from the outside of rivals down the backstretch, raced four deep around the far turn and weakened in the drive. WEST SARATOGA stalked the pace three
deep down the backstretch, raced five wide into the upper stretch and faded. JUST STEEL showed good early foot two deep and gave way the final quarter
of a mile. AWESOME ROAD settled off the early going, raced four to three wide in the lane and had no response. BAYTOWN CHATTERBOX pressed while

Footnotes
UP TO THE MARK settled off the early pace along the inside, raced three wide between through the far turn, worked through traffic in the stretch, split rivals
four deep nearing the eighth pole and just got up under all out pressure. MASTER OF THE SEAS (IRE) was unhurried early on, moved up from the inside
near the five sixteenths pole, angled out to race five wide and lost the nod in a game effort. SET PIECE (GB) raced off the early pace near the inside, angled
through the upper stretch to race from the outside and closed in belatedly. ANNAPOLIS tracked the early leader from the outside two deep, made a bid took
take command near the seven sixteenths pole, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and weakened in the final stages. ENGLISH BEE settled off the early
pace inside, raced three wide between near the five sixteenths pole and was even late with no closing run racing five deep. HARLAN ESTATE dropped
back to race mid pack early, ridden through the far turn, fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. STITCHED tracked the top pair two
deep down the backstretch, raced four wide near the quarter pole and faded. ATONE raced three deep early on mid pack, was five deep near the quarter
pole and weakened through the drive. INDESTRUCTIBLE (IRE) showed good early foot along the inside and gave way through the stretch run.

Footnotes
BOOTH sent along early to set his own uncontested early pace and kicked clear through the stretch under a steady hand ride. NASH tracked the early
leader from the inside, ridden along near the seven sixteenths pole, shifted out four deep but was no match for Booth in the drive. RAPOPORT raced near
the back of the pack early, was three deep around the far turn, angled out through the stretch run and moved up to improved position. MIYAGI raced two
deep around the far turn, was five to three wide in the drive and raced even with no final bid. GOLDBRICK dropped back to race with the second flight,
raced from the inside near the quarter pole, improved position but was no real threat. KITTY HAWK stalked the pace between rivals, raced five deep near
the quarter pole and tired. HAMMERSTEIN raced mid pack early, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a bid. POKER RUN settled off the early
pace, raced three wide around the far turn and had no response. WHO'S THE KING raced at the back of the pack early, was five deep near the three
sixteenths pole and never was a factor. LATTA swung wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. STARSCAPE stalked the outside, raced three to
five wide around the far turn and faded.
