Footnotes
IN HONOR OF AUTISM raced close to the decent early pace while outside of runners, advanced two wide on the turn, shifted to the three path into the
stretch, battled with STRENGTH OF AUTISM to the furlong marker, drew to even terms outside of STRENGTH OF AUTISM heading to the
sixteenth-marker, dueled into deep stretch with STRENGTH OF AUTISM, took a narrow lead in the final strides and lasted at the finish to prevail.
STRENGTH OF AUTISM assumed command in the early running and set a decent pace into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker by IN HONOR OF
AUTISM, met the bid of that rival into the stretch, raced on even terms inside of the furlong marker, dueled into the final sixteenth inside of IN HONOR OF
AUTISM, was gamely bested in the final strides and was clear for second. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW tracked the early pace from the inside, was coaxed
along three wide into the stretch, could not make headway on the top pair in the drive, was outkicked and held clearly for third. CHAOKOON chased the
decent early pace from the inside, was shifted outside of runners into the turn, came four wide into the stretch, lost ground approaching the furlong marker
and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER never far back, settled along the inside into the first turn, was well positioned while saving ground through the backstretch run, was
roused approaching the quarter marker, angled four wide into the stretch and loomed nearing the furlong grounds, took command inside of the furlong
marker and drew away under moderate urging in deep stretch. GORDY'S BOY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the decent pace into the
backstretch run and steadily advanced on N. K. ROCKET MAN heading into the far turn, overtook that rival leaving the quarter marker and vied with
EMERALD MAGIC into the stretch, could not keep pace with BROKEN FINGER inside of the furlong marker, was outfinished in deep stretch and held well
in the end for second. EMERALD MAGIC tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run and was well
placed heading to the half-mile marker, continued to gain three wide approaching the quarter marker, vied for the lead into the stretch and battled with
GORDY'S BOY to mid-stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong, was outkicked and held clearly for third. MY SUNSHINE settled
inside of rivals to begin, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run tracking solid fractions, mounted a five wide bid into the stretch and
improved position heading to the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into deep stretch and flattened out. N. K. ROCKET MAN was a step slow to
begin, was hustled in the early stages and assumed command into the first turn, dictated terms off of the rail into the backstretch run, set solid fractions
controlling the pace to the half-mile pole, came under pressure along the far turn, was overtaken leaving the quarter marker and tired in the stretch drive.
WALKING BOSS settled outside of rivals into the turn, maintained a four wide path through the backstretch run, was coaxed along three wide into the far
turn and did not threaten in the stretch.

Footnotes
MORNING ADDICTION was away in good order and was prominent early, pressed the solid early pace outside of BLUEBERRY MUFFIN, dueled for the
lead into the turn with that rival, took a narrow advantage two wide and between runners at the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch, was kept to
moderate urging into the final furlong, drew off into deep stretch and was hand ridden to the finish to prevail as much the best. BIG MAMA THORNTON
broke a step slowly away from the gate, rushed up and raced close to the quick early pace outside of the leading pair, pressed three wide at the quarter
marker, lost ground into the stretch, was not able to impact the runaway winner in the late stages but ran on in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to
secure the place. PERFECTLY JULIE was pinched back at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased the fast early pace outside of an inner rival, gave
chase three wide to the quarter marker, came four wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and just missed for the place, while
getting up in time for the show in a blanket finish for the minor awards. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke alertly and contested the fast early pace with
MORNING ADDICTION, dueled inside of that rival into the turn, lost the lead to MORNING ADDICTION approaching the top of the lane, chased into the
stretch, tired in the late stages and was outfinished for the minor awards. AIR FORCE WOMAN chased the quick early pace from a two wide path, was
coaxed along four wide into the stretch, lost ground heading to the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. O'NEILL'S LEGACY lacked early
speed, raced three wide to the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
MARY MARGARET broke out at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered and tracked the decent pace from a two wide path and between runners,
waited for racing room approaching the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch, angled six wide approaching the furlong marker, responded to
urging and vied for the lead heading to the sixteenth-marker, took a narrow lead into deep stretch and held the runner-up at bay in the final stages to prevail.
SHEMAKESCENTS was sent leaving an alert beginning and set pressured early fractions, shook free into the turn and set the pace from off the rail heading
to the quarter marker, showed the way into upper stretch and drifted to the three path into the drive, was confronted by MARY MARGARET inside of the
furlong pole, was overtaken in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, while holding safely for second. KITTEN'S KID stalked the decent early
pace from the inside, remained close to the pace while chasing along the turn, came two wide into the stretch, raced within aim into the drive and chased to
the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in deep stretch, was outkicked and just held for third at the wire. SMOOVE AS SILK tracked the early pace
from the inside, saved ground into the turn, waited a bit for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, found room along the inside into the drive and
advanced heading to the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into deep stretch, flattened out and just missed for third at the finish. DRAW NEAR
chased the decent early pace while outside of rivals, came three wide to the quarter marker and swung five wide for the stretch drive, was outrun to
mid-stretch and tired in the late going. SEASON TO REMEMBER was sent away from the start, pressed the decent early pace outside of
SHEMAKESCENTS, maintained a three wide path to the quarter marker while pressing the pace, came four wide into the stretch, lost position into upper
stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DR LOW KEY was forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the solid early pace, inched closer two wide along the turn and was roused three wide
into the stretch, took command into upper stretch and was set down at the furlong marker, was kept to task into deep stretch, held foes at bay in the final
sixteenth and held safely in a drive at the finish to prevail. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS stalked the solid early pace from the inside, gained ground heading to
the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch and continued to improve position heading to the furlong grounds, was gaining in deep
stretch but could not reel in the winner in the final stages and just held for second at the finish. BIG DON'S SMILING took back and rated off of the solid
early pace, gained ground from a two wide path on the turn, tipped three wide for the drive, closed well in the late stages, just missed for second and held
safely in the end for third. THE SANDY SURPRISE was squeezed by neighboring rivals leaving the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear early on,
gained ground two wide along the turn, came three wide into the stretch and offered a mild rally in the final furlong. DAD BOD was hustled away from the
start and assumed command in the early stages, sped to the early lead and set the fast pace into the turn, dictated terms along the bend while carving
decent fractions, drifted to the two path into upper stretch, was overtaken by DR LOW KEY heading to the furlong marker, remained in contention into deep
stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear in the early stages,
saved ground into the turn, lacked a response in the stretch and did not threaten. RIGHT TURN chased the solid early pace outside of rivals, ran in pursuit
three wide along the turn, dropped back approaching the top of the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SPEED GRAZY settled outside of runners to begin, was steered four wide into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace to the half-mile marker,
was roused four wide approaching the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, drifted in a bit inside of the
furlong pole, assumed command into the final sixteenth, found more in deep stretch and drew clear to prevail in the end. WELLSWORT (IRE) tracked the
moderate early pace outside of a rival, gained ground along the backstretch run, continued that gain three wide into the far turn, vied for the lead into upper
stretch, vied between rivals at the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with SPEED GRAZY into deep stretch, was outkicked and held safely for second at
the finish. RACKATAPTAP was hard sent away from the start, was prominent into the first turn and assumed command of the early stages, cleared to the
rail and set moderate fractions into the backstretch run, controlled the pace to the half-mile marker and showed the way into the far turn, came under
pressure in upper stretch, met bids of oncoming rivals to mid-stretch while along the rail, came in a bit tight when SPEED GRAZY drifted in inside of the
furlong pole, could not go on with the top pair into deep stretch, gave way and was clear for third. CHIEF WILD EAGLE was prominent away from the gate,
was asked to rate into the first turn and was a bit keen stalking the pace in the early stages, settled into the backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace
to the half-mile marker, improved position heading into the far turn, chased two wide into upper stretch, could not match strides at the furlong marker and
weakened in deep stretch. TAM'S TIME never far back, settled off of the decent early pace and tracked from a two wide path into the backstretch run, was
well placed inside of rivals heading to the far turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker, lost contact into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

MARKSMAN ON TARGET broke well and was up with the early leaders through the first turn racing two deep, was content to stalk FANTASTIC DREAM to
the far turn then was set loose passing the seven-sixteenths marker, took over the lead along with ALGERIA (IRE) to the inside, was going better than that
foe at the top of the stretch, pulled ahead and held off all challengers. DUPLICATION was up with the leaders going into the first turn fanned four wide,
dropped back and raced in mid-pack, still wide down the backstretch, started to rally on the far turn, with ITS THIEVERY also making a move to the inside,
loomed into contention at the top of the stretch, kept to task to the wire but was unable to catch the winner. FANTASTIC DREAM broke alertly and showed
good speed from the start, was first into the turn with a trio fanned out across the track, emerged from that turn with the lead, stayed on the rail then checked
near the three-eighths pole when ALGERIA (IRE) took the rail, lost momentum then came under pressure shortly thereafter and found new life at the quarter
pole, had a wall of horses in front turning into the stretch, changed course to the six or seven path on the far outside then found a hole in mid-stretch and
surged inside to gain third. BEROLIJEAN (FR) bobbled after the break and was a little slow to get going then raced well behind the field while saving
ground, was asked to pick it up with a half-mile to run, made some slow but steady forward progress through the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch,
kept grinding away to the wire but came up just short of a minor award. ITS THIEVERY raced mid-pack stalking the leaders three to four deep, launched a
bid in tandem with DUPLICATION from about the seven-sixteenths pole, got a good run into the stretch in the two path and ran on well to the wire but but
was outkicked in the late stages. ALGERIA (IRE) raced close up stalking FANTASTIC DREAM to the far turn, bid from the seven-sixteenths alongside
MARKSMAN ON TARGET, could not keep up with that foe after passing the quarter pole then weakened and was outfinished down the stretch. TAKE THE
TWO TEN broke a beat slow and lacked early speed from the break, lagged behind the field throughout, raced on the wrong lead through much of the
stretch and was never a threat.
