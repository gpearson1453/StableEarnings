Footnotes
HAPPY IS broke alertly and was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the early pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, was well placed
while just off of the solid fractions heading into the far turn, tracked the pacesetter to the quarter marker, tipped two wide into the stretch, advanced to
confront ALL HALLOWS and battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took command at the furlong marker, was kept to task into deep stretch and held safely in
a drive at the finish. ALL HALLOWS was sent between runners leaving the break and assumed command into the first turn, set solid fractions while
prompted through the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead approaching the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch, met the bid of HAPPY IS
at mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and held well in the end for second. STANDFORGRIT was away in good order, became rank while
between runners in the opening furlong and was taken up heading into the first turn, settled two then three wide into the backstretch run, was content to trail
to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch drive, closed willingly in the final furlong, could not reel in the top two
in deep stretch and was well clear for third. ENGEE OMBEE was prominent leaving the break, raced three wide while between runners into the first turn and
stalked the solid pace through the backstretch run, lost ground while three wide heading to the quarter marker, was coaxed along in the four path into upper
stretch and tired in the drive. MISSING PENNY was forwardly placed in the early running, came widest into the first turn and attended to the pace while
three wide into the backstretch run, stalked the pacesetter to the half-mile marker, lost position along the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

KERRYGOLD LADY broke alertly and was prominent into the first turn, stalked the decent early pace from the inside, tipped outside of RIVIERA SUNRISE
into the backstretch run and prompted the pacesetter to the half-mile marker, advanced two wide along the far turn and confronted RIVIERA SUNRISE
heading to the quarter marker, battled into upper stretch, dueled outside of RIVIERA SUNRISE into deep stretch, responded to urging in the final strides,
surged at the finish and prevailed over the game runner-up. RIVIERA SUNRISE was hustled from her outside post and assumed command into the first
turn, set decent fractions while off of the rail through the backstretch run, was confronted by KERRYGOLD LADY along the far turn, battled with that rival
into the stretch, dueled inside of KERRYGOLD LADY into the final furlong, was kept to steady left-handed urging into deep stretch, could not hold off
KERRYGOLD LADY in the final strides and was gamely bested, while well clear of the rest. LAKER JET was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the
decent early pace three wide into the backstretch run, gained a bit of ground heading to the half-mile marker, chased two wide to the quarter pole, was
coaxed along four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in the final furlong and held safely in the end for third. LUCY L settled outside
of rivals into the first turn, came four wide into the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile marker, gave chase while three wide along
the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. LA POPIS settled off of the decent early pace, swung to the two path into the
backstretch run and chased to the half-mile marker, lost contact along the far turn and lacked a response in the stretch.

ANITANEWMERCEDES was sent leaving the start, vied for the early lead while between rivals and took command into the first turn, set moderate fractions

Footnotes
MARNAYS QUEEN broke sharply and assumed command away from the start, set a decent early pace while off of the rail then rated nicely into the turn
and dictated terms to the quarter marker, extended the lead into upper stretch, was kept to task under steady urging into the final sixteenth and drew away
under a hand ride in the final stages. LUCKY LOCKETT stalked the decent early pace, kept close attendance to MARNAYS QUEEN while three wide on the
turn, lost a bit of ground to MARNAYS QUEEN into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth and stayed on to be second best. SHEZA
QUEEN BEE chased the decent early pace while inside of rivals, lost ground while chasing in the two path along the turn, lacked a final response in the
drive and held for third in the final strides. AFTER SUNDOWN chased the early pace from a three wide path, gave chase while outside of an inner rival
along the turn, needed more in the stretch drive and missed for third at the finish. G G RULES settled off of the decent early pace, raced outside of an inner
rival into the turn, slipped to the rail nearing the quarter marker, saved ground into upper stretch and did not threaten. NOMI LACKEE lacked early speed,
saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and was outrun.

LADY GREGORY was asked for early speed and contested the pace in the opening furlong, set a pressured pace while off of the rail along the turn, shook
free into the stretch, drew clear at the furlong marker, drew off into deep stretch and was ridden out in the final sixteenth to be much the best. FRIED
ASPARAGUS was prominent away from the start and contested the solid early pace, pressed LADY GREGORY along the turn while three wide, lost ground
to that rival into upper stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, could not keep pace with the winner into deep stretch and held safely for second in the
end. AUSTRIAN NAVY broke alertly, conceded the early lead and tracked outside of rivals into the turn, improved position while four wide nearing the
quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, needed more in deep stretch and won the nod for third in the final strides. MARY MARGARET was unhurried
away from the gate, raced outside of rivals into the turn and came five wide to the quarter marker, needed more in the final stages and just missed for third
at the finish. PRETTY THIRSTY bobbled leaving the break and was away a step slowly, tracked the solid early pace from the inside, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, could not muster a response in deep stretch and tired.

THE CALABRESE KID was away in good order and raced close to the early pace, pressed the pace from the three path into the turn then dueled with
DUMB LUCK while two wide approaching the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch and showed the way to the furlong grounds, shifted to the
four path nearing the sixteenth-marker and lost the lead into deep stretch, came again in the final strides and surged at the finish to prevail in a game win.
GALOPIN GOURMET was prominent away from the start and contested the early lead with DUMB LUCK, took back off of that rival and tracked the pace to
the half-mile pole, angled to three path nearing the quarter marker and gained ground approaching the top of the lane, chased THE CALABRESE KID into
upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong grounds and shifted to the five path into deep stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth-marker, battled
with THE CALABRESE KID into the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding for second. MADE THE TEAM broke a step slowly away from the
gate and settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position heading to the quarter marker, rallied two wide into the
stretch, advanced at the quarter marker, continued to make a steady bid into deep stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final stages and
was outfinished, while holding for third. MR. CLUTCH tracked the early pace from the second flight, was steered outside of rivals along the turn and
improved position while four wide at the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, re-bid into the final sixteenth but was outkicked in deep stretch. THE
SANDY SURPRISE settled off of the decent early pace, was coaxed along outside of rivals into the turn and gained ground while three wide approaching
the quarter marker, continued that bid into the stretch, could not sustain his bid into the final sixteenth and flattened out late. DUMB LUCK broke alertly and
disputed the early pace, assumed command heading to the half-mile marker and set a good pace into the turn, was confronted into the bend by THE
CALABRESE KID and dueled through decent fractions with that rival to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into upper stretch, dropped back nearing
the furlong pole and tired in the late stages.

CLOVISCONNECTION was away in good order and was forwardly placed early on, tracked the fast pace to the half-mile marker then advanced two wide
into the turn and pressed the pace to the quarter marker while between runners, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled with TOP HARBOR to the
furlong grounds, lost a narrow lead to TOP HARBOR leaving the furlong pole, came again into the final sixteenth and dueled inside of TOP HARBOR into
deep stretch, responded to urging in the final yards, was fully extended at the finish and prevailed in a determined win. TOP HARBOR bobbled at the start
and was away a step slowly, recovered to track the fast early pace while outside of runners, gained ground three wide heading to the quarter marker, vied
for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong grounds, dueled outside of CLOVISCONNECTION into the final sixteenth, raced on
even terms with that rival into the final strides and was gamely bested on the wire, while well clear of the rest for second. LARRY'S LEGEND tracked the
fast early pace from the inside, chased from the two path along the turn and lost a bit of ground heading to the quarter marker, maintained that two wide
path into the stretch, was not able to make headway on the top pair in deep stretch but ran on in the final stages and held safely for third.
EVENEREVENWORSE broke sharply and showed good early speed away from the start, set a quick pace to the half-mile marker, was pressed along the
turn by CLOVISCONNECTION and dueled with that rival to the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased the leading pair to the furlong marker
and weakened in the final stages. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF steadied in the opening yards and settled off of the fast early pace, tracked outside of runners
into the turn and raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch and finished evenly in the drive.

Footnotes
EL JOY settled behind the pace taking an inside position in the two path, moved up to challenge for the lead as the field passed the three furlong pole, came
into the stretch with short lead then opened up when roused and drew away under intermittent urging. VANISKY was off slowly then hustled to get early
position, settled between horses mid-pack to the far turn while rating well, waited for room then started to run on passing the five-sixteenths pole, swung out
four or five wide into the stretch and produced a strong rally to gain second. J T'S WATCH hopped in the air at the start, throwing the rider off balance,
spotting the field a significant head start, regained contact with the field near the six furlong pole while racing in the back of the field five wide, moved over
towards the inside passing the half mile pole, made some forward progress through the turn racing on the inside, raced in tight and lacked room nearing the
top of the lane, found room into upper stretch but could not keep pace with the top pair and ran on to secure third. EFFECTIVE GIG raced close up while
three wide, made a strong bid for the lead with three furlongs to run, swung four wide into the stretch and weakened in the final stages. MY DAD IS
THIRSTY broke best and pulled the rider to the front, settled mid-race and held sway to the far turn, came under pressure from all sides passing the
five-sixteenths marker, hung in to mid-stretch then could not keep up in the final furlong. N. K. ROCKET MAN tracked the pacesetter while behind hard held
through first half mile, was three wide into the stretch but came up empty. TWIRLING DERBY had no speed from the gate but got a rail run through the first
turn, angled out to the four or five path near the six furlong pole and stayed in that path for the rest of the race, made a mild move from the five-sixteenths
pole then had nothing to offer for the stretch run.
