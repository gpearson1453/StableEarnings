turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. MONSTRODAMOUS was in touch and had a slim lead on the far turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. KIDDIE HOLIDAY settled off the pace and was roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch failed to fire. HALF LIT showed speed from the outside and set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

SEVEN IS A BREEZE was off the pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. BAIT N SWITCH was in
range, a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch but was caught late. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN was in touch and
had the lead on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. SANTIAGO SALSA was well back and closed the gap on the far turn
but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no threat. SPIRIT BELLE showed speed from the outside but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
VOYANT was hustled early but headed on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

ERNIE'S MARTINI was in mid pack, raced evenly on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. I LIVE BY FAITH showed speed from
the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BAJAN BULLET was off the pace,
moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for show. COLLABORATIVE showed no speed and had a mild gain on the
turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch needed more. DIAMOND HEIST was in range and had a bid on the turn but from the six path at the top
of the stretch leveled off. BILL NEEDLE showed no speed, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. M C JACKHAMMER was in
touch and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. NEOLITHIC NATION was up close early but chased on the turn
