Footnotes
SHERILINDA was hustled away from the gate and assumed command in the early running, set the pace into the backstretch run, showed the way while
mildly pressured through the backstretch run, carved out a decent pace while well handled into the second turn, raced in hand into upper stretch and drew to
a clear lead at the furlong marker, was given a few taps of the crop into deep stretch and was hand ridden to the finish to be much the best. KERRYGOLD
LADY broke alertly then settled off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the backstretch run then was steered outside of rivals heading to the
half-mile marker, came three wide into the stretch, rallied in the final furlong, could not impact the winner at the finish and bested the rest.
AGREETODISAGREE stalked the early pace while outside of rivals, maintained a three wide path to the half-mile marker, chased SHERILINDA to the
quarter pole, could not keep pace with SHERILINDA into the lane, weakened in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for third. DANGEROUS ILLUSION
had her head turned at the start and was unprepared leaving the break, was allowed to settle through the backstretch run, went two then three wide along
the far turn and did not offer a late response. SPLICER lacked early speed, saved ground into the far turn, raced two wide into the stretch and did not factor.
PRANCIN N THE PARK was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked from a two wide path into the backstretch run, attended to the decent fractions to
the half-mile marker, lost position into the far turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAJOR TOM raced close to the decent early pace, saved ground along the turn and tracked the pacesetter to the quarter marker, raced a bit in tight into
upper stretch, found room and mounted an inside bid nearing the furlong marker, dueled with his stablemate into deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the final
yards, drifted out under firm left-handed urging just before the wire and held on for the win at the finish. O'BANION (IRE) raced close to the decent early
pace, tracked two wide to the quarter marker then swung to the three path into upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker, dueled with MAJOR
TOM into the final sixteenth, was carried out by his drifting stablemate in the final strides and was bested on the wire for the win, while clear of the rest for
second. THECHIEFHASTRICKS rated nicely off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the turn, gained ground at the quarter marker and came in
a bit tight nearing the top of the stretch, swung five wide into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final stages but
closed well while widest in deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. R HEART OF GOLD was forwardly placed in the early running while outside of
rivals, chased three wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker and
could not muster a late rally. MIGHTY RULER was hustled to establish the early lead, set decent fractions into the turn and extended the lead midway
through the bend, showed the way into the stretch while off of the rail, was confronted by the top pair in upper stretch, met those bids to the furlong grounds
and weakened. LUCKY RAPPER was slow into stride away from the gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
NO ICE NO GLASS was away in good order, vied for the early lead and pressed his stablemate through quick fractions into the turn, kept close attendance
to ALMOST SNOW while two wide along the bend and confronted that rival into upper stretch, battled with his stablemate to mid-stretch, shook free inside
of the furlong marker and drew away while kept to task to the finish. BALLYVAUGHAN GIG broke out a step at the start, was prominent in the early running
then rated off of the fast early pace and tracked into the turn, tracked two wide to the quarter marker, swung to the three path into upper stretch, was able to
offer a mild late rally inside of the furlong marker and was best of the rest. ALMOST SNOW showed speed in the early running and assumed command
away from the gate, set a fast pace while pressured into the turn, carved out solid fractions while pressed by his stablemate to the quarter marker, battled
with NO ICE NO GLASS to the furlong grounds, weakened into deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. RODRIGOKNOWS tracked the solid early
pace while between rivals, lost ground along the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, came three wide into the stretch, lacked a response in the
final furlong and passed a tiring rival late. J C'S A LEGEND took back and tracked outside of rivals in the early running, came three wide into the turn, was
steered four wide into the stretch and did not threaten. IN HONOR OF AUTISM chased the fast early pace from the inside, saved ground to the top of the
stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and tired.

Footnotes
OH ANGEL was fractious prior to the start, hopped at the break and was off slowly, settled along the inside into the first turn, tracked from the rail through
the backstretch run, advanced along the inside into the far turn, came in tight at the quarter marker and waited for racing room into upper stretch, tipped two
wide and split runners at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, confronted I'M GONNA SHINE in deep stretch and surged in the final strides to
earn the win. I'M GONNA SHINE was forwardly placed while outside of rivals early on and stalked the pace three wide along the first turn, advanced along
the backstretch run, came three wide into the far turn and vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch and took
command heading to the furlong grounds, was kept to task under steady urging into the final sixteenth, was confronted by OH ANGEL in deep stretch and
was tagged for the win in the final strides, while besting the rest. CRESCENDO MOLTO settled leaving the start, came in a bit tight approaching the first
turn, steadied off of heels and in turn carried out SILVER FLIRT leaving the seven furlong pole, regrouped and raced two wide into the backstretch run,
improved position approaching the half-mile marker, was guided three wide into the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the top
two in the final furlong but offered a mild late rally and was up in time to secure third. GLORIOUS DIVINITY broke alertly and assumed command in the
early running, set moderate fractions while prompted into the backstretch run, showed the way while mildly pressured by VALERIE approaching the
half-mile marker, lost the lead heading to the quarter pole, battled along the inside to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth, gave way and
was outfinished for third. VALERIE was a bit hard to handle and was keen in the early running, stalked the pace along the first turn, advanced to mildly
pressure the moderate pace through the backstretch run, vied for the lead nearing the second turn and took a narrow advantage heading to the quarter
marker, was overtaken in upper stretch, chased to the furlong grounds and tired in deep stretch. LIGHTS ASTERN settled just off of the early pace and
saved ground into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch and was well placed heading to the far turn, was boxed in approaching the quarter
marker, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. ENGLISH MEADOW was a bit hard to place in the early running, settled outside of
rivals and tracked the moderate early pace, made a steady advance along the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, could not
sustain that run into the stretch and flattened out in the final stages. SILVER FLIRT was allowed to settle away from the start, came in a bit tight entering the
first turn was carried four wide leaving the seven furlong pole, recovered and raced three wide into the backstretch run, maintained that three wide trip to the
far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
TIGERIZE broke well then eased out of the developing pace duel, raced three to four wide through the early stages, saved some ground through the turn
responded when asked to go on with three furlongs to run, tipped to the three path for clear run into the stretch, collared the dueling pacesetters near the
sixteenth pole and won clear. PLEASANT WARNING broke well, held the inside position, dueled on the front end with LOCHMARA and battled that rival to
deep stretch, gained the upper hand passing the sixteenth pole but could not hold off the winner. LOCHMARA broke a step slow then sent for the lead,
dueled to the outside of PLEASANT WARNING to deep stretch then weakened in the final sixteenth but held third. ZEE PERFECT RUN broke well and was
close to the early pace while racing three to four wide, came under a ride in the turn and started to lose ground on the leaders passing the five-sixteenth
marker and was not a factor from that point. DIVINE PASSAGE broke slow then veered in after the break, spotting the field a head start, tried to make a run
through the turn but could not improve position. THE RIVER MANGITA broke well but could not keep up, fell far behind and chased the field throughout.

Footnotes
CARDIFF CRACK was forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the pace from a two wide path into the first turn then stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run, gained ground heading to the quarter marker, responded to urging into upper stretch, offered a three wide bid into the final furlong, took
command at the sixteenth-marker and kept to task in the final stages to prevail. LIMITED HEATWAVE settled off of the early pace and raced outside of
runners into the first turn, tracked the decent pace from the three path through the backstretch run, improved position while two wide at the quarter marker,
slipped to the rail into upper stretch and loomed approaching the furlong pole, could not match strides with CARDIFF CRACK in the final sixteenth but
finished well and was up in time to claim second. INCREDIBLE SHOT was forwardly placed leaving the start and tracked the early pace while three wide,
was well positioned while outside of runners approaching the half-mile marker, advanced three wide along the far turn, swung to the four path into the
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, offered a mild late bid but lacked the needed response in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to secure
third. OH GREAT (IRE) was asked for speed away from the gate and assumed command of the early running, showed the way into the first turn and set
decent fractions through the backstretch while well handled, carved out the pace to the quarter marker and was set down into upper stretch, held foes at bay
into the final furlong, was confronted by CARDIFF CRACK approaching the sixteenth-marker, met that bid into deep stretch but could not keep pace into the
late stages, was outfinished and just missed for the minor awards. HICKORY WIND took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground through the
backstretch while not far back, maintained a rail trip to the top of the lane and lacked a rally in the stretch. J D'S RUDE BOY lacked early speed and was
allowed to settle, saved ground into the backstretch run, lost contact with the others heading to the half-mile marker, was eased through the stretch and
walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
LAW ABIDING was asked for speed away from the gate and was sent to the early lead, set decent early fractions while off of the rail into the backstretch,
drew to a clear lead while well handled approaching the half-mile pole, felt mild pressure while showing the way along the far turn and quickened
approaching the quarter pole, responded to urging into upper stretch and drew clear at the furlong grounds, was kept to task into deep stretch and
maintained a clear lead to the finish to hold sway. BUTTONWOOD TREE was prominent away from the gate, took back off of the early pace and settled in
the two path along the first turn, shifted outside of rivals leaving the first turn and raced widest along the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the half-mile
marker, continued that gain while three wide into the far turn, chased LAW ABIDING into the stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the final
furlong and was outfinished, while just holding in the end for second. BID ON THE PRIZE settled in the second flight in the early running and raced three
wide along the first turn, altered course and steadied slightly entering the backstretch run when BUTTONWOOD TREE shifted out, made a mild gain at the
half-mile pole, continued that advance while three wide along the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied while widest into deep stretch, closed
willingly in the final stages and just missed for second at the finish, while holding safely for third. ATTENZIONE was away a step slowly at the start and was
allowed to settle early on, saved ground into the backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn,
made a mild gain into the stretch and finished evenly. UNION WAVE was forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the early pace, raced outside of
the pacesetter and came three wide into the backstretch, stalked the decent pace to the half-mile pole, gained ground while two wide heading to the quarter
marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. IMPLICITLY settled off of the early pace while two wide, gained ground along the
backstretch run, maintained a two wide trip into the far turn, ran evenly into the stretch and did not threaten.

DISKO TRIBUTE tracked just behind the leading pair while saving ground through the turn, bided time while full of run, swung out to the three path for the
stretch run, crowded TERRY'S BOY passing the eighth pole wandered in and out in the final yards and was fully extended to hold on for the win. TERRY'S
BOY settled mid-pack then saved ground through the turn, navigated a nice trip through the turn, swung four wide for the stretch run, had to alter course a
bit near the eighth pole when DISKO TRIBUTE came over then came back and just missed. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke well and was encouraged to get
early position, settled just off the flank of COWBOY CHARLIE early on, the moved forward to apply more pressure on that one past the three furlong marker,
took a short lead turning for home then was challenged by DISKO TRIBUTE to the outside, weakened in the final furlong but held on for third. TALBOT BAY
outrun early, was kept busy while racing near the back of the tracking group, started to rally through the turn, got a clear run in the two path into the stretch,
was finishing well, had to alter course past the furlong marker, was gaining at the wire and just missed a minor award. COWBOY CHARLIE sent hard from
the gate, grabbed a share of the lead a furlong out with HONEYMOONZ OVER pressing the issue to the outside, hung in to the top of the stretch then gave
way. PLAYING HARDBALL caught wide and pushed to keep up with the pace to the turn, made a middle move to get into contention then did not sustain
the move into the stretch. RALLY CAT broke well and displayed some brief speed, was close up racing three wide to the turn, began to lose ground past the
three furlong pole and came up empty in the stretch. GRAZEN SUN was outrun from the break, chased the field from far behind, was eased in the stretch
and walked off.

SMOOVE AS SILK settled in a tracking position three wide down the backstretch, stayed in the clear through the turn, launched a bid from the three furlong
pole, swept into contention at the top of the stretch and gradually wore down AMANDA ROSE to prevail in the shadow of the wire. AMANDA ROSE took a
light bump form the outside then moved up the rail into contention by the half-mile marker, bid for the lead passing the seven-sixteenths, came into the
stretch with a short lead, responded to intermittent urging and ran on well to the wire but could not hold the winner at bay. TIME TO SMILE came away best
but allowed WESTERN TOWN to take the early initiative, raced between horses stalking that one to the turn, came into the stretch with every chance and
finished well clear of the next horse while never a threat to the top pair. JERSEY BIRD broke in and bumped with AMANDAN ROSE then was outrun in the
earlly going, chased the field throughout and saved ground to no avail. CAROLINE MARGARET raced up close three wide down the backstretch, was still in
contention through the turn then started to weaken near the five-sixteenths pole. WESTERN TOWN hustled from the gate, opened up a clear lead before a
furlong, took the field to the quarter pole then gave way readily.
