FAST EH saved ground setting the pace and drew clear during the drive. YORKTOWN prompted the early pace while three-wide, was carried out slightly on
the turn by FIRECRACKER STAND and finished well for second in a steady effort. FIRECRACKER STAND vied for the early lead from between horses,
lugged out slightly on the turn and held on well for third. J. CRUZ broke in slightly to bump with THREE DAY BENDER then saved ground chasing the pace
but lacked a rally. THREE DAY BENDER bumped with J. CRUZ shortly after the start then dropped back and failed to seriously threaten.

SPORTSCARR stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up two-wide nearing the stretch and was up in the final seventy yards from between horses. DOC
COPE was allowed to settle early, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and closed strongly. LIL ZAPPER quickly opened a clear lead to saved
ground setting the pace, responded when asked and held on gamely to the wire. OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR was reserved off the early pace, moved up
five-wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked the needed late response. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY dropped well back early while saving ground and failed to
seriously threaten.

WHISKARITA saved ground setting the pace and gradually increased her advantage. CAPA BELLA prompted the issue throughout while two-wide, was
unable to reach the winner but proved clearly second best. FAVORITE saved ground while being unhurried and finished in a mild rally. SWIFT SWALLOW
broke out and bumped with VALUE DANCER, then was close up early, dropped back on the turn and went evenly late. VALUE DANCER was bumped at
the start by SWIFT SWALLOW, then was prominently placed to near the stretch racing along the inside, drifted out and tired.

ANNA'S IMAGE vied with DARLA'S FURY from along the outside, shook that one off leaving the eighth pole and gradually drew clear. DRAMATIC FLAIR
was unhurried early, moved up along the outside on the turn, was five-wide the final quarter and finished fast. I SAID QUIET saved ground while dropping
back, angled out for room leaving the three-sixteenths pole and closed strongly. DARLA'S FURY vied for the lead from along the inside to the eighth pole
and weakened late. ARANY was off a step slow then rushed up along the inside, bore out on the first turn carrying STARLIGHT LANE out, then was
forwardly placed to the stretch and tired. STARLIGHT LANE was carried out on the first turn by ARANY and gave way. THE RIDER OF ARANY LODGED
AN OBJECTIONS AGAINST DARLA'S FURY BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

BROWNING ISLAND ward forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to engage SMASH FACTOR nearing the eighth pole and prevailed in a stiff
drive. SMASH FACTOR saved ground setting the pace, responded when challenged and held on gamely to the wire. REDNECK REMARK prompted the
issue from along the outside into the stretch and weakened slightly late. AGENT C saved ground stalking the pace, angled out nearing the quarter pole,
came four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. SIMMS was unhurried while racing three-wide and was gaining slightly late. MOONSHINE NOW hopped
slightly at the start then was reserved off the pace, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

DADDY'S PEPPER vied with RAUSTY TREASURE for the lead from along the outside, disposed of that one after a half mile and quickly drew clear.
TRAPEZE was reserved off the early pace, moved up between horses on the backstretch, came three-wide into the stretch to offer a bid but was unable to
reach the winner while clearly second best. ASHES TO ASHES was forwardly placed while racing four-wide throughout and finished well for third in a
steady effort. BORN ON FIRE settled in the middle of the field while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. JOKERS R WILD was unhurried early, came
five-wide into the stretch and improved his position. RAUSTY TREASURE vied for the lead from along the inside for a half mile and tired. QUINTO'S TIME
gave way after showing brief speed along the inside.

GRACIAS was unhurried early, moved forward racing along the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished in a mild rally.
ANOTHERFORBROOKS was reserved off the early pace, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late. FINALIZE vied for the early lead from
between horses and tired after a half mile. BRODY'S PAL stalked the issue while racing two-wide but lacked a response when called upon. LAST OF WAR

Footnotes
CARRERA CABALLO dueled with RUN ROSSCO RUN for the lead, drifted out slightly entering the stretch and gradually drew clear late. AMEER saved
ground while being allowed to settle, slipped through entering the stretch to offer a bid, could not reach the winner but continued on well for the place.
WIZARDOFMENLOPARK was forwardly placed while racing three-wide and finished in a mild rally. RUN ROSSCO RUN dueled with CARRERA CABALLO
to the stretch from along the outside and weakened during the drive. CHESTER SLEW was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to
seriously threaten. CAROSWAY was prominently placed early while racing two-wide and tired. REAL JUSTICE was close up for a half mile racing between
horses and gave way.

Footnotes
DECOY dueled with STONE CARVER for the lead from along the inside and drew clear late. STONE CARVER dueled with the winner from along the
outside, was unable to stay with that one late but continued on well for second in a game try. ROCKTILLYOUDROP settled in the middle of the early, came
three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. DRINKING AGAIN was allowed to settle while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. RUMOHR REIGNS
was off a step slow then saved ground and went evenly. COUNTRIFIED was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
ZICATELA was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and tired. SLEW'S BAK was off slow then hopped shortly after that, dropped back and trailed.
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
