Footnotes
CALIFORNIA BAY got brushed and crowded into the first turn, traveled in mid-pack on the inside, ran up behind rivals and had to pause on the backstretch,
moved out three wide on the far turn, angled out in the in the lane and rallied to overhaul the runner-up. DISCRETIONARY DAY dueled for the lead from
inside then ceded command into the backstretch, switch out and pressed up the backstretch, dueled into the lane, took over in upper stretch and got run
down by the winner late. BRAVESTONE was off a bit slow to begin, taken back to avoid a tight spot between runners, settled in the two path, drew closer up
the backstretch, gained three then four wide on the far turn, rallied in the lane but was outkicked by the top pair. FORE FLAG stalked on the inside, had to
pause when running up on heels early on the backstretch, continued to stalk up the inside, asked left handed leaving the far turn, lacked room in upper
stretch, tipped out and finished willingly. TALKLESSWORKMORE tracked from the rail position, waited for room on the far turn, lacked room from upper to
midstretch and was ridden out once clear in the final sixteenth. DOS VICIOS broke in and bumped rival, tracked two wide outside a rival, raced between
foes then outside a rival on the second bend, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out and kept on trying to the wire. ALPINE THUNDER hard to load prior
to the start, got knocked into inner rival at the start, trailed two wide early, spun three wide into the lane, moved out wide in the stretch and showed a mild
response to improve position. MYSTIC FLYER dueled for command from outside then cleared leaving the clubhouse turn and moved inside, pressure up
the backstretch, dueled into the lane, fought to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. SYNTACTIC brushed inner rival into the first turn, settled two wide,
saved ground through the far turn and failed to menace. HACKING IT UP stalked in the two path, chased three wide into the lane and weakened.
DON'TTHINKJUSTDOIT bumped from outside at the start, raced on the inside near the back, trailed around the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE FIRST QUARTER WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
COFFEE IN BED stalked from inside, launched a bid inside the leaders and gained the lead at the quarter pole, fought with CLIQUISH in upper stretch, put
that rival away at the eighth pole under hand urging and was ridden out to the wire. CLIQUISH tracked four then three wide around the first turn, went two
wide into the second bend, bid four, five, then three deep on the far turn, fought with the winner to upper stretch, was no match for that rival in the furlong
grounds but was clearly second best. LIBERAL LADY attended the pace three deep, vied three then four deep on the far turn, could not match strides with
the leaders at the top of the lane and weakened in the late stages. KEEN LADY settled off the rail and angled in around the clubhouse turn, continued to
save ground through the far turn and passed tired rivals. BLUE WILDCAT took control early from inside, dueled up the backstretch, drifted out and had to
take hold briefly at the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. VITALERA (CHI) raced up close two to three wide, confronted the leader
and dueled up the backstretch, vied between on the far turn, got put in a bit tight at the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
ANNIE'S JOY stalked on the inside, drew closer along the rail on the far turn, tipped out and challenged from outside with a furlong left to run, dueled with
RUGELACH in the final sixteenth and drove past. RUGELACH brushed rival at the start, sped to the front in the two path then moved inside, drew away with
three furlongs left to run, held a diminished lead entering the lane, responded when pressured by ANNIE'S JOY at the eighth pole and yielded grudgingly in
the end. PRECOCIOUS TIMES traveled in mid-pack, saved ground through both turns, moved out in the lane and finished willingly for a clear third.
FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER had to steady when rival came over early, traveled outside a rival towards the rear, ridden along while tipping three wide on the far
turn, chased two wide into the drive and could not rally. RUFF RIDE broke in and bumped, raced on the inside near the back in the early going, went two
wide into the far turn, angled out to the four path midway around the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and needed to find more. NOKIE trailed on the
inside early, angled three wide approaching the quarter pole, had to steady entering the stretch and could not regain momentum. COURT SNORT settled off
the pace and moved to the rail, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a rally. JORDAN got bumped leaving the gate, was closest in pursuit from the
two path, coaxed along into the far turn, dropped back around that bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LONESOME STEW sped clear and moved inside, given his cue at the five-sixteenths pole and started to draw away, asked right handed into the stretch
and opened up, then remained well clear under steady handling in deep stretch. CALIFORNIA TIGER chased off the rail then moved inside, tipped two wide
around the bend, closest in pursuit entering the stretch, could not make any headway though and churned on for a clear second. CAROL'S COMIC tracked
wide up the backstretch, navigated the turn four then five wide and gained the show. RED FALCON broke in and brushed rival, forwardly placed outside the
pacesetter early, chased two then three wide on the turn and flattened to fourth. LOGON TO WIN stalked three wide into the turn, came four wide into the
lane and weakened. LORD TRIPPING chased along the inside, lost ground around the bend and failed to menace. THE LAST ONE PERK dropped his
head and got brushed leaving the gate, lagged behind, trailed on the inside and weakened. TORLEIF chased off the rail then got put in tight early, chased
two then three wide on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
THERMAL took control quickly and showed the way up the backstretch, saved ground along the inside through the turn, hand urged through the lane and
coasted in nearing the wire. UFFDA was closest in pursuit in the early going, chased two then three wide into the stretch, could not threaten the winner in
the final furlong and held the place. AVOIR stalked off the rail then moved inside, saved ground through the turn, finished willingly in the drive but could not
get by UFFDA for second. LAUDATORY bumped leaving the gate, raced at the back two wide into the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and showed a
mild response when called upon. BEADS broke well then stumbled shortly after the start, chased outside several rivals then raced greenly and dropped
back, rounded the turn two then three wide and improved position. DISCREPANCY broke in and bumped, traveled in mid-pack three deep, chased two wide
into the lane and lacked a rally. CERTITUDE (FR) brushed leaving the gate, became rank briefly early, traveled in mid-pack on the inside into the turn,
saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed response. IMA JOKER broke a step slow, settled inside off the pace and was never a factor. JUST FOR
FUN broke a bit slow and got bumped, tracked outside a rival, three wide around the turn and could not make an impact. LAHAR BLOCKADE broke in and
brushed, raced in mid-pack between rivals, started to weaken around the bend and tired down the lane.

lane and held safely. TOO MUCH INFO broke in and bumped rival, raced near the back three wide into the turn, eased out to the five path, finished willingly
through the lane but could not reach the winner. ALL THE KING'S MEN prompted the pace early off the inside, kept the pressure on the winner from inside
to the five-sixteenths pole, could not go on with that rival approaching the quarter pole, churned on through the lane and held the show. SPIRITIST
prominent early between rivals then ceded control and took a stalking position, traveled four then three deep around the bend, chased four wide into the
lane and finished evenly late. CATHEDRAL LIGHT brushed early, stalked from inside, ran up on heels and bobbled near the seven-sixteenths pole, angled
out and came five wide into the lane, drifted in and improved position. NEW YORK DREAMS (GB) got bumped back early, moved into range between rivals,
roused two then three wide on the turn and flattened out. TAHOE SECRETS stalked three deep into the turn, four wide into the lane and weakened.
MISSED CALL climbed early and trailed wide under coaxing leaving the backstretch, went four, five, then six wide around the bend and failed to menace.
STAFFORD TO KUPP bobbled and got bumped leaving the gate, went up to contest the pace from inside, dropped back around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
DANIEL'S MAGIC stalked from inside, waited for room approaching the dirt, gained a clear path crossing surfaces, kicked clear in upper stretch and held
well late. KING APOLLO tracked three deep, came out across the dirt, closed well but was not enough in the end. BAJ unhurried in the early going, traveled
three deep on the turn, spun four wide into the lane, finished with late run and gained the show. DEL MAR JERRY rank chasing behind rivals early, steadied
into the turn, bobbled crossing the dirt and became rank again, came out and finished willingly for a minor award. X J RASCAL (IRE) went up to duel from
inside, jumped crossing onto the dirt then drifted out, lost command at the top of the lane and weakened in the final furlong. RUTHERFORD raced two wide
then moved inside off the pace, steered out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. EL ORO (FR) stalked the top pair, rounded the turn two wide and weakened
in the stretch run. ARMA D'ORO got shuffled back and trailed early, angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn and lacked room in the stretch.
LIBERTY FOREVER broke well to take control, dueled from outside, got floated out across the dirt and faded down the lane. HOGMANAY (IRE) stalked in
the two path around the bend and came up empty in the drive. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNTION THE HALF-MILE WAS HAND-TIMED.

GOOD WITH PEOPLE closest in pursuit from inside into the turn, reeled in the leader while shifted to the two path on the turn, drew alongside and dueled
into the stretch, put away KINGDOM HEART approaching the eighth pole and held under a strong drive. ESCAPE ROUTE bumped leaving the gate, sat off
the pace outside a rival, rounded the bend three wide, put in a late bid but ran out of time. LOVESICK BLUES got crowded between rivals early, chased four
wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, tipped back out into the stretch and closed for a game third. DESMOND DOSS bumped with
ESCAPE ROUTE at the start, chased off the rail out of range, angled in on the turn, moved back out a bit in the drive and got edged for third. KINGDOM
HEART sped clear and set the pace with a comfortable lead up the backstretch, raced along the rail into the turn, challenged past the quarter pole, lost
command in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOR TEQUILA stalked off the rail, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. K P KWEST
had to take up when losing path early, trailed on the inside into the turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LUCKY GIRL (IRE) tucked inside racing near the back early, ridden along and angled three wide midway around the far turn, steered out further in the
stretch, unleashed a rally under right handed encouragement and got up in the closing moments. FREEDOM FLYER tracked outside a rival off the pace,
gained along the inside then two wide on the far turn, bid three deep in upper stretch, took over midstretch and got run down by LUCKY GIRL (IRE) in the
final strides. UNBRIDLED MARY was closest in pursuit in the two path then moved inside, reeled in the leader on the far turn and confronted HAMWOOD
FLIER (IRE) entering the stretch, took over shortly after, relinquished the lead to FREEDOM FLYER midstretch and kept on to hold the show. EDDIE'S
NEW DREAM settled along the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch, moved out in the lane, bid inside rivals approaching the sixteenth pole but needed to
find more late. OAKHURST taken back to last early and steered to the inside, trailed to the rail turn, went between rivals then two wide around that bend,
moved out in the lane and finished evenly late. PRESENT MOMENT (IRE) traveled in the two path between rivals around the clubhouse turn off the pace,
continued between into the far turn, asked two wide at the quarter pole and failed to respond. UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) was off slow to begin, pulled along
the inside early, saved ground to the stretch and was not a factor. HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, cleared quickly
and crossed over, opened up a comfortable lead early, continued well clear into the far turn, saw her lead diminishing through the far turn and clung to short
lead entering the lane, was overtaken shortly after and retreated in the final furlong. ANKYRAH tracked three deep well out of range in the early going,
remained three wide into the far turn, bothered briefly by rival coming out approaching the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch run.
