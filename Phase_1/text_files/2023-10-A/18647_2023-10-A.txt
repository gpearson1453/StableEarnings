Footnotes
JUST COMPLY showed good early speed between rivals, shook free to set the pace, widened on the turn, responded when roused and was kept to task in
the stretch run. ALPHA COMPANY chased between rivals early on, chased the winner on the turn, finished well but second best. VESPARO raced off the
pace inside, steadied entering the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied mildly and got the nod for third. RANUNCULUS chased on the inside, was
shuffled back entering the turn, then rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch and just missed for the show spot. JERSEY GREGG was bumped at the start,
raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GIANT JAMES raced off the pace inside and had no rally. CHARLIZE CHUB
raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. SOCIAL D chased three wide early, chased on the turn and faded. CHANGING THE KARMA was
bumped and off slowly, then outrun. MAD MAXEY was off a bit slow, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
MIA'S CRUSADE vied outside for the lead, dueled with AMAZING GRACES JOY on the turn, responded when roused nearing the furlong marker, dug in
gamely outside that rival, gained command at the sixteenth pole, drew clear and then held well to the wire. SADIE BABY raced off the pace inside, came
two wide into the lane, angled out, rallied outside and finished well. AMAZING GRACES JOY set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the turn
and into the stretch, dug in gamely on the rail, yielded and then held on for third. BRAMBLE BAY chased two wide, raced between horses on the turn,
continued evenly in the stretch run and just missed for the show spot. ROSELBA raced off the pace, off the rail and closed belatedly outside. SEA MAIDEN
chased close up early on the inside, chased inside on the turn and weakened. DELIGHTFUL AVA chased outside for the outset, continued three wide on
the turn and tired. JOY AND PROSPERITY broke a step slow and was outrun.
