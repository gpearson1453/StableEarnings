as much the best while being ridden out. SHELL FIRE allowed to settle, rallied three wide into the final turn to make the lead, set the pace to the top of the
stretch then was no match for the winner. ROYAL DRAGOON unhurried early, loomed boldly two wide into the final turn, matched stride into the stretch then
was outfinished. BOURBON WISDOM pressed the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, quickly opened a daylight advantage entering the backstretch,
set the pace into the final turn, remained closed into the stretch then gave way late. ITASCA set the pace along the inside for four and one half furlongs,

Footnotes
CYCLONE stalked the pace four wide into the far turn, rallied two wide to engage the leader entering the stretch, battled the balance of the trip and proved
best under right handed urging. GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD set the pace along the inside into the stretch, dug in gamely when headed by the winner but
finished second best. R CARDINAL PRINCE trailed early, split horses with a rapid move three wide before a half, remained a sharp threat into the stretch
and was outfinished. CITY OF CLOUDS pressed the pace three then two wide and finished evenly. CENTSOFWANDER was no factor. FALK was through
after a half. HURRY ON OUT vied for the lead along the inside for six furlongs then folded.
