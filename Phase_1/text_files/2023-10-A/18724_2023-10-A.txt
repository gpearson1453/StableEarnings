Footnotes
SICILIAN GRANDMA set the pace in the two path while inside of a moderately pressing rival, then drew off approaching the lane. ENDLESS saved ground
off of the pace, improved turning for home, stayed on along the rail to gain place in the final furlong and held from an outer rival late. SPIRITCATCHER
trailed two wide, improved position between horses turning for home, tipped three wide in upper stretch, ran on but needed more for place. ROCK THE NILE
prompted the leader from the three path, but gave way turning for home and faded between horses in the final furlong. LADY WITH A CAUSE stalked
behind the leaders and from the two path, chased in the two to three path around the far turn then faded between horses turning for home. BIG JAVA keenly
tugged in the three path and between horses around the first turn, chased while floated to the four path around the far turn and faded approaching the lane.
WILDCAT DREAM tracked in the four path but faded with a half mile to go and was done early.

Footnotes
KHANATE perched himself outside of the leading trio, bid into the turn, took over approaching the five sixteenths pole and drew off under driving pressure.
MR. FAVERSHAM took light contact from an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path, shifted out to the six path in midstretch and rallied for
place. TIZ MY HERO tracked along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane and stayed on. HEAD LAD saved ground off of the pace, fanned to
the six path entering the lane, ran on mildly between horses on his left lead and drifted inwardly in the final sixteenth. STUNNEM chased two wide and
between horses, yielded into the turn, shifted outside of rivals turning for home before fanning to the six path entering the lane and moved up. CLOTH OF
GOLD brushed an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, chased in the three path around the turn and faded. PRETTY FAST vied inside of
a trio of rivals, proved no match for an outer rival turning for home and faded. MONEYSHOT took a bump from an outer rival at the start, vied three wide and
between horses and gave way. GREAT RICHIE M chased from midpack in the two path and weakened between horses turning for home.
WECALLEMFUNCOUPONS dueled for the lead two wide and between horses and weakened. SILENT SPECTRE made little impact from the two to three
path. LEAD FOOT leaned inwardly and bumped an inner rival at the start, lagged behind down the backstretch and showed little.

LIKE A SALTSHAKER set the pace inside of a prompting rival, inched away from that one while in hand in upper stretch, responded once set down entering
the final furlong in the two path and was ridden out to hold sway. SHACKLEFORD STRONG stalked three wide, chased the leading pair around the turn,
dueled for place with an inner rival through the final furlong and prevailed. JUNIOR BUG laid off of the pace two wide, rallied along the rail to vie for place
with a outer foe in the final furlong, but was bested. CARAMEL CHIP tracked two wide, shifted to the four path into the turn, then to the six path entering the
lane and chased evenly. ONE COOL DUDE prompted two wide, vied outside of the eventual winner around the turn, but failed to keep pace with that one in
upper stretch and faltered between chasers at the furlong grounds. CASEYS MEMORY tossed his head just before the gates sprung causing him to break
rank and multiple lengths slow, trailed in the two path, cut the gap in the four path between horses entering the lane and moved up. RISK PROFILE lacked a
response to urging while three wide and off of the pace into the turn and tired. OUT WORK'N broke a step slow, raced off of the pace along the inside, got
shuffled behind a faltering foe into the turn and made little impact. READY PURSUIT got outrun in the four to six path. WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW tracked
along the inside, weakened into the turn, then was eased through the final furlong, vanned off and found to have bled.

Footnotes
KILLSHAVE BEAUTY set the pace in the two path, showed the way well in hand around the far turn, shook clear in the four path entering the lane while
shifting to the four path, drew off in upper stretch and was driven home to seal the deal. PENDULUM tracked two wide, fanned to the four path entering the
lane, ran on to gain place a sixteenth from home and held from an outer rival late. TURINO pursued from midpack in the three path, swung out to the six
path in upper stretch, then stayed on to bid for place in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. I'M A MESS tracked along the inside, took aim to rally
between horses in upper stretch but lacked a kick. PURR FACTOR stalked inside of a rival while in the three to two path around the first turn, tucked to the
rail entering the backstretch, gained place from an outer foe entering the lane but yielded in the final furlong. CARINA NEBULA laid off of the pace two wide,
then chased in the five path. WINSOME BEAUTY saved ground off of the pace, but mildly shuffled back in the two path into the far turn, then lacked a rally
in the three path. MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA pursued from midpack along the inside and faded around the far turn. FUN LOVING stalked in the four to
three path around the first turn, offered mild pressure down the backstretch, but failed to sustain pressure nearing the lane and weakened between horses in
upper stretch. COLONIAL ROSE never got involved from the two path. MAYBE MAGIC was taken back after getting keen between horses early on, trailed
around both turns, fanned to the five path entering the lane was outrun. SHOW ME THE CANDY laid off of the pace three wide, fanned seven wide in upper
stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
INTERMITTENT FAST vied for the lead two wide and between horses, then drew off entering the lane. LITTLE SASS prompted the pace three wide, vied
into the turn, but proved no match for an inner rival entering the lane and was second best. BACK ON TRACK saved ground off of the pace, gained tipping
two wide and between horses nearing the lane, but flattened out and narrowly lasted for show. SHY SHY stalked behind the leaders and from the two path,
got floated three wide entering the lane, yet ran on in pursuit of a flattening foe for show in the late stages, but just missed reaching that position. GO
MARGIE GO laid off of the pace in the three path and improved between horses. ADIOS MUCHACHAS broke slowly, lagged behind while saving ground,
then improved along the rail. TOO FAST FOR YOU chased in the three path and between horses, fanned to the five path entering the lane and faded. WILD
BOUT HILARY vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but gave way turning for home and weakened. AFTERNEATH chased in the four path and faded in
the six path entering the lane.

Footnotes
LILAC GIRL tracked in the two to three path, fanned out to the five path entering the lane, rallied up to the leaders at the furlong grounds, drove subtly clear
entering the final sixteenth and lasted from an outer pair late. MAKE THE BOYS WINK saved ground off of the pace, shifted out to the five path in upper
stretch, rallied to bid for place in the final sixteenth and forged that position in the shadow of the wire. UP AND DOWN pursued from midpack along the
inside, chased in the two path in upper stretch, altered to the four path at the furlong grounds, ran on to gain place in the final sixteenth but was nailed by an
outer bidder late. SECRET STATEMENT set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer presser around the far turn, but was headed by a wider bidder at
the furlong grounds, fought on for minor rewards into the final sixteenth but yielded late. SAKE (FR) lacked speed three wide, swung to the seven path in
upper stretch and moved up. PAINT ME PERFECT laid off of the pace two wide and failed to menace. WHISKEY LULLABY prompted the pace setter from
the outside moving to the backstretch, vied around the far turn but weakened between horses in midstretch. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) pursued from
midpack in the two path, chased in the three path around the far turn, shifted to the six path entering the lane and gave way between horses. CLEVER
JOKE was put to subtly tight quarters between horses at the start, lacked speed two wide, then along the inside around the far turn and made little impact.
GRACE DARLING (IRE) checked between horses early on, trailed along the inside and got outrun. LEMON BOMB stalked in the three path, drifted out to
the four path in upper stretch and faltered between horses.

Footnotes
HURRY HURRY tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader at the five furlong pole, bid along with an outer rival at the seven sixteenths
pole, led from that presser while taking the far turn in the two path, then drew off entering the lane. MASTER GAME laid off of the pace while hung in the
four path, chased the leaders from the five path around the far turn, yet sustained a rally to gain place at the sixteenth pole. FIGHTERTOWN took contact
from an outer rival at the start, stalked in the three path, bid along with an inner rival into the far turn, pressed that one around that bend, but yielded entering
the lane, gave way yet narrowly lasted for show. SANT' ANTIMO bobbled at the start, saved ground off of the pace, chased around the far turn and ran on
while one paced to miss reaching out outer for for show. INEXORABLE laid off of the pace in the three path, but lacked a response to urging in the four path
around the far turn and failed to offer a bid. LONG CROW pursued from midpack three wide and between horses, but tired in the four path around the far
turn. PIKE PLACE stalked in the four path, required strong urging to sustain pressure outside of the top pair around the far turn, then weakened between
horses in upper stretch. MADISON LUVS DUKE broke slowly, trailed, improved in the six path around the far turn and tired. SEVEN FLAT leaned in and
bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses then faded around the far turn. SPEED WARNING pulled clear in the three path
around the first turn, but was headed by an outer pair approaching the far turn and faltered between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
CAIRO STREET pressed three wide, dueled with an inner rival into the final furlong, forged an advantage with a sixteenth to go, leaned inwardly and held.
LUZ DIVINA prompted the pace two wide and between horses, led in upper stretch, dueled with his outer counterpart through the final furlong but was
headed at the sixteenth pole and failed to regain even terms. BUTTERFLY QUEEN tracked in the two path, chased the top pair while gradually shifting
outside of them at the furlong grounds and held show from an inner rival late. MISHKA broke a step slow then got rank from restraint in the early stages,
lacked speed along the inside, fanned to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to gain fourth in the final furlong. AURACULOUS got rank while transferring
contact from an inner rival to an outer foe into the first turn, laid off of the pace in the four to three path, then lacked a bid in the five path. LA SCALONETA
laid off of the pace along the inside, then pursued evenly between horses while hanging on her left lead. PULA tracked in the four path, chased entering the
lane then yielded between horses. SIMPLY STRIKING set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, but weakened in upper stretch. QUEEN LEXI broke slowly
and never got involved. JOYFUL IMAGE hopped slightly while off a step slow, tracked along the inside but tired turning for home. SPIRITUAL LADY took
contact rom an inner rival into the first turn, lacked speed in the five to three path shortly after, then drifted to the nine path in upper stretch and tired.
EXTREMELY GRUNTLED got rank and bumped an outer rival into the first turn, continued keen in the three path and between horses around that bend,
then was through entering the far turn.
