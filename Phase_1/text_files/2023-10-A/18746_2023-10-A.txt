the two path around the far turn and chased the winner home to the wire. PORTOS saved ground around the first bend, trailed the field up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. URBAN MYTH raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the
pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path, offered a mild bid approaching the quarter pole and flattened out from there.

Footnotes
LAPINSKI UNION raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path, kicked clear
in the stretch and held that margin to the wire. MINTENON raced in the two path around the first turn, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch,
dueled from the three path around the second turn and kept on to the finish. GRUNION saved ground early, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up
the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn and chased the winner home in the lane. RULE BREAKER bumped with the
horses to his outside at the start, raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the frontrunner up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in
the four path and finished evenly. I WANNA ROCK veered in sharply and bumped with the horses to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path
around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, raced in tight quarters, bumping with SHIP MASTER approaching the
far turn, navigated the far turn from the two path, raced into traffic with the loose horse and was forced to check in the final furlong and was outkicked from
there. RUGBY ROAD raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid nearing
the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. LT'S JACKNTHEBOX saved ground around the first turn, checked and nearly lost his rider entering the
backstretch, raced off the pace between horses from there, ran out coming off the far turn and never threatened, finishing with his rider standing in the irons.
MY BIG DRAMA raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, drifted out and bumped with SHIP MASTER coming off the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. SETTE STELLE was bumped hard at the start of the race, settled at the
back of the pack on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still in the two path and was empty in the
lane. SHIP MASTER was bumped by the horses to both sides leaving the gate, angled in to save ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up the
backstretch, bumped with both I WANNA ROCK and MY BIG DRAMA approaching the far turn, falling in the process and later walked off. INBOUND reared
and veered out at the start, causing his rider to loose a iron in the process, raced in the four path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up
the backstretch, lost his rider coming around the second bend, was pulled up after the wire and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO
THIS RACE. UPON REVIEW, HORSE ELEVEN, I WANNA ROCK, WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE WITH MULTIPLE

the four path coming around the far turn and was outkicked in the lane. LOVE FOREVERAFTER raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the pace
setter between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far bend in the three path and faded from there. UNA LUNA raced off the pace on the
outside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the second turn and never threatened. BLONDE SAMARITAN raced in the two path early,
settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and made no bid. MS BOOMBASTIC stumbled
leaving the gate, trailed the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and was not a factor.
SEEKINGBYTHESTORM raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in
the two path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
RINGY DINGY raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, began a bid while saving ground around the far
turn and drew off in the lane, in command. MISS ELLARY raced in the two path early, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, came around the
far turn in the three path and chased the winner home in the stretch, no match for that rival. TOP BLUE stalked the pace setters on the outside through the
opening half mile, continued around the far turn in the four path and finished evenly. D'LIGHTFUL SUMMER raced in the two path around the first bend,
chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the second bend and was outkicked from there. STILL
GAME saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and faded in the
lane. GEE WIZ raced in the three path around the first bend, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back headed into the far turn, was eased in
the stretch and later vanned off.
