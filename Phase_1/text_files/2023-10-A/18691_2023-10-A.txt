Footnotes
INVINCIBLE cleared from inside, showed the way through the turn, drew away when asked and was ridden out to the wire. UNCHARTED raced in mid-pack
outside a rival, three deep at the quarter pole, moved out and rallied in the final furlong and bested the rest. AMERICAN HOPE got bumped and put in tight
early, raced inside a pair of rivals towards the rear leaving the backstretch, tipped out at the top of the stretch but lacked room behind rivals, gained a clear
path and kept on but got outfinished for the place honors. EL REY REY was off slow to begin, trailed two wide into the turn, lacked room around the bend,
looked to gain a clear path but had to steady when lacking room in upper stretch, altered out at the eighth pole and put in a late run. STICK SHIFT stalked
from inside, saved ground through the turn and flattened in deep stretch. EIGHT CLAP was off slow to begin, settled inside, got boxed past the three-eighths
pole, shifted two wide near the quarter pole, lugged inward in upper stretch and could not rally in the furlong grounds. GOLD FOOT stalked up close in the
two path into the turn, drifted in upper stretch and weakened. SHEAR MAGIC bumped with inner rival and got crowded early, chased between foes into the
turn in the two path, tipped three wide into the lane and failed to menace. CITADINO traveled three deep near the back, came four wide into the lane and
failed to make an impact. SIR MAXIMUS chased under coaxing up the backstretch off the rail then between rivals, lost ground on the turn, got crowded at
the quarter pole and faded. TEDDY'S TRIUMPH chased two wide into the turn, angled to the rail at the quarter pole bothered by GOLD FOOT drifting over
in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MANGO MOON cleared quickly from outside and crossed over, lightly coaxed around the bend then roused past the quarter pole, put to right then left
handed urging in upper stretch and held safely. MINEDANDREFINED stumbled badly leaving the gate, was a bit rank chasing from behind up the
backstretch while getting into range, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit in the lane and finished determinedly to close the gap on the winner.
CASIA hit the gate to lose a step at the start, stalked between rivals, brushed with IIA VEIW TOO entering the turn three wide, remained in that path to the
stretch and finished evenly late. ILA VEIW TOO broke a step slow, stalked outside the leader up the backstretch, brushed with CASIA entering the turn,
rounded the bend two wide and lacked a bid in the final furlong. ZZYZX chased two wide into the turn, angled over to the rail at the three-eighths pole,
swung out leaving the bend, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. OAK CREEK GAL was off a bit slow to begin, went up to chase up close
four deep, dropped back around the turn, angled in exiting the bend and tired.

Footnotes
MADISON RAE broke well, stalked from inside then switch outside the pacesetter, bid between foes around the bend, fought three wide into the lane,
battled down the stretch and edged MISS MICHE LADA late. MISS MICHE LADA cleared and steered across to the inside, met bids from outer rivals
around the bend, held a short lead two wide into the stretch, fought with MADISON RAE through the lane and yielded grudgingly. PURA VIDA stalked the
pace from inside, cut the corner into the lane, failed to find the needed late kick to challenge the top pair but outfinished HOT DANZING for the show. HOT
DANZING stalked up close from outside, bid three deep on the turn, could not kick on with the leaders entering the final furlong and flattened to fourth.
STAY ZAPPY settled off the pace, ridden along on the turn, shifted ground at the quarter pole and failed to threaten in the final furlong. SIGNORA
VITTORIA dropped back early then moved up outside the leaders four deep, failed to sustain the bid around the turn, chased three wide into the lane and
weakened. MEMORYSINTHEPARK chased widest up the backstretch, went five wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend, trailed three wide into
the lane and tired.

five-sixteenths pole, dueled with BAD SNEAKERS into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch, fought back in the final furlong and was all out to edge
the runner-up. BAD SNEAKERS stalked two wide then moved inside on the first turn, launched a bid inside the top pair at the five-sixteenths pole, put a
head in front in upper stretch, battled MUCINO into deep stretch and finished gamely in defeat. MIXTO rated on the inside then moved out around the first
turn, chased two then three wide on the second bend, angled out in upper stretch and gained the show. EXCEL CALCULATOR coaxed from the gate but
dropped back early, traveled five then four wide near the back, continued wide through the far turn, drew closer four then five wide on the far turn but
flattened out in the stretch. MAUNA KEA BOUND raced up close five then four wide outside rivals on the clubhouse turn, chased into the backstretch, asked
three to four wide on the second bend and weakened down the lane. BRING HIM HOME trailed on the inside, altered around rival leaving the far turn and
could not rally. THRUST vied inside a pair of rivals three wide into the first turn then moved into the two path while taking command, set the pace under
pressure up the backstretch, headed near the three-eighths pole, overtaken while between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, started to weaken with a quarter
mile remaining, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

ENDLESSLY traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, angled in on the far turn while moving into range, tipped out to take aim at NGANNOU in upper stretch,
drew alongside that rival past the eighth pole and drove clear. NGANNOU dueled from inside into the first turn then took control around the bend, led under
mild pressure from outer rivals up the backstretch, cleared approaching the quarter pole, challenged by ENDLESSLY inside the eighth pole, lost command
nearing the sixteenth pole and stayed on to secure second. GRAND MO THE FIRST was off a bit slow to begin, trailed into the first turn on the inside, went
outside a pair of rivals into the far turn, was on the move three then four wide around that bend, chased within striking distance with a furlong remaining but
finished evenly late. ACE OF CLUBS traveled two wide near the back early on then outside a rival, asked right handed past the quarter pole, angled to the
inside in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong but got edged for the show. MICI'S EXPRESS settled inside, got blocked nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, tipped two wide into the clear and passed tired rivals. FORMIDABLE MAN dueled from outside into the first turn then chased the leader around the
bend, moved up to apply pressure from between in the middle stages, lost touch with the NGANNOU approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide into
the lane, bothered by the winner coming out and had to steady outside the eighth pole and was not persevered with after. BOLTAGE raced up close three
deep, failed to kick on with the pacesetter with a quarter mile remaining, remained three wide into the stretch and weakened. POUR DOMPTER (FR) broke
a step slow, stalked on the inside then in mid-pack on the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
GHOST OF MIDNIGHT got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, stalked in hand early, bid between into the turn, inched ahead then cleared past the
quarter pole, drifted out a bit under left handed urging and powered away in the lane. MIDNIGHT FURY broke out and bumped, dueled for command
outside a rival up the backstretch, vied three deep around the bend, could not kick on with GHOST OF MIDNIGHT past the quarter pole and stayed on
through the drive to best the rest. PRINCIP got put in tight between foes early, chased five deep into the turn, four deep into the lane and got outfinished for
the place honors. HONDO CROUCH was off a bit slow in the beginning, stalked on the inside, worked on while shifting to the two path around the bend,
steered back to the inside in upper stretch and was ridden cautiously when crowded a bit with a sixteenth remaining which halted his momentum. ZE'BUL
dropped back early, three to four wide on the turn and passed tired rivals. HOUNDSTOOTH raced up close outside the top pair, went four wide into the turn,
lost ground under coaxing and moved into the three path around the bend, then also weakened in the stretch. TIZ TOK dueled for command from inside,
vied with outer pair into the turn, lost touch with the winner with a quarter mile remaining, remained inside and got put in tight in upper stretch, then faded in
the furlong grounds. HEARTBREAK KID broke in and bumped the winner, tracked three wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and weakened. KEEN
HEIR was off slow in the beginning, trailed into the turn, moved to the inside then came out and exited the bend three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DREAMFYRE set the pace on the inside under pressure, met a pair of bids from outside at the five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead in upper stretch, drifted
out and bumped BUTTERCREAM BABE late and gamely prevailed. BUTTERCREAM BABE pressed from outside to the far turn, vied between rivals
around the bend, fought outside DREAMFYRE into the final furlong, got bumped by that rival past the sixteenth pole and could not get by. FLATTERY
stalked along the inside, roused midway around the far turn, stayed along the rail into the stretch and showed a mild rally to gain the show honors.
WHERE'S MY RING bobbled shortly after the start, was taken back and started to pull early, continued to tug up the backstretch and onto the three-eighths
pole, let loose around the second bend, moved out in upper stretch and kept on for a minor award. SOHO pulled early, raced in range in the two path,
launched a bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, could not go on with the leaders entering the final furlong and flattened in deep stretch. ZONA VERDE
(IRE) was fractious in the gate, broke a bit slow, trailed on the inside into the clubhouse turn, tipped two wide second bend, moved out in upper stretch, then
steered back in and improved position. ANGIOLLETA (IRE) broke a step slow, settled outside a rival, drew closer two wide on the far turn and lacked a rally.
PUTT FOR DOUGH settled inside, looked to split rivals but lacked room and had to check at the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the inside into the
stretch and was not persevered with late. SUSHI STICKS reserved early and tucked inside near the back, steadied when running up on rivals heels into the
far turn, got blocked around that bend and failed to threaten. THE RIDER ABOARD BUTTERCREAM BABE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST
DREAMFYRE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE LATE IN THE STRETCH AND THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE SAME
INCIDENT. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUG DREAMFYRE DID DRIFT OUT AND MAKE CONTACT WITH
BUTTERCREAM BABE LATE, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
SEAL TEAM (GB) tracked three deep then outside a rival, went three deep into the far turn, challenged three wide into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and
held under strong urging. ALIGATO lost his path shortly after the start, settled inside then moved to the two path on the first turn, traveled three deep into
the second bend, remained off the rail into the stretch, rallied and was gaining to the wire but was not enough. LOTTERY PICK sat off the pace outside a
rival then three deep on the first turn, drew closer up the backstretch, launched a bid four deep into the stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. MALTESE
FALCON (IRE) chased between then moved inside, went two wide into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and churned on for a minor award. RECKLESS
SPIRIT got bumped early, reserved in the two path, had to check at the three-eighths pole, tipped out to the three path, swung out into the lane and
improved position. LAHAINA FLAVOR got bumped from outside shortly after the start, traveled on the inside near the back, had to pause when running up
on heels into the far turn, saved ground around that bend, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out and improved position. SOULMATE showed keen early
speed three deep, vied with inner pair up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and weakened in the lane. EASTBOUND trailed on the inside early,
moved out and was on the move three then four deep on the far turn, then flattened out in the final furlong. PHOSPHORESCENCE (FR) rated along the
inside, moved out in upper stretch and lacked room, then weakened in deep stretch. DOMINANT SOUL dueled for command from inside, vied with rivals in
the middle stages, fought with SOULMATE through the far turn and weakened down the lane. WODETON (FR) pulled early vying between rivals, failed to
keep exiting the backstretch, dropped back around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.
