Footnotes
SPARKLING JEWEL stalked the early pace two wide, rallied through the turn to make the lead in at the top of the stretch outside the leader and proved best
by a narrow margin while fully extended. LADY LOTTIE away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, dug in gamely under left handed urging
and just failed. FULL TIME STRUTIN chased the early pace along the inside and lacked the needed response. WORTHERWEIGHTNGOLD stumbled at the
start and was no threat. ELIKA trailed throughout.

BACK TO OHIO had good early speed along the inside, waited for racing room behind a trio of horses through the turn, angled out and split rivals two wide
entering the stretch, shifted inside the leader, surged along the rail and proved best under confident handling. CANDLELIGHT HOURS pressed the pace
two wide into the turn, made the lead, drifted to the four path at the top of the stretch then inward through deep stretch and couldn't handle the winner. TIVIS
allowed to settle, had a mild late rally in the four path. WINE ME UP BABY away alertly, set the pace near the inside until mid turn, remained a sharp threat
into the stretch and weakened late. R THREE ANGELS was taken outside shortly after the start and failed to menace. AUNT BEE was no factor. KICHI
KITSU stalked the leaders four wide down the backstretch, loomed boldly three wide entering the turn then came up empty.
