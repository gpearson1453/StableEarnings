MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES broke alertly and moved clear, widened on the turn and remained safe while kept to a drive. SO SWELL broke very slowly,
advanced wide and was up for the place late. LA LUISA chased in the two path then inside and flattened out through the stretch. POPTHECHAMPAGNE
RO moved close up inside, eased back into the far turn and lacked a rally. CALIENTE RUM pursued inside, was taken up near the far turn and lacked a
response. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE raced just off the pacesetter outside and proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
TOTAL DISCRETION outrun early, moved boldly inside into the stretch, took over quickly and pulled away while kept to her task. LOST LUGGAGE asked
for run after half a mile, finally leveled off on the final turn and was up for the place. LITTLE DOYLE prompted the pace outside, was bumped at the top of
the stretch and continued willingly. BRUNO BARBER GIRL set a pressured pace inside, was bumped off stride at the top of the lane then tired. LORD JOAN
broke slowly then rated wide and lacked a solid response. COLETTE'S SPIRIT bid inside to a narrow lead at the quarter pole then weakened.
ANGELOFTHEGALAXY raced just off the leaders outside, moved wide in the stretch and retreated. AMALFI LADY broke awkwardly and was never in
contention racing inside. LUCKY BREEZE settled close up inside then stopped abruptly on the final turn. The stewards posted an inquiry into the bumping at
the top of the stretch but the result was allowed to stand.

CONFIRMED GENIUS pursued the loose pacesetter, continued determinedly then wore down that rival in the final strides following a long drive. AEGEAN
SEA quickly sprinted away, remained clear to midstretch then was nailed in the final yards. GINGERS WISH lagged far behind, advanced inside on the turn
and closed well with a steady gain. PURE ELEGANCE lacked speed outside and was never involved. RANDOM LUCK chased in the two path and was
always outrun.

PEARLS AND HEELS stumbled badly at the start, advanced quickly on the turn inside and pulled away through the stretch. CREME CARAMEL rushed up
inside to set the pace after a quarter mile but proved no match for the winner. LULI'S DANCER settled off the leaders, angled wide on the turn with a mild
rally. CRAZY SERENA chased wide down the backstretch, faded on the turn and was no threat. BULLET ON TAP forced the pace between rivals to the far
turn and faltered. SWEET LILLY FACTUM flashed speed three wide for half a mile and stopped. PEARLBDANCING earned a narrow advantage inside in
the opening quarter and gave way.

Footnotes
DREAM CONCERT vied outside, led on the turn, was collared in the stretch losing the advantage narrowly then battled back very gamely to gain the
decision. FLOR DE SOMBRA reserved behind the leaders, bid on the turn, led narrowly in midstretch but was outgamed to the wire. IN MY OPINION
chased inside, faded on the turn then came again outside for the show. MARY Q raced wide off the pace and was finished after half a mile. COMEDY ACT
led inside under pressure then faltered midway on the turn. KISSES FOR EMILY dropped far behind early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TALENTED MAN came over early having his heels clipped, vied outside, edged clear in the stretch and held rival safe driving. ROB THE RICH settled off
the pace then rallied outside with gradual a gain in the stretch. ICONIC LEGACY saved ground well behind then offered some late energy. POWERFULLY
BUILT chased within range outside and began fading on the turn. A DANGEROUS GUY was urged just off the leaders inside and faltered. TUFF
CONSTITUTION alternated for the advantage inside and gave way through the stretch. GEEBERT clipped heels and bobbled badly early then trailed
throughout. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of GEEBERT against the rider of TALENTED MAN for early interference, TALENTED
MAN was disqualified and placed last.

CADDY MAN outrun early inside, swung wide rallying into the stretch, closed well and bid clear late. VESELSKY raced in pursuit inside, moved out in the
stretch and finished willingly. UPTOWN SHOES moved between rivals in second flight and continued well. BUBBY PAPERMAKER outrun early, advanced
with good energy along the inside. IT'S A PITY chased four wide in second flight then steadied tiring late. IM STILL BRAVE quickly sprinted to long lead, led
to the stretch then faltered. SPARTAN BOY fractious in gate prior to start, raced well back and was no factor. SHEA D CAPTURE broke slowest, rushed up
wide down the backstretch and faded. LORD SEABEE lacked speed along the rail and was never a factor. BIG POPPER lagged far behind and was never
in contention. ARTHUR S GOLD raced very wide on the turn and gave way readily.
