Footnotes
THAT KHENNY cleared soon after the start, continued clear through the turn and into the lane, was put under a drive when straightening in the lane then
inched away to the wire. HIGH BROW raced in the two path through the turn, continued in the two or three path through the turn and into the lane, shifted
into the five path late when gaining momentum and just got up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. GOOD SUGAR chased the winner through
late turn and into the lane, continued to chase the top one through the final sixteenth and just lost the place spot at the wire. SHIPSHAPE chased the pace
from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and finished evenly. RISKY BOY was closest to the winner into the turn,
continued in the three path through the turn and into the lane and weakened. RAF never a factor while along the inside. DANANG was in the four path
through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and trailed.

up for the place spot. FIERCE JUSTICE pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, chased the winner into the lane while in the three path, could not

Footnotes
DEBOISBLANC set the early pace while under pressure into the turn, shook clear after mid-turn, widened into the lane then extended to the wire while being
ridden out. DESIGNATED was in the two to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path then finished with good momentum to be
up for the place spot. MILA JUNES was in the four or five path through the far turn when in mid-pack, continued with good energy into the lane while in the
four path and was just outfinished for the place spot. BALLADRY prompted the pace three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, had
aim on the winner after straightening, could not gain on that one and lost two spots at the wire. HERE'S THE SPIDER raced off the rail through the turn
while in the two path, came into the lane from the four or five path then moved up while never a factor. FANCIFUL pressed the pace two wide through
mid-turn, could not keep up with the winner while dropping to the rail through late turn then faded. AIM HIGHER in the two or three path through the turn
when never far back, came into the lane from the four path and tired. LUCKY LESSON was outrun while off the inside. SUNDAY SPEIGHT was close early
while near the inside into the turn and was done in mid-turn.

Footnotes
ZOLO dueled inside, was clear in the stretch and lasted under steady urging. JEOPARDY THEORY stalked the pace inside, angled two path late and
proved second best. WRITE OFF JERRY was climbing during his first run down the stretch, angled out on the far turn, bid five wide but couldn't close late.
HAVILDAR stalked the pace in the two path but had no late bid. SIMPLE LOGIC stalked the pace between foes, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, then
faltered in the stretch. WHAT A BLAST dueled outside of the winner to the stretch and gave way. MOMS MOON stalked the pace in the three path before
fading in early stretch. ICE SHARD trailed, bid inside near the half-mile pole and then faltered in the stretch. COOL AND COLLECTED faded. ME AND
CHILI stalked the pace in the four path before fading near the three-eighths pole.
