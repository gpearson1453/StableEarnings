Footnotes
VALENTINE GIFT showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dueled inside of a rival in upper stretch,
shook clear coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. HANDLE ON YOU chased the leading duo on the outside then in the four
path on the turn, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final sixteenth and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. CALL HER BLUFF
bumped solidly with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn, chased the leaders under a drive into the final sixteenth
and just missed the place. DUSK contested the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dueled outside of the winner into the final furlong,
dropped back into the final sixteenth and weakened. LU'S REDEMPTION moved out while urged along well off the pace, went four then five wide on the
turn and lacked the needed response. MIA NIPOTINA bumped soundly with a rival at the start, dropped back on the far outside while void of speed, angled
in late on the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. CITY BLOCKS bobbled at the start, was urged along off the pace,
went three wide on the turn and came up empty. ALETTE D'ORO was last to commence, raced near the back, moved from the rail to the three path on the
turn, spun four wide into the stretch and was no factor. BELLS TOLLING was ridden along off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn and failed to
respond. BARONESS BOURBON was urged along off the pace, raced in the two path while between horses early on the turn, was crowded when a foe
crossed in front near the seven-sixteenths, moved to the three path before the five-sixteenths and also failed to respond. LEARNING TO FLY was coaxed
along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, steadied while in tight against the rail near the seven-sixteenths and capitulated. CARA'S GIRL bumped solidly
with foes on both sides at the start, went five wide on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and faltered then was eased but walked off.

SEA STREAK bobbled at the break recovering inwards and forcing SKIP THE LINE to shy in briefly before being steadied when squeezed out, chased six
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn coming under coaxing just past the three-eighths, went seven wide into
upper stretch, closed well outside to overthrow the front inside the eighth pole, then drew clear to the finish getting geared down in the final jumps. WAJDA
broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive tussling with CHANGE OF COMMAND through to the finish running on to best that rival for the place honors. CHANGE OF COMMAND five to
six paths off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command nearing the eighth pole, got overhauled inside that station and fought on with the aforementioned rival to the
finish and was along safe for the show honors. REASONED ANALYSIS got bumped askew at the start by SKIP THE LINE coming inwards in reaction to the
tightening of his lane by SEA STREAK, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the finish. LIVEHAPPY coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, dug in taking narrow and brief command with three-sixteenths to go before being headed by CHANGE OF COMMAND nearing the
eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. RATHMORE coaxed from the start, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader before tucking inside
through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took over command and took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, got displaced from
the front at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the final furlong. SKIP THE LINE shied in bumping REASONED ANALYSIS and then got steadied when
squeezed out at the break due to press from SEA STREAK, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn,
went six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. STATES UNITED coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ELECTRIC EEL coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a
ride from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. GUM ISLAND coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three wide into upper stretch, made no impact. THUNDERSLAM shied in at the start, chased just off the inside
until tucked inside through the turn, swung three wide for home, made no impact. MAXIMILLIONS DREAM coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the stretch.

eighth-pole, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then drew away under steady handling. HEADLAND went to the front, angled in outside the
five-eighths, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper
stretch, came out inside the furlong marker then was overtaken by the winner and proved no match. CARAMEL SWIRL was away alertly, settled on the
inside, was roused near the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch, chased into the final furlong, checked between foes outside the sixteenth-pole and
lost momentum then secured the unofficial show position. BEGUINE brushed the outside of the gate then bumped lightly with a foe after the start, tracked
the pace, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the quarter-pole, chased in upper stretch, steadied between foes at the furlong marker
and weakened. UNDERVALUED ASSET made light contract with a foe after the start, was rated off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, moved

Footnotes
ZANDON went three wide early on the first turn then was carried to the five path, was taken up while bumping with a foe midway through that bend, settled
off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew away
under steady handling. FILM STAR raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, took
the lead coming to the quarter-pole, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner and proved no match while just able to get the
place. LAW PROFESSOR tossed his head while lugging out from the two path to the four path early on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the four path on the far turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong and just missed the place. CHARGE IT was hustled from the
gate, moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, was well placed down the backstretch, passed the half-mile pole under urging, chased in the two
path on the far turn, had the rider lose his crop outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. O'CONNOR (CHI) was restless in the gate, broke a
bit slow, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path on the far turn and gained ground but
failed to threaten. TYSON was carried from the four path to the six path early on the first turn then bumped with a rival, settled on the far outside, was urged
five wide on the far turn, spun six wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and came up empty. COSTA TERRA dropped from the two
path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. PIPELINE went to the front,
traveled around the opening bend in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked while inside on the far turn, lost the lead at the
quarter-pole and gave way.

to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and made no impact. SWEETNESS led early on from the four path before dueling three wide briefly with DISRUPTION to her inside, got shaken off
inside seven-sixteenths and chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and tired. DISRUPTION
forwardly placed just off the inside in the early going, advanced to duel with the aforementioned foe briefly down the backstretch before emerging with
DASHING DELLA into the turn, got displaced from command with seven-sixteenths to go and came under coaxing midway on the turn, faded and spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
ALLEY'S SONG brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along between horses, went five then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid at the
quarter-pole, battled outside the runner-up into the final furlong, took the advantage coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear late while best. SOL
EMPERATRIZ pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, took the lead passing the three-eighths, led under a drive until near
the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. NECESSARYANDPROPER brushed the inside of the gate at the start, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the lead passing the three-eighths pole, dropped back into the stretch and weakened.
POSEIDON'S MIST was urged along just off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the turn and came up empty. WISE CONVERSATION broke a bit
awkwardly, dropped back while showing no speed then angled in, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. PERFECTLY MPERFECT brushed with a
rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, went six then five wide on the turn and failed to respond. SONG OF SOLOMINI was last to commence, raced
towards the back while ridden along, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was no factor. BANK ON BELLE was urged along off the
pace, steadied briefly while in tight near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. MISS OMAHA
bobbled at the start then was hustled, chased the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, dropped back fast late on that bend and faltered then was eased
but walked off.
