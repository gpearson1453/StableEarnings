Footnotes
WMA OLIVER saved ground in the early furlongs, shifted outward in the upper stretch and kick clear in the final furlong to be up late. ERIN MHF settled in
the early furlongs, swung six wide leaving the bend and closed willingly besting the rest in late stretch and was up for second. WMA WILD ROSES was
advancing from the three path down the backstretch to duel for the lead with an inner rival leaving the bend and into the stretch then was out finished in the
end and kept on for show. PEARLS COMET AA chased the pace from the inside, then was bumped and steadied slightly at the half pole, rebid from the four
path on the turn and closed well despite prior challenges. UPTOWN KEEPMEINMIND chased the pace while two wide and outside rival, then bumped rival
at the half pole, rebid on the turn under strong urging, advanced to third position in the upper stretch then gave way in the end. SWEET IVORY AA set the
pace from the two path into the turn, then dueled from the inside into the early stretch, was used up and gave way in the end. FLYINGJ JOYCE settled while
three wide then bid while seven wide leaving the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. RB MAMA WINGATE pressed the pace from the inside under a
hard drive, was used up after the turn and flattened out in the stretch. WMA DIAMOND GIRL settled along the inside and was thru after the first half. TR
MBAPPE stalked the pace from the two path in the early yards then dropped back after the half and had no final rally. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY
in regards to interference in the early furlongs. After review, no change was made.
