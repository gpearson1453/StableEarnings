Footnotes
HE HATE ME trailed far behind then rallied strongly to catch the pacesetters in the final stages. STRAWBERRY CONE broke sluggishly, advanced inside,
was carried out late while finishing gamely. STARLITE WALKER quickly took control, opened a long lead on the turn then weakened. BIG CITY BOB
chased off the leaders inside and flattened out in the stretch. HE'S INCREDIBLE chased wide off the pace and lacked a rally. JOVIAL pursued the
pacesetter, lost his action o0 the turn then collapsed at the quarter pole. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
COLONEL JUAN settled inside, bid on the final turn then edged clear following a long drive. EXCURSION well placed early, moved with the winner on the
turn but was outfinished. WIZARD SERRAT lacked speed outside, remained wide and made a gradual late gain. LONG GRAY LINE dropped back inside
then continued willingly in the stretch. RELATIVLEA earned a narrow lead dueling outside then came up empty. SUNNY SAINT forced the pace along the
inside for five furlongs and gave way. DARK STORM dropped back early and gave way readily.

the pace then made a gradual late gain. WONDER CITY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and continued gamely. MERCY MERCY settled off the
pace, moved wide in the stretch and was no threat. KENTUCKY PRIDE chased wide throughout and lacked a response. RISQUE'S JEWEL trailed to the
stretch and was always outrun. BEYOND A MILLION broke slowest, raced wide and gave way.

A CASE OF YOU rated inside, angled out in the stretch and quickly pulled away under moderate pressure. FEARLESS KRISTIE stalked the pacesetter, bid
into the stretch then proved no match for the winner. NEON CITY trailed far behind, advanced inside and closed well for the place. FANCY SCEPTER set a
measured pace to the stretch then weakened. JESS'S GYPSY GIRL dropped back three wide and steadily faded. SO FULLY SUE lacked speed, moved
wide and was never a factor. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS dropped far behind and was never in contention. PACHELBEL prompted pair of leaders outside for half
a mile and gave way.

Footnotes
BARTLETT hustled to the front, shook loose in midstretch and just lasted while shortening stride late. FACE THE FACTS moved close up inside, angled out
on the turn and closed well too late. CHILLING HASSLE pressed the winner outside to the stretch and weakened. CHECKING BOXES raced off the leaders
three wide and lacked a solid rally. PENTATONIC chased in midpack then caught rivals along the inside. ZIO SALINO lacked speed racing wide and was
never involved. RIDLEY PARK raced very wide and failed to menace. DON TEQUILAS moved off the leaders in the clear four wide and faltered. BIAGIO
dropped back inside awaiting room then was no factor. IN THE AIR dropped far behind early and always outrun. KING MUFASA broke slowest and was
never in contention. CRAIGH NA DUN lagged far behind throughout.

Footnotes
AWESOME PAL earned a narrow lead, shook loose on the turn then held rival safe through the final furlong. BOCA ROYALTY saved ground, advanced into
the stretch, loomed a threat but hung. LEAN ON E broke alertly then dropped back, rallied inside then went evenly. OUI MADAME dropped well behind then
showed some late energy. CARLY HUSTLE steadied leaving the chute, raced far behind and was no factor. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY urged just off the
winner outside then faded in the final furlong. B B'S ROCKET moved close up to the turn and faltered. SCHNUER WILL chased four wide down the
backstretch and was always outrun. ADVOCATE HARBOR trailed early then caught fading rivals. WHAT A BEAUT raced outside in second flight and gave
way. ABHAILE began retreating after a quarter mile. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE forced the pace along the inside then began weakening on the turn.
