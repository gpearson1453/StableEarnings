Footnotes
REPORT stepped to the front quickly from inside, led clear through the turn, put to left then right handed urging in the lane and stayed clear when flagged
with the crop through the final sixteenth. SIDE BY SIDE settled off the pace, raced along the inside into the turn, tipped out but ran into traffic briefly
approaching the five-sixteenths pole, altered back to the rail, tipped out with a quarter mile remaining, got to within striking distance with a furlong left to run
but finished evenly in deep stretch. LISA'S NONNO broke a step slow on the outside, chased off the rail then angled in on the turn, steered back out in
upper stretch and finished with late run but could not threaten the top pair. RILEY G was closest in pursuit giving chase to the outside of the lone leader
early, traveled in the two path through the turn and weakened in the final furlong. MISS MONARCH BAY chased on the inside into the turn, eased off the rail
and came three wide into the stretch and also weakened in the drive. SULTRY KITTEN stumbled in the beginning, traveled near the back three wide exiting
the backstretch, moved out to the four path around the bend and failed to menace. ALWAYS SMILING chased outside a rival or three wide into the turn,
started to weaken around the bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
DEVIL MOON set the pace on the inside in hand up the backstretch, confidently handled through the turn, roused in upper stretch and held well under right
handed urging and strong handling. CASTLEKNOCK chased two wide into the turn, traveled between runners through the bend, moved out in upper stretch,
put in a late bid but needed more late. TICKLE MY FANCY away quickest in the beginning, chased the pacesetter outside a rival, navigated the turn three
wide and finished evenly in the final furlong. SANGER raced up close in the early going to the outside of the leader, took aim two wide exiting the bend and
lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. DUTY FIRST broke a step slow, traveled three deep while not far back into the turn, spun four wide into the
drive and could not rally. MISTER BEAMS stalked from inside, saved ground through the turn and lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
CHATALAS set the pace under pressure from DUA, roused past the five-sixteenths pole, still holding a short advantage over outer rival, put to left then right
handed urging in the lane and drew clear in the final sixteenth. SCALABLE settled off the pace on the inside, made progress through the far turn continuing
to save ground, rallied along the fence in the lane and got up for second. DUA prompted the pace from outside, roused on the far turn to stay alongside
CHATALAS, fought with that rival to the sixteenth pole, could not match the winner late and got edged for second. PACIFIC ROSE stalked from inside,
tipped three wide at the quarter pole and finished evenly in the late stages. GATE TO PARADISE tracked three deep through both turns, came four wide
into the stretch and weakened. AUTUMN CHILL had to check when running up on rivals heels into the first turn, chased the top pair from between after, lost
ground under coaxing on the far turn and weakened in the lane. MOTET was fanned six wide into the clubhouse turn then altered down into the three path,
traveled near the back in the middle stages, rounded the far turn two to three wide and could not rally. PINK WHITNEY threw her head and came away last
in the beginning, trailed three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, angled in to save ground on the far turn and was not a factor. LAURENT chased four
wide into the first turn then drifted to the five path, remained well off the rail up the backstretch, came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SLIDER set the pace under pressure from outer rival, drifted out and came four wide into the lane while relinquishing the lead to DARK VINTAGE (IRE),
fought with that rival to the sixteenth pole and dug in late to draw clear. DARK VINTAGE (IRE) broke a step slow, chased along the rail into and around the
bend, launched a bid exiting the turn and took over at the top of the lane, held a short lead over SLIDER into the final furlong, dueled into the final sixteenth
and yielded late. APRIL VINTAGE stalked wide up the backstretch, went five wide into the turn, angled into the three path then bumped with inner rival
approaching the quarter pole, kept on through the lane and bested the rest. DES DOIGTS was off slow to begin, raced near the back, altered out from
behind steadying rival at the three-eighths pole, steered out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally to earn a minor award. BEAR RIVER chased three
deep into the turn, got floated six wide past the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. ALWAYS ON CAY bothered leaving the gate and dropped
back, raced off the rail and came three wide into the lane, then improved position through the lane. CHARGE FOR GOLD broke a step slow, had to steady
near the inside entering the turn, continued along the rail through the turn, steadied in tight in upper stretch and was not persevered with late. TRANCHE
broke a step slow, chased between rivals then drifted and had to check hard at the three-eighths pole, bumped outer rival nearing the quarter pole and
flattened out. MYSTICISM veered in leaving the gate, went up to press the pace from outside, got floated five wide around the bend and weakened in the
drive. LORD PRANCEALOT broke in, forwardly placed three deep, drifted six wide around the bend and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING
THE RUN INTO THE TURN, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT TRANCHE CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MAGIC SPOON was off a bit slow, looked to get into range but had to steady behind a rival early and climbed a bit, advanced around the bend and swung
five wide into the stretch, flew late and overhauled JARAMA for the victory. JARAMA bumped between rivals at the start, attended the pace five then four
deep, fought four then three wide, cleared past the five-sixteenths pole and crossed over into the two path, led clear into the final sixteenth and got run down
by the winner. STAY ON THE FENCE broke in and bumped, forwardly placed six then five deep up the backstretch, rounded the bend five then four wide
and finished willingly for the show. STOLEN TREASURE vied three deep early then outside a rival in the early going, vied between on the turn, chased past
the five-sixteenths pole, kept on through the lane and earned a minor award. HALO UNCLE settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn, tipped out
and tried to split rivals but lacked room midstretch and flattened out. PETESOLDFASHIONED sent to fight for the lead inside several rivals, dueled into the
turn, chased the new leader past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. RED ON SUNDAY pressed four then three deep up the backstretch, had his path
taken by JARAMA approaching the five-sixteenths pole and weakened after. FACT OR FICTION got bumped and took up at the start, trailed five wide into
the turn, had one beat entering the stretch and failed to menace. WICKED FACTS showed speed briefly between rivals then chased up the backstretch,

Footnotes
BOOK SMART sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, coaxed along a bit off the rail into the drive and padded the margin under left handed
urging. EGOMANIA chased outside rivals then moved into the two path for the turn, rallied near the inside and outclosed RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) for
second. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) broke in and bumped, chased three wide through the turn, steered out in upper the lane, finished well and missed the
place. ELEVADO stalked two wide into the turn, ridden along around the bend, came three wide into the stretch, flattened in the final sixteenth and lost the
place and show. BRAZENLY bumped with inner rival at the start, traveled along the inside off the pace into the turn, tipped two wide around the bend and
failed to threaten. TRUSTY RUSTY stalked three deep early, went three then four wide around the turn and weakened. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY bumped at
the start, traveled along the inside at the back into the turn, eased out to the three path around the bend, moved out wider in the lane and failed to menace.
CURLY ESA sat off the pace outside a rival, rounded the bend two then three wide and failed to respond when called upon. SAI CON (FR) bumped in the
beginning, forwardly placed up the backstretch, lost ground along the rail through the turn and faded in the lane. COMRADERY (IRE) was off a bit slow,
coaxed along near the back while racing widest early, entered the lane five wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
DIDIA (ARG) settled in the two path, drew closer in the middle stages, bid three deep late on the far turn, took over into the lane, kicked clear in upper
stretch and remained strong under urging to the wire. ANISETTE (GB) bumped lightly leaving the gate, rated along the inside, tipped two wide midway
around the far turn and chased between rivals late on the bend, finished willingly through the lane and outkicked JUNCTURE (GB) for second. JUNCTURE
(GB) broke a step slow and got bumped back at the start, settled inside, moved out and drew closer between rivals on the backstretch, rounded the far turn
two then three wide and got outkicked for the place honors. CLOSING REMARKS rated along the inside through the early going, continued to save ground
around the far turn and cut the corner into the stretch, chased within striking range entering the final furlong but flattened in the late stages. NEIGE
BLANCHE (FR) raced in the two path near the back, roused two to three wide around the far turn, steered out at the top of the lane and failed to threaten.
SYMPHONY PERFECT (IRE) reserved early on and tucked inside, saved ground through the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. STOIC
LUNA stalked in range outside a rival, moved up to duel for command in the middle stages, fought head to head through the far turn, vied between leaving
the bend, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and bumped with inner rival at the sixteenth pole.
TURNERLOOSE took control early from inside then drifted out across the dirt, remained clear and showed the way early on, challenged by STOIC LUNA on
the backstretch and dueled with that rival into and around the far turn, was no match for the winner in upper stretch, bumped STOIC LUNA at the sixteenth
pole and weakened.

stretch, put away WINE ME UP midstretch, drew away in the final sixteenth while kept busy to the wire. WINE ME UP stepped to the front and crossed over
to the inside, set the pace under pressure, cleared outer rivals past the half-mile pole, challenged by MUTH at the quarter pole, lost command in upper
stretch, could not kick on with the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. BE YOU tracked in the two path out of range early, drew closer up
the backstretch, gained on the inside then two wide through the far turn but flattened in the furlong grounds. RAGING TORRENT pressed the pace from
between rivals, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn two to three wide and weakened. ROTHSCHILD pulled briefly into the first
turn along the inside, traveled in mid-pack entering the second bend, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. INDISPENSABLE tracked three wide then
got bumped to the four path early on the 1st turn, raced at the back outside a rival in the middle stages, asked three, four, then five wide on the second bend
and proved no menace. NEXT LEVEL stumbled badly, rushed up behind rivals and bumped INDISPENSABLE while steadying into the first turn, traveled at
the back into the far turn, came two wide into the lane and was not a factor. EL MAGNIFICO attended the pace three deep early, trying to drift in up the
backstretch while the rider tried to correct, finally took hold at the half-mile pole losing ground, chased between rivals on the far turn and took hold again at
the quarter pole, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
KISSED BY FIRE set the pace with pressure from outside, cleared outer rival past the three-eighths pole, led two wide into the lane and remained
unchallenged under urging. GEM MINE chased off the rail then angled in on the turn, gained up the inside around the bend, finished evenly in the furlong
grounds and drifted out late while holding second. REAL FIRE sat off the pace, raced outside a rival into the turn, chased two then three wide on the turn,
moved out in the lane, summoned a mild rally and gained third while getting bumped at the wire. ALVINA (FR) raced in mid-pack to the turn, came in a
brushed rival past the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the lane, finished willingly through the drive and got bumped approaching the wire. MISS
LIZZY came away slow, angled to the inside, moved out around the bend and came three wide into the stretch, rallied but got blocked late and bumped
outer rival approaching the wire halting all momentum. HAYLEY LEVADE broke a step slow and dropped back early, saved ground through the turn, moved
out at the top of the lane, summoned a mild rally while moving back inside but needed to find more. TEEN DRAMA broke poorly, traveled mid-pack on the
inside into the turn, had to steady behind trouble rival on the turn, altered to the two path, kept on through the lane but could not threaten. RAGTIME ROSE
off slow in the beginning, settled off the pace on the inside, got brushed and put in tight by outer rival and checked on the turn, remained inside to the lane
and could not rally. SECRETS TOLD pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the winner past the three-eighths pole, chased two wide into the lane
and weakened. NU PI LAMBDA raced near the back two wide into the turn, dropped back to last and angled over to the inside on the turn and was not a
factor.
