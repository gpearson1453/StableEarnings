CLASSIC PERFORMER stalked the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, eased out to the three path turning for home, secured command outside
LENAMAGNETTA near the eighth pole and drove clear. LITTLE BABY GIRL , four deep on the turn, rallied outside horses and switched leads twice in the

between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. QUEEN JELLY BEAN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in upper stretch.
MOMS TRIBUTE , no factor, was kept wide throughout. FUNNY SHE FIRED ME began sluggishly, racd along the inner rail on the turn and was outrun.

Footnotes
WHAT SAY YOU had speed then was content to be rated back off the leader heading to the seven furlong marker, angled out to track two to three wide,
came under coaxing into the far turn then went on the attack past the three eighths, wrested a short lead entering the lane, battled outside BRASSTOWN
past the furlong grounds under strong encouragement, edged away through the final sixteenth then held firm. BRASSTOWN rushed clear outside the
winner, dropped in to set the pace, was engaged near the five sixteenths, fought on past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and saved the place.
NORTHERN THUNDER was angled outside rivals leaving the three quarter pole, advanced four wide leaving the far turn, continued wide for the drive and
closed steadily. HOT N SPICY LOVE , taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, advanced inside nearing the lane, came out to progress to the inside
of NORTHERN THUNDER leaving mid stretch then flattened out late. VIRGINIA FULLA , two to three wide early on, raced between runners nearing the far
turn, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths, shifted out five wide for the drive but lacked a solid run. CAN'T PASS IT UP , off the pace and between rivals
early on, dropped in mid way through the backstretch and failed to respond. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY , bumped at the break, was sent up and raced three
wide stalking the leaders, was pushed along leaving the far turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. FORMAL ORDER broke outward bumping
a rival, steadied when in tight soon after, lagged back while five wide and never got involved.

HUNTER JOE bumped with NOBLE CONQUEST leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace down the backstretch, swung to the three path leaving the far
turn, closed outside horses, led late and drove clear. COLBALOAF prompted the pace outside MY BOY COLTON, over took that one leaving the far turn
and continued gamely through the stretch. MY BOY COLTON , right to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gradually weakened the
final furlong. CRAZY KATER , three wide both turns, failed to menace and finished evenly. OXIDE raced in mid pack down the backstretch and lacked a
rally. NOBLE CONQUEST bumped with the winner leaving the starting gate, raced outside horses in the stretch and showed mild, late interest. NEVER
CHANGE , a bit rank at the break, was well positioned outside horses leaving the backstretch and gave way on the far turn. JAMMIN STILL raced inside
horses and faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
KADRI was nudged to the front, set a pressured pace under rating while towards the inside, spurted away into the lane, opened up after being put a drive
leaving the three sixteenths, was kept alert to deep stretch and held firm. MURRAY , brushed and in tight at the break, was hustled up and advanced
between foes into the turn, gave chase past mid turn, altered in entering the lane, moved up past mid stretch, came out late and finished strong.
MOJOVATION chased the leaders while saving ground, worked outward to be about four wide past the three sixteenths, churned on and earned the show.
MAGIC MULE bore out at the break and was away last, corrected and was sent up three wide between rivals heading to the turn, pursued three deep past
the five sixteenths, angled five to six wide in upper stretch and kept on with effort. FUNKENSTEIN , four deep off the pace, raced well back mid turn, angled
out in the drive and offered a belated response. TREASURE TRADITION , three to four wide, lacked a bid. OUTKISSED broke outward tightening
MURRAY, corrected and went up to prompt outside the winner, failed to kick on with that one in upper stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened.
SHOWTIME CAT saved ground without threatening.

Footnotes
HOME SCHOOL , rated inside horses down the backstretch, worked his way to the six path in upper stretch, closed resolutely outside rivals and was up
approaching the finish. GENERAL'S DUTY lacked speed, moved to the five path inside the winner in upper stretch and rallied between foes. DARK AND
FITZY , clear into the first turn, set the pace near the inner rail and weakened late. MASTER OF NONE advanced four wide leaving the far turn to reach a
striking position then flattened out. KING SWANSBORO raced in the three path on both turns, bid for the lead outside DARK AND FITZY in mid stretch then
weakened in the drive. DYNA MAST lacked speed, raced along the inner rail in upper stretch, lacked room in mid stretch, altered course to the outside near
the eighth pole and passed tired rivals. CARLOUN (IRE) , steadied in traffic entering the far turn, lacked the necessary late effort. GETTIN'DOWNONIT ,
always near the inner rail, stalked the pace, loomed in mid stretch then gave way. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA chased the pace to mid stretch and gave way.
ELUSIVE was outrun.

Footnotes
TOCAYO , three deep with the early pace, emerged in a duel outside MISTER AGENT mid turn, gained a slim lead battling into the lane, edged clear under
a drive leaving the furlong grounds, widened a bit a sixteenth out then was fully extended to hold sway. ARMED AND READY , jostled at the break, quickly
recovered and raced in close attendance four wide outside rivals, dropped back a bit leaving the half mile marker, circled four wide into the lane, found more
past mid stretch and finished up well. MISTER AGENT disputed the early pace between runners, gained a short lead nearing the turn, secured the rail and
dueled with TOCAYO from mid turn to about mid stretch, shifted out a bit after that one cleared then stayed on with effort. BRODIE BOY , bumped at the
break, moved up between rivals to be in range approaching the half mile marker, saved ground around the turn and into the lane but failed to generate the
needed finish. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE , off the pace and removed from the rail, came four wide for the drive, angled wider nearing mid stretch and
offered a mild response. SIMON'S CHOICE broke a step slow, rushed up towards the rail and joined the pace fray leaving the chute, dueled inside a pair of
foes heading to the turn, eased back off those two then angled out soon after, gave hard yet willing chase to mid stretch then faded. GALLANT RULER
came in at the break and bumped a rival, lagged back, raced off the rail around the turn and lacked a bid. KINGDOM FORCE , five wide early and in range,
chased to the inside of a rival mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. PURE REALIZATION saved ground leaving the far turn and failed to
menace. CHIPANDAPUTT , brushed at the break, saved ground giving early chase and faltered mid turn.

Footnotes
SHASTA STAR , rated inside horses around the turn, eased out approaching the eighth pole, secured command outside RAMBERT inside the eighth pole,
was set down late and drew off. PAPER MANSION raced in the two path between horses around the turn, remained between rivals through the stretch and
rallied nicely. HITCH A RIDE bumped with CANADIAN GINGER and was caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, trailed to the head of the stretch,
swung to the seven path in upper stretch and closed outside horses. MUNDLE OF JOY , three wide chasing the pace to mid stretch, weakened. RAMBERT
set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened late. CANADIAN GINGER bumped with HITCH A RIDE, was not a factor and angled to the six path
in upper stretch. ADIOS BABE chased the early pace, drifted out entering the turn, was four wide entering the stretch and gave way. BANDITS WARRIOR
saved ground on the turn, remained near the inner rail in the stretch and lacked a rally. SPICY MARGARITA prompted the pace outside RAMBERT and
gave way. FANCY PRINCESS was no factor.

Footnotes
BOAT'S A ROCKIN , away alertly, sat in a striking spot inside while under rating, eased out and advanced between foes into the lane, took over from
ZYRAMID leaving the quarter pole, spurted away in mid stretch, remained on his left lead while under a solid drive and held firm. MATTA , in hand while
saving ground nearing mid turn, came out soon after and raced five wide into the lane, closed steadily and nabbed second to the inside of MAYA PRINCE.
MAYA PRINCE , outside a rival and off the pace into the turn, angled out mid turn, circled six wide into the stretch, closed willingly and just missed second.
DESTIN'S MISSION had speed, chased the leaders while three wide into the lane, raced between runners past the sixteenth marker but couldn't quite
seriously kick on through the final yards. REBEL POSSE , in the clear into the turn, angled out mid turn, raced four to five wide in upper stretch but lacked a
solid finish. TOM HAGEN , off the pace, raced two wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. OCEAN CITY rated off the pace while saving ground, worked
outward through the final furlong and offered a belated kick. ZYRAMID sped clear early, dropped in and set a strong pace, could not resist the winner
leaving the quarter pole, stayed on past mid stretch then weakened through the final seventy yards. MID DAY IMAGE quickly gained three wide heading to
the turn, prompted the pace outside the leader, lacked a punch soon into the stretch and tired. SO STREET saved ground and failed to menace.
