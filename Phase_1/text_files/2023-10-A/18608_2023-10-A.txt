Footnotes
BIRDIE'S CHANTZ checked behind rivals through the first turn, shifted out three wide before a half, rallied through the far turn to make the lead at the top of
the stretch, was put to right handed urging briefly near the furlong marker and won going away. DEE'S KY WILDCAT never far back, matched stride through
the stretch three wide and just got up for second. ANGEL'S DESTINY forwardly placed inside, bid two wide into the stretch and just missed getting up for
second. HALO EFFECT pressed the pace two wide for a half, gained a narrow lead, set a pressured pace past the quarter pole and weakened in deep
stretch. LATE DATE was always outrun. BUSYBEING FABULOUS set the early pace while getting out, gave up the lead before a half, had speed into the
stretch, drifted wide and sopped.

PRIDE close up from the start, loomed boldly three wide on the turn and finished second best. FAST CLIP bobbled at the start, had good early speed along
the rail, shifted outside the leader near the half mile marker, remained a sharp threat into the stretch, drifted four wide and faded. MAN'S CHOICE was no
factor. BAD BOY BOOGIE sprinted to the lead two wide soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was used up.
