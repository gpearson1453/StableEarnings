Footnotes
NAVY SOUL stalked in the three path, vied outside of the pace setter while remaining a path away around the far turn, subtly failed to sustain even terms in
upper stretch, yet kept on as his inner counterpart tired in the final furlong, bid at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. G T FIVE HUNDRED rushed to the
fore after a bit of a flat-footed start, set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, inched away from that one in upper stretch, but
failed to sustain a margin and gave in in the final sixteenth. MOHAAFETH broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the three path, improved position with
under five furlongs to go, chased outside of the top pair and from the four path while within striking range around the far turn, but lacked a bid. HEY BOSS
saved ground off of the pace, improved to reach fourth nearing the lane, lasted for that position at the wire, then was vanned off and found to have bled. EL
FRANCO trailed in the two path, then three wide around the far turn and made little impact. CHISHOLM TRAIL tracked in the two path, but lacked a
response to urging between horses around the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF MISSOULA broke slowly, trailed in the two path, inched closer to the leading trio while under strong urging in the four path turning for home,
sustained a four wide bid entering the lane, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. STAGFLATION set the pace along the inside, but was
headed by an outer pair with five sixteenths to go, fought on entering the lane, but was bested by a wider bidder approaching the furlong grounds, then
narrowly lasted for place. EYES OF GOLD broke a touch outwardly, tracked along the inside under a snug hold around the first turn, chased in the two path
around the far turn before being outmoved to trail the field at the quarter pole, yet shifted out approaching the final furlong and stayed on late but missed
reaching place. RITA'S ONTHE BEACH tracked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer bidder
entering the lane and yielded. GATHER stalked two wide and between horses, bid along with an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole but gave way in upper
stretch.

ARELLA STAR came out at the start while clearing outer rivals, set the pace in the two path, embraced an outer rival's challenge while shifting to the three
path coming to midstretch and held firm. LOVE OF MY HEART tracked in the four path, inched closer entering the lane to take aim on the clear leader in
upper stretch, offered a bid nearing the final furlong but was kept at bay. CHOCTAW BINGO stalked along the inside, took aim inside of the leader in upper
stretch but only managed to chase. SLACK TIDE stalked the leader from the three path, chased between horses entering the lane and yielded approaching
midstretch. BREWHOUSE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and made little impact. ICY STARE DOWN
steadied once pinched between horses in the opening stages, raced at the rear in the five path around the turn and tired.

ABOVE THE SUN broke slowly while last away, trailed in the three path, gained in the four path around the far turn, rallied to range up to the leader in the
final furlong, drove past that one at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. BEEN REAL BUSY set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge around the
far turn, repelled that foe in upper stretch as an outer bidder took aim, but was no match for that one at the sixteenth pole and remained clear of show.
LOST LOVE took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, but was blocked behind a tiring foe at the quarter pole,
slipped inside of that one entering the lane, then rallied to gain show from an outer foe late. CHOCTAW GRACE laid off of the pace three wide, gained four
wide into the far turn to bid outside of the leader and from the three path with five sixteenths to go, vied turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival
in upper stretch and yielded. TWILIGHT SONATA bumped an inner rival at the start, raced forwardly three wide and between horses, backed off to midpack
entering the backstretch, retreated to trail in the four to five path at the five sixteenths pole and made little impact. NORTHERN ROAD transferred contact
from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in the two to three path around the far turn, drifted to the four
path entering the lane and tired. COLLECTED SUCCESS bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, pressed down the
backstretch, but was outmoved at the five sixteenths pole and weakened turning for hoe. COLLIER tracked four wide early on, moved to stalk three wide
entering the backstretch, but wilted between horses entering the far turn.

Footnotes
SOUPER QUEST set the pace along the inside, entered the lane in the two path, dug to while resisting an inner challenge in midstretch, shook free in the
final furlong and held firm. MOUNSIEUR COCO tracked four wide, spun five wide into upper stretch, then stayed on to gain place in the shadow of the wire.
BAL A KAZOO chased along the inside, took aim inside of the leader in upper stretch, attempted a bid at the furlong grounds, but failed to keep pace in the
late stages and got nailed at the wire for place. NO NAY HUDSON (IRE) prompted three wide, fanned four wide into the lane, producing a grinding rally
nearing midstretch but flattened out in the final furlong. CHISELER laid off of the pace in the two path, subtly searched for racing room in the four path in
upper stretch then came up empty. CROCODILEHUNTER vied two wide and between horses into the turn, failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart
while being floated to the three path entering the lane and faded between horses. HIDDEN PATH lagged behind the rest into the turn and got outrun.

WICO (IRE) prompted the pace three wide, bid in hand turning for home, kicked away in upper stretch and was kept to task under busy handling. JUST
BATTLE pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path into the turn, fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied to duel for place with an
inner rival through the final furlong and prevailed. CAN'T HUSH THIS bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked the leading trio from the two path
around the turn, tipped outside of them while inside of JUST BATTLE entering the lane, stayed on to duel for place with that one through the final furlong but
was bested. ANTARES broke outwardly, vied two wide, then between horses turning for home, but proved no match for his outer counterpart in upper
stretch and faded. SEEKING UNITY laid off of the pace two wide, pursued in the four to five path around the turn and failed to menace. CANT BE DOIN
THAT failed to factor from the three path. TRACK MATE bumped with an inner rival at the start, vied along the inside and with a pair of outer rivals around
the turn, then weakened in upper stretch. SCHOOLMASTER (GER) lagged behind and got outrun.

Footnotes
TUNISIAN SPRING took an awkward stride while prominent leaving the chute showed the way in the two path while in hand around the turn, then kicked
away once set down in upper stretch. HALMSTAD pressed in the three path, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, lugged inwardly at the
furlong grounds and was second best. WICKED AGAIN raced close up along the inside early on, chased around the turn, sparred for show with an outer
rival through the final furlong and narrowly held. CITIZEN leaned outwardly and bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses,
vied for show with an inner rival in the final furlong but hung. RUNANDSCORE laid off of the pace while hung in the five path, moved down to the three path
in upper stretch and improved position. ATLANTIC DANCER laid off of the pace along the inside, but was blocked behind rivals nearing and entering the
lane and failed to threaten. STUDY COMMITTEE took contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path into the turn and tired.
CITY OF LOVE raced off of the pace in the four path and between horses, then lacked a response to urging around the turn. MICROBEASTIE raced
forwardly in the four path, but faded in the five path entering the lane. GIVE HIM TIME broke slowly and showed little.

Footnotes
COMMITTEE OF ONE bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, fanned out to the six to seven path in upper stretch, rallied
outside of rivals to bid at the sixteenth pole, dueled with an inner rival through the late stages and prevailed via a head-bob. AMIDST WAVES broke a bit
awkwardly, settled off of the pace along the inside, gained in the three path and behind the leaders while between horses coming to midstretch, took aim
four wide passing the furlong grounds, bid at the sixteenth pole along with an outer rival, dueled with that one to the wire and missed via a tight photo.
SHARDS broke a step slow, saved ground far back, rallied in the three path and between horses in the final furlong to take aim inside of the top pair in the
late stages, but needed more. COWES pursued from midpack two wide, smoothly found clear sailing three wide and between horses entering the lane,
rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by outer rival s at the sixteenth pole and yielded. FAIRHOPECURLY stalked outside of the leader and
from the three path, bid along with an outer rival in midstretch but gave way to wider foes entering the final sixteenth. BLEDSOE stalked along the inside,
but encountered mild traffic in upper stretch, got outmoved by outer rivals at the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. SPONGE BATH bumped with an outer
rival at the start, trailed in the two path and failed to factor. RIPAROUND broke sharply, showed the way in the two path around the turn, but was headed by
outer bidders at the furlong grounds and faltered. PINOTSLILGIRL tracked in the four path and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds.
CANDYMAKER took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed in the three path and faded.

Footnotes
IDIOMATIC dictated terms via a loose and uncontested advantage, responded once set down in upper stretch, widened under a drive through midstretch
and was put to wraps with a sixteenth to go. LE DA VIDA (CHI) raced at the rear in the three path, gained in the four path around the far turn, sustained
progress to bid for place in midstretch while hanging on her left lead and edged that position shortly after. BELLAMORE pursued from midpack in the four
path, inched closer to be within range of the clear leader into the far turn, chased that one from the three path around that bend, lacked a bid before meeting
an outer challenge for place in midstretch, got bested and yielded. NEST was subtly last away, laid off of the pace in the two path, decided against inside
progress at the half mile pole and shifted to the three path to be between horses into the far turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane with many lengths
to find and lacked a bid. SIXTYTHREECALIBER stalked the loose leader from the two path, but got outmoved by outer rivals while forced behind that one
approaching the far turn, then steadily weakened despite heavy urging around that bend. MALLOY tracked in the three path, inched closer as an outer rival
forced her hand approaching the far turn, but came under urging in the two path around that bend and faded turning for home.
