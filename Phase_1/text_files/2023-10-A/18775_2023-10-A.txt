Footnotes
DISPUTED CLAIM , keen to go early, moved clear of ANTIPOISON nearing the five eighths, set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up after being set
down in upper stretch, wandered outward a bit near mid stretch, was soon corrected with a right handed ask, switched over to his left lead in the final strides
and held firm. SHADY MUNNI edged up nearing the half mile marker then stalked outside a rival, was put to a ride nearing the quarter pole, eased out some
with hard pursuit past mid stretch and dug in gamely to save the place. CLUBMAN , inside off the early pace, angled out mid turn, circled four to five wide
into the lane and closed steadily. FREE SQUARE , a bit fidgety in the gate, broke a beat slow, was sent up between runners leaving the chute and gained a
forward spot, chased three wide into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded late. ROYAL SPY drafted back after the break and dropped in some,
moved up between runners nearing the turn, was under heavy pressure mid turn, shifted out some and came up empty. GALLANT GOLD bobbled at the
break then was put in tight soon after, was guided down towards the early on and moved up heading to the turn, steadied when in a bit close mid turn then
gave way. CITI CREEK was steadied soon after the break, lagged well back saving ground, eased out and failed to menace. PATRIOTIC PARTY drifted out
at the break, lost ground four and five wide and failed to menace. ANTIPOISON rushed up to the inside of the winner leaving the chute to force the issue, let
that one clear then stalked two wide, chased towards the rail past the five sixteenths and weakened through the drive. MICE AND MEN , four wide, dropped
back around the turn. WONDER WATER saved ground and gave way.

Footnotes
PRECIOUS AVARY assumed the early lead, set the pace well off the inner rail, drifted out slightly turning for home, drifted out late and lasted. NAVAL
EMPIRE , up close inside horses down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, remained near the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. GOLDEN
HEART chased the pace, raced in the two path around the far turn and weakened in the drive. AMPLIO ESQUEMA , lightly steadied in traffic entering the
first turn, moved outside on the backstretch, circled horses the far turn, was four deep entering the stretch and passed a tired rival. PROPER STORM ,
briefly steadied soon after the break, was three deep the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and was no menace. BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS
lacked speed, hugged the inner rail and briefly steadied on the heels of DOWNTOWN KATIE near the eighth pole. DOWNTOWN KATIE saved ground the
far turn, remained near the inner rail in the stretch and weakened. COCONUT CAKE had a mild move outside horses leaving the backstretch and gave way.

Footnotes
BAD TEMPER rated close up and to the inside of a rival early on, eased out and moved up between rivals past the five sixteenths, shifted in leaving the
three sixteenths, surged inside the dueling leaders to take over nearing the sixteenth marker then drew out under a steady hand ride. UTTERLY
ENCHANTING prompted the pace three wide and between rivals nearing the half, bid three deep after a half, dueled four wide outside TAM CHAR in upper
stretch, kept up the battle nearing the sixteenth pole and continued on willingly to earn the place. TAM CHAR moved up in hand near the five eighths and
attended the pace outside the leader, moved to a slim lead three furlongs out, dueled three wide and to the inside of UTTERLY ENCHANTING from the
head of the lane past mid stretch, drifted a bit and gave way grudgingly. DIVINE FASHION , taken to rate early, advanced between runners nearing the
quarter pole, angled in some through the final furlong and kept on with interest. BELLA BETTINA was shuffled back leaving the chute, dropped in some then
lightly steadied leaving the far turn, angled out, circled five wide into the stretch and continued on with some effort. DULCE KIARA rated outside a foe, took
closer order leaving the far turn, was pushed along three wide past the quarter pole and faded. CHICA RABIOSA , four deep prompting the pace, failed to
kick on with the leaders entering the lane and gave way. HOT LOOKIN ROYAL , urged along, moved up some near the half, steadied around the far turn
then lacked a serious recovery. POLICE WOMAN , off slow, saved ground while well back into the turn and failed to menace. MY SUPER SALLY steadied
soon after the break, lost ground four to about six wide, made a mild run mid turn then faded. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY saved ground into the turn and
weakened. HOLY DELITE was sent clear early, set the pace towards the rail, ceded the lead after a half mile then faltered approaching the stretch. SOME
IS NINE popped the gate pre race, stumbled at the start, faltered, was eased in the lane and walked off.

WICKED PRANKSTER , immediately in front after the break, set a comfortable pace off the rail and responded to urging in the stretch run. STARSTRUCK
NOTION , taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, dropped back a bit on the backstretch, hugged the inner rail around the turn, moved out in mid stretch
and closed nicely. JACK'S LEGEND lacked speed, circled horses on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied outside foes. TAPPIN
CAT , a forward factor inside horses throughout, chased the pace and flattened out. CRABS N BEER , three wide chasing the winner to upper stretch,
weakened. CANNON'S ROAR raced in the two path between horses much of the trip, failed to rally. FLETCHER saved ground around the first turn, worked
between horses the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and failed to rally. JOHNG , never a factor, raced along the inner rail on the far turn. STREET
COPPER raced in the three path on both turns and weakened. LACCO AMENO trailed.

Footnotes
MISS HARRIETT , hard sent the initial strides to reach contention, prompted the pace three wide outside REMEMBER ME, went on the attack leaving the
three eighths, wrested command heading to quarter pole, kicked clear under a drive soon into the lane, drifted out a bit when confronted by SHEILAHS
WARCLOUD, dug in tenaciously under strong handling and proved resolute to the wire. SHEILAHS WARCLOUD moved up between rivals early, was
coaxed along chasing the embattled leaders past the three eighths, rolled up four wide into the lane, moved alongside the winner heading to the sixteenth
marker, battled gamely while floated out a bit but wasn't quite good enough. KISSEDBYANANGEL broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and
advanced between rivals to be in range, chased the leaders under asking mid turn, shifted out some in upper stretch and finished up with good energy.
LUCKY COUGAR saved ground under some urging, eased out in upper stretch and continued on with effort. GO SHERRY GO , bumped then pinched back
at the break, gathered momentum four wide leaving the far turn, moved up three wide between runners entering the stretch, angled out and kept on with
interest. SHINE ON MOON was steadied back from between runners soon after the break, raced three wide leaving the far turn, angled in but lacked a solid
run. REMEMBER ME sped clear early, set the pace removed from the rail, took pressure leaving the far turn, dueled to about the quarter pole then gave
way past mid stretch. SUPER FABULOUS saved ground chasing the pace, stayed in touch to upper stretch then gave way. OLD BAY , bumped at the
break, raced three to four wide between runners early on and came up empty. ENEMYNUMBERNINE lost ground five wide and faded. BOH'S N O'S broke
a step slow, was ridden along off the pace and off the rail past the three furlong marker, swung six to seven wide but lacked a rally. LILLY LIGHTNING ,
towards the inside, faded. IRISH ANGEL stumbled inward at the break bumping OLD BAY, was hustled up to flash brief speed, faltered around the turn and
was eased late.

Footnotes
SEVEN'S ELEVEN chased the pace outside JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY, was bumped by that one in upper stretch when challenging for the lead then drew
out under brisk urging. TWISTED RIDE , steadied then checked in tight quarters near the five eighths pole, raced in the three path between horses turning
for home and split rivals late to get the place. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn, moved to the two path in mid
stretch and rallied between horses. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY sped to the early lead and was taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, drifted out bumping the winner in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. AL LOVES JOSIE , three deep chasing the pace
around the turn, weakened through the stretch. HELLO HOT ROD , shuffled back leaving the starting gate, was fanned four wide turning for home and was
not a factor. GOING TO THE LEAD , caught in close quarters near the five eighths pole, worked between horses on the turn nd lacked a rally. FIND FAITH
hugged the inner rail around the turn and in the stretch and wekened. MOCEPHUS , wide on the turn, was no factor.

Footnotes
WITTY , off towards the back of the pack, was patiently handled off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane, took advantage of ample
room towards the rail past the three sixteenths, rolled up to the inside of runners to take over nearing the sixteenth marker, kicked clear under right handed
asks and held firm. TIDEWATER , under firm rating while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch, worked his way between runners in the final furlong
and kept on gamely to earn the place. WHENIGETTOHEAVEN , unhurried off the pace and off the inside, swung six wide for the drive and closed well. R
B'S THE BOSS had speed to the inside of runners then eased back off the leaders heading to the turn, stalked inside mid turn, came out for the drive,
ranged up five wide leaving the furlong grounds to contest the lead then flattened out late. GRATEFUL BRED , away alertly, disputed the pace three wide
outside a rival, took a narrow lead in mid stretch, was confronted from both sides soon after and faded late. CYNERGY'S STAR , two wide between runners,
worked outward through the final furlong and churned on. TENAX , three wide between rivals, lacked a rally. ODINSON emerged with a short lead between
runners nearing the turn, dueled two wide and to the inside of GRATEFUL BREAD from mid turn to mid stretch, could not kick on near the sixteenth marker
and weakened. SKY'S NOT FALLING broke a step slow, settled off the pace, raced between foes near the three eighths, moved up some past mid stretch,
steadied briefly with a sixteenth to go, shifted in and came up empty. COMMANDING GENERAL , four to five wide early, chased three deep around the

Footnotes
CATAHOULA MOON stalked a five ply pace battle, was in hand waiting for room leaving the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch, took the lead
under urging in mid stretch, lugged in and his rider dropped his whip approaching the sixteenth pole. PRADO ROAD , five deep around the turn, disputed
the pace to mid stretch then weakened. KOHLER'S , well off the rail around the turn, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch, failed to menace and
passed tired horses. DANCE FOR GREEN lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and passed tired ones. BIGDADDYSBOY saved
ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. POINT PELEE disputed the pace in the three path between horses around
the turn and gave way. SUMMERSTATEOFMIND advanced along the inner rail approaching the stretch, bid for the lead entering the lane and weakened
late. KING'S RIVER lacked speed and passed tired horses late. BLAME THE TUX showed speed in the two path between horses and gave way. FULL
PROOF , kept wide around the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and was eased. SPEEDYNESS battled in the four path between horses around the turn
and weakened. STREET TOUGH was outrun.

Footnotes
INTREPID DAYDREAM , confidently handled four wide outside rivals tracking the pace, dropped in a bit and cruised up to engage RESPONSE TIME
heading to the quarter pole, took command soon into the lane, powered away under a drive past mid stretch then held sway while kept alert to the wire.
RESPONSE TIME took command leaving the chute and handled some outside pressure while under rating, edged clear leaving the far turn, dug in when
confronted by the winner near the quarter pole, shifted out when not quite able to keep pace in mid stretch, straightened away and kept on well to preserve
the place. LUNA BELLE , off a bit slow, settled off the pace, edged up between runners near the half mile marker, angled out four to five wide for the drive
then closed steadily while on her left lead. MAVILUS , off the pace while saving ground, continued inside into the stretch, moved up some past mid stretch
then flattened out very late. FILLE D'ESPRIT , with the pace three wide between runners, came under a ride mid turn, shifted out four wide approaching the
stretch, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. MALIBU BEAUTY was used up when rushing between rivals to contest the pace, saw the
leaders get away past the five sixteenths and weakened. QUIET IMAGINATION lacked speed, raced three wide near the half, circled four wide into the
stretch but failed to rally. SWEET GRACIE , well placed towards the inside stalking the quartet of leaders, came under a ride past the three eighths, eased
out three wide for the drive, lacked a punch and retreated through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MARKET MAVEN chased the pace down the backstretch, was two wide on the turn, floated out a bit entering the stretch, bid for the lead in upper stretch,
bumped AIN'T DA BEER COLD when angled in inside the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. AIN'T DA BEER COLD , sent to the early lead, set the pace
along the inner rail, was bothered in mid stretch and battled gamely in a sharp effort. DOUBLE CROWN , patiently handled between horses down the
backstretch, eased out to the four path leaving the far turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. DOLICE VITA hugged the inner rail down
the backstretch stalking the pace, saved ground the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. ALL THREES stalked the pace outside horses down the
backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and gave way turning for home. LOOSE ENDS lacked speed, circled the far turn four wide, floated to the five path
in upper stretch and gave way. RHUMJAR , between horses the first turn, was never a factor. OURNATIONONPARADE bobbled leaving the first turn, gave
way and returned bleeding. Following an objection by the rider of AIN'T DA BEER COLD, MARKET MAVEN was disqualified and placed second.

Footnotes
BONDED rated outside a rival in a stalking spot, steadily progressed four wide to take aim on the leaders into the lane, leveled off when switching to his
correct lead leaving the furlong grounds, collared IMAGINE IT ALL inside the sixteenth pole, kept on doggedly to gain a slim advantage in deep stretch then
got the bob at the wire. IMAGINE IT ALL , reluctant to load, moved up widest to take over heading to the first turn, cleared and dropped in to set the pace,
was joined by SEVILLE ROW mid way on the final turn, responded to firm asks and kicked back clear in upper stretch, drifted out maintaining the advantage
past the furlong grounds, dug back in when confronted by the winner leaving the sixteenth marker, dueled valiantly inside that one but lost the bob. BOFFO
KID steadied back off foes soon after the break, edged up three wide near the half, moved up five wide under a hustling ride in upper stretch and found his
best stride in the final furlong to bridge the gap. SEVILLE ROW prompted in hand outside the leader, bid to challenge after six furlongs, forced the issue into
the stretch, couldn't quite quicken past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. THE LAST SCIP checked heading to the first turn, saved ground through the
backstretch run, eased out past the five sixteenths, advanced between runners in mid stretch then continued with effort. NICK PAPAGIORGIO saved
ground, eased out and raced in range in upper stretch but failed to seriously kick on. SOROLLA lagged far back, saved ground most of the way and offered
a response through the lane. MINT GAME broke a bit slow, settled off the pace, raced four wide between rivals nearing the quarter pole, angled out but
lacked a rally. BRILLIANT CHASE angled off the rail soon into the backstretch, moved up steadily while between rivals heading to the turn, chased under a
hearty ride past the five sixteenths then faded. REMEMBERING WILBUR angled out early into the backstretch run, lost ground four to five wide from the far
turn and came up empty. SIGMUND failed to menace. PRIDE OF PAYTON , forward inside early on, steadied off heels into the first turn, regrouped and
stalked inside, gave hard pursuit past the five sixteenths and weakened. JACKSON MAN broke awkwardly, raced wide off the pace and lacked a rally. RUN
ROCKY RUN lost ground four to six wide while outside rivals, moved up some past the three eighths, chased to upper stretch then retreated.
