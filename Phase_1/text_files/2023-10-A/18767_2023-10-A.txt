DOO WOP DON bobbled leaving the start and was off a step slowly, tracked the decent pace from the inside, was roused in upper stretch and vied for the
lead heading to the furlong marker, took command, met the late bid of FAR WEST held a narrow advantage in the final sixteenth, dug in late and lasted for
the win at the finish. FAR WEST tracked the decent pace outside of rivals, advanced three wide into the turn and pressed the pace to the quarter marker,
lost a bit of ground into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, re-rallied into deep stretch, confronted DOO WOP DON approaching the
sixteenth-marker, battled with that foe into deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and held safely for second. SATANTA
was allowed to settle away from the start, tracked between rivals to the half-mile marker, was steered outside of runners and improved position four wide
heading to the quarter pole, swung widest into the lane and mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, closed in the final furlong, could not reel in the top two
in the late stages and held clearly for third. MITICO sent at the start, dictated terms in the early running and carved a decent pace into the turn, set the pace
off of the rail and was pressed to the quarter marker by FAR WEST, battled for the lead into the stretch with DOO WOP DON, could not keep pace into the
final sixteenth and weakened.

MR. BUGS was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the decent early pace outside of runners, improved position four then three wide along the
turn, vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with LET GEORGE DO IT to the furlong marker, took command and shook clear into deep stretch, felt late
pressure from the runner-up and held safely in a drive at the finish to prevail. DARK MYSTERY settled outside of an inner rival to begin, improved position
three wide along the turn and was roused four wide into the stretch, came within aim approaching the furlong marker while widest, closed willingly in deep
stretch, put pressure on the winner in the final strides but could not reel that one in and bested the rest. BRONZE ONE rushed up in the early stages and
raced close to the decent early pace, lost position two wide along the turn, re-rallied into the stretch and gained ground approaching the furlong pole, could
not muster a final response in deep stretch, was outkicked and just held for third at the finish. APLOMBADO bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly,
chased the early pace from the inside and saved ground to the top of the stretch, improved position heading to the furlong grounds, needed more in the late
stages, mounted a mild rally in the final sixteenth and just missed for third. LET GEORGE DO IT showed good early speed away from the gate, dictated
terms in the opening furlong and set a decent pace into the turn, showed the way to the quarter marker off of the rail, came under pressure into the stretch
and battled to the furlong marker, lacked a response in deep stretch and weakened. EL CAPRICHO chased the decent early pace from a two wide path, lost
a bit of ground heading to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch, could not keep pace into the late stages and gave way.

Footnotes
BRANNIGAN pressed the decent early pace outside of GO GABRIELLA, took command into the turn and showed the way to the quarter marker while off of
the rail, drew off into the stretch, was kept to steady urging into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off O'BANION in deep stretch and lasted for the win at
the finish. O'BANION (IRE) was prominent away from the start, took back in the early running and tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile
marker, raced two wide into the turn, angled four wide approaching the top of the lane and was asked for run into the stretch, chased BRANNIGAN to the
furlong grounds, closed with a rush into deep stretch, came within aim in the final strides and just missed for the win, while well clear for second. BOBBED N
LURED broke alertly and was prominent away from the start, stalked the decent early pace while outside of runners, gained ground three wide into the turn,
could not keep pace with BRANNIGAN into the stretch, was unable to make headway on the winner in the drive and was outkicked, while clear in the end
for third. THECHIEFHASTRICKS chased outside of an inner rival leaving the start, came three wide into the turn, improved position into the stretch but was
unable to threaten in the final furlong. GO GABRIELLA was hard sent leaving the break, set a decent early pace from the inside and was pressed into the
turn, lost the lead into the bend and chased from the rail into upper stretch, lacked a response in the drive and tired. SMILING PREACHER stumbled at the
start and was off slowly, chased the decent early pace while inside of rival, was coaxed along in the three path into the turn, lost contact approaching the top
of the lane and did not factor.

Footnotes
BRONZE WARRIOR was asked for speed away from the start, vied outside of a pair of rivals into the first turn and assumed command three then two wide
into the backstretch run, set solid fractions along the backstretch run and extended the lead heading to the half-mile marker, came under pressure from LIL
MIRACLE MAN approaching the quarter marker, met that bid into upper stretch and battled to the furlong grounds, shook free into deep stretch, dug in
under firm urging in the late stages and held safely in the end for a determined win. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) broke out at the start, was shuffled back and
was off a bit slowly away from the gate, settled outside of an inner rival in the early running, tracked the solid fractions along the backstretch run, made a
steady gain three wide into the far turn and came three wide into the stretch, closed well in the late stages, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and
was up in the final strides to secure second. LOOKOUT POINT was unhurried away from the start, settled in the two path into the backstretch run and
tracked the pace to the half-mile marker, came two wide into the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, rallied in
deep stretch and just missed for second, while just getting up for third in a blanket finish for the minor awards. LIL MIRACLE MAN vied for the early lead
away from the start, took back into the first turn and stalked the pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run, raced close to the solid pace three deep
approaching the half-mile marker, mounted a two wide bid approaching the quarter pole and battled for the lead into the stretch, pressured BRONZE
WARRIOR to the furlong marker, lost ground to that rival into deep stretch, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor
awards. IL CAPITANO broke out a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, checked off of heels when
BRONZE WARRIOR crossed over into the backstretch run, stalked the pacesetter through solid fractions to the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far
turn, lost position approaching the quarter marker, trailed into the stretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
TAMARA MINE disputed the solid early pace with TIP TOP GAL, took command along the turn and set the pace from the two path heading to the quarter
marker, was pressed into the stretch by CITY GLITTER and fought with that rival into upper stretch, repelled that bid and was confronted again by TIP TOP
GAL approaching the furlong pole, battled with that foe into deep stretch, held a narrow lead in the final yards and determinedly lasted for the win at the
finish. CITY GLITTER raced close to the decent early pace while outside of rivals, advanced on the turn and pressed the pace three wide to the quarter
marker, was turned away into upper stretch and chased to the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, finished well in deep stretch and missed for the
win, while getting up in time to secure the place. TIP TOP GAL was away in good order and contested the decent early pace with TAMARA MINE, lost
ground to that rival into the turn and chased from the inside into upper stretch, re-bid approaching the furlong marker and vied for the lead into mid-stretch,
could not get by the determined winner into deep stretch, was outfinished for second in the final strides and was well clear of the rest for third. YOUNG LIFE
LAURA broke in at the start, sharply bumped NAN ELIZABETH and caused that runner to unseat her rider, spotted the field in the early stages, chased two
wide along the turn and did not threaten. NOMI LACKEE chased the decent early pace from the inside, was outrun along the turn and gave way in the
stretch. NAN ELIZABETH was bumped sharply at the start by YOUNG LIFE LAURA, unseated the rider in the first few jumps away from the gate, was
caught following the race and walked off under her own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT YOUNG LIFE LAURA INTERFERED WITH NAN ELIZABETH LEAVING THE START AND
WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED LAST.

Footnotes
LAKER JET raced with the tracking group early on then was outrun on the turn as TWO TWELVE stretched the field out on the lead, started a bid passing
the three furlong marker, swung out to the four path for the stretch run, made a good late rally along with SEVEN SISTERS, made up a half-dozen lengths in
the final furlong, got a head in front with yards to go and prevailed in a thrilling finish. SEVEN SISTERS broke best and had the lead for a few strides, then
angled over to save ground while letting TWO TWELVE take command into the turn, set down after that rival for the stretch run, was gradually cutting into
the margin down the lane, passed that foe in the shadow of the wire but could not hold off LAKER JET in the final jumps. TWO TWELVE vied for the early
lead from the break, emerged from the pack with the lead passing the nine-sixteenths pole then opened up on the field through the turn, came under
pressure at the top of the stretch, was weakening passing the eighth pole and could not hold off a pair of closers to the outside but soldiered on to hold third.
TAKES A VILLAGE got a perfect inside trip, raced up close to the pace in the early stages under some encouragement, tracked behind TWO TWELVE
through the turn, got even with SEVEN SISTERS nearing the quarter pole, came into the stretch with every chance and ran on well but came up short of a
minor award. COASTAL STARLITE broke well then was unable to keep up with the dueling leaders, raced to the inside of the tracking group then lost some
ground on the turn but kept to task and finished up with some interest and not too far behind the winner. ALESHA was last away, angled over the rail for the
run through the turn, was put into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, had too much ground to make up but did improve somewhat in the final furlong.
MISCHIEF MAMA fell behind after the break despite the best efforts of the rider to encourage some speed, found a good rhythm heading into the the turn
racing three wide but could not muster a rally. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA raced between horses as part of the tracking group through the initial furlong then
began to fall behind as the field entered the turn and never recovered.
