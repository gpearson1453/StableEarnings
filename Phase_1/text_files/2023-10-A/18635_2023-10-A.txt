Footnotes
NORTHERN INVADER bobbled at the break, recovered to race just off the inside forwardly placed into the first turn, advanced to take over just inside six
furlongs to go, showed the way in hand from the two path patiently handled until set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under
a drive to the eighth pole, held safe to the finish to prevail. OHANA HONOR just off the inside tracking from the front from the tail of the field, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole tipping out to swing six then five wide into upper stretch, got brushed by APPRAISE straightened away, offered up a mild kick
to secure the place honors while well clear of the rest and second best. BAT FLIP tracked the pace along the inside a bit eager into the backstretch and
under restraint, advanced half a mile from home when CITY FEVER vacated the rail in front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened. CITY FEVER led early along the inside, got displaced from command just inside six furlongs to run, tracked the
front along the rail until tipped to the two path taking up cover behind the leader half a mile from home, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened. APPRAISE (IRE) grew rank under restraint in the two path into the
first turn skygazing and climbing a bit keenly, tracked just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five then four wide into
upper stretch under a drive, brushed with OHANA HONOR at the three-sixteenths and came up empty.

two path, advanced to take narrow and brief command swinging three wide into upper stretch, got headed at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive
running on to secure the place honors. CITY MAN settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to
five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick and shied out under a left handed crop a sixteenth out while clear for the show honors. BARRAGE chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. KINGDOM ON PAWS coaxed from
the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. UN OJO
coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under

Footnotes
WINTERS LION got bumped at the start by SIGNATOR due to pressure from PADDINGTON and was forced to steady off the heels of SUERTE, settled just
off the inside at the tail of the field early on, took to the rail through the first turn before heading back to the two path down the backstretch detached at the
rear, remained patiently handled tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch,
closed well outside and collared a trio battling head to head just inside the final seventy yards to prevail at the end. MISTICAL CURLIN tracked the leader
just off the inside in closest aim, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting on near
even terms near the sixteenth pole, battled on between rivals nose to nose through to the finish and was up for the place honors when overhauled by the top
one late. DRAKE'S PASSAGE three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting on near even terms with a pair a sixteenth from home, fought on to the finish and was just up for the show honors
in the final jumps. SUERTE established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and stubbornly clung to command by a sliver fending them off until collared inside seventy yards
from home, then lost the bob at the end for the place and show honors. SIGNATOR got bumped at the start by PADDINGTON and in turn bumped
WINTERS LION, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home
and stayed on one paced through to the finish. PADDINGTON broke out at the start bumping SIGNATOR into WINTERS LION, raced three wide through
the first turn before chasing four to five wide thereafter, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late
stages.
