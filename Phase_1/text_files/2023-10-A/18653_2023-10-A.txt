MAMA'S GOLD established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside comfortably in front, remained patiently handled as the
field got busy in behind midway on the far turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and was set down straightened away, edged away to inside the eighth
pole and held clear to the finish. STRAPPED coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three wide down the backstretch,
tucked back to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick.
WARRIOR RICHARD broke out at the start taking over the lane of the slow breaking SOUTH STREET, chased just off the inside and then along the inside
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. ACHILLES HEEL just off the inside through the opening
bend, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths,
swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. GUT FEELING coaxed from the start, chased three wide through the first turn and then six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the far turn coaxed along from midway, swung five wide at the head of the stretch and
weakened. ARREBATO coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn and then five wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. SOUTH STREET broke a beat slow and

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS tracked the pace from near the rear while saving ground unhurried as the leader drew off, remained on hold until placed to coaxing
near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to get first run at the once well clear leader, seized command near the sixteenth marker and
edged clear to the finish to score. SOLDIER RISING (GB) coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside near the tail of the field through the first two turns
before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked back inside into the far turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SO
HIGH (GB) pulled on the bit early on spurting away and the rider remained settled not wishing to engage in a tug of war allowing his charge to settle into a
comfortable rhythm while spurting away to a long lead just off the inside, remained in hand and showed the way well clear through the second turn and
down the backstretch widening a bit to the far turn, remained just off the inside through to the five-sixteenths before tucking briefly inside, swung three wide
into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under a drive under growing threat and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors in a
strong effort. REBEL'S ROMANCE (IRE) coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. STONE AGE (IRE) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. GRAND SONATA tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked. PIONEERING SPIRIT coaxed from the start,
tracked the front along the inside leading the main flight far behind the lone leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and tired. ASTRONAUT chased two to three wide early on and then three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, edged clear under a drive kept to task. GENERAL PARTNER established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from SWEET SODDY J through the opening half mile to the outside, shook off that rival into the
turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared near the eighth pole, ran
on well clear of the rest to be along second best. DANCING GROOM broke out a step at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing half a
mile from home, went nine to ten paths off the rail into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors while never threatening the top pair.

through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. AIR CAV chased along the inside

backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, came under brief urging near the quarter pole for a stride or two, went seven wide into upper stretch
getting tapped to the left side with the crop, then was in hand while flashed the crop to the left side through to the finish and tired. SWEET SODDY J

and then three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, closed well latching on the aforementioned foe in the final jumps to the wire. FEARLESS SOLDIER showed the way in hand just off the

then weakened in the final furlong. DATAMAN got bumped at the start by CLASSIC CATCH due to pressure from ANGLOPHILE, chased two to three wide
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response.
