Footnotes
QUEEN WIGGY tracked the pace well back, moved up through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady
pressure. TRIPLE R RATED sent from the gate, sprinted away from the field, drifted out through the turn and into the stretch, then came again and lapped
on to the winner late. QUEEN OF CHILL allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain
and closed well late, missing the place. GOOD SOURCE well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, came four wide into the
stretch, angled inside a drifting leader, then faded. PEEP'S DAY was never involved.

Footnotes
SHORESY steadied for racing room through the first turn, eased to the lead, shook clear down the backstretch, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to
the task. ELUSIVE EMPRESS allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the
place. STEAM KNOT led in the early going, stalked the pace outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the
stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. WAIT FOR TOMORROW tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to
bid outside the leader into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong. VERSACE SUMMER well placed and between, moved up two and three wide through
the second turn, fanned four wide into the stretch and had no rally. JOYFUL SOUL well placed and outside, faded three wide through the second turn.
GOLDEN EXPRESS was never involved and was outrun.

furlong and finished on equal terms with JARETH. JARETH mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, angled widest into the stretch, evened
out and finished on equal terms with HINDENBURG. HE'S ON THE FLY allowed to settle, passed tiring rivals, inside. CASH IN A FLASH hard to rated in
the early going, saved ground through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, drifted out and faded. MARGARITA SUNRISE well placed and outside,

Footnotes
LA PANDA tracked the pace through the first turn, angled out to stalk that one down the backstretch, gained a striking position on the two path through the
second turn, bid outside the leader and shook clear into the stretch, then drew off and was kept to the task. GLOVANNA allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, lost her path, angled back in, made a steady gain and closed well for the place.
ANNIE UP BUCK well placed and outside, moved up three and four wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed well for the
show. LEAD PERFORMER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and
held a share. TREASURE THE STORM well placed and inside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch
and flattened out. WINDY CITY GIRL was never involved. FORBIDDEN DREAM well placed and between, gained position two and three wide through the
second turn, came three wide into the stretch and had no rally.

while clearly best of the rest. AMERICA'S JUSTICE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then
flattened the final furlong and held the show. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES allowed to settle, angled out while moving up through the second turn, came widest

Footnotes
THREE O ONE set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the second turn, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. UPTOWNJACOB BROWN
mid pack and inside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up
for the place. MR. YASUDA allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and edged up for the
show. BRIT'S UNION well placed outside, held position three and four wide through the second turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, evened out and held
a share. SHARP PLAY BOY rated outside the leader, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside that one into the stretch, then
weakened the final furlong. NORTHERN RUNNER steadied into the first turn, improved position inside. SNIP THE ROSES well placed and outside, moved
up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. DON'T FLINCH rated back, tracked the pace, then faded
through the second turn. MANSUETO was never involved.
