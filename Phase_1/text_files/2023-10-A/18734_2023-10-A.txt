DATS A SUPERSTAR secured the lead past the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested a slim advantage nearest the rail on the turn,
dueled clear leaving the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold on well. SK'S HEART gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about
the four path, closed steadily through the lane and took second in the final strides. LATE NIGHT SPIRIT pressured the pace through the backstretch and
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened stride the final sixteenth.
FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and passed rivals outside. EVERYDAYISAGIFT pressured the pace inside but
dropped back nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and flattened in the lane. PRINCESS MIA ROSE chased, rounded the turn about the
three path and weakened. TODAYISMYDAY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail, angled out past the eighth pole and showed little
in the lane.

MR CHANCE ROMANCE took over while moving to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and held on under steady handling. PRESSURE rounded the first turn in the four path, challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced
close in the three path on the far turn and finished well while gaining on the winner. RAGTIME RICHES saved ground off the pace, gave chase past the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then dueled through the stretch for third. LEG UP saved ground off the pace, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE stalked two
deep then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. DIVINAS CONNECTION raced off the rail
on the first turn, gave chase leaving the nine sixteenths pole and eased outward into the backstretch, gave chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far
turn about the five path and showed little more.

Footnotes
LONA LEE took the lead at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, dueled clear toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily
handled to hold well. MISS BEE BOP gave close chase through the backstretch, dropped back approaching the quarter pole, raced evenly in the lane but
had to settle for second best. FRIEND FURH REAL became fractious behind the gate then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in
the lane. SHOTGUN MARGARET gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. BEVERLY'SACTINUP chased outside, raced in the
five path on the turn and finished evenly. WAY OF APPEAL chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and flattened in the lane.
IMADHI veered in at the break then gave chase, though, weakened in the four path on the turn. SING ME TO SLEEP ducked in break and raced well back.
SPIRIT ON THE WIND was shut off at the break and saved ground. My Lucky Deia ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
I'M THE MONEY MAN settled in the three path on the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in under steady encouragement to take the nod under the wire. I'LLTAKECAREOFIT rated the pace inside, came
under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn and
bested NOCASHREFUNDS for second but was nipped for the win under the wire. The latter stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. DON'TCALLTOOEARLY raced in the four path the first
turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, had his heels clipped in the four path and ran evenly in the stretch. NEVERPOPTHECORK saved
ground off the pace, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole then eased out from the heels of ROAD SLEW past the quarter pole and
had his heels clipped, but ran evenly in the lane. The latter stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, moved to
the rail at the quarter pole and flattened in the lane. MY BOY CLYDE settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but was
forced out and clipped the heels of Don'tcalltooearly past the quarter pole, fell, but got up and walked off. After posting the inquiry, the Stewards disqualified
Neverpopthecork to sixth place for causing the incident past the quarter pole.

Footnotes
WICKED WISDOM tapered in and stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and took the nod passing the five
sixteenths pole, was met at even terms nearest the rail midway on the far turn but dug in under determined handling to hold on. KATALIMA settled close off
the rail the first turn, started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and dueled to even terms three wide midway on the far turn, cleared second
in later yards but couldn't improve on the winner. MISS LAUREN stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and
dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths, raced between horses two deep on the far turn but started to flatten stride nearing mid-stretch. TENNIS TAP
saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward leaving the turn and showed
little further. TAPPING SOUTH raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path and passed some rivals. BOCA BIRDIE was not a factor. MOIRAINE took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came
under pressure into the backstretch, was met at the five sixteenths pole and faded readily at the rail on the far turn. WISHING FOR SPRING had a brief
early lead then rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.
