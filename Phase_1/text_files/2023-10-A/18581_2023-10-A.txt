ASK AMANDA , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, eased out to the five path in upper stretch, swept to command outside horses inside the
eighth pole and drew clear. RADIANT QUEEN , bumped and forced in by CALL THE QUESTION at the start raced behind horses on the turn, moved out in
upper stretch, was taken to the six path in mid stretch and rallied outside rivals. THE AMAZING MIZZEN raced in mid pack around the turn and in upper
stretch, angled to the inner rail near the eighth pole and rallied. SHARMIN , bumped in the jam up at the break, was three wide chasing the pace around the
turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. PRINCESS STREET , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, swung out leaving
the turn and gave way. DETERMINED BLUE , bumped and forced in leaving the starting gate, dueled in the two path between horses to mid stretch, raced
on her left lead and gave way. CALL THE QUESTION caused a chain reaction when bearing in leaving the starting gate, was well off the rail on the turn,
entered the stretch in the four path and came up empty. TEQUILA TARA , bumped and pinched back leaving the starting gate, was no factor. PAMZ
PALACE , bumped when TEQUILA TARA was forced in leaving the starting gate, showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. VERY SURE trailed

Footnotes
ELLIE VICTORINA broke a step slow, recovered and rated inside and off a duel, edged up leaving the far turn, eased out into the lane, split rivals three wide
to take over in mid stretch then drew clear under a drive. BALI HAI stalked the embattled leaders three wide, advanced under asking mid turn, circled four
wide into the lane, had the winner slip through to her inside near mid stretch then churned on willingly to gain the place. FASHIONATTA disputed the pace
outside THUNDER BOSS, poked a head in front three furlongs out, fought on between runners nearing mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. THUNDER
BOSS got into a duel along the rail early on, carried that scrum to mid stretch and faded. AZTEC BAY rated back between foes early, dropped off the pace
saving ground leaving the three eighths, swung wide for the drive but failed to menace. GOOD STORY was outrun.

Footnotes
I HAVE COURAGE was sent up between rivals soon after the break and reached a forward spot, dropped in and chased, eased out past mid stretch,
surged between runners to take command with about a sixteenth to go and kicked away under a drive. COCKTAIL DREAMING , four wide nearing the half,
dropped in a path and stalked around the turn, ranged up outside rivals leaving mid stretch, failed to quicken with the winner to his inside but stayed on to
salvage the place. BLAME CATALAYA saved ground, eased out near the sixteenth marker and finished with decent energy. MO CO GOLD sped clear
early, set the pace towards the rail, edged away under a drive leaving the three sixteenth, was confronted near the sixteenth pole and gave way.
MYSISTERNANCY eased back to the inside of runners leaving the five eighths, found herself far back mid turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to
threaten. VOODOO MAMA JUJU broke a step slow, raced well back mid turn, angled five wide for the drive but failed to menace. MISS ANTIETAM was
sent three wide between foes early, chased to mid turn then dropped back.

Footnotes
ON THE SHORTLIST , a forward outside JACKSON'S DIXIE down the backstretch and around the far turn, sprinted clear in upper stretch then dug in late to
prevail. DIVA READY lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses entering the far turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied nicely.
ALWAYS LAUGHING hugged the rail down the backstretch and on the far turn, eased out to the three path at the head of the lane, moved up to mid stretch
and flattened out. CORINNA , unhurried behind horses for six furlongs, angled out on the turn, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside.
NOW YUS CANT LEAVE lacked speed inside horses, had a mild advance along the inner rail to mid stretch and lacked the necessary rally. GIRLS HOUSE
, checked in traffic entering the first turn, raced forwardly in the two path between horses to the far turn and gave way in the stretch. CLOUDS OF WHITE ,
very wide both turns, was not a factor. DAILY PLANET , unhurried early, worked between horses and was not a factor. A RING THING , three wide both
turns, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. JACKSON'S DIXIE showed speed along the inner rail and faltered in mid stretch.

Footnotes
MISS JUSTIFY had speed between rivals then rated back after about a furlong, chased the duelers while outside a rival mid turn, circled four wide into the
lane, closed determinedly under left handed asks and forged to command a sixteenth out, eagerly widened and was kept to task. DON'T LISTEN emerged
in a battle to the inside of PRINCESS BLAME early on, sparred around the turn, stayed on near even terms while under pressure past mid stretch, could not
kick on with the winner but stayed on well to be clear for the place. PRINCESS BLAME , three deep with the early pace, dueled outside DON'T LISTEN
around the turn, held a slim lead battling from the quarter pole to mid stretch then weakened through the final sixteenth. FIRST TO ARRIVE stumbled inward
at the break, dropped off the pace while saving ground, eased out past mid stretch and churned on with interest. TO BE LOVED BY YOU , in mid pack while
off the rail, angled out a bit for the drive but lacked a rally. MISSY BOSS drifted in at bit at the break, saved ground chasing the duelers, angled out into the
stretch and gave way. FLAG SONG FLYIN , sluggish from the gate, raced well back leaving the far turn, raced off the rail into the stretch and lacked a bid.
VALLEY STAR broke awkwardly and was outrun. FOREVER MIA . four wide with early pursuit, gave way.

Footnotes
DERBYNESS stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out
in the drive and lasted. PRIMED TO GO , in the middle of the pace to the far turn, moved up four wide leaving the far turn, challenged for the lead in mid
stretch and hung. NO FOOLIN MO stalked the pace, saved ground on the far turn, angled out and rallied between horses. MONEY IN MOTION , in the two
path between horses entering the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and rallied mildly outside rivals. STARLIFTER disputed the pace outside
HAPPY JAUNT and weakened in the drive. PASSIONED , a forward factor in the two path, chased the pace to the stretch and weakened. HAPPY JAUNT
hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and gave way. SCENIC MOON , rank approaching the first turn, was four wide the far turn and failed to be a factor.
MUCHO LOVE , three wide the first turn, raced four wide the far turn and gave way. LAST POST broke slowly and was outrun. WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD
raced along the inner rail, faltered on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
HIS NAME IS SUE broke sharply and took control, set a rated pace towards the rail and handled some outside pressure from DIALING DIXIE, moved clear
of that one past the three eighths, came two wide into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, wandered outward a bit then held firm while kept
alert. SAVOY , three wide early, gave hard chase while between runners around the turn, shifted out near mid stretch and finished with good energy to gain.
SPITBALL secured the rail early, pursued to the inside of rivals around the turn, edged up near mid stretch then flattened out late. DIALING DIXIE bore out
at the break, corrected and rushed up soon after to press outside the winner, saw that one get away past the five sixteenths, stayed on with willing pursuit to
about mid stretch then faded. MICE AND MEN , three deep around the turn, came up empty. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN broke a step slow, lagged back and
never got involved.

Footnotes
JOHN HALL , in close quarters leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, moved to the two path in upper stretch, worked between horses in
the stretch, closed inside CALMING STORM and was up at the wire. CALMING STORM , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead in
mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. FUN NOTION chased the pace around the turn, was well positioned along the inner rail in upper stretch, was forced to
alter course outside ONE TRUTH in mid stretch and closed gamely outside the top pair. ONE TRUTH sprinted clear early, was well off the rail on the turn
and in upper stretch then drifted in when tiring in mid stretch. TALL ORDER raced in mid pack around the turn and failed to menace in an even effort. SUE
LOVES BARBADOS , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn, swung out in mid stretch and weakened. BOSS MAN J J came out at the break,
raced along the inner rail most of the trip and was not a factor. BENNY HAVENS , wide around the turn, was outrun. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN had a mild, four
wide advance leaving the turn and gave way. KOBE TOUGH , outrun, raced wide around the turn.

Footnotes
GENERAL NOOZ broke on top, showed sharp speed to lead leaving the chute, ceded command to FREESTANDING heading to the five eighths, prompted
outside that one into the turn, responded to a hustling ride leaving the three eighths and moved to the attack, took over into the lane, kicked clear under a
drive leaving the three sixteenths, wandered outward from some left handed asks, was corrected with right handed encouragement heading to the sixteenth
pole, kept on tenaciously and dug in to hold off PRACTICAL SENSE. PRACTICAL SENSE , off a bit slowly after breaking inward, was hustled up to be mid
pack while saving ground past the five eighths, angled out mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch, shifted out a bit wider gathering steam near mid
stretch, closed gamely but just could not get past the determined winner. EAGLE IN LOVE bobbled at the break, bumped with a rival then steadied in tight,
drifted out well out into the track before recovering, found himself far back into and around the turn while extremely wide, remained very wide for the drive
and made a valiant run to nab the show. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON , jostled at the break, raced off the pace while between rivals nearing the turn, steadied
soon after, dropped inside and made progress leaving the five sixteenths, angled out into the lane, worked between foes in mid stretch then flattened out
late. SWAY'SINMYDNA , five then four wide early, moved up outside runners entering the turn, quickly gained past the five sixteenths and took aim, came
three wide with pursuit into the stretch, stayed on between runners to mid stretch then faded. LONG LIVE NOW , off the pace, raced three wide leaving the
far turn and failed to respond. FEDERAL OFFENSE bobbled at the break, chased while saving ground, came out for the drive but lacked a finish.
CALIFORNIA GHOST broke inward, gave early chase off the rail, angled in and faded. FREESTANDING sped up to the inside of the winner early leaving
the chute and took command, set the pace towards the rail, was taken on past the five sixteenths, could not keep up leaving the three sixteenths and
faltered.
