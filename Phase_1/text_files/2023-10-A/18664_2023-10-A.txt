Footnotes
TENTH MOUNTAIN had an awkward start and laid wellback in the four path turning into the backstretch, was under right handed encouragement in the five
path rounding the far turn, rallied from the seven path into the lane, swept to the lead passing the eighth pole, and held sway under a drive. TEXAS AIR
FORCE laid off the pace in the five path, swung from said position under a drive into the stretch, and ran on for place. MY GREAT ILLUSION stalked in the
four path, was driven around the far turn, bid from the three path entering the stretch, briefly led before the eighth pole, but evened out in the final furlong to
show. DECISIVE WARRIOR bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path, lost position while under a ride rounding the far turn, and was
one paced in the five path down the lane. NOBLE STAR trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch, lugged in and out down the
stretch, and made no impact. AWESOME FRIEND laid up close in the three path, was under right handed encouragement from the rail around the far turn,
but faded from the two path down the lane. HERCULES N LOVE bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack from the four path, was driven
around the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. ADIAMOND ISFOREVER set the pace in the two path but gaveway along the inside in upper stretch.
NEIGH NEIGH NOW broke in at the start, rated in the two path but was empty entering the lane.

Footnotes
GRANDE SOIREE settled off the duel along the inside, bid between foes midway around the far turn, angled back in leaving the five-sixteenths marker, took
over near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. KEANU dueled in the three path around the far turn and two wide between foes around the far turn,
could not keep pace with the winner in the lane but stayed on well to hold the place. MANNIX (IRE) raced off the pace three wide, made a three bid bid
between foes entering the far turn, briefly led midway around the bend but flattened out in the lane. PLUMA ROJA raced well back three wide, angled five
wide near the quarter pole and was no threat in the lane. EMBER broke slowly, raced well back inside, went four wide around the far turn and lacked the
needed rally. EUPHORIA STAR failed to menace while racing two wide and swing six wide near the quarter pole. EYES OF CHAMPION chased the pace
three wide around the first turn then steadily faded. MONEY MAP steadied nearing the first turn, saved ground in midpack, launched a four wide bid early on
the far turn, reached near even terms near the five-sixteenths marker and came up empty in the lane. T VILLE dueled inside, gave way near the
three-eighths marker, steadied while tiring midway around the far turn and retreated under minimal urging.

Footnotes
GREAT VENEZUELA prompted the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path around the turn, took aim from the four path entering the stretch, took
the lead passing the eighth pole, and drew clear under a drive. BREEZERO bumped with an inner foe at the start, led out in the five path into the turn, was
cued to tip inside early around the turn, stayed on from the two path in upper stretch, lost the lead passing the eighth pole, began to fade nearing the final
sixteenth, but held place in a photo. NEXT ON STAGE chased in the two path, was driven in the three path around the turn, shifted out to the five path into
the stretch, kept on, but lost a minor photo to show. CASUALLY raced off the pace inside, tipped out around the turn, was in the five path at the top of the
lane, but was one paced. THE MYTH trailed in the three path, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, but made no impact. LUCY'S COOKIE pressed
inside of foes from the two path, was put to a ride along the rail rounding the turn, but faded around the four path in the stretch. FLUFFY rated in the five
path but never threatened. SPICY GUACAMOLE bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced up close between foes in the four path, steadied going into the
turn, then drifted outward turning into the lane, and was eased.

SELF TAUGHT lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn, swept to the front in midstretch and drew clear under a drive. GAME BOY BENNY
tracked the pace three wide, bid between foes nearing the eighth pole, was no match for the winner but kept on to be a clear second. FIVEFIVE SIX
CHAMP set the pace along the rail and yielded leaving the eighth pole. ROAD TO STARDOM raced up close two wide, waited for room late on the turn but
lacked a closing bid once clear in upper stretch. CROSS HASTE was crowded at the start, advanced between foes down the backstretch, dueled two wide
around the turn and tired in the drive. HERCULES broke outwardly and was steadied, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened. THIS RUN'S
FOR YOU was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
CATALYTIC stalked in the five path, bid from the four path early around the turn, was cued to open up from the two path entering the stretch, and kicked
away under a drive. SECRET LOVER chased in the four path, advanced under a drive around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the lane, and
chased on for place. CATALINA WINEMIXER set the pace inside, lost the lead midway around the turn, floated out to the four path into the stretch, and was
one paced to comeback for show. SUPREME DOMINANCE was hustled along from off the pace in the three path, under right handed urging in the four path
around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, but was unable to challenge. XY FACE prompted the pace out in the six path, floated out to
the seven path turning into the stretch, and flattened. WHITE SERIES pressed in the three path, briefly led before being overtaken by the outer eventual
winner midway around the turn, and faded going into the stretch. AMAZING JETT trailed from the five path into the turn, and did not factor. ZAINO raced in
midpack from the three path, fanned out around the turn and was in the eight path entering the lane, but weakened. DASH TO FINISH raced wellback in the
four path and never threatened. GUAICAIPURO rated in the two path but was eased turning into the lane.

POUND GREEN settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, moved to the front in midstretch, dueled outside of
CUPID'S DUDE to the wire and prevailed. CUPID'S DUDE settled off the early pace outside, angled to rail midway around the first turn, made progress
inside around the far turn, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth pole, dueled inside of the winner to the wire and just
missed. CHAPALU raced closest to the pacesetter in the clear early, bid two wide around the far turn, took the lead late on the turn, led to midstretch and
weakened. BENELUX was off slow, saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and ran on. BURNING MAN failed to menace while
racing three wide. XY TIME set the pace along rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. READYSEEKGO played no factor while racing two wide
around the turns and angling five wide turning for home. TEMPLET chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE SAINT tracked between foes in the three path, tipped inside under coaxing early around the turn, bid from the rail into the stretch, took the
lead near the eighth pole, and was driven clear. LOYAL LOUIE stalked in the five path, was roused from the four path early into the turn, fanned out to the
six path entering the stretch, and kept on to be up for place. GEPARD set the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path passing the quarter, tipped
back out to the three path entering the lane, lost the lead nearing the eighth pole, and evened out for show. BARONE CESCO hopped at the start and
bumped with an inner foe, rated in the three path, split foes midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, but was one paced on his
left lead down the lane. EXECUTIVE SEARCH prompted the pace in the four path, was under a hard drive in the three path around the turn, but flattened in
the five path down the lane. SENSEI LAWRENCE hopped at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but made no impact. THENORTHREMEMBERS
trailed in the two path early and was no factor from the five path in the stretch. LUNAR ROCKET bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two
path but was no menace.

Footnotes
TIME PASSAGE was bumped at the start but still clearly broke on top, set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. TO THYSELF B TRUE
settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around most of the far turn, angled in near the quarter pole and rallied in the two path to
gain the place in the final strides. PAWKY chased the winner three wide, made some progress in the three path around the far turn but was unable to match
strides in the lane and lost second late. COCO settled off the early pace inside, angled out turning into the backstretch, advanced outside, edged closer four
wide under urging around the turn and faded in the stretch. LUCK IN THE DUSK failed to menace while racing two and three wide. OLGA broke a bit
awkwardly and bumped the winner just after the start, stalked that foe in the three path and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
THREE WITCHES chased between foes in the four path, ranged up to bid in the five path turning into the lane, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, drew
clear of inner rivals passing the sixteenth, and stayed on to hold off a late charging outer foe. MARYQUITECONTRARY trailed from the six path into the
turn, loomed up under a drive passing the quarter, swung from the seven path into the lane, and ran on down the center for place. R ADIOS JERSEY was
reluctant to load, prompted the pace in the three path, bid under urging turning into the stretch, evened out in the final furlong, but held show. BLUEFIELD
tracked in the three path, was driven in the two path around the turn, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. OLIVIA DARLING
stalked inside, was roused midway around the turn, bid from the rail into the stretch, but faded. ROSIE'S HALO rated in the three path, but made no impact
from the six path down the stretch. POIEMA set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the three eighths pole, but yielded at the top of the lane.
FLAKES was wellback in the six path and never menaced.

Footnotes
CHILLING FACTOR was bumped at the start, angled out midway down the backstretch, raced in range in the clear in the four path around the turn, closed
outside, was up leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear under left-handed urging. MIGUEL'S BELLE set the pace in the two path, was collared near the
sixteenth pole and held on for the place. WOW LUCKY was reluctant to load, raced off the pace two wide, lugged in in midstretch, belatedly switched leads
near the sixteenth pole and ran on well from there. UMBRAL raced off the pace four wide and had a mild belated rally. SWEET MISS broke sharply,
prompted the pace in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. MY SARASOTA QUEEN failed to menace while racing two wide.
DIVA BALLERINA bumped with the winner just after the start, had speed inside but retreated through the lane. CHURCH GIRL was bumped not long after
the start, saved ground and made little further impact. MOCHI GIRL was fractious in the gate, hit the gate, bumped not long after the start, raced three wide
and trailed.
