Footnotes
L. A. WOMAN stalked the two rival duel while in the three path into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn, caught the leader outside the eighth pole while in
the four or five path then drove clear. HOLIDAY ROAD vied for the lead two wide from the outset, was inching to the front when joined by the winner into the
lane, drifted from the three to the rail nearing the eighth pole, came back off the inside and into the four path through the final eighth and just lasted for the
place spot. NOTO raced off the rail into the far turn, continued three wide through late turn, came into the lane from the five path and finished with good
energy to just miss the place spot. ART QUEEN was in the two path and between rivals through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and
finished evenly. SHE'S A SAINT was in the three path path through the turn while near the back, came into the lane from the four path and offered a mild
gain. EL KOWN dueled for the lead along the inside down the backstretch and through the turn, continued to press the pace into the lane, was shut off
against the rail nearing the eighth pole and was put in hand late. DIXIE RAG was never a factor while along the inside. DEVIL tracked the pace along the
inside through the far turn, was still a contender entering the lane then was empty the final eighth while in the two path. FROSTY TALE raced in the two path
through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and never made an impact. AFTER A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF #4 EL KOWN, #5 HOLIDAY ROAD WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND (2ND) AND PLACED SIXTH (6TH) FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
EIGHTH POLE.

BUTCH'S BEST pressed the pace in the three path outside of the leader, bid on the turn, dueled through the stretch, inched clear late and lasted under mild
urging. HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE stalked the pace in the three path, bid late but couldn't get past the winner. SPOTONJUSTICE led inside of the winner in
the two path, dueled, then yielded late. CABOOSE was away last, bid inside at the three-eighths pole, angled four wide at the quarter pole, bid and hung.
GOOD FOREVER pressed the early pace inside, settled, lacked room in the stretch and gave way late. KINGOFTHERAINBOW was through early. ONE
WAY RAY faded on the turn. PER RULING FROM HIWU, HIGHCOTTON JUSTICE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY saved ground through far turn, angled into the three path after cutting the corner into the lane, was brushed by a tiring rival
from the inside, dug in for the final push and prevailed. JURA chased the two rival duel through the far turn, bid into the four path while straightening in the
lane gained the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and was outfinished by the winner. AQUACAT vied for the lead along the inside through the far turn and into
the lane, dispatched dueling rival into the lane but was soon joined by the eventual winner, drifted out a step and brushed that one when weakening.
SATURN BOY trailed while well off the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then moved up while not a threat. ONE LUCKY DAY
was in the three path through the turn when never far back, swung four wide into the lane and needed more. SMOKIN' HOT pressed and vied with the
pacesetter while two wide through the far turn then was suddenly done after straightening in the lane.

Footnotes
FIRST KITTEN saved ground through the turn and into the lane, stayed along the rail to cut the corner into the lane, moved inside of leaders nearing
three-sixteenths, continued on with good energy to gain the lead outside the sixteenth pole and held. AZURITA raced along the inside through the turn,
came off the rail and into the three path straightening into the lane, checked and altered out into the five path when avoiding a badly tiring runner, got clear
inside the eighth pole while in the five or six path and finished willingly. GIFT WRAPPED saved ground through the turn when never far back, was gaining
on the leader when outfinished by the top two, stayed on well and finished clear for the show spot. JE SUIS BELLE vied for the lead along the inside, shook
off challenger into the lane then gave way to others. MABEE LUCKYNWILD chased the pace from the two path through the the turn, came into the lane
from the three or four path and lacked a closing kick. MONTGOMERY PARK raced in the two to the three path through the turn when in mid-pack, swung
into the lane from the seven path and never was a factor. GET N TIPSY raced in the two path through the turn when trailing, angled widest and into the nine
path and passed a couple. KEEN ICE SIGHT saved ground through the turn, angled into the eight path for the drive and made no impact. AWESOME
LAWSON was hard ridden early to duel for the early lead, dueled into the turn, was still a factor into the lane then retreated. SHES MY TREASURE was
outrun while in the three path through the turn.

BOOMING stalked the pace in the three path, lacked running room in early stretch, waited, shifted to the four path at the eighth pole and rallied, going clear
late under mild urging. KNEEDEEPJUSTICE pressed the pace in the four path, bid at the eighth pole, was clear late but couldn't hold off the winner.
SPECIALTY ACT stalked the pace inside, then bid late between rivals in the three path. GREEWHIZ dueled inside before giving way late. TREMOR dueled
outside of the leader before giving way late. THEO'S PROMISE was off a step slow, then rallied belatedly six wide. COWBOY JUSTICE pressed the early
pace five wide, then bid six wide in the stretch. ANDELE ANDELE pressed the pace three wide before giving way. JAILHOUSE JUSTICE was not a factor.
AMERICAN EYES was never close.

Footnotes
GRANATO was bumped at the start, chased the pace from the two or three path through the turn, bid into the lane, led when straightening in the lane, was
urged left-handed once, lugged out sharply from the four to the thirteen path, urged right handed and stayed clear. SECRET OPERATION raced in the two
path through the turn when near the back, came into the lane from the two or three path, shifted into the five path and rallied through the final sixteenth.
YOU'RE AVOIDING ME raced in the three path through the turn when never far back, angled into the five path for the drive and moved up to be clear for the
show spot. STAR WISHER was in the three path through the turn when near the back, shifted into the five path for the drive and offered a belated gain.
STRAWBERRYLEMONADE pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane then weakened. BUTTONS chased the pace along the inside and
weakened in the drive. MORE THAN A DIVA saved ground to no avail. DESIGNED BY KITTEN vied for the lead along the inside through the turn then gave
way through the lane. CURLIN SERENADE came into the lane four wide and tired. KAYA'S HALO raced well off the inside down the backstretch, was
getting out through the turn reaching the ten to twelve path, continued far from the inside into the lane and was never in it thereafter.

MACHO JUSTICE chased the dueling pacesetters while in the two path, asked for more in late turn, gained a short lead outside the eighth pole, came out a
path and bumped the runner-up, was then bumped and leaned on by that one inside the sixteenth pole, continued under strong handling to the end and
prevailed. DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE saved ground through the turn while never far back, bid into the lane from the three or four path, was bumped by the
winner inside the eighth pole, drifted inward under right-handed urging to bump with winner then was denied. HIGHEST MEMORIES unhurried while off the
inside, moved through the four path on the far turn, continued in the four or five path through the lane and was gaining to the end. SCENIC JUSTICE trailed
early while off the inside, continued to slowly move up while in the three path through the turn, continued in the five path into the lane and gained from
mid-track belatedly. ROCK THE RED saved ground through the turn and into the lane, came into the lane from the two path and finished evenly. LAST
OUTLAW was along the inside throughout and never was a factor. HE SAID CASH never a factor while in the three path through the turn and into the lane.
JUANCHO vied for the lead along the inside of another through the far turn then gave way in late turn. SAN RONIN outrun while off the inside. DAYKRA
vied for the lead two wide through the far turn then was done at the quarter pole. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #2 DOUBLEDOGJUSTICE AGAINST
THE RIDER OF MACHO JUSTICE AND A STEWARDS INQUIRY FOR ACTIVITY DURING THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR CHANGE OF
ORDER.

Footnotes
CATS BY FIVE dueled outside of a rival, drew off in the stretch and geared down late. SHARP SHOT pressed the early pace inside, lacked a late bid but
gained the place late. AZTECA'S GOLD dueled inside of the winner, then gave way in the stretch while holding the show. BIRCHTON stalked the early pace
between foes before fading. THISISRIDICULOUS improved position late outside. DRIVE TRAIN was not a factor. FACTOR THE ODDS was through early.
