Footnotes
PEARLS SPIRIT AA tracked the pace from the two path while being well rated down the backstretch, urged on the turn to take command at the quarter then
dueled with TM PURNCESS down the stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. TM PURNCESS raced behind the field down the early backstretch, then
was advancing on the turn to battle for the lead with PEARLS SPIRIT AA from the outside in late stretch and was out finished in the end. AA SWEET
VICTORY tracked the pace from the inside into the turn at a moderate pace then rallied in late stretch and was best for the show prize. WMA BIG BABY
stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, then moved up to take the lead briefly on the turn then was used up and flattened out in the stretch.
RB MUNCHIE set the pace while two wide, was in a long drive heading into the turn then was extinguished after the quarter marker. RS JEWEL CROWN
settled behind the field while two wide and was no threat.
