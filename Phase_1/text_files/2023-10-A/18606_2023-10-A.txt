Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP settled inside, angled out on the final turn then wore down the pacesetters through the final furlong. CARTIER CAT alternated for the lead
along the rail in a long duel and continued gamely but was caught late. CAUSALISTIC lacked speed then finished full of run outside in the stretch. DRONE
SWARM dueled in the two path then inside and faltered in the stretch. TEEWINOT PASS saved ground in midpack and lacked a response. AMOUNT trailed
far behind then picked off rivals without menacing. RUNNINGFORHOME chased wide down the backstretch and was never in contention. SAMARONTI
moved close up for half a mile then gave way readily. MISSISSIPPI dropped back outside and weakened steadily.

third. SANDY Q dueled between rivals for half a mile then weakened. MAP OF LIFE chased along the inside and lacked a rally. LUCKY FLUSH was put to
urging down the backstretch and gave way. K C MO dropped far behind racing wide and faltered.

Footnotes
PROFESSOR KOOL chased wide throughout, rallied into the stretch and was up in the final yards for the upset. FINALLY CAPTURED forced the pace,
moved outside on the turn, bid clear in the stretch then was caught late. BIG BOYS ANSWER lacked speed, raced wide throughout and made a gradual late
gain. PRIVATE CABANA dropped back early then passed rivals late without menacing. NINJA PRIZE raced just off the pacesetters three wide and came up
empty in the stretch. INTO THE SAUCE hustled to a clear lead inside, vied through the turn and faltered. MIDNIGHT CAT hustled off the leaders inside and
was never involved. BATTUTA D'ORO moved briefly closer inside on the turn then flattened out. BLUE ROYAL broke sluggishly, rushed wide then gave
way readily.

Footnotes
KENNER led under a rating hold, shook loose before the half, opened a commanding lead and remained far ahead in a dominating score while kept to his
task. DEPLANE well behind early, advanced very wide, continued gamely but was no match for the winner. NORTH POLE pressed the winner in the
opening three furlongs then weakened in the stretch. AGARRAMESIPUEDES chased along the inside and lacked a solid rally. LEGENDARY LORE
dropped off the pace three wide and never threatened. RUSH CENTER raced within striking range and was never involved. COMPLETED STORM moved
off the leaders between foes and retreated. WRECKING BALL lagged far behind racing wide and was never a factor. RETWEET raced inside off the leaders
and gave way.
