SOMTHING ELUSIVE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside,
shook clear of his pace rival entering the final turn, and increased his advantage late while under confident handling. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT stalked the leaders
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid four wide while looming a danger entering the final turn, and finished willingly three
out from the rail in the drive. THERE GOES MY HERO tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, collared the
leaders while commencing a three wide bid from between rivals entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. BETTER
TONE saved ground through the first turn and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied one out from the rail entering
the final turn, while looking for room, and finished evenly from along the rail in the stretch drive. CRYPTO MUNNY unhurried early while trailing the field in
the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished five out from the rail in the drive while only able to outfinish a tiring rival.
REMEMBERTHEALAMO away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of SOMTHING ELUSIVE entering the first turn, forced the issue from the
outside of that rival in the run down the backside, was unable to match strides with his pace rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

HE'S A SAINT away alertly and raced to the lead entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, continued to dictate the pace in the run down the
backstretch while racing out from the rail, maintained his advantage through the final turn, and widened his advantage late while drifting four wide in deep
stretch. CAIRO CRUSADER broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his
position in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. MAX
BOOSTER away well and stalked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, continued to save ground and gained a tracking trip
in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon while finishing at
the rail. STOLO SPIRIT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied two wide entering the final turn,
and finished four wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late impact. HE'S GOLDEN settled at the back of a compact field entering the stretch the
first time, saved ground through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

ROOKIE YEAR away alertly and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch
the first time, crept closer in the run down the backside, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and was all
out to fend off a late surge by BROKE AN BROKEN to prevail. BROKE AN BROKEN settled off the battling leaders while saving ground at the rail entering
the stretch the first time, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn while being restrained while awaiting racing room, tipped four wide leaving the
turn, and closed determinedly four wide in the lane to just miss. WISELY PLAYED away well and stalked the leaders into the lane the first time while racing
one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide from between rivals entering the final turn, steadied slightly leaving the turn, and finished three wide in the
drive to garner a share. SLOOP JOHN B broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from
the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken leaving the turn, and faded in the late going. BUZZINGA KARMA shifted off the
rail entering the stretch the first time to duel for the early lead from the outside of SLOOP JOHN B, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. The
rider of WISELY PLAYED lodged a claim of foul for alleged interference on the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was
made to the original order of finish

OUR BLOKE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, repelled the
challenge from KIKS LOVE OF LIFE through the final turn, and drew clear in the lane to prove best. EYES OF BEAUTY stalked the leader into the
backstretch while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, pulled her way into a tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from
