Footnotes
SO CLOSE SO FAR hard to load, broke sharply and was well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and drove clear late. BLOODHOUND rated outside the leader, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear into
the stretch, drew off, then was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. EMPTY MY POUCH chased the pace early, moved up two and
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. TALE OF THE DRAGON unhurried, moved up on the two path through the
turn, came through on that path into the stretch and improved position. SWEET TRAVELS mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the stretch and had no rally. POLIE set the early pace inside and faded through the turn. LOVE IS FOREVER hard to load, reared at the start
and was never involved.

VICOUNTESS well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, made a
steady gain and drew off inside the furlong marker. DONATE LIFE set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, then was no match the final
furlong and held the place. HALEY'S HAPPY GIRL mid pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, angled
out for clear racing room, made a steady gain and missed the place. DORTH'S SOL DANCER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. WITH FEELING (GB) unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and weakened the final furlong. I'AM TOO bumped at the start, improved position. BANDIT QUEEN stalked the pace on the outside and faded
through the turn. MEL'S ANGEL broke in bumping a rival at the start, then was never involved.

Footnotes
ORAZIO well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain,
dueled late and edged ahead in the final strides. CEDUNA stalked the early pace on the outside, moved up to gain a short lead through the second turn,
then dueled with the winner in the late going and was outfinished. SPETTACOLI (ARG) unhurried, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. SIDE TRACKED well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the second
turn, came four wide into the stretch and evened out. J P CORNETTA well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn,
came three wide into the stretch and flattened out. LORD REVELSTOKE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through
the second turn, then faded late. PATRIOT DRIVE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the
stretch, angled out and passed tiring rivals. REGAL SPEAKER improved position, inside. INNUENDO was a brief fac. GOODTIME ARTIE was never
involved.
