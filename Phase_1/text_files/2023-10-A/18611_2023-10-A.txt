Footnotes
AGATE ROAD chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
sixteenth out coming in slightly at that station, then inched away to the finish to prevail. FULMINEO tracked just off the inside from near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied and was bumped between foes who each came inwards closing
off his seam a sixteenth out, then was along belatedly for the place honors. LIAM'S JOURNEY tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing just
off the inside at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and came in slightly bumping FULMINEO in tandem with SPIRIT
PRINCE a sixteenth out while offering up a mild bid. SPIRIT PRINCE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and came out slightly a sixteenth out when collared for the front, bumped with FULMINEO at that station and ran on to the
finish. TRIPLE ESPRESSO settled just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. B D SAINTS coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued two to
three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. TIFAREEH chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GET SPOOLED coaxed from the gate, raced two to three
wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. There was a Stewards'
Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a claim of foul by the rider of FULMINEO alleging interference against AGATE ROAD. After review, the result was
allowed to stand and the claim of foul was dismissed prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
WOKE UP QUICK dueled early on from the three path before emerging to show the way three then two wide, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive and held on to prevail. BIG PRANKSTER coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, closed well but was ultimately repelled to the wire. AZ U CHASE ME coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. NANO MAN hard to load, veered in at the start bumping DRINKING
SOLO into SAVAGE SPIRIT, dueled from the two path briefly with WOKE UP QUICK, then chased tucked to the inside through the turn, continued in the
inside route into upper stretch and ran on to the finish. PRICE IS TRUTH coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path into
the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. ROB THE BANK
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. SORORITY PRANK chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered no rally. DRINKING SOLO broke in at the start
and was bumped by NANO MAN into SAVAGE SPIRIT, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. SAVAGE SPIRIT got bumped solidly at the start and conceded five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five
then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, made no impact. MITHRIDATES four then three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, tired.
