Footnotes
BAR MONEY without early speed, waited for room just off the rail on the bend, got through four wide between horses midstretch and drew clear deep
stretch. GREEN GRACE shared the lead just off the inside, floated out some entering the lane, moved clear upper stretch, did not have enough left the last
sixteenth but was clearly second best. WILDISH pressed the early speed while toward the outside, three then four wide taking the turn then flattened out the
last furlong. KISSES FOR WEEJ disputed the pace from inside for a half mile then began to yield. JUST AT MIDNIGHT unruly in the gate prestart, raced in
contention between horses, came five wide into the stretch and also wore down. IT'S ON failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. MS KS DYNASTY was a
factor from outside for a half mile then gave way. HUCKLEBERRY HUSTLE was steadied in traffic leaving the chute, hustled along behind WILDISH and
began to fade four wide on the bend.

Footnotes
BRIANA HARPER forwardly placed toward the outside, went for the lead three wide on the bend, moved clear inside the final furlong, drifted out deep
stretch but held sway. KONA KONNECT progressed two wide on the turn, altered out four wide for a clear path upper stretch, rallied belatedly between
horses and angled out to stay clear of BRIANA HARPER in the waning yards. ONACOUNTA without early speed, stayed off the inside on the bend, brushed
DON'T TELL ALYCE leaving the turn, found herself behind FANCY HILL inside the final furlong, altered out abruptly, bumped solidly with DON'T TELL
ALYCE, rallied deep stretch and got up for third late. HARPER BRIANA lost considerable ground widest on the turn, came into the lane from the middle of
the track and also rallied belatedly. DON'T TELL ALYCE soon trailed, began to pick up her pace after a quarter mile, was forced to stay wide just outside
ONACOUNTA on the bend, rallied from path five in the stretch, was bumped solidly inside the last eighth and showed a willingness to run late. FANCY HILL
was shuffled back shortly after the break, came into contention four wide on the turn, fanned out further entering the stretch and was closing the gap
belatedly deep stretch, as well. RAIN ATTACK set a pressured pace just off the inside for a half mile then gradually wore down. FAST KYLIE unruly in the
gate prestart, displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing three furlongs. There was a stewards' inquiry into the bumping incident
deep stretch. After their review, ONACOUNTA was disqualified and placed fifth for altering out into DON'T TELL ALYCE'S inside the last furlong.

Footnotes
KEEN RESPONSE hesitated at the break, gradually progressed from inside, altered out five wide upper stretch and edged ahead in the waning yards.
OKLAHOMA HEAT settled inside, commenced his bid after a half mile, dueled for the lead along the rail the final sixteenth but did not have enough left
nearing the wire. ARGYBARGY BUCK vied for the lead briefly from inside, angled outside KANITHAPPEN midway on the backstretch, went for the lead
again on the second bend, had the advantage entering the lane, was challenged from inside then outside as well deep stretch and slowly yielded. STORM
BORN bumped with OPTION at the break, advanced from outside on the backstretch, angled in into the second turn, soon threatened two wide between
rivals but gradually wore down in the late going. FATHER PATRICK chased from just off the inside, swung out five wide for the stretch run, altered out some
when his path was taken by KEEN RESPONSE upper stretch and could only make up minor ground inside the last eighth. OPTION bumped with STORM
BORN at the start, had no early speed, lost ground widest through the second turn and also closed the gap some in the stretch without threatening.
KANITHAPPEN vied for the early lead from outside, moved clear and stayed in path three, was challenged from outside on the second bend and gave way
between horses in the lane. STAY STRONG was a brief contender but steadily faded from outside KANITHAPPEN before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ICONICUS rated off the early speed, gradually progressed three wide on the backstretch to gain the advantage on the second bend, drifted out to path five
into the lane, moved clear inside the furlong marker, gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure but held sway. CREPE YARNS steadily advanced
from inside, came out slightly leaving the second turn, had a narrow lead briefly at the top of the stretch, was soon overtaken, angled outside ICONICUS
when that one took his path nearing the sixteenth marker and proved clearly second best. MY TENNIS SHOES settled early, progressed while toward the
outside on the backstretch, gained a striking position four wide on the second bend, lost further ground staying outside ICONICUS entering the lane then
could not sustain his bid. MAXIMUS DECIMUS was encouraged to a clear lead into the first turn, showed the way just off the inside, was challenged from
outside nearing the end of six furlongs and wore down the final quarter mile. TEMPLE FOOL advanced from outside to reach contention on the second
bend, drifted out to path seven into the stretch and gave way. NEVER SORRY chased from between rivals, saved ground taking the second turn and had no
late bid. UH OH IT'S MAGIC raced in midpack toward the outside on the backstretch but faded on the second bend. CHERRY ORCHARD chased from
outside, stayed off the inside through the second turn and had little to offer for the stretch run. HALF THE BATTLE quit from just off the inside soon after
entering the backstretch.

Footnotes
READY REDDING was sent to a clear lead and the inside then allowed to relax, moved clear when roused leaving the quarter pole, opened up in the lane
and was kept to task until nearing the wire. DRIFTING WEST settled inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, swung out to path four on the second bend
and took over second inside the final furlong. WILLOW RIDGE without early speed between rivals, was just off the inside on the second turn, lodged a mild
bid along the rail in the lane and gained third inside the last sixteenth. GEORGE'S VISION soon trailed from well off the inside, swung out five wide for the
stretch run and passed tired ones. BAM BAM CAM advanced from outside to share the lead on the backstretch, angled in beside READY REDDING
nearing the second bend, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and flattened out between rivals inside the final eighth. KRAMDEN
hesitated then broke a bit outward, stayed off the inside and was never a factor. TRIPLE CHROME unruly in the gate prestart, raced in contention from path
three for six furlongs then gradually drifted out as he gave way in the stretch. REMEMBER THE MAINE was a factor from inside but began to fade into the
second turn.

Footnotes
TAPICITA broke alertly, was rated off the early speed, was just off the rail on the bend, fanned three wide for the drive, took the lead with seventy yards to
go and began to draw off. CARICIA soon vied for the lead just outside HIGHTAILING IT, moved ahead on the turn, took the rail into the lane, widened
command but did not have enough left inside the final sixteenth. SCAPITURE was soon well back, saved ground on the bend, swung out to path four
entering the lane, altered outside the drifting BLAZE BEAUTY upper stretch, made a strong move the last furlong, narrowly missed second but was easily
best of the rest. BLAZE BEAUTY pressed the early speed from outside, was three then four wide through the turn, drifted out some as she began to fade
upper stretch, held a straight path the final eighth and finished evenly. DRAGONFLY KISSES chased running widest and was never a factor. HIGHTAILING
IT was hustled to contest the pace from inside but began to yield before finishing a half mile. BORDER STAR was an early factor between rivals, sustained
a serious injury into the turn, was pulled up and humanely euthanized.

Footnotes
MARY'S BOY prominent from outside, was roused four wide on the bend, fanned out further into the lane, took the advantage with a sixteenth left and kept
PLAIN OR PEANUT at bay. PLAIN OR PEANUT crowded briefly at the start, progressed in close quarters between horses, was two wide through the turn,
vied for the lead inside LORD SHAFTESBURY inside the final furlong and did not have enough left to hold back MARY'S BOY deep stretch. I'M YOUR
VALENTINE prominent behind the early leaders, did not keep up on the bend, lost ground fanning six wide into the lane, rallied belatedly but gained third
inside the last sixteenth. LORD SHAFTESBURY was away somewhat slowly, circled rivals five wide on the turn, angled in some entering the stretch and
began to wear down between horses inside the final eighth. MY KINDA TETON displayed early speed from inside, was shuffled back from tight quarters
nearing the bend, boxed in through the turn, angled out four wide upper stretch and had no late bid. THACKER FROMM contested the pace between
horses, gained the rail into the turn and began to flatten out before finishing a half mile. LAGRUE vied for the lead four wide on the backstretch but gave way
three wide on the bend.

Footnotes
MILLARD'S SMILE settled at the back, commenced his bid just off the inside after a half mile, progressed two wide on the second bend, angled outside
LASTFORTINOFAMILY upper stretch, continued his rally and lugged in some as he edged ahead near the wire. NULLARBOR was encouraged to sprint
away from the rest at the beginning, floated out some into the stretch, began to shorten his stride, gradually drifted out inside the final furlong and was
outfinished. LASTFORTINOFAMILY rated from outside, progressed from path three on the second turn, moved clear for second upper stretch, gradually
angled out as NULLARBOR came out inside the last eighth, lacked the extra needed, was steadied behind MILLARD'S SMILE in the final strides and
proved easily best of the others. MAC PANDOWDY raced closest to NULLARBOR for six furlongs then began to flatten out. ARROW STRIKE chased from
inside, angled out four wide on the second bend, lost further ground fanning to path six entering the stretch and had no late bid. COPPER CROSSING not
far off the inside most of the way, failed to menace. LONESOME DREAM chased from between horses, angled in with a half mile to go, improved position
some just off the rail on the second turn then gave way for the drive. LOOK AWAY showed little in a ground-saving trip. SLAVA UKRAINI reluctant to load,
hesitated at the break, was hustled up between rivals on the backstretch, began to fade along the rail on the second bend, was eased deep stretch and
walked off.

DOCS SEVEN rated just off the inside, progressed on the bend, angled out widest into the lane, altered out some as SALLY'S SURPRISE came out upper
stretch, took the lead inside the last eighth and lugged in under right-handed pressure nearing the wire. SALLY'S SUPRISE a step slow at the break,
advanced from outside, took over second three wide on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, drifted out slightly upper stretch, lugged in some as she
vied for the lead between rivals inside the final furlong then did not have the extra needed in the waning yards. IGGY BIGS was also a step slow at the start,
progressed just off the inside, had the rail on the bend, ran evenly the last two furlongs but was clearly best of the others. LICHITA was quickly clear of the
rest, had the rail on the turn, came out some into the lane then began to gradually drift out as she wore down between rivals the last eighth. MY MORNING
GAL prominent toward the outside on the backstretch, began to fade just off the rail before finishing a half mile. PALAGO was soon well back, stayed off the
inside and had no late bid. DOROTA was a contender between horses on the backstretch but gave way along the rail on the turn. JULIAISON showed little.
