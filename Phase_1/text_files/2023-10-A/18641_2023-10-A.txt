Footnotes
ALL stalked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, gained ground three wide heading to the quarter pole, made a steady gain on TWO TWELVE into
mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth and kicked clear to prevail. TWO TWELVE was sent in the opening furlong, established the lead in the
early running while outside of runners and set a solid pace while off of the rail along the turn, held ALL at bay into upper stretch, was overtaken by that rival
into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and bested the rest. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA broke in at the start and was
off a step slowly, settled off of the solid early pace and tracked from the inside along the turn, gained ground into the stretch, was not able to impact the top
two in deep stretch and ran on to secure third. MISCHIEF MAMA stalked the solid early pace, came in tight approaching the turn while between runners and
checked, stalked the pace three to four wide into the stretch, weakened and was outfinished for third. SEVEN SISTERS broke alertly, lost the early lead to
TWO TWELVE, chased that rival through solid fractions while saving ground along the turn, came two wide into the stretch and gave way. COASTAL
STARLITE lacked early speed, chased three wide into the lane and did not threaten.

Footnotes
A LOTTA NERVE was hard to load prior to the start and broke a half-step slowly away from the gate, recovered and assumed command in the opening
stages, showed speed and opened to a clear lead into the turn, extended the lead while off of the rail heading to the quarter marker, widened the lead into
mid-stretch and drew off in the final furlong in an impressive debut win. SOUTHERN BLESSING rook back off of the solid early pace, was steered three
wide into the stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages and ran on to secure the place. AUTISM SHINE chased the fast pace from the
inside, raced in tight along the turn and steadied nearing the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into upper stretch, lacked the needed response in
the final furlong but stayed on in deep stretch to secure third. FOREVER LOVELY stalked the fast pace from a two wide path, chased A LOTTA NERVE into
the stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and faded. ESCAPE THE HEAT chased the fast early pace, lost ground while two wide along the turn,
dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

path at the top of the stretch, drew to even terms with TEAGANS ATM nearing the furlong marker, took command from that rival and drove clear in the final
sixteenth. TEAGANS ATM assumed command in the early going, set decent fractions into the turn, drifted out a bit at the top of the lane and came two wide
into the stretch, was confronted nearing the furlong pole by AYRTON SENNA, was overtaken and could not match strides with that rival into the final
sixteenth, was outfinished and held safely in the end for second. BRONZE ONE raced close to the decent early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane,

FANTASTIC DREAM was allowed to settle, tracked the decent early pace while two wide and between runners along the first turn, was well placed heading
to the half-mile marker, was roused three wide and between runners approaching the quarter pole, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled with L L L
COOL to the furlong marker, took command into the final stages, held the runner-up at bay into deep stretch and kept to task in the end to prevail. L L L
COOL was prominent in the early running and contested the pace into the first turn, prompted the pace from a two wide path into the backstretch run, kept
close attendance to the decent pace to the half-mile marker, took command while two wide and between runners approaching the quarter marker, was
confronted by FANTASTIC DREAM into upper stretch and battled with that rival to mid-stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong, was held at bay in deep
stretch and was clear of the rest for second. BRANNIGAN settled outside of runners into the first turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run and
improved position heading to the half-mile marker, mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, lacked the needed
response in deep stretch and was outkicked, while well clear of the rest for third. VINNIEBOB was asked for early speed and assumed command into the
first turn, crossed over to the inside and set decent fractions into the backstretch run, carved out the pace to the half-mile marker, was overtaken nearing the
quarter marker and faded in the stretch. STELLA BOY was forwardly placed away from the gate, stalked the decent early pace from the inside, lost position
nearing the half-mile marker, lost contact along the second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

JERSEY SUNSET broke alertly and showed speed away from the gate, set a moderate pace prompted into the turn, shook free along the bend and was
well rated to the quarter marker setting the pace off of the rail, showed the way into upper stretch and held a safe lead approaching the furlong grounds, was
all out to hold off BERRY VALLEY inside of the sixteenth-marker, was fully extended in the final strides and lasted for the win at the finish. BERRY VALLEY
stalked the moderate early pace outside of rivals, was well placed three wide approaching the quarter pole, responded to urging three wide into the stretch,
came within aim in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, besting the rest. ADAPTED MEMORY tracked the moderate early pace from the inside,
saved ground to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was outkicked by the top pair in the final furlong and held clearly for third. SURFLINE raced
close to the early pace, mildly pressed outside of JERSEY SUNSET into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter pole, angled four wide in the stretch
and did not offer a late response. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE chased the pace from the inside and did not threaten. HARBOR'S BEAUTY was a bit slow into
stride away from the gate, was outrun along the turn and did not factor.

THREAD COUNT contested the early pace away from the gate, took back and tracked the decent pace from the inside, was roused along the turn, shifted
out and made a three wide move approaching the quarter marker, battled with BIG MAMA THORNTON into upper stretch and lost a bit of ground to that
rival nearing the furlong pole, re-rallied into deep stretch, vied between rivals in the final yards and gamely prevailed at the finish. NAN ELIZABETH bobbled
at the start, was off a step slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, came three wide into the turn, raced wide into the stretch and was asked for run
from the six path at the top of the lane, ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed with a rush while widest in deep stretch, vied for the lead in the final strides
and just missed for the win while just earning the nod for the place. BIG MAMA THORNTON contested the early pace while outside of a pair of rivals then
dueled with JASMINE CHIEFTAIN into the turn, carved out moderate fractions from the two path approaching the quarter marker, shook free into upper
stretch and was kept to steady urging to the furlong marker, held a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off oncoming rivals in deep stretch,
was outfinished by the top two in the final strides and was clear for third. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN was prominent in the early running, disputed the early pace
while between runners then pressed BIG MAMA THORNTON while inside of that rival heading into the turn, lost position heading to the quarter marker,
saved ground into upper stretch and remained within range at the furlong grounds, chased into deep stretch and lacked a final response.

MISS UNION was away in good order and was prominent leaving the start, took back to track the solid early pace and maintained a two wide path into the
turn, was roused along the bend and vied for the lead while two wide and between runners nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead into upper stretch
with HOT RAGEOUS, repelled that rival's bid heading to the furlong grounds, kicked clear into deep stretch and drew off in the final stages to win going
away. HOT RAGEOUS lunged at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the quick early pace and raced outside of rivals into the turn, loomed four wide
approaching the quarter marker and battled for the lead into upper stretch with MISS UNION, was turned away by that rival inside of the furlong pole, was
outkicked in deep stretch and held safely in the end for the place. BUYBACK was forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the solid early pace while
outside of rivals, improved position into the turn while three deep, came in tight nearing the quarter marker and took up while between runners approaching
the top of the stretch, raced four wide into the lane, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong but stayed on in deep stretch and was clear in
the end for third. DULCE EMMA stalked the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, came in
tight while behind runners and waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, shifted to the two path into upper stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker
and weakened in the final sixteenth. LADY WOLF was hard sent away from the gate, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the half-mile marker,
came under pressure heading to the quarter pole, was overtaken into upper stretch and tired in the drive. THE RIDER OF HOT RAGEOUS LODGED AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF MISS UNION. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO

Footnotes
GORDY'S BOY was caught three wide into the first turn then settled in a tracking spot behind the pace, raced five wide on the outside of the tracking group
down the backstretch, started a rally approaching the three furlong marker, took command into the stretch and won clear under brisk handling to the wire.
BROKEN FINGER was quick from the break and encouraged to get forward position, then was taken in hand and let FRANKS FIX IT alone on the lead,
made a bid on the far turn when that one began to weaken near the three-eighths pole, vied briefly with GORDY'S BOY to the outside but could not match
strides with that rival then ran on well to finish second, well clear of the next horse. POUR ON THE COLE secured an inside position and settled mid-pack
while the pace scenario played out in front, was put into a drive passing the seven-sixteenths pole then swung five wide into the stretch and was tiring down
the stretch but managed hold the third position under steady pressure. BROOKYS TAPIT got squeezed after the break then was taken in hand to be last
into the first turn, fell way behind the field for the first half mile then gradually regained contact with the field heading into the far turn, made a three wide rally
through the turn that ran out of steam in the stretch, but kept on to improve position in the late going. MARKSMAN ON TARGET raced close up while in the
three to four path, began to struggle to keep up by the far turn, lost ground then was not persevered with and ridden out to the finish. BEL RAGAZZO raced
near the rear of the tracking group, then set up for a run through the turn then was unable to keep up by the five-sixteenths and was outrun from that point
on. FRANKS FIX IT broke in after the start and caused BROOKYS TAPIT to take up, and was sent for the lead with purpose, opened up a big lead through
the clubhouse turn, continued to set rapid fractions down the backstretch, still held the lead to the far turn then started to fade passing the three furlong pole.
