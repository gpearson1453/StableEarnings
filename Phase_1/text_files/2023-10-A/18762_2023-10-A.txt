Footnotes
SKIPPER'S PRIDE hustled away, went in pursuit of TICKET TO THE TOP leaving the backstretch, swept the lead at the head of the lane and won going
away. TICKET TO THE TOP loaded without the rider, sent for outside speed, emerged the leader into the backstretch after racing four wide through the
opening turn, opened up to good margins then was overtaken into the lane and finished second-best. GRATED COCONUT reserved off the early
pacesetters, lodged an all-out bid into the final turn, and finished evenly. MARAMAX chased inside and failed to threaten. EDDY BEAR offered little.
BURNING UP flashed some early speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
CALI CONQUEST took early initiative to lead the field into the opening turn, responded gamely to challenge from WANDERING WEST at the head of the
stretch, and held under a long drive, finishing in record time. WANDERING WEST stalked the pace inside, brushed H K RAPPER entering the backstretch
while in close quarters, shifted out to the two path then moved up menacingly alongside CALI CONQUEST, rallied determinedly outside but was unable to
get by, but proved clearly second best. KAUAI DAN fanned four wide leaving the first turn, sat in striking position, was unable to move on with rivals and
held on for show. H K RAPPER fanned three wide in the opening turn, was brushed entering the backstretch while in traffic, chased inside but was unable to
improve position. BODEMONSTER was never far back early, tracked four wide through the backstretch, and weakened.

NORTHERN JEWEL lost position in the opening turn then dropped back, gained quickly inside nearing the final turn, overtook the leader, and edged clear.
ROUGH CUSTOMER set the pace from the rail, drew away in the far turn, was overtaken in the stretch, and finished second-best. SMART CAT jostled
away, pressed the early pace from between foes, and chased the leader then started to fade gradually and held on for third place. HANDSOME HENRY
bumped leaving then vied three wide, chased three to four wide, and finished well. MACHINE jostled away, chased through the backstretch, took closer
order, and came up empty in the drive. PACHECO saved ground inside, lodged a rail bid then lacked running room in the stretch and yielded.
TAPFERSURE fanned four wide into the backstretch, tracked outside, and tired early.

FAVORITE LIGHT brushed leaving then secured the lead from just off the rail, opened up when called upon, and was geared down late. KISS ME HELLO
raced four to five wide into the opening turn, stalked three wide, and chased the leader into the stretch but was no match for the winner. SIX SHOTS OF T
lagged inside early, shifted outside, and closed late. GWIZZ chased four wide into the opening turn, sat just off the pace in the two path, and weakened
gradually. NO MOR DISCO broke inward brushing FAVORITE LIGHT, dropped back through the backstretch, and was unable to improve position in the
drive. VIOLET CITY offered little. ANTIGUA BAY never reached contention. REMAIN CALM never involved.

Footnotes
EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE dictated the pace early, saved ground while showing the way from just off the rail, came under urging when feeling the threat from
WHISKARITA into the stretch, was under pressure throughout the stretch and was able to hold on. WHISKARITA allowed to settle early, took closer order
from along the rail, waited briefly on the final turn then shifted out, but was unable to get by after a game attempt. GO MAMA saved ground while in striking
position, and lacked a kick that was needed. GRIGORO trailed early, then raced wide through the backstretch, circled wide at the head of the lane, and
rallied belatedly. WITT'S TENNY TEN reserved off the early pacesetters, and rallied late. HENRY'S GAMBLE chased five wide, and tired. FRAN FROM
PERU was outrun early then retreated.

LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR raced five to six wide leaving the opening turn, shadowed the leader while two to three wide, overtook the advantage into the
stretch and moved off under a sturdy hand ride. SHARP DRESSED BEAU vied outside for the lead, contended the early pace leaving the first turn, was
joined by LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR but lacked the rally that was needed. UPO held position near the back early, pursued four wide in the backstretch and
finished up third with determination. BACKSTREET BOBBY pressed four wide early, chased inside, and gave way. LONESOME CAT checked inside early,
dropped back into the backstretch, and finished evenly. SMARTY RIVER PANTS was under a snug hold early while in traffic through the opening turn, and
chased to no avail under encouragement. ESCROW STYLE trailed, lacked room at the head of the stretch, and flattened. MAGICAL LADY was in traffic
early, chased four wide, and wilted. LIGHTENING ANNA offered little.

PERDITION contested the early pace inside of CASHLINGS, gained a short advantage into the far turn, was under attack while between rivals, turned back
the challengers late, and inched clear. CLUB CHAMP took back when crowded into the backstretch, lacked room into the final turn, lodged bid inside when
seam opened up, and was along for place. CASHLINGS contended the early pace, rallied three wide under urging, and was bested late. TUCKER TIME
lagged early, shifted outside leaving the backstretch, and closed well but was in traffic late. CARSON'S LEGACY chased inside and lacked running room
late. DUNE D'ORO raced three wide into the opening turn, dropped back leaving the backstretch, and offered a late mild bid. BROWNING ISLAND sat in
striking position while four to five wide, prompted three wide into the far turn, and faltered in the stretch. EXPLODE failed to threaten. ADRIEN'S AURORA
raced in close quarters leaving the opening turn, and was unable to improve position.

Footnotes
AL REICHERT sat in striking distance while four wide, moved up alongside BRODY'S PAL to challenge the front, dueled through the stretch, and narrowly
prevailed. BRODY'S PAL hurried inside, went in pursuit of the leader, gained a slim lead then was soon joined by AL REICHERT, dueled inside then
weakened in the final strides. BIG BAD INTAGLIO unhurried early, advanced quickly inside nearing the final turn, and was long late for show. SPOT ON
DUDE chased the pacesetters while three to four wide, and was outkicked for third. BOBS BUDDY showed the way into the backstretch, was overtaken and
gave way. VANTASTICCANAVERAL lodged a mild late bid. YES NO MAYBE SO passed tiring rivals. DADDY'S PEPPER fanned four wide leaving the
opening turn, and tired early. PADDYS ROCKET outrun throughout.
