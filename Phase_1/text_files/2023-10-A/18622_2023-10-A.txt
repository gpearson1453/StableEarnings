into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under late threat and held safe coming out slightly nearing the finish. CANDY
LOVER stumbled at the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick
latching on the leader as she hit the wire. BENTO broke out at the start coming together with BEFORE YOU GO GO and forcing PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD
to steady in between and behind, showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the
turn, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show
honors. BEFORE YOU GO GO broke in at the start brushing with the aforementioned foe and forcing PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD to steady between, chased
four then three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down angled five wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late
stages. TRUE MYTH chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, improved position
passing tired rivals. EXPERIMENTAL chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD got pinched at the start and was forced to steady when rivals on each side broke her way, conceded
three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride chasing four to five paths off the inside early on, tucked three then two wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch and weakened.

KING JAMES three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong
and was just up by a sliver on the wire. CHARGING showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was nailed in the very last jump to the finish. WAR
TERMINATOR chased along the inside, struck the temporary fence near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. VOLKERT chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, kept on under a drive but was outfinished in the late stages. BUCKORTWO chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN broke out brushing the off side stall at the start,
chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. OCTOPUS coaxed from
the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered no response. MAJESTIC JOHNSON
