Footnotes
ANTHONY'S ROCKET chased in the five path, was under right handed encouragement in the two path midway around the turn, angled out to the six path
while rallying into the final furlong, and drew past the inner pacesetter in the final strides. GARY'S FLYING LION set the pace in the three path, kicked away
after a right handed cue turning into the stretch, but began to shorten stride going into the final sixteenth, and was caught late by a surging outer foe to
place. REDISUR rated in the two path, was driven from the rail around the turn, and mildly stayed on from the two path in the stretch for show. CALLIHOO
prompted the pace in the five path, was put to a ride in the three path midway around the turn, but faded form the five path in the stretch. DONTONIO
always trailed around the two to three paths.

Footnotes
ALE'S GIFT stalked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, took the lead leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear. ON THE DOT set the
pace along the rail and yielded leaving the sixteenth pole. GULLFAXI pressed the pace two wide between foes, could not match strides with the top two
nearing the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and kept on to hold the show. OPUS broke slowly, trailed inside and rallied through the lane. DADDY'S
PIGEON hopped at the start and never threatened while racing four wide. FONTINA steadied early, chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the
quarter pole, drifted out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under a hand ride and had no closing bid.

Footnotes
CAJUN HOPE broke out at the start, stalked inside, bid under a drive between foes midway around the turn, led while tipping out to the four path into the
stretch, and dug in to hold on. SMOKIN BOW raced off the pace in the four path, ranged up in the five path around the turn, bid going into the stretch, but
hung for place. UNCAPTURED STAR was fractious in the gate, set the pace in the two path, was roused into the turn, began to fade going into the stretch,
but held show. TIK TOKABLE chased in the three path, had to steady between foes in the four path nearing the five-sixteenths, and did not factor. BALTIC
MULE was reluctant to load and broke thru the gate, prompted the pace in the three path, had to check between foes just past the three-eighths pole, and
was tired while getting out in upper stretch. SHAKE UP steadied at the start, and always trailed out in the six path.

Footnotes
DANCING N DIXIE rated up close inside, angled three wide entering the far turn, moved to the front three deep near the quarter pole and drew off under a
drive. LETS GO KOKO raced off the pace two wide, tipped out turning for home and ran on to be clearly second best. CLASSIC BALLAD steadied while in
tight between foes around the first turn, pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch, bid between foes midway around the far turn, briefly led near the
five-sixteenths pole but was no match from there. LLAMARADA saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. SEAT AT
THE TABLE set the pace inside and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. BETTY failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CANT STOP
DREAMING was bumped hard soon after the start, raced three wide and made little impact. SHE CAN SCAT came out and bumped soon after the start,
chased the pace three wide and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
HAY HAY PAULA trailed from the five path into the turn, was driven in the seven path around the turn, fanned out to the nine path entering the lane, rallied
down the center, and was up in the final strides. RUNAWAY BREEZE stalked in the three path, bid under a ride between foes around the turn, led while
floating out to the five path into the stretch, and ran on but was caught in the final strides by an outer foe. SOLAIR chased in the five path, ranged up
midway around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the lane, and kept on for show. LEXINATOR tracked from the rail, shifted out to the four path under
a ride turning into the lane, was herded back to the rail nearing the final sixteenth, and finished evenly. DRINKS ON ME rated in the two path, had to steady
going into the turn, was driven into the six path entering the stretch, angled inwards passing the eighth pole, but evened out. FOR EVER OURS raced off
the pace along the rail but made no impact. DANCING DOLL raced in midpack between foes in the four path, but had to steady going into the turn, and did
not threaten. RAW HONEY set the pace in the two path but gaveway turning into the lane.

Footnotes
EXTENDO set the pace in the three path, opened up under a nudge in the two path around the turn, and extended that advantage from the three path down
the lane under a drive. NO NAME DUDE settled up close in the five path, was roused in the three path midway around the turn, tipped back out to the five
path entering the stretch, and chased on for place. WOW WISH stalked in the four path, was ridden in the two path turning into the stretch, and was one
paced for show. BEGANINGREENPOINT had an awkward start, chased in the two path, tipped out under drive around the turn, swung from the six path into
the lane, but flattened. MARLEY LUCK was behind in the three path, ridden between foes in the four path around the turn, but made no impact. GRAND
BEY raced off the pace in the four path but never threatened.

Footnotes
HOW BOUT DAT settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, seized command leaving the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a
drive. FOR THE THRILL tracked the pace from the rail, got through inside of foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the winner in
the final furlong but stayed on well to be clearly second best. GHOST FORCE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes
nearing the five-sixteenths pole, briefly led but was no match in the lane. CHERU shied in early and was forced to check, raced off the pace five wide and
never threatened. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT was reluctant to load, was very rank at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. D CITY GIRL was bumped
at the start and never involved while racing two wide. STARSHIP DYNASTY hit the starting gate, chased the pace four wide and came up empty. MRS.
CASH MAN set the pace in the two path and retreated after a half.
