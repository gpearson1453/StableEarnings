Footnotes
TEASPOON OF PEPPER chased the leaders to the backstretch, offered a bid leaving the three eighths along the rail, swung out for room into the stretch
and rallied smartly to win going away. GALWALKSINTOABAR contested the pace outside of HYPHY, inched away from that one briefly nearing the second
turn then could not stall the winner but hung onto the place. HYPHY dueled from the rail, kept pressure on GALWALKSINTOABAR to the second turn then
was outkicked through the drive. SWISS SCRIPT chased the pace three wide for a half mile then lacked the needed late response. GREAT CURVES was
outside of SWISS SCRIPT and four wide while trailing then came up empty when roused. CAL'S GIRL tracked the leaders for three eighths then gave way.

WHISKEYJACK stalked the pace early then raced to the front when TRES VITE bore out, edged away on the second turn and held driving. TRES VITE
hustled to the front but bore out six wide into the backstretch, pressed the winner three wide to the stretch but did not threaten. ROJO PEQUENO chased
the top two, advanced inside on the second turn and was making up a bit of ground late. SHOT OF BRANDY lugged out on the first turn, was corrected,
settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. PASS THE CROWN was chasing to the three eighths then
saved ground but also did not rally. LIL BIT OF HEAVEN bore out on the first turn and put in a dull effort.

CABALLERANGO never far back, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled into the stretch then battled gamely to prevail. RODEO ROSE broke out sharply, was
corrected but had no speed, bid three wide to the stretch then closed steadily to grab the place. SKEESIX prompted the pace early, took over when
NORTHERN BLEND bolted, responded to mid stretch then was bested late. CORAZON DE LUCIA had no speed, trailed to the second turn then saved
ground to the stretch and closed a bit late. NORTHERN BLEND hustled to the front but bolted on the backstretch, was pulled up but crossed the wire.
BEING A BOSS tracked the pace two wide then drifted out slightly on the second turn, clipped heels with RODEO ROSE, fell then was walked off. The
stewards conducted an inquiry into the accident but made no change.

MADAME CAUSEWAY had good speed, dueled two wide then kicked away into the second turn and edged away under steady urging. ZEPHYR CAT
stalked the leaders, was roused three wide into the far turn then was no threat to the winner but gamely was along for second. SIXINTHECITY attended the
pace inside the winner but was outkicked on the second turn and did not rally. SAINT HELEN was four wide early, chased three wide to the stretch but
lacked a closing response. UNLIMITED GLORY tracked the pace early then saved ground to no avail. JUST PIN ME broke slow and veered outward then
was always outrun. MANUELS TABLE had no speed was never a threat. SERAPHIMZALE was through early. BELLAREIGN was away slowly then refused
to stride out, was pulled up shortly after the start and walked off.

SEQUOIA settled mid pack, was roused two wide into the far turn, swung widest then closed steadily. PULPITS POWER was outsprinted, chased to the
stretch the second turn, bid three wide, rallied to be along to duel furl the lead into the stretch but was outkicked late. MASHHAD FLATS prompted the pace,

Footnotes
CODE CHARLIE pushed to the front, widened on the backstretch and was kept to task to the line. D K'S CROWN was outsprinted, bid three wide to the
stretch then was not a threat but bested the others. SIR LAUGHALOT chased the winner, was outkicked down the backstretch and lost the place late.
SPIRE had no speed, saved ground but did not threaten. MASTER RECOVERY also had no speed, was two wide and lacked a late response. HAKUNUI
tracked the winner in the early stages then got outkicked and weakened in the final furlong. MOLAF was always outrun. WHOS DALLINS DADDY pressed
the pace for almost three eighths then tired and gave way.

Footnotes
RAAJIN RIBBON had good speed, dueled for three eighths, inched away on the second turn then held driving. DANNY MICHAEL was well placed, bid two
wide to the stretch then was making a run inside late. ANNA'S IRON MAN dueled the winner to the second turn, responded two wide to loom a threat into
the stretch but finished evenly. CONTINUE ON VICTOR was outrun early, bid three wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response.
HASHTAG BAE contested the pace for a half mile then saved ground but weakened in the drive. HYDROGEN was four wide to the backstretch, settled to
the second turn, tried to rally two wide but came up empty. FORT YORK drifted five wide to the backstretch then was never a threat. HAWK HILL drifted out
also to the backstretch and trailed throughout.
