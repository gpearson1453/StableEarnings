Footnotes
SUIKO broke in a tangle and was off slow, tracked the pace two wide, then shifted out three wide by the three eighths marker, then moved to the inside on
the turn and came under coaxing, then cut the corner and closed well up the inside to get up to prevail under a drive. CHALK HILL was well placed on the
inside, saved ground to the quarter pole, then eased out and made a four wide bid off the turn, went on even terms by the furlong marker and took over
leaving the furlong marker but was out-kicked by the winner to just miss. RAINBOW TROUT vied for the lead on the outside on the first turn, then dueled for
command on the far turn two to three wide, made a three wide bid off the turn but could not sustain that bid late, faded while besting the rest.
LONDONDERRY was bumped and then stumbled shortly after the start, then was reserved on the first turn, angled out in the drive and had a late kick to
gain the last spot in the superfecta. BLIND SIGHT vied for the early lead three wide and in between rivals, then fell off the pace and chased the pace three
wide on the turn, then weakened in the drive. CALYPSO GHOST vied for the early lead on the inside, then dueled for the lead on the inside on the turn,
came two wide off the turn and weakened the final furlong. CICI UNIFIED vied for the lead two wide and in between rivals and stopped. The rider on number
four LONDONDERRY CLAIMED FOUL against the number six RAINBOW TROUT for alleged interference after the start despite being nowhere near that
rival, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was not allowed and the race was left as is.

Footnotes
BELLA FAST set the early pace on the inside while clear, then kicked away leaving the turn and widened the margin while being show the crop in the
furlong grounds, ridden out. NAVANI stalked the winner and was two wide on the turn, proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best.
WILPIC was reserved early, three wide by the quarter pole, then showed some late kick to gain the show award between rivals. SOFSTER chased the pace
four wide, then came five wide into the lane and faded missing the show award. KAPADOKYA chased the early pace five wide, made a four to three wide
bid on the turn, drifted in through the lane and weakened. IRON PYRITE tracked the early pace two wide and stopped. WHITE HEAT was off a step slow,
then hustled up the rail to chase the pace and then tired. HIGHLADY was bumped and off a step slow, then was not a factor.

AFERDITA set the early pace on the inside, was well handled and kicked away leaving the turn, then drew off to prove much the best, driving.
WATERWORKS stalked the early pace towards the inside, made a two wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner, second best. GRAND
ARROW was rated along three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole to be in contention, then drifted out leaving the turn and flattened out, held
show award. PARTY MONSTER was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. LUCKY LORRAINE was reserved early, three wide on the turn, swung
out five wide and had no rally. COLLIN'S GREY LADY stalked the pace three wide and tired. MY BOSS LADY threw head at the start while off a step slow,
raced on the inside while reserved, roused by the three eighths marker and had no response.

Footnotes
WILD ARMY BRAT stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, took over off the turn and drew clear by the furlong marker, then
maintained a safe margin to prove best, driving. BLUEBERRY INDYGO was rated early and was between rivals on the tun, came three wide into the lane,
finished well and was gaining late, second best. MOONSHINING was settled early on the inside, moved out on the turn and came seven wide into the lane
and had a late rally to gain the show award. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT was reserved early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated
rally. ASUE was fractious in the gate, reserved on the inside, came three wide into the lane, then checked and had to alter course to avoid the fallen rider at
the three sixteenth marker, then finished willingly. SECRET WISPER set th early pace, then was headed leaving the turn and came in by the three
sixteenths and weakened. ANIMAL PRINCESS chased the pace four wide and weakened. TRULY AMBITIOUS chased the pace on the inside and had no
rally. HONEYCAMP was settled two wide and dropped back on the turn and had no response. HOPEFUL CURE was settled back early, steadied and
moved out by the three eighths marker, then had no rally. LADY LANCER was off a step slow, then checked by the three eighths marker and never
threatened. DAHGO was well placed on the inside, cut the corner leaving the turn and then clipped heels when the pace setter came in, then stumbled and
lost the rider, walked off. There was a STEWARDS INQUIRY into the rinning in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
SECRET WISPER from sixth and placed her eleventh for interference around the three sixteenths marker.

NOTHINGMAKESENSE was void of early speed, advanced on the outside on the turn, came wide into the lane and closed full of run to draw away in the
final sixteenth to prove much the best, drivng. REBEL CONSORT was reserved early on the inside, angled out by the quarter pole for racing room, came
five wide into the lane, rallied well but could not go with the winner. ISTRIA stalked the pace three wide, made a two wide bid to draw clear by the quarter
pole, then faded the final furlong, bested rest. CHEZ SOLEIL was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide by the half mile marker, made a three wide bid
on the turn but weakened in the lane. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT passed the tiring rivals. LOOKIN AT KISSES had a four wide pursuit down the backstretch, then
was two wide on the far turn and weakened. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY was settled early and lacked a rally. FILTERED LIGHT was reserved three wide and
had no response. ENCHANTMENT (FR) chased the pace in between rivals and tired. NEWTON'S STAR (IRE) was off slowly and was not a factor.
MARVELETTE was keen early and crossed over to the inside to set a fast pace, then gave way in the lane. INCONTROVERTIBLE chased the pace on the
inside and stopped on the turn.

CAIRO SUGAR stalked the pace two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command, then had a long drive in the lane and was bumped by
HAZARDOUS HUMOR by the sixteenth marker and was resurgent to prevail late. HAZARDOUS HUMOR stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on
the turn, gained a short lead off the turn, came in by the sixteenth marker and bumped the winner and then hung late to just miss. RAGTIME BELLE was
allowed to settle on the inside, shifted out off the turn and split rivals by the furlong marker and finished willingly to gain the show award. CRYPTO MAMA
chased the pace four wide on the first turn, then dropped to be two to three wide on the far turn but had no kick, missed show award. KINGDOM QUEEN
was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace five wide and in between rivals, then was four wide on the far turn but lacked the needed winning bid.
BABA set the pace on the inside and weakened. GAMESTONKS was six wide into the first turn, then had a wide pursuit and tired. The trainer of number
three HAZARDOUS HUMOR claimed foul against the winner for interference in the lane, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION was
not allowed and the race was left as is.
