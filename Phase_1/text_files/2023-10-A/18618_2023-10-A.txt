KINGSVILLE settled close up inside, slipped through to the front just after passing the quarter pole then quickly drew away in the stretch. MR. EINSTEIN
stalked the dueling leaders three wide, bid into the stretch but was second best. SHANE'S JEWEL set a measured pace, vied throughout the final turn and
weakened. THE ANGRY MAN trailed for five furlongs then passed a stopping rival. MONTAUK SUMMER forced the pace outside to the final turn and
stopped abruptly.

and continued willingly to earn the place. QUEEN CADENCE chased three wide, went after the winner on the turn then tired. CLASSY SADIE prompted
winner down the backstretch then faltered on the turn. SNAPPY RIDE raced off the leaders outside and lacked a rally. ISABELLA SMILE dropped well
behind then moved wide in the stretch. LULINDA'S HEART dropped back early and was never in contention. BRODY SLAM weakened steadily while trailing
throughout.

Footnotes
BEE BY THE SEA came out bumping rival into the first turn, set the pace, lost the lead at the quarter pole then came again in the final furlong to gain the
decision. HARD STING rated at the back of pack, commenced his rally on the final turn and closed well too late. ET'S MAGIC MAN rallied three wide to the
front at the quarter pole, held a clear lead in midstretch but weakened. CELTIC TREASURE lacked speed, made a menacing bid on the final turn then
flattened out. MORE THAN A DANCE reserved off the leaders, moved very wide into the stretch and was no threat. CUPID'S DART hustled close up inside,
was asked for run on the final turn but faded. BOOM BOOM KABOOM prompted the winner three wide early then faltered on the final turn.

advanced on the tur then proved second best. LIBERTY RUNNER lagged far behind then offered wide late energy. AYE raced off the pace inside and
continued willingly. CONNECTING moved close up inside for half a mile, angled out and flattened. HOLY CITY raced three wide between rivals down
backstretch and faded. OMERTA CODE lagged very far behind and was always outrun. REX KWON DO set a clear pace in hand then stopped abruptly.
