Footnotes
EDDIE CROSSWIRE was forwardly placed away from the start and tracked the pace four wide and between runners, maintained that four wide position
along the turn, came four wide into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a quick move into deep stretch, confronted DRUMADOON inside of the
sixteenth-marker, surged past the runner-up in the final strides and held in a drive to prevail. DRUMADOON stalked the solid early pace while outside of
STORMY JOE, pressed the pacesetter from the three path to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and took a narrow lead at the furlong
marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from EDDIE CROSSWIRE and was outfinished for the win in the final strides, while
holding safely for second. STORMY JOE showed good early speed away from the start and dictated terms early on, set the pace from the two path along
the turn and was pressed to the quarter marker, felt pressure into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, weakened in deep stretch and just held for
third. ONE LITTLE INDIAN rated off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the turn, mounted an inside rally into the stretch, could not sustain that
run into the final furlong, flattened out and just missed for third. CALARI BLUECAT raced close to the solid early pace while widest, came five wide into the
turn, lost ground while four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and tired. SPLIT ACES tracked the early pace while three wide and
between runners, lost ground on the turn while two wide, dropped back into the stretch and gave way. PER THE HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND
WELFARE UNIT, ONE LITTLE INDIAN HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BIG BENO settled off of the disputed early pace and tracked from the rail into the first turn, raced closest to the leading pair through the backstretch run,
was roused three wide approaching the quarter marker and vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with SGT POWELL to the furlong grounds, shook
free of that rival into deep stretch and pulled away under a hand ride in the final sixteenth. COOPERKLIMT bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly,
settled in the two path into the first turn and was content to trail through the backstretch, was steered outside of rivals into the far turn and gained ground
heading to the quarter pole, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the final stages but closed well and held safely in
the end for second. WRONG SPOT settled in the second flight away from the gate, raced three wide into the backstretch and tracked to the half-mile
marker, mounted a three wide bid along the far turn and came within aim at the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch, was not able to keep pace with the
top two in the final furlong and ran on in deep stretch to claim third. SGT POWELL was sent after an alert beginning, was engaged by G'S LAST CHANCE
in the early stages and contested a solid pace with that rival, disputed decent fractions while clear of the others through the backstretch run, came back to
the field along the far turn, shook free of G'S LAST CHANCE into upper stretch, battled with BIG BENO to the furlong marker, could not muster a response
in deep stretch and tired in the late stages. G'S LAST CHANCE was prominent leaving the start, engaged with SGT POWELL into the first turn and
contested the pace with that rival into the backstretch run, disputed the decent pace with SGT POWELL to the half-mile pole, continued to duel into the far
turn, lost position into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. LOVE OF THE SPORT was bumped leaving the start
and was away a step slowly, settled along the inside into the first turn, made a middle move to track the contested pace heading to the half-mile marker,
advanced while two wide along the far turn, could not match strides with oncoming rivals into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BLEVYS TIGER was forwardly placed away from the start, took back just off of the fast early pace and tracked into the turn, was roused along the bend and
loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, responded to urging at the furlong grounds and drew away while under
moderate urging in the final sixteenth. CHARLENE'S DREAM made contact with VINOS ANGEL at the start and was away a step slowly, chased the solid
early pace while inside of a rival and came two wide into the turn, improved position along the turn then waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch,
angled five wide into the lane, lost a bit of ground at the furlong marker, rallied while widest into deep stretch, could not reel in the winner in the final stages
and bested the rest. BROADWAY TIGER was away in good order and contested the solid early pace with UNION COACH, disputed the fast pace from the
inside through the turn, chased BLEVYS TIGER to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the top two in deep stretch, weakened and just held for third.
LUSMA was prominent away from the gate, took back off of the fast early pace and tracked outside of rivals into the turn, mounted a four wide bid heading
to the quarter marker, maintained that four wide path into the stretch and lost a bit of ground at the furlong pole, lacked a response in the late stages,
flattened out and just missed for third. VINOS ANGEL made contact with CHARLENE'S DREAM at the start then was shuffled back a bit leaving the break
and was off a step slowly, settled off of the fast early pace, chased three wide to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch. UNION COACH was
asked for speed away from the start, engaged with BROADWAY TIGER and disputed fast fractions into the turn, continued to duel for pace duties along the
bend and carved out fast fractions while two wide and between runners at the quarter pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DADS DREAM was forwardly placed leaving the break and stalked the solid early pace, tracked from the rail along the turn and was well placed at the
quarter marker, tipped two wide into upper stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, confronted AUTISM PUZZLE inside of the sixteenth-pole, battled
with that rival into the final yards, surged approaching the wire and was up in time to prevail. AUTISM PUZZLE traded bumps with ALPINE SERMON at the
start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and was sent to establish the early lead, set solid fractions from the rail into the turn, carved out a quick pace to the
quarter marker and was set down in upper stretch, held a safe lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task under firm urging to the sixteenth-pole, met the
bid of DADS DREAM in deep stretch, grudgingly gave way in the final strides and held for second at the finish. MR. DREAMCYCLE raced forwardly leaving
the break, was a bit hard to place in the early running and settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and
gained ground at the furlong marker, responded to urging into deep stretch and rallied four wide in the final sixteenth, just missed for second at the finish
and was up in the final strides to secure third. CORAL CAT was prominent leaving the start and stalked the solid early pace, kept close attendance to the
pace along the turn while two wide, was guided three wide into the stretch and chased AUTISM PUZZLE to mid-stretch, could not muster the needed
response in the final sixteenth, was outfinished and was just edged for third at the wire. DRUM BUNNY settled off of the solid early pace, was steered two
wide into the turn and improved position at the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and continued that bid to the furlong grounds, lacked the
needed response in deep stretch and finished evenly. ALPINE SERMON traded bumps with AUTISM PUZZLE at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled
off of the solid early pace and trailed into the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, was not able to threaten in the final furlong but showed good late
interest. HALF THROTTLE broke alertly, was prominent away from the gate and raced close to the solid early pace while outside of rivals, came three wide
into the turn and lost ground heading to the quarter marker, slipped to the inside in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally.

Footnotes
LOVE CANDY was a bit slow into stride away from the gate, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from the inside, came in a bit tight approaching the
turn and steadied nearing the three-furlong pole, angled out heading to the quarter marker and was roused four wide into the stretch, made a mild advance
at the furlong marker, closed determinedly while outside of rivals into deep stretch, wore down rivals in the final yards and was up in time for the win.
LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, tracked the solid early pace while three deep and was well positioned into the
turn, stalked TRIP TO SPAIN to the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded to urging in the lane and
rallied into deep stretch, vied between rivals in the final yards and just missed for the win at the finish, while just getting up for second. TRIP TO SPAIN was
asked to show speed away from the start and assumed command in the early running, set a pressured pace into the turn, shook free along the bend and
carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, showed the way into upper stretch and held a safe lead to the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final
sixteenth, was all out to hold off oncoming rivals in the final strides and was gamely bested at the finish, while clear of the rest for third. TORPEDO AWAY
was squeezed at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the quick early pace and was steered two wide into the turn, came four wide into the
stretch and offered a mild late rally. TOP EXECUTIVE showed early speed and contested the solid early pace, lost position into the turn, was well placed
while saving ground approaching the furlong pole, saved ground to the top of the stretch and lacked a rally in the final stages. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD
tracked the solid early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide into the turn, swung to the five path into the stretch and did not offer a response in the
late stages.

Footnotes
IL CAPITANO broke alertly and sped to the early lead, drew to a clear advantage into the first turn and set decent fractions through the backstretch run
while well handled, had the margin cut into along the far turn and felt mild pressure nearing the top of the lane, kept to task into the stretch and held foes at
bay to the furlong marker, extended the lead under steady urging into deep stretch, dug in in the final sixteenth and held safely for the win at the finish.
CHIEF JACKSON was forwardly placed leaving the start, saved ground into the first turn and tracked the decent early pace from the rail, advanced along
the backstretch run, saved all of the ground to the far turn and continued to gain at the quarter marker, raced in tight into the stretch, was not able to reel in
the winner in the late stages and won the nod for second at the wire. DICK BEST bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered and was
forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run, gained ground while two wide along the far turn, chased IL
CAPITANO into the stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the late stages, was outfinished and was just edged for second at the finish, while
clear of the rest for third. WARD 'N JERRY settled in the second flight, saved ground into the backstretch run and was well placed heading to the half-mile
pole, made a steady gain while two wide along the far turn, continued that steady gain into the stretch, could not sustain his bid into deep stretch and
flattened out. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the quarter marker, angled three wide nearing mid-stretch, gained
ground at the furlong marker, lacked the needed response in the final sixteenth and was outkicked. RIJEKA (IRE) settled in the second flight away from the
gate, tracked outside of a rival along the first turn and was guided three wide into the backstretch, came in a bit tight and raced in traffic at the half-mile pole,
continued to race in tight entering the far turn, found room nearing the quarter pole and came two wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds
and could not muster a late response. WILL IS CHILL was fractious prior to the start and was pinched back leaving the break, was unhurried into the first
turn, raced three wide into the backstretch run, trailed into the second turn and did not factor in the drive. UNUSUAL CODE was forwardly placed in the
early running, tracked the decent pace while outside of rivals and raced three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground at the half-mile marker,
continued that advance while three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MY YAMMY LADY broke out a bit at the start, was crowded by a neighboring rival and was away a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages and saved
ground into the turn, made a mild advance at the quarter marker and tipped two wide into the stretch, improved position at the furlong pole, closed with a
rush into deep stretch, determinedly split rivals into the final yards and was up in the final strides to earn a game win. A ROUSING BABE took back off of the
fast early pace and tracked from the second flight, improved position on the turn while three then four wide, continued that bid into the stretch and came
within aim at the furlong marker, rallied five wide in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while just getting up to secure the place. STRANGE
ADDICTION tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, gained ground on the turn while two then three wide, raced four wide into the stretch and
continued that advance at mid-stretch, angled to the six path into the final sixteenth, came out a path in the final yards, surged at the finish and just missed
for the win and place, while just earning the nod for the show. BIG SIS LITTLE SIS raced close to the solid early pace, advanced into the turn and pressed
the quick pace while two wide heading to the quarter pole, was steered three wide into the stretch and lost a bit of ground heading to the furlong marker,
re-rallied into deep stretch, came in very tight while vying between rivals and just missed. RAFANELLI bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly,
recovered and tracked the solid pace from the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, shifted back to the rail into
deep stretch, closed well along the inside in the final sixteenth and just missed. SHE'S INTHEARMYNOW crowded a neighboring rival a bit leaving the start,
was hustled away from the start, showed good early speed and set a fast pace while clear into the turn, carved out solid fractions to the quarter marker, was
kept to task into the stretch and extended the lead at the furlong marker, was all out to hold off a cavalry charge of rivals in deep stretch and was tagged in
the final strides. SWEET LAYLA RAE was away in good order and took back off of the fast early pace, came two wide into the turn, swung five wide into the
stretch, mounted an outside bid into the final sixteenth, came within aim in the final yards and altered course in the shadow of the wire. LAURA BRANIGAN
chased the fast early pace while outside of rivals, raced four wide to the quarter pole, came six wide into the stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong.
BOBBY'S GENIE was prominent in the early running and raced close to the fast early pace, saved ground into the turn and gave chase to the quarter pole,
dropped back into the stretch and tired.

TOPANTICIPATION (GB) seized the lead quickly when uncontested, set easy fractions while always traveling well, quickened away on cue at the top of the
stretch, opened up on the field and cruised to a handy victory. RIVETING SPIRIT unhurried from the break and settled near the rear of the field, bided time
on the inside through the far turn, angled out near the quarter pole and found a seam for clear run three wide into the stretch, produced a bold rally but came
up short. DOWNBURST settled right behind and stalked TOPANTICIPATION (GB) to the stretch, tried to make a run and that one before the quarter pole,
had that bid rebuffed, continued to run on well to the wire but was passed late for second. BUSKER ALLIE was a bit keen and hard to place going into the
first turn racing near the rail, settled down after a quarter mile racing near the back of the field, saved ground to the far turn, took an inside path into the
stretch and was making up some ground in the later stages while never a threat. DRAMATIZER was not asked for speed from the break, raced mid-pack
two wide to the half, got a good trip through the far turn then swung five wide into the stretch with some momentum but could not produce the needed finish
to threaten. DRAW ME broke a beat slow then was held up going into the far turn, raced two wide near the rear of the field down the backstretch, made a
tepid rally through the far turn but could not make an impact. BESTRELLA (IRE) pulled hard on the rider through the first turn, was able to get a ground
saving trip through the first half, remained in contention to the top of the stretch then weakened before the furlong marker.

Footnotes
BALLROOM PRINCE allowed to settle mid-pack early, rated nicely through the first half, made steady forward progress through the far turn while saving
ground along the inside, awaited room to the quarter pole then slipped through a hole in the two path into the stretch, took command passing the eighth pole
and drew away. UPRIGHT broke well and was immediately pushed to get to the front, led the field to the far turn with several in close pursuit, responded
when roused at the half-mile marker, came out of the last turn with a short lead, tried battle back when challenged by BALLROOM PRICE but was unable to
match strides but held the place. LAURA'S KIDOUGH veered out at the break and bumped hard into UNCLE DUSAN, straightened then took a position in
the middle of the pack through the first quarter, started to move forward and improve position coming out of the clubhouse turn, pulled the rider up close to
the leaders near the five furlong marker, steadied briefly before the seven-sixteenths pole then steadied again passing the three-eighths marker, made a
three wide bid for the lead at the top of the stretch, could not keep up with the top pair but was able to hold third. PLAYBOY STYLE got forward position and
a good run through the first turn tracking UPRIGHT while racing four to five wide throughout, rallied into contention through the far turn, came into the stretch
fanned out to the five path, lugged in at the top of the stretch into the path of a rival, and finished with some late energy but came up short of a minor award.
UNCLE DUSAN was slammed into by LAURA'S KIDDOUGH after the break and was last into the clubhouse turn, improve position down the backstretch,
moved into serious contention through the far turn then weakened passing the three-sixteenths and hand nothing to offer in the stretch. YOU ENJOY
MYSELF flashed some speed but got caught three deep going into the first turn, was five deep down the backstretch tracking the pacesetter, made a wide
run through the far turn then started to lose ground passing the three furlong marker and was no factor from that point. SON OF SHANGHAI stayed to the
inside and tracked the early leaders on the rail through the first turn, moved out to the two path for the backstretch run, stalked the pacesetter to the far turn,
got stuck behind horses from the five-sixteenths pole then had to steady and alter course at the top of the stretch and could not recover. HOLY SMOKES
settled behind, raced three deep into the first turn, attempted to rally in the far turn but was unable to improve position. HE'S DOUBLETROUBLE got hung
five wide through the first turn, struggled to keep contact with the field and was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.
