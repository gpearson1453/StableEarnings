for the early lead, racing outside around the first turn, made a bid, drove clear down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner. VIOLENT CITY
dueled on the front end, saved ground and proved no match for the top two. G'S STORM raced evenly in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and was
gaining on VIOLENT CITY for the show position. XANTHUS WRATH raced evenly near the back, improved position, while finishing wide, but was no factor.
MAJESTIC MANDATE raced in the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. HALF A BUCK lacked early speed and was never a
factor. SHADY GRADY broke sharp, dropped back and was no threat late. CLERIC void of early speed and was never close. MR LIBERTY showed early

Footnotes
G VICTORY challenged on the front end, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. MR B QUIET unhurried in the early going, moved up
on the inside around the second turn, angled out down the stretch, split rivals, swung back toward the rail and finished willingly. UNFATHOMED raced within
contention, came around the final turn three wide, raced close throughout and was outfinished for second. TAPPIN FORA DANCE raced evenly near the
back in the beginning, made a mild bid, but was no factor. COOLCROSS raced in the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. THE
GREEN MO'STER raced in the middle of the field and never mounted a bid. QUANA DUDE lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide and
showed little. OUTLAW X. raced within contention and made a steady retreat. INCORRIGIBLE went to the front, drove clear and dropped back. DUE
APEAL always raced in the back and was outrun.
