Footnotes
QUANTUM THEORY broke sharply setting the pace through the turn angling out in upper stretch holding under a drive. BOURBON TALKING stalked the
pace chasing on the turn being carried out in upper stretch hanging late. OMEGA GOLD tracked the pace through the turn extending into upper stretch
lacking surge there hanging on to posiiton. CHASING A PAYDAY slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch finishing evenly. JOYRIDE slow early lagged
to lane passing tired ones there. KALINBA played no factor. CAPONE'S LOFT was never involved. OCEAN KISS raced evenly tiring in upper stretch.
YDOUHAVETOBESOMEAN was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF BOURBON TALKING AGAINST THE RIDER OF QUANTUM
THEORY FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
