Footnotes
JUBAY pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, dug in determinedly to take the nod mid-stretch and eked out the
advantage over DE'S CASTLE through the final sixteenth. The latter set a pressured pace and contested the edge two deep on the turn, dug in gamely from
the head of the lane but reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. KING OF LUCK chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out
leaving the turn and dug in to take third the final yards. WINDSOR'S STAR gave chase, raced four wide on the turn and was outfinished for third later yards.
ROCKING TO HOME chased inside, was ridden apprehensively approaching the five sixteenths pole, resumed full stride past the pole and rounded the turn
near the rail, then flattened later yards. BOP ZAPPER pressured the early pace and raced close three wide on the turn, but weakened in the lane. IN HIGH
GEAR raced wide and never factored.

Footnotes
TIMETOGETUP gave chase toward the inside, angled five wide approaching the eighth pole, dug in leaving the turn and steadily improved to get up the
final strides. BLACK PANDA pressured the pace and raced close in the three path on the turn, dueled to a brief slim lead in later yards but was caught the
final strides. LUNATIC chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, was checked and altered course past the eighth pole and finished
well to take third the final strides. SHUTUPN'KISSME set a pressured early pace, was met at the rail toward the quarter pole and contested at a close
disadvantage through the turn, recovered the nod into the lane but was caught flattening stride later yards. CASTLE LIGHTS pressured the pace and took
the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge through the turn but was met into the lane and flattened the final sixteenth. SHE'S A
LINO chased, rounded the turn in the four path and ran evenly in the lane. MYGIDGETMARIE chased outside, raced in the six path on the turn and showed
little in the lane.

Footnotes
A LITTLE BIT CRAZY rated close off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out and took over into the
lane, dueled clear past the eighth pole and was steadily handled to hold well. PRACTICALLY THERE saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, picked
up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and steadily improved, rounded the far turn about the three path, closed for second inside the sixteenth
pole and finished well. SECRET CASTLE raced with the early pace then stalked in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and dueled through the stretch for third. BONNIE BLUETOOTH broke awkwardly then bumped outward into China
Cat and saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel
for third. SULTRY SALLY H veered outward at the break and made contact with Bonnie Bluetooth then rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward
the five sixteenths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn but was met into the lane and weakened the final sixteenth. CENTERFOLD
ANGEL settled off the rail on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and
showed little more. CHINA CAT was bumped then pinched back at the start and never factored. SUPER WILDCAT became fractious in the paddock then
veered out at the break and raced in the four path the first turn, faded past the seven sixteenths pole and was eased the final quarter mile.
