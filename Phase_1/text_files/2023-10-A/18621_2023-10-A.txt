Footnotes
BODIL always within striking distance, moved up steadily three wide through the turn, made the lead at the top of the stretch then widened the balance of
the trip to win as much the best while in hand. DANCE DRAMA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no
match for the winner. QUEENIE ROSE was antsy in the gate, steadied between rivals entering the main track and passed tiring rivals in deep stretch.
MARGARITA CINCO chased the pace two wide and faded late. HERE COMES DOLLY was no factor. OH EYE SEE settled five wide and failed to respond.
PENNY'S TREASURE had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half.

MY TWO JAKES never far back, surged three wide through the turn to make the lead at the top of the stretch then finished full of run to win as much the
best. CANELA FINA pressed the pace two wide, made the lead before the turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner while
well clear for second. MOST ADORABLE was fractious in the gate, settled with the second flight inside and improved position late two wide. NICKATYE set
a pressured pace along the inside down the backstretch, remained a sharp threat into the stretch and faded late. POLLY PRISSY PANTS failed to menace.
BOLD NICKY had speed into the turn then wilted. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN was fractious in the gate and trailed.
