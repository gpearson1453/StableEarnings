Footnotes
EYE OF GUNFIGHTER led from the start, set the pace early, and held off challengers before the last hurdle to prevail in the stretch. ICANDOTHAT tracked
the leader early, settled off the pace at one mile, bid in the stretch, and came up second best. GREYLOVER settled midpack, exchanging positions with
close competitors, made a bid before the last hurdle but couldn't maintain the pace. SECRET SOULMATE stalked the leader after one mile, gave chase
before the last hurdle and faded before the stretch. CODIGO ran just behind the leaders early, gained ground 5/8 from home, moved into the 4-path to bid
before the last hurdle, then faded. MCSTEAMY settled 4th to 5th behind the leader in early going, maintained position until fading back before the last
hurdle. ICE BAR ran off the pace, remaining well behind the lead, and was never a factor. BELLARMINE HALL ran at the back of the field and was never a
factor. ROYAL REGATTA was anxious at the start, ran at the back of the field, pulled up before the last hurdle and walked off.

Footnotes
GARRISON FOREST (IRE) broke mid pack, ran evenly throughout the race, rallied after the 9th hurdle to pass front runners and overcame the leader in the
stretch for the win. ACTIVE DUTY (FR) started mid pack, gained ground at the one mile, led before the final hurdle and at the top of the stretch, but was
outpaced in the stretch by the winner. LOOK NORTH stalked the leader through the first mile, gained the lead after 6 hurdles, and lost ground before the
last hurdle to finish third best. KARL CARES started toward the back, gained ground 5/8 from home, remained middle of the field, and surpassed his nearest
competitor in the stretch. HIGH DEFF (FR) started mid field, made a small gain to third place before the last hurdle, entered the stretch in fourth place but
was outrun by KARL CARES. VINTAGE YEAR ran out the back, made no significant gains, and was never a factor. PARQUETRY was consistently off the
pace, running middle of the field through the first mile-and-a-half then lost significant ground after the 8th hurdle. RACAVAN (IRE) started well just behind
the leaders, held ground through a mile-and-a-half, then lost ground after the 8th hurdle to ultimately finish last. I AM FORTUNATA (IRE) started well and
went out to an early lead, tracking wide around the course through the first mile, began tiring 5/8 from home, pulled up before the last hurdle and walked off.
GOSPEL WAY ran in the back of the field from the start, made a small gain after a mile-and-a-quarter, fell behind again and pulled up before last hurdle and
walked off.
