VOGELSANG between horses first turn chasing leader to the stretch, cleared. SWIGERT well rated while saving ground throughout, no match for winner.
AMATTEROFPRINCIPLE off rail trip to far turn, ran on for the show spot in the lane. CASINO ANNIE bobbled a bit at the start, quick to the front, faltered far
turn. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART broke very slowly with little chance throughout from that point. CANCERFREE KIDS tried to keep up on the backstretch
with nothing left in the final furlong. BONITA D'ORO was through early and dropped far back. FELLA'S SISTER never factored throughout. Race was hand
timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

TRAUMARAMA awkward start, regrouped quickly, rallied far turn to go well clear. ELLIE DELI hopped at the start, chased to half between horses while
proving no match for the winner. CELESTIAL SPIN a bit tardy, ran up steadily to contend with a bid into far turn for show spot. NORTHERN ALLIANCE
trailed to far turn, passed one in the stretch run. LUCKY ROAD cleared to front first turn, duel at the half, gave in readily .Race was hand timed due to a bad
sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

improve position stretch. MONEY PIT never menaced throughout. HEY RAY chased to the half with nothing left from far turn, faded back. MAMBA TWENTY
FOUR inside speed to the front stayed to the half, gave in readily. TORNADO BOY was pinballed and steadied back at the start, rushed inside but was
through after half and dropped far back readily.
