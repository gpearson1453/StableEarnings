Footnotes
AUNT OPAL sent clear, continued clear under a strong aggressive ride, entered turn clear, drifted out in upper stretch, kept to task and held rivals safely at
bay. ISLAND LIFE stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn swung widest into the lane, rallied well in the seven path to get
up for second at the wire. FLASHY PASS chased clear leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, angled in when winner drifted
out in upper stretch, gained and flattened out final hundred yards and was nailed for second at the final jump. ROCK N ROLL SONG away cleanly, had to
take up sharply when QUEEN VERRAZANO lugged out, settled into stride midway through the backstretch, took the turn in the two path, split rivals entering
the lane and kept on gamely while being outclosed. QUEEN VERRAZANO broke in, lugged out three paths early and caused ROCK N ROLL SONG to take
up, went back along the inside for the turn, eased out and angled out four wide into the lane, made mild progress until flattening out the final sixteenth.
CROWN KITTEN away cleanly, settled off the pace and along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and failed to respond in the
lane.

Footnotes
NENE ROMANO dueled for the lead along the inside on the backstretch, continued to duel on the turn, entered lane holding a slim margin, summoned all
she had and refused to be denied in a gallant effort. RUN AUNTIE T RUN dueled two wide throughout, kept on gamely and just could not get by the game
winner. B B GUN BULLSEYE sat off a duel two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched bid three wide and made mild progress
under a drive. AUNTIE BEV chased dueling rivals along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, made progress in the lane but
not enough to improve position. MY SWEET MARY fractious and reared inside the gate, broke out and bumped rival at the start, stalked contested pace
three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in the three path and needed more while making mild progress. QUIET
FOREST bumped back by inside rival at the start, rider chose to stay well off the rail, took the turn four wide, failed to make any headway on the turn and
lacked a bid in the lane.
