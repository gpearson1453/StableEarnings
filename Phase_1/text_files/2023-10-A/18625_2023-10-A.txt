Footnotes
BALI ROLLING TIDE was allowed to settle early on the inside, saved ground on the turn while being coaxed along to move into contention, then made a
inside bid off the turn and edged clear in the final furlong to prove best, driving. WHISKEY PRIZE was three wide into the first turn, set the pace while racing
in the three to two path, then was headed by the furlong marker and was outfinished, second best. DANGEROUS MIND was rated two wide early, shifted
out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and finished willingly late to gain the show award. STOMPING MOON
was well placed early on the inside, made a two wide bid off the turn but flattened out late, lost show award. COURT CONTENDER was off a step slow, four
wide into the first turn, made a three wide bid on the far turn but weakened. DIVINING STONE tracked the pace three wide and tired. PAYNTED THUNDER
was off a step slow, then showed little.

DISCREET DEVIL broke thru the gate pre race, then went up to set the early pace while clear, then widened the margin on the turn and drew out leaving
the turn, then was kept to crop pressure to remain clear to the wire. ELUSIVE IMAGE was reluctant to load, then tracked the winner from the inside, tipped
out three wide leaving the turn for aim and was gaining late but could not get to the winner, second best. RAY'S GONE ASTRAY was settled early on the
inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn, then finished willingly to best the rest. A THOUSAND IDOLS chased the pace three wide, came five wide into
the lane and had no rally. WYNN TRIP chased the early pace two wide, came four wide into the lane and faded. BARFLY had an outside pursuit, then was
four wide on the turn and lacked a rally. ALBOROTO was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and was not a threat. POP SOCKS was away alertly and
was through early. SMILIN JACK failed to respond. OUT ON THE TOWN was off slowly and far back while showing little.

Footnotes
GUN OF GOLD was well rated on the inside, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then was kept to a
long drive while drifting in and held on to prevail. FAST MULE set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then was confronted by the
winner leaving the turn, was passed nearing the furlong marker, but ran on gamely to the inside to just miss. DOROTHY'S THE BOSS was settled back
early dropping to the inside, advanced on the inside on the backstretch, shifted out on the tun to be three wide by the quarter pole, then angled back in
leaving the turn, then angled out in the furlong grounds and finished willingly to clearly best the rest. CIRCLE OF COURAGE was five wide into the first turn,
advanced on the outside on the far turn and came five wide into the lane but lacked the needed stretch rally. D'ORO BABY fractious in the gate, pressed the
pace two wide and tired on the turn. UNBRIDLED SASS was reserved three wide and then failed to respond. BRASS BAND was four wide into the first turn,
settled early and tired. LILLI ROSE chased the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
TREASURED GEM was well rated three wide early, then between rivals by the five eighths marker, then moved up and dropped to the inside by the three
eighths marker, awaited room by the quarter pole, tipped three wide off the turn and made a bid, took over nearing the sixteenth marker and was clear, then
held off HEAVENLY APPOINTED late to prove best, driving. HEAVENLY APPOINTED was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, eased out by the
quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, angled out in the lane and closed well while lugging in, missed. CREOLE set the early pace while clear, then
was headed nearing the sixteenth marker and faded late, bested rest. UP FOR IT was rank on the inside into the first turn, then settled entering the
backstretch, then was keen and moved up leaving the five eighths marker, then finally rated by the half mile marker, saved ground on the turn and ran on
late. SERGEANT MOLLY stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but weakened in the drive. FOREVER ROSE (GER) was three wide into
the first turn, then reserved on the inside, then had a belated rally on the inside. DENIM N LACE was reserved two wide and had no rally. LA BEFANA was
settled three to four wide and weakened. CHERIE AMOUR was settled back three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BOSS LOGIC prompted the pace three wide, made a bid by the quarter pole when ready to take over, then drew off in the drive to prove much the best
under mild urging. NO CONFESSION set a pressured pace on the inside, then moved off the rail down the backstretch, then dropped back to the inside
entering the far turn, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and proved to be no match for the winner, angled out by the furlong marker and held the
place gamely. YOUR ANALYSIS was rated between rivals, four wide by the quarter pole while making a mild bid, came five wide into the lane and had no
kick, missed place award, bested rest. LAST ROMANCE chased the pace on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and was empty. ST
ANDREWS was reserved on the inside and had no rally. WILD BANKER tracked the pace three to four wide and tired. LIB'S CONTENTO was off slowly,
reserved three wide and was not a threat.

Footnotes
EDDIE THE GREAT was settled early on the inside, then moved out to be two wide on the first turn, between rivals on the turn, tipped out for racing room
and closed well to get up in the final fifty yards to prove best, driving. MAYBE IT'S TIME set the pace on the inside, dug in gamely in the stretch but was
caught late to just miss. GRATIA PRINCE was settled back early, advanced three wide on the turn, swung out seven wide leaving the turn and rallied well
late to gain the show award. DAVID'S PROSPEC tracked the pace three wide and faded in the drive. JOE BRAINS pressed the paced two wide and came
three wide into the lane but weakened the final furlong. PROVISION was rated along the inside, made a mild bid on the inside leaving the turn but flattened
out. CALLOWAY PEAK was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a rally. GAMBLING TZAR lacked a serious rally. FIELDSTONE was reserved early,
made a three to four wide middle move but tired the final quarter of a mile. READY REWARD was settled three wide and tired.
