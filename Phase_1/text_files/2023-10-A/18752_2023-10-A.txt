Footnotes
APOLLO RISING tracked four wide, moved to press the new leader from the three path at the three furlong pole, bid entering the lane and drew clear in
upper stretch. LEVY lacked speed in the two path, improved position in the four path around the far turn, sustained progress to gain place in the final
sixteenth and held that position from an outer bidder late. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR was slow into stride and lagged behind the rest around the first turn,
picked up momentum in the five to six path entering the lane, and stayed on to miss reaching place while achieving show at the wire. PUNCTUALITY settled
off of the pace in the two path, surpassed tiring foes three wide to gain show around the far turn, but flattened out and got outfinished by a pair of outer rivals
for minor rewards in the final sixteenth. SOUND DOCTRINE stalked three wide, bid at the five furlong pole, inherited an advantage from inner faltering rivals
into the far turn, showed the way from an outer presser while tucking to the two path with three furlongs to go, met that one's challenge entering the lane,
got headed in upper stretch and weakened. FAITH RUNNER tracked along the inside, gave way behind tiring rivals around the far turn, shifted out to the
five path entering the lane and came up empty. COUSIN ODELL vied two wide but weakened between horses entering the far turn. GOLDEN REIGN broke
half a beat slow while leaning outwardly at the start, vied along the inside, but faltered approaching the three furlong pole. SILVESTRE raced off of the pace
while hung five wide around the first turn and was done early.

Footnotes
HEY JOE JOE prompted inside of the pace setter, bid along the rail in upper stretch, edged an advantage passing the furlong grounds and held sway. SPIN
THE BOULEVARD set the pace in the two path, resisted an inner rival's challenge in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong grounds, kept on but
failed to regain even terms. GOOGOL JOKE took light contact to his hind quarters from an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path,
fanned to the six path entering the lane and stayed on to gain show in the final sixteenth. AUGUSTINE RED bumped with an inner rival before lightly
brushing an outer foe at the start, gained four wide and outside of the main group into the turn, sustained progress to be within range of the leaders at the
quarter pole, but drifted to the five path entering the lane, leveled off in midstretch and lost show to an outer bidder late. HEART HEADED tracked two wide
and between horses, then chased the leaders from the two path through midstretch before tiring entering the final sixteenth. COMMISSIONER OSCAR
bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged behind around the turn and surpassed a tiring rival in the final furlong. DEBT PAID stalked three wide, but
weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
SAMARITA vied outside of a rival while remaining multiple paths away from that one down the backstretch, led and tucked to the two path into the turn,
drew off shortly after and added to his margin under driving pressure. INVALUABLE tucked behind rivals early on, raced off of the pace along the inside,
gained place from outer rivals entering the lane and was second best. SHE DAZZLE chased in the two path, floated to the four path to gain show entering
the lane and was best of the rest. IFIHADACHANCE lacked speed in the three path into the turn, shifted out out to the five path turning for home and failed
to factor. FAIRY CAKES (GB) vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, proved no match for that one with over three furlongs to go and weakened
between horses entering the lane. HIGH SPEED tracked in the four path and faded between horses turning for home.

BLUE LIGHT stalked in the three path and between horses, pressed two wide around the turn, bid in the three path in upper stretch and drove clear at the
furlong grounds. FROSTED DEPARTURE took contact from an inner rival at the five furlong pole, raced close up along the inside, stalked from the pocket
around the turn, checked while blocked entering upper stretch, slipped through a very narrow rail seam while scraping the inner fence at the furlong
grounds, and chased the clear leader home to prove second best. ELITE FORCES bumped with an inner rival at the five furlong pole, tracked four wide,
moved to press three wide into the turn, then only managed to chase inner rivals through the lane. GILCREASE bumped with rivals on both sides at the five
furlong pole, trailed in the two path in to the turn, then tipped out nearing midstretch and surpassed a tiring rival. FIT TO FLY set the pace in the two path,
then along the inside around the turn, got headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and faltered while bumping with an inner foe at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
RAISE HIGH vied in the three to two path while outside of a rival, sparred between horses around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, drove
clear at the furlong grounds and lasted from an outer oncharging rival late. CONVERSING pursued from midpack in the three path, checked off rivals' heels
at the three furlong pole, fanned out to the six path entering the lane, rallied in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong, closed in late but ran out of
ground. SAGITTARIUS tracked in the four path under a tight hold around the first turn, moved forward to press the leading pair into the far turn, but only
managed to chase the clearing leader while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds but was outkicked by an outer
bidder for place at the sixteenth pole. EQUAL PROTECTION laid off of the pace in the three path to four path, tracked around the far turn, chased on his left
lead in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds but lacked a bid between horses. PILKINGTON stalked two wide and between horses, chased
among foes while vying for place through midstretch and yielded entering the final sixteenth. FAYETTE SPIRIT stumbled severely and bumped an outer
rival at the start, raced at the rear along the inside, then in the four path around the far turn, swung to the seven path entering the lane and rallied willingly.
WESTERN MOON vied along the inside, then with a pair of outer rivals around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch and weakened through the final
furlong. GET AHEAD NOW broke a step slow and failed to factor from the two path. SMART UNCLE stalked along the inside, pursued from the pocket
around the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. AUDEN got bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three path and between horses,
steadied slightly behind a troubled rival at eh three furlong pole and made little impact. QUALIFIED broke a step slow and was outrun in the four to five path.
FIREBALL FUN pursued from midpack in the two path and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
HIGHESTDISTINCTION was a bit antsy in the starting gate, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, fanned to the six path entering the lane,
slowly gained while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over in the final sixteenth causing a late surge of energy and was up in time.
INJUNCTION stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, prompted along with an outer rival around the far turn, chased before bidding passing
the furlong grounds, wrestled an advantage in the final sixteenth but was nailed by an outer on-charging foe at the wire. ACCREDIT broke a bit inwardly, set
the pace in the two path, showed the way from a pair of outer pressers around the far turn, held a margin through upper stretch, but was collared by a bidder
on either side leaving the furlong grounds, was bested passing the sixteenth marker, then dead-heated for show. BEATBOX tracked two wide, checked
subtly while between horses leaving the three furlong pole, chased among rivals into the lane and through midstretch, tipped to the four path at the sixteenth
pole, ran on late and dead-heated for show. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE laid off of the pace four to three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, then stayed on
mildly between horses in the final furlong. FUERTEVENTURA stalked along the inside, attempted a rail bid passing the furlong marker, but lacked the
needed kick and yielded late. TIZ THE BOMB laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued towards the rear while between horses around the far turn and
failed to factor. GRAY'S FABLE pursued from midpack three wide, tugged closer entering the backstretch, got rank at the nine sixteenths pole, settled and
pressed around the far turn, but chased entering the lane and faded between horses in the final furlong. PLAY ACTION PASS pursued from midpack along
the inside and lacked a bid. HOZIER laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, fanned from the four to seven path entering the lane and
lacked a rally. GREYES CREEK was last away and got outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
INTRICATE tracked three wide, tipped to the four path around the far turn, offered a bold bid outside of the leaders entering the lane, led into the final
furlong and drew clear under mild urging. CARARRA pressed two wide, led from between horses leaving the five sixteenths pole, dug in to resist an outer
challenge entering the lane, fought on after getting headed nearing the furlong grounds but was second best. GENETICS broke slowly, pursued from
midpack along the inside, steadied slightly nearing the backstretch, took closer order to stalk approaching the far turn, but checked behind the leading group
entering the lane, yet ran on between horses to gain show in the final sixteenth. AMY Z stalked three wide, pressed around the far turn while under urging,
got outkicked by an outer bidder entering the lane, gave way to the top pair in upper stretch weakened between horses in the late stages. ARIJANA'S
PEARL stalked from the two path, pursued between horses into the far turn, shifted out to the four path in midstretch while hanging on her left lead and
missed reaching fourth. PLUMERIA laid off of the pace four wide, failed to respond to urging in the three path around the far turn, floated to the five path
entering the lane and lacked a rally. AMERICA'S VOW raced at the rear in the four to five path, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch and failed to factor.
REMEMBERING laid off of the pace in the three path but was through turning for home. GRAND PRAIRIE GAL broke a step slow, pursued from midpack
two wide and between horses entering the first turn, but steadied hard out of tight quarters entering the backstretch, trailed in the aftermath and was outrun
thereafter. SHE'S ARODEOQUEEN set the pace along the inside, got headed while inside of a pair of rivals with five sixteenths to go and weakened in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
BOLD ACT (IRE) broke a step slow, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses early on, saved ground around the final two bends, shifted out to
the four path approaching midstretch, split foes leaving the furlong grounds while launching a rally, surged up to the leader in the final sixteenth and drove
past in the closing stages. CELLIST set the pace along the inside, shook clear of an outer presser entering the lane, held sway well through midstretch and
into the final sixteenth, but was collared by an outer rival in the late stages, got bested then saved place. LIMITED LIABILITY pursued from midpack three to
two wide, spun four wide into the lane, floated a path out passing the three sixteenths pole, got outkicked by an inner rival while picking up stride at the
furlong grounds and stayed on to miss reaching place. RED RUN tracked two wide, tipped three wide entering the lane, grinded away to vie for place
passing the furlong grounds but flattened out between horses. TAWNY PORT stalked along the inside, chased under rousing around the far turn, sustained
pursuit into the final furlong but lacked a bid. RED KNIGHT rated far back in the two path, then the three to four path around the far turn before fanning to
the six path entering the lane, but only offered a mild kick. THERAPIST settled off of the pace in the two path, then in the three to four path around the far
turn, came under urging three wide around the final bend, then lacked a rally in the five path and between horses. HIGHEST HONORS pursued from
midpack along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane, then gave way between horses. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY broke a step slow, trailed in the
two path and failed to factor. KITODAN laid off of the pace in the three path, saved ground around the final turn and made little impact. CHANNEL MAKER
pressed two wide, required urging to sustain pressure around the final bend, yielded entering the lane and weakened between horses. ANOTHER
MYSTERY broke a beat slow, lacked speed along the inside, then three wide around the final bend and got outrun.

Footnotes
TIGER DAD set a clear pace in hand in the two path around the turn, dug in to resist an outer challenge from his stablemate in midstretch and gamely held.
PALACE KITTEN pursued from behind the main flight, tipped outside of them and four wide turning for home, rallied, bid outside of his clear stablemate at
the furlong grounds, dueled thereafter but was denied. LEADER OF MEN trailed in the three path, split foes in the five path entering the lane and ran on
willingly. NEPOTISM chased along the inside, vied for show with an outer rival in the final furlong but was bested. HERD IMMUNITY laid off of the pace
along the inside, then improved in the four path and between horses. WOKE UP IN LOVE lacked speed in the three to four path, swung to the seven path
entering the lane and failed to factor. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) tracked four to three wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and
weakened between horses. READY TO ROLL chased three wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. EMERALD EXPRESS raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, then weakened in upper stretch.
