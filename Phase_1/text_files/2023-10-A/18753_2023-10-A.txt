Footnotes
TWEET AWAY ROBIN stalked the pace, moved up three wide leaving the turn, took the lead near the eighth pole and edged away under brisk urging.
TRUE BLUE PEARL , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch and rallied outside foes. ESPERANNNA showed
speed, gained a two wide lead leaving the turn and faded late. CAR LADY trailed to the stretch, swung wide turning for home and passed tired horses.
VIKING QUEEN , four wide entering the stretch, was not a factor. CUPIDS DREAM , outrun, was five deep turning for home. SNEAKY CHEEKY hopped a
bit at the break and lacked a rally. CARTWHEEL , three deep on the turn, faltered. THUNDER BUGGY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner
rail and tired in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HAINT BLUE (FR) settled off the inside, advanced four wide under a light hold past the five sixteenths, shifted out a bit wider into the lane, leveled off under
left handed asks to close outside rivals, took a slim lead leaving the sixteenth pole and held firm. IMAGINETHEODDS rated off the inside, took closer order
three wide under some coaxing nearing the quarter pole, moved out a bit wider and sustained her run, moved up to take a short lead leaving the furlong
grounds, could not quite contain the winner's charger from her outside with a sixteenth to go but stayed gamely to the wire. REES drafted back off the early
pace, saved ground while advancing past the three eighths, eased out to progress between runners into the stretch, awaited some room near mid stretch,
angled out and kept on with interest. SULTRY SKY lagged well back, swung five to six wide into the lane and closed steadily. IRISH MIRAGE , in the clear
tracking the pace, moved up to the inside of a runner near the five sixteenths, eased out, challenged between foes in mid stretch, failed to seriously kick on
past the sixteenth marker and faded. NAMI saved ground under early rating, cut the corner making headway into the lane, steadied when lacking room in
mid stretch, continued bottled up about a sixteenth more, angled out but was unable to seriously recover. RITAMARLEY cleared early, set the pace towards
the inside, moved away a bit near the five sixteenths, maintained the advantage under a ride past the three sixteenths, could not resist multiple challenges
leaving the eighth pole and weakened. TIME GOES FAST , off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn, swung out four wide nearing the lane but lacked
a solid run. SALLY GIRL prompted the pace outside the leader, failed to kick on nearing the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
NEW YORK PANTHER edged up four wide into the first turn then dropped in a bit to track COVERT KAT, moved to challenge past the three eighths,
sparred on near even terms from the head of the lane, gained a slim advantage in mid stretch, kept on under left handed asks and edged away a bit nearing
the wire. COVERT KAT took over early and was attempting to lug out a bit entering the first turn, corrected and set the pace towards the rail, began to get
pressure from the winner exiting the far turn, dueled from upper stretch, gave way grudgingly in the final yards and manage to save the place. GLIDING
AFLEET stalked the leaders while saving ground, eased out three wide under pressure into the lane, ranged up to loom off the embattled leaders in mid
stretch, kept on willingly but just missed second. VAX A NATION steadied off heels nearing the first turn, regrouped and stalked three wide, was under
coaxing chasing past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the lane and churned on. MOST WANTED MAN broke a bit slow, settled off the pace,
moved up three wide nearing the quarter pole, swung out six wide for the drive and rallied. LANGLEE AVENUE , forced out six wide into the first turn,
recovered and settled off the inside, edged up under a ride past the quarter pole while about three wide, worked between runners in the final furlong and
continued with effort. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO broke a bit slow, rated off the pace while saving ground, steadied behind rivals entering the far turn, angled
out and offered a mild run. INVECTIVE rated between foes near the five eighths, dropped inside leaving the far turn, moved up nearing mid stretch to take
aim then flattened out. GALILEE saved ground, briefly waited near mid stretch, angled out but failed to seriously threaten. PEJA DU unseated his rider when
fractious in the gate, was backed out and re loaded then forced out five wide into the first turn, raced three deep into the backstretch, moved up some
leaving the far turn, angled five wide for the drive and faded. COCO SHELL checked sharply off heels and bore out bothering rivals into the first turn,
regrouped and saved ground, edged up a bit nearing the five eighths, checked in tight leaving the far turn and faded. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
run approaching the first turn, No action was deemed necessary

Footnotes
BERKS set a pressured pace along the inner rail, edged clear in mid stretch and was kept under urging. TREASURE TROVE stalked the pace down the
backstretch, advanced three wide on the far turn, took aim on the lead entering the stretch and flattened out. ROUGH SEA lacked speed, circled foes four
wide on the far turn, failed to menace and drifted in near the sixteenth pole. MAXIMUM IMPACT trailed to the far turn, waited for room in the two path
entering the stretch, raced near the inner rail through the stretch and lacked the needed late effort. AMPERSAND dwelt then broke awkwardly, rushed up
three wide the first turn, remained in the three path on the far turn and tired. SOUTHERN DISTRICT prompted the pace outside the winner and faltered
leaving the far turn. TRASH TALKIN LARRY hugged the inner rail around the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BOLD HOPPERTUNITY cleared early, was nicely rated towards the inside, turned away an outside threat nearing the lane, responded and kicked back
away when roused past the three sixteenths, kept on under steady handling through the final furlong and held firm. PHOTO COPY settled outside,
commenced a run into the far turn, advanced four wide into the stretch and kept on gamely to out kick SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR for the place.
SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR , a bit rank and checked off heels early, remained tough to settle early backstretch, moved up between runners to have aim into
the far turn, dropped in with pursuit, stayed inside for the drive and kept on with interest. WORLD FACTOR , three wide, angled five wide into the lane,
ranged up past mid stretch then flattened out. FOE saved ground, steadied when trying to advance inside runners into the far turn, recovered to make
another run into the lane then flattened out late. HIGH STAKES saved ground and had a mild late response. CORRECTED PEDIGREE stalked off the rail,
moved up under a ride and bid outside the winner near the quarter pole, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. HENDERSON , three wide, lacked a bid.
SERGEANT SHERMAN failed to menace. THE LAST JUMPSTART was outrun.

Footnotes
FEELIN SO LUCKY , patiently handled outside horses down the backstretch, circled rivals on the turn, was five deep turning for home, secured command in
mid stretch and drew out under urging. BIG EARN , off slowly, rushed up four wide on the turn, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole, lugged in near
the sixteenth pole and was best of the others. LADY CHARLOTTE , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, weakened the final furlong. SIX PACK
SENORITA raced forwardly in the three path between horses on the turn and failed to rally. CLASSY CHICK trailed to the stretch, turned for home in the
three path and passed faders. HATEFUL raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. SMART WITH
HEART hopped at the break, raced inside horses throughout and showed some late interest. SHEHERHERS was never a factor. BUNNY HOP sped to the
early lead, hugged the inner rail and faltered the final furlong. ARIEL MOON bore in at the break, chased the pace three wide around the turn and faltered in
upper stretch. NEOLITHICA raced in mid pack on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
LA TRAVIESA rated close up while three wide, moved up and bid three deep into the lane, took over four wide soon after and spurted clear when asked,
drifted out and switched over to her left lead when shown the left crop in mid stretch, corrected when meeting a challenge heading to the sixteenth marker,
switched back to her correct lead and dug in tenaciously to prevail. GASTOWN BABE rated to the inside of a rival around the far turn, moved up to race in
the clear mid turn, angled out and responded when set down five wide past the quarter pole, ranged up boldly then was herded out by the winner a furlong
out, recovered and continued on gamely outside that one to just miss. AFANDI stalked inside, eased out into the lane, waited briefly behind rivals, worked
between foes inside the final furlong and kept on with effort. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER , off the pace while settled inside, moved up while saving ground past
the three sixteenths, came out to advance on between runners, raced on her left lead late and churned on. LA CIENEGA broke outward and a bit slow,
straightened and chased outside a rival leaving the far turn, angled out for the drive and offered a slight late kick. SHOWGIRL LYNNE B prompted the pace
outside the leader, bid between foes nearing the stretch, battled on to the inside of runners leaving mid stretch then faded late. KALENJIN , off the pace and
between foe mid turn, swung very wide into the stretch, made a slight run then flattened out. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH broke inward and brushed with a rival,
edged up between runners to be forward into the turn, chased to upper stretch then gradually gave way. GET THE CANDY was sent clear early, dropped in
and set the pace, was taken on by two rivals into the lane, fought on past the three sixteenths then surrendered. EVERYONELOVESLINDA , brushed at the
break then steadied when in tight, dropped off the pace, raced three wide mid turn, angled six to seven wide into the lane but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
POGGIBONSI sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged in mid stretch then dug in tenaciously to prevail. VIOLENT VIXEN
, two wide around the turn, moved up to challenge the winner in mid stretch, finished gamely but was second best. BOURBON WILDCAT saved ground
around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and needed more in an even effort. MAMA G'S WISH broke slowly when turning her head at the
break, angled off the rail leaving the turn, entered the stretch in the three path, brushed with GOLDEN EFFECT in upper stretch and flattened out. OUR
LIBERTY BELLE , no factor, raced in the two path around the turn and swung to the six path in upper stretch. ROYAL WHISPER hesitated at the break,
raced in the two path on the turn and was never a factor. GOLDEN EFFECT , three deep stalking the pace on the turn, was fanned four wide entering the
stretch, brushed with MAMA G'S WISH in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
MONCRIEF vied outside a rival then moved clear while a bit erratic into the turn, took to rating around the turn, was guided outward when challenged in
upper stretch, straightened with strong handling, kept on tenaciously to the inside of MASTER OOGWAY through the final furlong and proved best.
MASTER OOGWAY had speed to the inside of the winner then rated back off that one nearing the turn, eased out and tracked mid turn, bid between rivals
into the lane, fought on outside the winner through the final eighth but was kept at bay. FUN COAST steadied soon after the break, regrouped and was
taken to rate inside, edged up around the turn to be in range, continued progress to mid stretch, continued on with good effort but was out kicked by the top
pair. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE stumbled inward at the break, recovered and was taken in hand, pulled his way forward outside a rival into the turn, edged up
three wide between foes into the lane, chased past mid stretch then went evenly late. RENNIE stalked the pace, took closer order three wide between rivals
past the three eighths, raced four wide to the inside of ARMY CADET into the lane but came up empty. MENO , bumped and pinched back at the break,
raced well back into the turn, saved ground into the stretch and had some late action. ARMY CADET came in at the break bumping and tightening MENO,
straightened and stalked outside rivals, circled five wide into the lane, failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. THUNDERHOUSE , off the pace, raced
wide in the drive and failed to menace. KING JOEY was outrun.
