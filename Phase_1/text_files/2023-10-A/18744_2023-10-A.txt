task. MAMA'S MIDDIE settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and safely secured
the place. IN A MINUTE bobbled at the start, moved out leaving the chute then tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the two path on the
turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, led briefly into the stretch then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened.

went clear early then was taken in hand, stayed well out in the track leaving the chute, dropped in near the three-quarter pole, vied inside on the turn, was
asked under heavy threat inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into the stretch and tired. WISECRACKER was reserved off the pace, came under

on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ORANGE FREEZE dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled near the
back, was urged along the rail on the far turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
JOKING WAY was hustled from the gate then coaxed along off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, was roused three then four wide on the turn,
came six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong
handling. TOMMY GUN was hustled from the gate then moved in early, contested the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, spun
four wide into upper stretch then shook clear, led under a drive into the final furlong, was collared by the winner coming to the sixteenth-pole and missed
while able to get the place. BIG SAVE settled off the pace, was roused while saving ground on the turn, chased inside in the stretch and finished with good
courage for the show. AMANI'S EAGLE settled in third position, was asked in the two path on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch, moved in while
gaining quickly on the leader into the final furlong, chased to the finish and just missed the show. ON THE COME UP disputed the pace on the inside of a
rival, vied along the rail on the turn, spun off the inside into the stretch and tired. MOVING PICTURES had a shoe repaired in the paddock, settled near the
back, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. TRUEBELIEVE was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and was no
factor.

the three-sixteenths then took the lead, disposed of FRONT MAN into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. LORD FLINTSHIRE was well placed
just off the pace on the inside, came off the rail into the stretch, was coaxed behind foes into the final furlong then altered out, gained in the final sixteenth
and finished well for the place. FRONT MAN went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was asked near
the quarter-pole, made a three wide bid into upper stretch, battled under a drive to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while just able to get the show.
SONIC SPEED settled on the inside, saved ground behind foes on the far turn, was asked into the stretch, lacked from behind horses from inside the
three-sixteenths into the final furlong then moved out while roused and finished with good courage to just miss the show. MIRACLE MIKE was hustled from
the gate, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, settled off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, shifted from two to four wide on the
final turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. THETHRILLOFVICTORY broke a step slow, pulled under restraint early, went three to four
wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. JARREAU was hustled from the gate then moved in, went two to three wide
on the turns and failed to rally. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied
inside on the far turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way. BLAME D RULE MAKER was off slow and spotted the
front a few lengths, went three then two wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was roused three to four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WALLEY WORLD went two to three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the three path on the far turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, took the lead while asked at the top of the stretch, responded well under pressure into the final furlong then drew clear under strong
handling. TOM COLLINS saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner in the drive and narrowly earned the place. MIDNIGHT COUNCIL jostled with a rival leaving the chute, tucked into the two path on the
first turn, settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, chased just behind the winner into the final furlong and proved no match then
lost the place. PRARIEDALE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, rounded the far turn in the
two path, came out at the quarter-pole then angled further out in the stretch and improved position. INHERENT PROMISE jostled with a rival leaving the
chute then became extremely rank, fought vigorously against the rating tactics of the rider, went three to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the
stretch and also improved position. FRED GEORGE (IRE) moved in while going to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, lost the lead to
the winner at the quarter-pole and gave way. MESSAGE OF HOPE (IRE) was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced inside to the two path on
the turns and failed to impact. DON VINO VICI jostled with rivals leaving the chute, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved off the pace,
saved ground on the far turn and lacked the needed response. GOLDEN PLATE tossed his head while very rank on the opening straightaway, continued
keen while inside to the two path on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, went four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in some
near the sixteenth-pole and failed to rally. GAME MISCONDUCT was taken in hand early, saved ground while well placed just off the pace, was asked for
his best in upper stretch and came up empty. ANCHISES went two to three wide on the turns and failed to threaten. ADMIRAL NIMITZ (GB) went around
the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, saved ground on the far turn and showed little.

VODKA MARDINI was hustled from the start, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, extended the advantage
late on that bend, remained well clear into the final furlong, shortened stride under the crop into the final sixteenth and held under steady urging.
SCREAMING UNCLE bumped with a rival at the start, dropped off the pace then was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, gained on the tired leader in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. AULA was hustled from the gate then urged
along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. GROWTH MINDSET was
coaxed along off the pace, saved ground under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to respond. WHENLOVETAKESOVER bumped with a foe at
the start then was hustled, showed speed then tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path on the turn and tired. NO SURRENDER was
reluctant to load then broke inward, raced inside under urging, dropped back outside the half-mile pole, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONLAWYER was taken in hand while established position early, saved ground while rated just off the pace, came through a rail opening inside
the three-eighths pole to make a bid then took the lead coming to the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to the crop in the stretch and held under
strong urging. GOOD SKATE bobbled at the start then was hustled to the front, raced inside to the two path on the first turn, showed the way with a clear
advantage while off the rail down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, left the rail open and lost the lead to the winner coming to the
five-sixteenths pole, kept on well in pursuit of that foe in the stretch but missed while clear for second. COSTA TERRA was hustled from the gate then
wrested back off the pace nearing the first turn, raced in the three path on that bend, settled on the outside, moved closer around the nine-sixteenths,
chased four wide for most of the far turn then dropped to the three path, lugged in in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. IRON
WORKS was hustled from the gate, went two to three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole,
chased three wide for most of the far turn then dropped to the two path and tired. MYSTIC NIGHT rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the
outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, traveled three wide on the far turn and failed to respond. TONAL IMPACT saved ground on the first turn,
settled off the rail on the backstretch, was urged passing the half-mile pole, went two then three wide on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
CIGARETTE BOAT showed speed on the inside of a rival then dropped off the pace near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, was asked in the
two path at the quarter-pole, moved out in pursuit of the leader outside the furlong marker, made a bid inside that marker, took the lead into the final
sixteenth then moved clear under good handling. FOREIGN INFLUENCE was reserved off the pace, raced off heels under tight restraint late on the
backstretch, saved ground on the turn, chased in upper stretch, lacked room along the rail inside the furlong marker and waited, bravely squeezed through
inside of the pacesetter in the final sixteenth and willingly earned the place. ALEXIS ZORBA (GB) showed speed on the outside then moved clear at the
nine-sixteenths, was challenged while in the two path on the turn, led under a drive until near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken by the winner and lost
the place. HIGHLAND LORD settled off the pace, was taken under snug restraint when the winner dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, became rank
while behind horses late on the backstretch, was let out in the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
RINGSIDE settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the turn and also lacked the needed response. VENGE settled towards the rear, traveled around
the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. IRON MAN JIMMY broke out at the start, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BORLETTI (IRE) was forwardly placed down the backstretch, came under urging in the three path on the turn, made
a bid at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. TAP YOUR HEART broke a step slow, settled at the back, went three wide on
the turn and failed to respond.
