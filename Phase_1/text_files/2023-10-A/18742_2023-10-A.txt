Footnotes
LAKE SHORE DRIVE was away alertly to set a brisk pace up front down the backside, opened up through the turn under swift fractions, was asking for the
wire at the furlong marker and held on by a diminishing margin at the finish. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE tracked four wide down the backstretch, was throttled
down to stalk the front three at the half, slipped up on the rail starting a rally in midturn, loomed the only threat at the top of the lane, was gaining steadily
late but could not close the gap in time. ECHO WITH LAUGHTER was part of the tracking trio down the backstretch, settling on the inside just off the rail,
chased the winner but to no avail while getting out through the turn and finished up mildly down the lane to hold on for third money crossing the finish line.
UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) stalked near the rear down the back straight, made no headway around the bend and showed some late interest inside to
close in for a minor role in the end. AMBER LIGHT broke outwards to begin, tracked the frontrunner between horses in the early going, was floated out
chasing the winner on the turn and gave way in the four path in upper stretch. WILD CONVERSATION broke with the field but was void of early speed to
trail down the backside, made little impact saving ground throughout the turn and could not get involved on the fence down the stretch.

Footnotes
ARAMOS stalked widest in the four path into the first turn, improved three wide down the backstretch, was hard ridden commencing a run midway on the far
turn, loomed four wide at the top of the lane, wore down rivals in mid-stretch and was going away crossing the finish line. TWIXTER tracked two wide
outside on the first turn, took closer order down the back straight three wide on the outside, rallied for the lead in the three path at the quarter pole, briefly
took command between foes at the furlong marker but was no match for the winner in deep stretch. ALL FOR HONOR tossed her head while veering in
sharply on the break, trailed in the beginning, was allowed to find her feet down the backstretch, started to gain momentum picking up horses three wide at
the half, continued to go around runners four wide through the turn, was in range in the five path in upper stretch, under left handed urging was laying in
driving to the wire and surged at the line to capture the show money. SPANISH SERENADE tracked the frontrunner on the rail in the early stages, kept
close tabs on the leader down the backside, bid between foes at the quarter pole, battled on the inside up front until the furlong marker and tired very late to
just miss holding for third in the end. SUNYANI broke outwards on the break, regrouped to take this field into the first turn, set the pace unchallenged down
the back straight, was collared outside by rivals at the quarter pole, offered little resistance turning for home and faded on the fence in mid-stretch. TAKE
CHANCES stalked in the two path with runners on each side on the first turn, travelled in the third flight between foes at the half while under a ride to keep
up, could not improve position in the final turn and was never a presence running to the finish line. ARNIE P stalked on the rail in the beginning, inched
closer to the pacesetter inside at the half mile marker, was one paced saving ground on the final bend and showed little finish through the lane. WONT
FORGET YOU stalked three wide between horses into the first turn, was shuffled back to settle near the rear down the back straight, could not offer a run
through the far turn seeing the field and had little to give in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TABLOID MATERIAL had a good position nestled on the rail down the back straight, waited with horse behind the contesting duo throughout the turn, burst
between runners in the two path at the eighth pole and drew away convincingly for the victory at the finish. I'M AWESOME watched the top two engage at
the half mile marker, closed in on the contesting leaders on the turn three wide, loomed the threat in the four path turning for home, was no match for the
closing winner late but determinedly got up at the wire for the runners up share. DIXIERIBSY had a slim lead on the fence at the half, was headed outside
with two furlongs to run, gamely regained the lead on the rail in upper stretch, could not hold off the surging winner late and stubbornly just lost the nod for
place at the finish. GET MY DRIFT leapt at the start, settled in mid-pack down the backstretch, stalked alone in the third flight midway through the turn, was
in the mix outside for a small role at the furlong marker and just held on for a minor role at the wire. SILENT PATSY was off a step slow to begin, co-trailed
on the inside at the half, rallied two wide between horses three furlongs from home, was getting out under right handed urging at the quarter pole and
finished up with strong intent late to just miss for a small piece of the prize in the end. GOLDEN SPRING pressed the pace on the outside with four furlongs
from the wire, bobbed heads for the lead outside at the quarter marker, was in the hunt in the three path between runners at the top of the stretch and
weakened at the sixteenth pole. SHE IS HOPEFUL stalked near the rear in the early going, travelled at the back on the rail, part of a trio that could see field
running through the turn and never could get into contention driving to the finish line. ALWAYS MY FAULT broke out sharply on the break, co-trailed on the
outside at the half, settled three wide at the rear outside runners with three eighths to go, shifted inwards to the rail at the quarter pole and could not pick up
any runners down the lane.

Footnotes
CHAIRMAN BOB settled inside early, began to advance two wide and between runners late on the far turn, came out four to five wide turning into upper
stretch and with momentum, struck the lead past the eighth pole, held. DESOLATOR was caught outside foes three to four wide settling at the back through
the first turn, dropped back a bit and shifted in near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the far turn, angled out past the three-sixteenths coming out five
to six wide, loomed a major threat but was second best. JACK THE CAT angled in and saved ground settling at the rear, came out in mid-stretch, ran on to
just get up for show. DERZKII tracked just off the leaders from inside, saved ground, kept on in the stretch, needed more and lost show honors in the
shadow of the wire. ROCKET JOE COPPER settled mid-pack outside three to four wide early, advanced past foes rapidly four then three wide on the far
turn, needed more while evening out in the stretch. MAD DOG N JOE was quick to the lead, set the pace in the clear just off the rail, widened a bit late on
the far turn, put to urging in upper stretch, drifted out several paths, faltered and faded. TIMESKIP settled between runners at the back two to three deep on
the first turn and wider up the backstretch, was forced four then five wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. STEAK AND CHEESE stalked the
pace from outside about three to four wide, faltered and faded. HULLABALOO settled mid-pack two to three wide early, dropped back three deep on the far
turn, faded and was not persevered with late. SEGUIMI chased the pace in the two to three path, steadily retreated on the far turn.

Footnotes
FANTAIL (GB) tracked in behind, took closer order late on the turn, waited just briefly past the quarter pole, came out a bit at the top of the stretch for room,
took the lead a furlong out, kicked clear under moderate hand urging. VERY SAVVY was bumped at the start, settled off the pace, went two to three wide on
the turn, swung out five to six deep coming to the top of the stretch, finished strongly but was only second best. ISHIYAYA pressed the pace two to three
wide through the turn coming out a couple paths in upper stretch, kept on for show honors. SPANISH BEAUTY bumped a rival at the start, set the pace from
inside on or just off the rail, weakened and lost show late. EYE GOT IT GOOD exchanged a minor bump at the start, switched out, raced outside four then
three wide on the turn, kept on well late but needed more. LOIS pursued from off the inside three then four wide on the turn racing mid-division, swung
seven wide into upper stretch, kicked on mildly. WAKE UP MAGGIE bobbled ever so slightly at the start, settled at the back, fanned eight wide into the
stretch, showed mild late interest. GORMLEY GIRL was lightly bumped at the start, chased mid-pack, dropped back on the turn racing inside.

Footnotes
WINYAH BAY was off a bit slow to begin, co-trailing inside in the early stages, started to rally angling out to be four wide five sixteenths from the prize,
loomed outside four wide at the top of the stretch and drew away when asked in the final sixteenth under a well timed rally. WINGS FROM ABOVE cleared
from the outside to lead the runners down the backstretch, dictated the pace under swift fractions up front on the turn, gave way grudgingly to the winner at
the sixteenth pole and gamely bested the rest at the wire. SONET'S NAME tracked the leader on the rail down the backside, settled nicely, tucked in on the
fence waiting to move through the turn, shifted outside two wide posing a threat between driving to the line and stalled at the eighth pole to finish up a
non-threatening third at the wire. PLUS POWER co-trailed on the outside in the early going, could see the field entering the turn, was roused commencing a
run four wide with three eighths to go, was floated out to the five path but in range turning for home and finished up evenly down the stretch to settle on the
fringes. SWIRLING DANCER tracked three deep outside foes down the back straight, chased the frontrunner three wide throughout the turn, could not
match strides with the outside rivals circling around at the top of the stretch and faded in the three path between horses in mid-stretch. BIG GINGER tracked
the pacesetter between runners down the backstretch, could not quicken with others on either side midpoint on the turn and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
DETERMINED FURY stalked three wide outside rivals down the backside, started to pick up horses three deep at the three furlong marker, continued to
make a bold rally four wide around foes pressing for the lead outside at the quarter pole, pounced to take command in upper stretch and was kept to the
task to the wire to edge clear late. GIANT TEDDY had a good position watching the battling pair down the backside, bid for the front with horses on each
side in the three path at the quarter pole, dueled inside with the winner until deep stretch and finished up to be a clear second best in the end. HIGHLAND
LIFE was checked briefly stalking close the back of the pack between runners nearing the half mile mile marker, could see this compact field in range
running through the turn, caught up to the pack in the five path widest driving to the finish line and closed in late to capture the show award at the wire.
THREEFIFTYSEVEN broke inwards at the start, was gathered up quickly to trail in the early going, kept pace while settled on the fence behind the engaging
leaders through the turn, had no room behind a wall of runners at the top of the lane, shifted out at the furlong marker and was outfinished late for third
money. CEREBRO prompted the pace inside down the backside, dueled on the fence clinging to the lead on the turn, was engulfed by runners outside at
the quarter pole and offered no finish while trying to lug out down the stretch. ANARCHY had a narrow lead outside down the back straight, hounded the
pacesetter on the outside throughout the running on the turn, was collared by quickening outside rivals at the quarter pole, offered no resistance and could
not find more down the lane to be involved at the finish.

FEDALINE forced the issue on the rail down the backstretch, was asked for more, pouncing quickly on the fence midpoint on the turn taking the lead,
opened up on this field turning for home and comfortably held safe under a hand ride to the finish. SHEZ A SEALY stalked near the rear three wide down
the backside, began to lengthen stride picking up runners four wide circling the field at the three furlong marker, was full of run to the wire but could not reel
the winner who broke away at the top of the stretch. GENTLE SEAS travelled midfield outside foes in the three path in the early going, took closer order
three wide running on the turn, was in with a chance in the three path between horses straightening out to the wire and angled outside with run in the final
seventy yards to win the photo for third money. EVA'S RECORD travelled nicely watching the quartet contest up front at the half, improved on the rail
throughout the turn, was in the hunt on the fence straightening out for the drive and stayed on late just missing getting the photo for third in the end.
T'PRING was up close to the lead four deep outside down the back straight, chased the pace three wide on the turn, was in the mix in the five path for a
share turning for home and stalled nearing the wire to just miss out on a small piece of the prize at the finish. CASTLETON settled in the middle of the pack
between horses down the backside, was shuffled back to almost the rear at the top of the lane running on the rail and showed late interest to resurge inside
down the stretch. DADDY'S LEGACY was brushed outside on the break, stalked near the rear between foes in the two path down the backside, was roused
three wide with horses on each side three furlongs out making little impression around the bend and ran on mildly down the lane to the wire. WANT TO GO
DANCING was brushed inside to began, settled in mid-pack on the rail down the backside, advanced on the fence through the turn, briefly lacked running
room at the top of the lane, had a clear path on the inside at the furlong marker but could not offer a finish in deep stretch. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH was
unhurried trailing on the inside in the early stages of the race, swung outside still seeing the field in the five path turning for home and passed the early
speed horses that dueled in the beginning through the stretch. CLASSIC GLORY pressed the pace between rivals down the back straight, gave way fighting
to stay up near the front with three furlongs remaining and backed away through the field at the quarter pole. POLA STAR broke inwards to begin, prompted
three wide outside down the backstretch, was hard ridden relinquishing the lead then trying to keep up with the winner midway on the turn and stopped
between horses at the furlong marker.
