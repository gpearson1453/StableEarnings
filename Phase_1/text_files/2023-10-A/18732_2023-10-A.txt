SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW went to the front, drove clear and lacked a late kick. VIEWING TRAIL raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and hung.
BYE BYE BIG BABY raced evenly near the middle of the field and was never a factor. SUM CHARM raced within contention, came around the final turn on
the outside and faded. SARATOGA KAREN void of early speed and was never close. OCEAN FLEET raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning and
retreated. SLIDE always raced near the back and showed little. RETRO RITA challenged near the front in the early part and made a steady retreat.

Footnotes
MUCHMORETHANREADY unhurried in the early part, racing in the back, moved up on the inside around the second turn, angled out down the lane, was
going away, while winning handily. MOR KISSES vied for the early advantage, raced three wide around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but
was a clear second. GOTTEMINABIND raced within striking distance, moved up the backside, while racing on the rail, made a mild bid and was a clear
third. MO SMOKING dueled on the front end, weakened and was no threat late. GEAUX VOTE vied for the early lead, saved ground and faded. EASY ACT
raced in the back of the pack, improved position, but was no factor. REINA ACES pressed the pace, entered the home stretch wide and dropped back.
JULIO CHOICE raced in the middle of the field and retreated. ARCTIC GUITAR void of early speed and was never close.

MAKE IT SPEND IT stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up, between rivals around the final turn, took the lead and drove clear under steady
urging. RITE ON SAM unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, made a bid, proved no match for the winner deep in the stretch, but
was best of others. GLAMORDINI went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. CLEARING CUSTOMS broke a step slow, racing in the rear and was
never a factor. YES JACK pressed the early pace and was finished early. FRUIT CUP always raced near the back and showed little.

FOR REAL ALICE dueled for the early lead, drove clear and was kept to the task. MISS TARGET raced within contention, moved up on the outside around
the turn, made a bid, couldn't catch the winner, but was best of others. WHERE'S AUNT J challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout and
proved no match for the top two. DOLLY'S GUITAR raced within striking distance, made a mild bid and was outfinished for third. TWO JET raced in the
middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. CHARGED TEMP lacked early speed, came around the turn wide, improved position, but
was no factor. MADISON'S SCREEN void of early speed, finished wide and was never a threat. SHEZA SALTY GAL pressed the early pace and dropped
back. BUILDING HOME showed early speed and made a steady retreat. AFLEET CHARLENE trailed throughout and showed little.

Footnotes
CARBON STRYKER unhurried in the early part, moved up in the rail down the backside, angled out around the final turn, dueled between rivals down the
stretch, exchanged bumps with MUFFIN NUTS and prevailed for the win. MUFFIN NUTS void of early speed, made a steady gain, exchanged bumps down
the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. B W P SPECIAL vied on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, bumped down the final stretch and
was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. FAR BEYOND raced within striking distance, came around the second turn wide and finished willingly.
ANDIAMO GIACOMO raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. CHAPEL BARN dueled for the early advantage, was finished early and
faded. SAVAGE raced evenly near the back, had an outside trip and was never a factor. JAZZY JUSTIN flashed early speed and made a steady retreat.
SCHNELL void of early speed and was outrun. THE JOCKEY OF #4 MUFFIN NUTS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #7 CARBON STRYKER FOR
INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.
