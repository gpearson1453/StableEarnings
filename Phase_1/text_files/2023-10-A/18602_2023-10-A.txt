Footnotes
BODACIOUS MISS showed speed from the outside, had a clear lead on the turn and with mild pressure in mid stretch prevailed. SIMPLE SOUVENIR
stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. BORN TO BE GOOD was
in touch and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. PLUIE D'AVRIL was in range and raced evenly on the turn but
had no late kick. ANITA GRIGIO was off the pace, trailed throughout and was not a factor.

Footnotes
JACK BEANSTALK set the pace, took command on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. MONEY MATTERS
stalked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. BEN LOMOND was in touch and had a
mild gain on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. WENJACK was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. DE ONLY SOLUTION was away alertly, showed little and from the five path at the top of the stretch
was outrun. BEYOND MY DREAMS was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

KIDDIE HOLIDAY was unhurried early, had the lead on the far turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. ANTIGONE stalked the early
leader and had a good position on the far turn but was no match for the winner. REDOUTE'S LIGHT was well back, closed the gap on the far turn and from
the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. A I INITIATIVE was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch needed more. TRISH THE DISH set the pace and was a factor on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left.
PAPERBACK HERO was in range and roused on the far urn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. DOODLE DANDY showed no
speed and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no rally. SANTIAGO SALSA was in touch but chased on the far
turn and came up empty. SAILOR'S PASSION was in mid pack but lost ground on the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE set the pace, had a slim lead on the far turn, vied through the stretch and fought gamely for the win. TANGERINE TWIST stalked the
early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. ASHWICKEN was off the pace and moved
up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. LADY OF THE FORT was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but had
no late kick. RUMOURS FLY was unhurried early and roused from between foes on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more.
PRINCESS DIDI settled off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but was no threat. KIMONO KATE was in range but chased on the far turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. WICKEN CENTS was well back and closed the gap on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the
stretch had no impact. SPEEDY NEPHRITE was in mid pack early but lost ground on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.
