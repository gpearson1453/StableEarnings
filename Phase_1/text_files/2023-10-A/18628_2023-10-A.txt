and was inching up late. LOONA LUV was in the two path through the turn while on the inside on three, continued in the two path through the lane and

Footnotes
ETERNAL BLISS chased the pacesetter through the turn and into the lane, set down for the drive straightening into the lane, caught the leader inside the
sixteenth pole and cleared late. OTIS ON THE CAPE sprinted clear at once, extended the lead into and through the turn, was still well clear with an eighth to
go, was no match for the winner late then stayed on to be clear for the place spot. SILVER BULL raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane,
moved to the four or five path for the final eighth and was gaining to the wire. RUFFLED WATERS raced near the inside through the turn and into the lane
and offered a mild gain. JOINT VENTURE was in the four path throughout and showed late interest while not a serious threat. CENTAURO in the three path
through the turn while near the back and never factored. CLOVERTOWNE was closest early while in the two or three path, came into the lane from the six
path and never menaced. BIG ANCHOR chased the early pace along the inside through mid-turn then faded. HAWAIIAN HIDE AWAY trailed throughout
while in the three path.

Footnotes
INDICIA trailed for half while off the inside, angled into the five path into the lane while gaining momentum, continued with good energy through the lane
when closing in on three others and just got up while four wide at the wire. HOTHEADED PRINCESS was pocketed through the turn, came off the inside
and waited for room while straightening in the lane, shifted into the four path for the drive, gained momentum nearing the sixteenth pole, split rivals late and
was just outfinished by the top one. THE CLUB was in the two or three path through the turn, bid into the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go then
was outfinished. SPRING MAGIC pressed the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn, came into the lane from the five path, led
with an eighth to go then could not hold off the the top three. LEA RO vied for the lead from the two path through the turn and into the lane then gave way.
AMANDA'S CHALLENGE raced along the inside while pressing the pace then tired through the lane. MADRILENA (ARG) raced four wide through the first
turn, continued four wide and in the five path through the far turn then was empty after straightening in the lane. WILD IRISH was never a factor while off the

Footnotes
GOODY FOUR SHOES chased the pace along the inside through the far turn when never far back, cut the corner into the lane, quickly closed in on the
leader, caught that one outside the eighth pole then drew away. DABNEY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane while three
wide, was moving to the front when collared by the winner outside the eighth pole, was no match for that one and stayed on to be clear for the place spot.
SEQUEEKER chased the pace from the four path into the far turn, bid four wide into the lane, was no menace for the top two and settled for best of the rest.
REDHOTJUSTICE was in the two path through the turns and never was a a factor. TEN LIL VICTORIES set the pace on a clear lead through late turn and
gave way after entering the lane. CAROLYN'S ANGEL was never a factor while off the inside. FLAWLESS JUSTICE was brushed at the start and was
always far back.

Footnotes
C F V TU BRUTUS was unrushed early in the three path, bid four wide at the three-eighths pole, then drew off in the stretch and geared down nearing the
wire. MEAN ELENITA was unrushed early inside, bid in the two path at the eighth pole and closed late. PRETTY HEART stalked the pace in the three path,
then had no late bid. SUTTON'S PASS stalked the pace in the two path but faded in the stretch. LUSH BE A LADY trailed before passing tired rivals
outside. PAT'S PALACE dueled inside of ANGELSNDISGUISE before both faded in the stretch.
