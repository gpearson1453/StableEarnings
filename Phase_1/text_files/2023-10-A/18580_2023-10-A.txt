ASKMENOQUESTIONS away alertly and raced to the lead entering the first turn while dropping down to the rail, controlled the pace in the run through the
stretch the first time, maintained his advantage in the run down the backside, increased his lead through the final turn, and was never threatened late.
CHAMPIOSA tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground along the inside, maintained his position in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. SILARONE broke
sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held his position in the run down the backside, rallied two
wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove best of the rest. Following the running of this race, SILARONE appeared to
have had an issue and was pulled up on the backstretch and walked off under his own power. TUXEDO settled off the early pace while racing one out from
the rail entering the backside, began to advance midway down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in
the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. MILO'S COMMAND away well and settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, but
weakened over the final furlong. EH TEE EM unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make a late impression.

down the backside, continued to battle from the inside of FAMILY BIZ entering the final turn, got the better of his pace rival in mid stretch, and was all out to
hold off GOOD BYE PUTIN late to prevail. GOOD BYE PUTIN stalked the leaders into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, raced into a
tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed steadily at the rail in the drive to just miss. FAMILY BIZ
away well and pressed the pace from the outside of QUAGMIRE entering the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, and gave way grudgingly late. FOOT SOLDIER broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time
while racing one out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. BARNEY
GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the stretch the first time, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the

entering the final turn, and closed four wide in the drive to get the place. TIME TICKER settled at the back of a compact field entering the first turn, began to
creep closer in the run down the backstretch, shifted three wide to mount his bid entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive to garner a share.

WICKED NIGHT tracked the dueling leaders from along the inside entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, angled
inside leaving the turn, then shifted three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to prove best. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND broke sharply and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, disposed of her pace rival leaving the turn, but was
no match when tackled by WICKED NIGHT in mid stretch, but proved clearly second best. AZOV SEA away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the
rail entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND entering the lane, and finished four wide in the drive to garner a share. LOGICAL AL tracked the dueling leaders into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, chased the leaders three wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, but was outfinished in
the stretch drive.

ARTISTIC JEWLER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, began to advance three wide entering the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, shifted four wide leaving the turn to quickly assume command, and drew clear as much the
best. BELLAROO away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run
down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, while awaiting racing room, tipped four wide leaving the turn in an attempt to chase ARTISTIC
JEWLER, was no match for that rival late, but finished willingly four wide in the drive to prove second best. ZETAMARIE away alertly and tracked the
leaders through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, held her position in the run down the backside, rallied three wide through the final
turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. LIZZIES GIRL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the
stretch the first time, continued to set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and
faded in the drive. RICHARDS COMMAND rushed up to duel for the lead from the outside of LIZZIES GIRL entering the stretch the first time, continued to
force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and faded in the late stages. ICE
BREAKER stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, began to drop back in the run down the backstretch, and had
nothing to offer late.

Y VEE R away alertly and dueled for the lead into the first turn from the outside of ANOTHER GUINNESS, continued to battle with that rival into the
backstretch, took control approaching the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. KNOPFLER stalked the leaders into the backstretch while
racing two out from the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up for the place. SELF
SERVING tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished
one out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. DRILLER tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied
smartly two wide through the final turn, while awaiting room leaving the turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the stretch drive. RING OF KERRY
unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished six wide in the drive while improving his
position. TIZ MEOW broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch,
rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing four out from the rail in the drive. ANOTHER GUINNESS away well
and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch, was overtaken approaching the final
turn, and faded in the stretch drive.
