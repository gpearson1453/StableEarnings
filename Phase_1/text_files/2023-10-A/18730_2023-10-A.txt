Footnotes
RED BURGUNDY went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage while inside to the two path, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole
then came under a drive in upper stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, shortened stride into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging.
DIVIDEND RECAP was off slow and last to commence then asked to move up, settled on the inside, was roused on the final turn, moved off the rail under a
drive in upper stretch, shifted out more while picking up stride in the final furlong, closed well in the final sixteenth and just missed while able to get the
place. NAUGHTY DESTINY went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was asked in the three path on the far turn, moved out while
chasing in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. FAST AND FRISKY was taken under a tight hold early, saved
ground while well placed just off the pace, came out four wide into upper stretch, drifted out some in pursuit of the winner nearing the furlong marker and
lacked the needed kick. CALLING AN AUDIBLE bumped with a rival on the initial straightaway then was very rank under tight restraint, rounded the first turn
in the three path, was reserved near the back, raced greenly behind horses leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the final turn and improved position.
COACH SESSA broke in then was corrected by the rider, settled on the inside, steadied briefly against the rail at the five-sixteenths then was roused while
moving to the two path and lacked the needed response. PRETTY UP was off slow then had her path taken, raced under reserve near the rear while saving
ground, came out into the stretch then moved further out in the drive and failed to threaten. STARSINTHECITY moved in while taken in hand, was reserved
in the two path, dropped back on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SHE IS ALL BUSINES went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside
without the benefit of cover, was asked four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. SNARKY was taken under a tight hold
while forwardly placed early, rounded the first turn in the two path, tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, spun
five wide into upper stretch and came up empty. PRACTICAL ROYALTY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on
the far turn, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. SARATOGA SMOKESHOW bumped with a foe on the opening straightaway, went three
wide on the turns and faltered.

hand-ride to the finish and narrowly prevailed. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead
while drifting out in upper stretch, continued to drift out some while dueling inside of the winner in the final furlong and was denied. BUSINESS MODEL
dropped back under urging on the outside, went three then two wide early on the turn, moved back to the three then four path later on that bend, spun five
wide into the stretch and just got up for the show. KING ANGELO was restless in the gate, moved out while urged along off the pace, went four wide on the
turn and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. EASTERN BAY was urged along on the outside, dropped from the five path to the three
path early on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ANDIAMO A FIRENZE broke through the front of the gate prior to the start then
was brought back around and reloaded, set the pace under some pressure, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
NOTINAMILLIONYEARS (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, was unhurried at the rear, traveled four then five
wide on the far turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, drifted in while closing fast coming to the sixteenth-pole and blew by the embattled leading duo to win
going away. LE BEAU angled in early, saved ground on the first turn, moved out with five furlongs to run, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased three
wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole, dueled with RIVIERE into the final sixteenth and bested that foe for the place but was overtaken by the
winner. RIVIERE moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole, dueled inside of LE BEAU into the final
sixteenth and was also overtaken then just missed the place. I'M A SURE THING settled on the inside, was asked on the far turn, chased into the final
furlong, moved out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly. REMIND (IRE) was keen under restraint into the first turn, saved ground while reserved
towards the back, was asked turning into upper stretch, altered out from behind a foe inside the three-sixteenths then raced in light traffic and lacked the
needed kick. MADAKET'S ARROW rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved off the pace, bumped with a rival near the five-eighths, was roused
four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. TACITURN was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn,
was reserved in the back half of the field, traveled around the far turn in the two path and failed to rally. SHE WILL DANCE (IRE) went around the opening
turn in the two path, bumped with a rival while forced out near the five-eighths pole then dropped back, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten.
PUT THE CRAZY AWAY broke out at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far
turn, dropped back in upper stretch and came up empty. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE bumped with a foe at the start, went three wide on the turns and faltered
then was reported to have bled.

BOLD VICTORY settled on the outside, dropped back under urging outside the five-eighths pole, fell further behind the leaders late on the backstretch, was
urged four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch, gained in the final furlong and got up in the final sixteenth to prevail. HAMMERIN AAMER
tracked the pace, engaged the leaders in the three path on the turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch,
shook off DONTBELATE nearing the sixteenth-pole but was caught by the winner while able to get the place. DONTBELATE disputed the pace, vied in the
two path on the turn, battled under a drive until near the sixteenth-pole then weakened while clear for the show. PIT BOSS bumped with a rival at the start,
disputed the pace, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and tired. JOKER BOY was urged along while
disputing the early pace, dropped back with five furlongs to run, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. DIXIE DRAWL broke
in and brushed with a rival, was urged along off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. SALTO DE
TIGRE broke out and brushed with a rival, was well placed early, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and came up empty.
GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS bumped with a rival at the start, raced at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and never reached
contention. JUMPSTER dropped well off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and showed little.

final furlong and finished fast but was too late while up for the place. KERRY was well placed just off the pace on the inside, came out four wide into upper
stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. GEORGEES SPIRIT settled off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch and improved position. LOST MY SOCK angled in while

Footnotes
TAP IT UP was well placed while rated just off the pace on the inside, moved out behind the leaders while asked in upper stretch, rallied to make a bid
coming to the furlong marker and drew clear under steady urging. LADY JASMINE stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked on the far
turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong then was headed by the winner and proved no match while able to hold the
place. SISTER NELL saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, went three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and improved to just
get the show. FROM HELLO was reserved on the inside, came under encouragement on the final turn, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
kick then just missed the show. NIGHTSABER (GB) went two to three wide on both turns, was asked on the final bend, chased the leader into the final
furlong and weakened. ANILEATE was reserved in the two to three path, steadied between horses at the three-sixteenths, steadied again near the
sixteenth-pole then altered out and lost her best chance. RHEAUME went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, saved ground on the far
turn, brushed with a rival in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SARATOGA CHROME was restless in the gate then taken under a tight hold
early, saved ground while reserved towards the rear, dropped back with three furlongs to run, came off the rail into the stretch and was no factor. EXCEPT
TEMPTATION went around the first turn in the tow path, settled in the middle of the field, was roused in the two then three path on the far turn and failed to
threaten. PIMENOVA went three to four wide on the turns and failed to respond. JUDGEMENT TIME was taken under a tight hold early, went four wide on
the turns, came six wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. MOULY went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the
quarter-pole, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way.

CAPTAINSDAUGHTER chased the leading trio on the outside then four wide on the turn, gained to take the advantage in upper stretch, remained on her
inside lead until near the eighth-pole then swapped to the proper lead, drifted out under a right-handed crop late and held under steady urging. ROSEBUG
was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide early on the turn, angled five wide nearing the five-sixteenths, gained outside into upper stretch,
made a bid in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. RACHEL'S ROCK disputed the pace on the inside of two foes, vied along the rail on the
turn, dropped back in upper stretch and was outfinished but kept on with good courage to get the show. SELF ISOLATION contested the pace between
horses, vied in the two path while still between foes on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened. MOSIENKO stumbled at the start and was off
slow, spotted the front a few lengths, was coaxed at the rear, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, chased
into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. HEY MAMALUKE contested the pace on the outside of two rivals, vied in the three path on the turn

Footnotes
OKALOOSA was forwardly placed on the outside, went three wide on the turn, rallied to the lead in upper stretch and just held under strong urging.
SCHERZANDO bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, angled from the two path to the four path near the five-sixteenths, came five
wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid in the final furlong but just missed while clear for the place. BUSTINO SANTINO was urged along off the
pace, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the stretch, chased the winner in the drive and was outfinished while able to get the
show. TWIRLING VINE settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and improved position. EGYPTIAN QUEST broke out at
the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and lacked the needed kick. KY THIRTY WON broke out at the start, was urged along
on the outside, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. KERN RIVER was well placed just off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, waited behind the leaders into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and came up empty. SCARAMANGA was
away alertly, showed in front early then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. LOOKIN'
TO WIN brushed the inside of the gate at the start then bumped with a foe, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. WHISKEY AND WINE bumped with
a foe at the start, moved up to set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch and gave way.
KID EMERALD broke inward and was off very slow, spotted the front many lengths, saved ground on the turn, struck the hind-end of the loose rival in upper
stretch, swerved out then unseated the rider and was walked off after being apprehended. PROUD ALUMNUS settled towards the rear, rounded the turn in
the two path, came four wide into the stretch, ducked in very sharply near the three-sixteenths and unseated the rider then was walked off after being
apprehended.
