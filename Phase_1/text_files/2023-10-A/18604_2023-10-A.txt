Footnotes
HAPPY HELEN unhurried for the first half mile, closed ground to the far turn, started to circle four wide, instead dove back to the rail cutting the corner,
tipped out at the head of the lane, engaged the leader in mid-stretch and out-dueled that one to the wire in a well managed ride. HEART HEADED WOMAN
sent to the lead from the gates to open a clear advantage in the first turn, was well rated on a clear lead through the far turn, responded when engaged
inside the eighth pole and just missed in a good effort. POOL NOODLE tracked the pacesetter from the rail in striking distance, loomed up on the turn when
set to a drive and finished evenly for the show unable to sustain his rally. WICKED BEAUTIFUL slow early to trail the field into the far turn and rallied passed
weakening rivals down the stretch. ABBREVIATION raced five wide in the first turn, settled to be mid-pack down the backside, failed to menace throughout
and was vanned off after pulling up on the turn post-race. LIL CARRIE D prompted the pace for a half mile and faded on the far turn. KATERINA PETROVA
stalked the pace from between horses into the final bend and flattened out.

Footnotes
PAGEANT PURRFECT pressed the pace midway down the backstretch, bid two wide nearing the quarter pole to take command at the head of the lane,
pulled clear down the lane and was unthreatened to the wire. CLASSIC MYSTERY broke a step tardy to be at the rear of the field, gained ground through
the turn along the fence, angled four wide in upper stretch and found her best stride late to close with a rush. SAVE THE MOMENT stalked the leaders
through the turn and finished well to be gaining down the lane. SUMMER DANCE set the pace on a clear lead to the turn, dueled with the winner through
the turn to upper stretch and weakened late in the drive. VIVIS IN FRONT was prominently placed early on, dropped back in the turn and finished without
impact. BLUESUP GREENSDOWN was never a factor.

Footnotes
RACING IN MY HEART stalked the pace for the first three-eighths, rallied three wide in the turn to engage the leader and cleared off down the lane in a
drive. SLACKER set a pressured pace from the start, dueled through the turn on the lead and finished willingly to just hold the place. SAN RONIN reserved
off the pace for half mile to be near the rear of the field, angled to the clear and made a good belated rally to just miss the place. HE SAID CASH tracked the
pace from mid-pack and mounted a mild bid turning for home and finished evenly`. LITTLE RUSTY raced wide through the turn, drifted further out at the
head of the lane, leveled out and rallied in the lane when switching leads. WE MISS OTIS reserved off the pace to the turn, made a brief bid turning for
home and flattened out. PHILIP SNOW well placed for a half mile and faded coming home. WHITE SILVER SANDS flashed brief speed to duel on the early
lead and tired in the turn.

Footnotes
OVERTHETOPJUSTICE tracked the pace to the turn, ranged up three wide leaving the quarter pole, made a steady drive down the lane and prevailed in
the final stride by a flared nostril. LEO'S ROAR broke alertly to be on top, settled just off the leader down the backside, moved to press the pace in the turn,
dueled with the pacesetter to mid-stretch, shook clear of that one and was immediately engaged by the winner in deep stretch and was nailed in the final
stride in a very game effort. MISTER MACHO sped to an early clear lead down the backstretch, came under pressure in the turn, dueled to midway down
the lane and weakened deep in the drive. SUNSIGN unhurried for the first half mile, angled wide in upper stretch and made a late bid from five wide. MAS
ORO stalked the leaders from between horses into the turn and failed to gain ground. RUNNING SMART prominently placed in striking distance for the first
half mile and gave way down the lane. ALMIGHTYJUSTICE was never a factor.

Footnotes
HAWKS CREEK unhurried in the early going to be in the back half of the field, avoided trouble in the first turn, gradually closed ground up the backside after
working toward the rail, commenced a rally in the far turn angling out and bumping FULL DRESS BLUES, continued his bid four wide through the turn and
closed determinedly down the lane to be up inside the final yards. COPPERLITE stalked the pace to the far turn, made a three wide bid turning for home,
split rivals in the lane and finished willingly to be up for the place. HOT N LUCKY prompted the pace to the far turn, tipped out while rallying in the turn into
the path of MITOLE'S BAYTOWN causing that one to nearly clip heels, rallied up to take the lead inside the final eight and was caught in deep stretch.
EXTRA HALO broke alertly to set the pace, opened a clear lead in the final turn, kept on through the lane and was out-finished in deep stretch.
INMYDREAMS raced four wide into the first turn, angled in bumping FULL DRESS BLUES, causing that one to crowd UKRAINE STRONG who took up
sharply, then leveled off into a steady rhythm and went evenly failing to mount a bid. HOLD THE PHONE raced near the rear of the field to the head of the
lane and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. FULL DRESS BLUES raced three wide into the first turn, was bumped by INMYDREAMS and pushed into
UKRAINE STRONG, was gathered together and raced mid-pack down the backside, rallied up from three wide into the final bend, was bumped by HAWKS
CREEK when that one angled out, took up to regain stride and finished evenly from there the victim of a very rough trip. MITOLE'S BAYTOWN stalked the
pace from three wide to the far turn, nearly stumbled when cut-off by HOT N LUCKY and nearly lost his rider who maintained balance and gathered him up
to finish evenly coming home. NO MANCHES was never a threat. UKRAINE STRONG raced just off the fence into the first turn when caused to check
severely when INMYDREAMS angled inward, regained his momentum to be mid-pack down the backside and gradually faded having lost all chance early.
LUCERITO BLANCO was never a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE ACTIONS OF HOT N LUCKY IN THE FAR TURN AND THE
RIDER OF MITOLE'S BAYTOWN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HOT N LUCKY FOR THE INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN, IN ADDITION THE RIDER OF
UKRAINE STRONG CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST INMYDREAMS FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED HOT N LUCKY AND PLACED HIM SEVENTH AND DISQUALIFIED INMYDREAMS AND PLACED HIM TENTH.

FOREVER LASTING pressed the early pace in the three path, dueled inside around the turn, then drew off in the stretch and geared down in the final yards.
TANEYCOMO pressed the pace in the four path, dueled outside of the winner around the turn but proved no match. OUTSTANDINGJUSTICE raced five
wide and gained the show spot late. TURBONATOR led inside in the two path, gave way on the turn and was getting out then. SPARKY THE SLAYER
saved ground, then checked near the quarter pole. DOC BENNETT was off awkwardly. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF SPARKY THE SLAYER AGAINST TURBONATOR ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE TURN.

Footnotes
MIGHTY KAI reserved off the early pace from two wide down the backside, circled five wide in the turn to commence a rally, drifted to the eight path in
upper stretch and closed with a rush to be up in time. HEART OF OSCAR tracked the leaders from the fence through the turn, cut the corner and rallied well
up the fence to just miss. FINN AND BRENNAN unhurried early to be near the rear turning for home and closed well through the lane in a good try the was
not quite enough. NEW SPELL raced three wide through the first turn, made an early bid to loom up turning for home and finished evenly in the drive.
MIDNIGHT AWARD rated in mid-pack through the far turn and failed to gain ground in the lane. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT set the pace comfortably to the
quarter pole, responded when called upon for the drive and weakened late in the lane. NOBLE GENTLEMAN saved ground to be well positioned and
continued on one-paced without a rally. LEMON MERINGUE prompted the pace for three quarters of a mile and gave way down the stretch. SHIESTY TO
CHASE trailed through the first turn, made a mild move to the far turn and flattened out. BADGE OF WAR was never a factor. BARREL THIEF raced wide
through the first turn to settle into mid-field down the backside and tired.

Footnotes
NICHOLAS JONES settled in hand off the early pace, rallied through traffic on the turn to engage the leaders from four wide in mid-stretch and prevailed in
the drive. GRACEFUL KITTEN tracked the leaders to the far turn, rallied up three wide to take a brief lead in upper stretch and was outkicked down the lane
in a good effort. RIVER REDEMPTION reserved from the pace to be mid-pack, angled clear turning for home to threaten and finished willingly. MAJOR
SPARKS unhurried early to be near the back of the field and made a steady gain down the lane to hit the board. ENGLISH CHALLENGE was slow early to
be well off the leaders turning for home and mounted a belated rally down the lane finding his best stride late. INDOCUMENTADO tracked the leaders
through the first turn, made an early bid splitting rivals down the backside and finished evenly unable to sustain his rally. COMMAND CENTRAL pressed the
pace through the first turn, assumed command opening a clear advantage down the backside and weakened turning for home. GRAND HIDEAWAY
showed brief speed taking the early lead and faded. CASANOVA KITTEN tracked the pacesetters down the backstretch, made a three wide bid in the turn
to threaten and flattened out in the lane. GLOBAL EMPIRE was never a threat. DYNABLUE well placed in the first turn, dropped to the rear of the field on
the backside and was never a factor.
