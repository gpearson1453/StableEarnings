Footnotes
STAND FOR FREEDOM tugged forward along the inside to stalk into the turn, pursued under snug restraint around the bend, tipped out entering the lane,
took aim on the new leader from the four path in upper stretch, bid while hanging on his left lead at the furlong grounds and drove clear. CANAVALL briefly
dislodged his rider in the post parade while remaining in the grasps of his pony-person, tracked in the four path, crept closer into the turn, bid at the five
sixteenths pole, forged an advantage entering the lane, but was headed by an outer bidder leaving the furlong grounds and was second best. BLOCKED set
the pace in the two path, but was headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and yielded through the final furlong. CREATIVE WAY broke outwardly at the
start, bumped an outer foe and put another to tight quarters in the process, laid off of the pace into the turn, but was shuffled back behind a faltering foe
passing the three furlong pole to be towards the rear turning for home, yet regained stride and ran on for a minor placing. VALE took contact to his hind
quarters from an inner troubled rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, took closer order with three furlongs to go, but floated to the five path
entering the lane and tired. BUCKTOWN was bumped by an inner rival into an outer foe before taking back from crowded quarters between them at the
start, trailed in the aftermath, improved in the five path at the three furlong pole, but fanned to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally.
TALKSCHEAP transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, briefly trailed
passing the three furlong pole, swung to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. SHOTSHELL raced prominently early on, but shifted inwardly
while spooking and losing action leaving the chute, checked behind rivals with eleven sixteenths to go while chasing two wide and between horses, then
backed out entering the turn and subsequently faltered. MISTER MULDOON stalked in the three path, pursued between horses into the turn, then
weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
ANDY'S CANDY lacked speed early on, progressed in the five path around the turn before fanning to the six path entering the lane, sustained a rally to
range up to the leader at the sixteenth pole and edged past approaching the wire. STORMY MESA vied two wide while kept in the three path by his inner
counterpart around the turn, wrestled an advantage from that one entering the lane, drove clear while hanging on his left lead in midstretch, but was collared
by an outer on-charging for in the final sixteenth and was bested in the late stages. CAJUN FOOL tracked two wide into the turn, cleared an inner rival yet
still pursued from the two path turning for home, then chased along the rail in upper stretch, slipped inside of a foe to take aim inside of the leading pair in
the final furlong but needed more late. SALMING broke a step slow, raced off of the pace along the inside, steadied behind a tiring rival at the three furlong
pole, surpassed that one from the three path entering the lane and ran on willingly for a minor share. JILLY'S WEST led inside of a vying rival while
remaining a path off of the inner rail around the turn, got headed by that one entering the lane and tired between horses in the final furlong. HOT WINGS
shook his head just as the gate sprung and broke multiple lengths slow, trailed down the backstretch despite urging from the rider, advanced inside of
faltering foes at the three furlong pole, tipped out entering the lane and ran on mildly between horses. STORMIN LOVE raced off of the pace in the four
path, shifted to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. CRUISIN AND BOOZIN bumped an inner rival at the start, chased along the inside but
faded at the three furlong pole. THE RUSH IS ON chased between horses for half a furlong and folded. PATRIOT HILLS stalked in the four to five path, but
weakened between horses in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. TAP ANCHOR broke a beat slow before bumping with an outer rival at the start,
raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses into the turn and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
STRETCH RIDE stalked three to two wide and between horses around the first turn, prompted along with an outer rival down the backstretch, led in the two
path as that one sustained pressure around the far turn, shook clear of him entering the lane and inched away while hanging on his left lead. LIGHTLINE
tracked four to three wide around the first turn, moved to press while perched outside of the top pair down the backstretch, vied with only a single inner rival
while kept in the three path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane and was second best while also hanging on his left
lead. SEIZE THE GREY raced forwardly two wide and between horses, backed out around the far turn, tracked down the backstretch, chased the clearing
leading pair from the three path while among foes around the far turn, then ran on to secure show. HAM SANDWICH stalked along the inside while under
snug restraint around the first turn, but was shuffled back behind a tiring ASTRONOMICO around the far turn, shifted outside of that one nearing the lane
and lacked a bid. EDIFIED pursued from midpack five to four wide around the first turn, but lacked response to urging outside of rivals around the far turn
and tired in upper stretch. STICKY NOTE trailed around both turns and got outrun. ASTRONOMICO set the pace along the inside, led from a pair of outer
pressers down the backstretch, but weakened with just over five sixteenths to go and caved.

Footnotes
CHARRIERE set the pace along the inside, shook clear entering the lane as an outer rival took aim, drifted across that one's path at the furlong grounds and
held sway. WILLOW BEND tracked along the inside, loomed a danger turning for home, flopped leads and paused under restraint while hesitant to split foes
at the five sixteenths pole, then smoothly took aim outside of the clearing leader entering the lane, chased as that shifted across her path in the final furlong,
attempted a bid along the inside in the late stages but was kept at bay. STREET JAM stalked four wide and between horses, then three wide into the turn,
but came under urging in the four path turning for home, failed to keep pace with the top pair in upper stretch and ran on mildly to secure show. MAOTAI
pressed two wide and between horses, but weakened drifting three wide entering the lane. COEXIST took contact from rivals on both sides before yielding
out of crowded quarters soon after the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and failed to menace. SHELL SHOCK tracked five to four wide, but faded
in the five path turning for home. ROC'S PRINCESS fidgeted about just before the gates sprung causing him to be unprepared for the start, hopped and
came out many lengths behind the rest, lagged behind and was outrun. YOU GOTTA HAVE FUN (IRE) raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but
faltered at the half mile pole, was eased around the turn, pulled up in upper stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
ZIPADOO broke inwardly and bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, tracked in the three path among foes
around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds and inched clear. KING'S SECRET (GB) stalked two wide,
bid around the far turn, vied in the three path in upper stretch, led briefly entering midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder inside the final furlong,
then narrowly saved place from an outer bidder at the wire. ENGLISH TREASURE settled far back two wide, gradually shifted out six wide in the final
furlong, produced a late kick while hanging on his left lead and just missed reaching place. HECKLED laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer five wide
turning for home, chased entering the final furlong while flopping to and from his left lead once shown a right handed crop, did so two more times while
feeling strikes in the final furlong, yet ran on in the late stages, got outkicked by an outer rival late and missed reaching show. CATMINT took contact from
an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, tipped to the two path nearing the lane, split foes to offer a bid inside of the leaders at the furlong
grounds, but shifted in and flattened out shortly after. BLESSING THE FLAG hopped and broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, then lacked a bid in
the three path. BOLTORO trailed along the inside, then three wide around the far turn, drifted out to the nine path in upper stretch and lacked a rally.
SOUTHAMPTON DOCK tracked three wide, chased under urging in the four path around the far turn then gave way wider entering the lane. ANIMAL
FRIES set a clear pace early on, was confronted by an outer challenger around the far turn, then faltered nearing the furlong pole.

Footnotes
DORNOCH set the pace in the two path before moving down to the rail entering the backstretch, embraced an outer challenge into the far turn, sparred
before swiftly kicking away entering the lane and drew off while hanging on his left lead. DJANGO brushed an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear two
wide, launched a rally in the five to six path into the far turn, moved down to the four path turning for home, then sustained his charge to gain place in the
final sixteenth. LAT LONG pressed outside of the leader and from the three to two path into the backstretch, bid entering the far turn, dueled around that
bend, but was turned away while proving no match for his inner counterpart entering the lane, weakened and lost place late. NUEVO EMPIRE pursued from
midpack along the inside, gained show from outer rivals approaching the far turn, chased the top pair from the two to three path around that bend then
faded. GREERS FERRY bounced off an outer rival before bumping an inner foe at the start, tracked while hung five wide, then gave way in the four to five
path around the far turn. ALLIED VICTORY brushed with an inner rival before taking contact from an outer foe at the start, stalked in the four to three path
around the first turn, then faded around the far turn. TENNESSEE LAMB bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three path,
lacked a response to urging between horses around the far turn and failed to factor. MIDNIGHT MAESTRO raced at the rear along the inside, lagged behind
around the far turn and was outrun. REDFIELD took contact from rivals on both sides at the start, pursued from midpack in the three to two path and
between horses around the first turn, was held up behind a rival at the five furlong pole, then weakened along the inside turning for home.

Footnotes
NINEELEVENTURBO stalked along the inside, bid in the three path and outside of the leader entering the lane, sparked a duel in the process, wrestled a
narrow advantage in upper stretch, shifted in and brushed his game counterpart inside the final furlong, sparred neck-n-neck through the late stages and
prevailed. FOREIGN RELATIONS set the pace in the two path, met an outer challenge entering the lane, fought on after getting headed at the three
sixteenths pole, took minor contact leaving the furlong grounds, tenaciously sustained the battle through the late stages but narrowly missed. SHARAR
bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, pursued from the three path around the far turn, got outmoved by an inner
rival while floated to the four path entering the lane, failed to keep pace with the top two in upper stretch and held show. O P FIRECRACKER pursued from
midpack in the three path, then two to three path around the second turn, crept closer in the five path around the far turn before tucking back to the three
path entering the lane, and chased the leaders evenly thereafter. QUADRA ISLAND laid off of the pace in the three path, got floated to the seven path by an
inner rival turning for home, moved back down to the four path in upper stretch and moved up between horses. ALTAZOR (ARG) saved ground in midpack,
chased under urging around the final bend, tipped out entering the lane and failed to menace. SEVEN CHARMS saved ground far off of the pace, improved
turning for home, shifted out in upper stretch and tired. KITTEN MISCHIEF trailed in the two path and failed to factor. STOLEN BASE bumped with an inner
rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, altered course to the six path nearing the five sixteenths pole and gave way. MONTAUK POINT stalked
three wide, pressed down the backstretch, but wilted in the four path and between horses around the final bend and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ACCEDE tracked four to three wide into the turn, took aim on the clearing leader from the four path entering the lane, drove past that one in the three path
at the furlong grounds, cleared as ZEITLOS gave chase, drifted out and across that one's path entering the final sixteenth and held sway. ZEITLOS tracked
in the two path, pursued behind foes turning for home, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, gained place as the clear
leader drifted across his path at the sixteenth pole and chased that one home. PUMPKIN SCONE set the pace along the inside, dueled with an outer bidder
around the turn, kicked away from that one entering the lane as an outer ACCEDE took aim, but was bested by that one at the furlong grounds, gave way
yet lasted for show. DEAR LADY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, fanned to the six path entering the lane, then stayed on willingly but needed
more to gain show. RARIFY lacked speed in the six to five path into the turn, got floated to the seven path entering the lane and surpassed tiring rivals.
MUCHO MACHO GIRL was last away while off a half step slow, recovered to stalk along the inside, but chased in upper stretch before fading. LITTLE
BLAZE pressed three wide, dueled with only an inner rival around the turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane. YOU LITTLE VIXEN prompted
the pace two wide and between horses early on, but chased her counterparts into the turn and tired. THREE TIPSY CHIX lagged behind around the turn
and was outrun. ROSIE'S ALIBI lacked speed along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
MAWJ (IRE) set the pace two wide into the first turn, cleared and crossed over exiting that bend, showed the way inside of an outer bidder around the far
turn, spurted clear in upper stretch, maintained a clear advantage through midstretch and held well from an outer on-charging foe late. LINDY (FR) broke a
bit outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace while tucking down from the three path to the rail leaving the first turn, saved ground in pursuit around the far
turn, shifted out four wide at the furlong grounds, produced a good late kick to surge up to the well-traveling leader approaching the wire, but ran out of
ground. MISSION OF JOY stalked along the inside, gained place while taking aim outside of the leader coming to midstretch, but only managed to chase
that one through the final furlong and was outkicked by an outer rival for place in the late stages. ELUSIVE PRINCESS (FR) stalked two wide, prompted
around the far turn before bidding nearing the lane, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart in upper stretch and yielded between horses in the
final furlong. SOUNDS OF HEAVEN (GB) tracked two wide and between horses down the backstretch, was roused for run among foes around the far turn,
but lacked a response and failed to menace. LIGURIA raced at the rear in the three to four path and outside of rivals, swung to the seven path entering
upper stretch but lacked a rally. ELOUNDA QUEEN (IRE) saved ground at the rear of the field, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch but failed to
factor. PAPILIO (IRE) tracked four to three wide around the first turn, chased around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the top flight while leaning in
and hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, then weakened. FREYDIS THE RED (FR) pursued from midpack five to three wide around the first turn,
floated to the six path in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FIRST MISSION stalked along the inside, was blocked behind a wall of rivals while entering the lane in the three path, tipped five wide and between horses
at the furlong grounds, then rallied to forge an advantage in the shadow of the wire. COMMANDPERFORMANCE laid off of the pace in the three path,
tracked four wide into the far turn, ranged up to bid turning for home, vied and wrestled a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an
outer bidder nearing the wire. COOKE CREEK stalked two wide and between horses, chased in the three path around the far turn before fanning six wide in
upper stretch, stayed on outside of rivals in the late stages in hopes of producing a bid, but just missed reaching place. CREATIVE MINISTER tracked in the
three to four path early on, pressed three wide and between horses into the far turn, bid turning for home, vied through midstretch but was bested by outer
rivals in the final sixteenth. KEYSTONE FIELD saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the three path approaching the furlong grounds and ran on.
IMPLEMENTATION pressed the leader while rank in the three path around the first turn, settled and vied around the far turn before outer rivals bid turning
for home, then yielded to them leaving the furlong grounds. ROMAN CENTURIAN trailed in the three path and failed to factor. AIRTIME set the pace along
the inside, but was headed by a trio of rivals nearing the lane and weakened in upper stretch.
