ITSALLGOODMAN quickly took command, held good margins through the backstretch, rider peered underarm then geared down when uncovered. JUMP
THE QUEUE stalked the early pace from the three path, raced in closest pursuit, was no match for the winner, and held safely for second. B B'S WILDFIRE
rated from off-the-pace between foes, dropped back in the final turn, and finished evenly. SILKSTONE trailed early and showed a mild interest late.
JODEYS LIL PAIN saved ground and was done early.

SMILIN EVIE brushed outside rival leaving, vied for the early lead then emerged the leader entering the backstretch, turned back a challenge from
BOOTIFUL ROSE into the final turn, and drew clear. DIXIE MO broke outward leaving, gained closer order outside through the backstretch, drove four to
five wide at the head of the lane, and was along in time for second place. BOOTIFUL ROSE brushed away from the gate, vied in the two path, sat just off
the pace, loomed boldly nearing the final turn, was unable to get by the eventual winner, and was caught late. LITTLE HARPER lacked running room
leaving the chute, trailed early, lodged a rail bid while advancing quickly nearing the stretch then flattened. THRILL OF THE NITE attended the pace while
three wide, and came up empty late. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE vied four wide into the opening turn, and was outrun.

WISH ON A STAR contested the early pace outside of BUSTER BRADY, inherited the lead leaving the backstretch, opened up to good margins, and stayed
clear under light handling. BRYNN'S DREAM reserved off the early pacesetters, lodged an all-out bid into the stretch but was no match for the winner, and
finished second-best. OUR SUNSHINE unhurried early, gained closer order under encouragement, and finished with good energy. ALBERTA BERBON
trailed early, chased through the far turn, and was outkicked. KISS ME HELLO chased the pacesetters through the backstretch, moved up menacingly in the
far turn, but had nothing left in reserve. SMOKIN JOY outsprinted through the opening turn and was outrun. BUSTER BRADY contended the early pace
from the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual winner, and faded.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE GOLD raced near the back of the pack early, circled the field into the lane, and narrowly prevailed after a multi-horse scramble to the wire.
WALKTHELINE stalked the pace from the rail, lacked running room in the final turn, angled in sharply when a seam appeared, gained a slim advantage, and
was narrowly denied. TOOL TIME set the pace from the two path, was under attack into the final turn, and was worn down late finishing on the wire for third
at the same time as MOUNT ASGARD. MOUNT ASGARD sat just off the pace from the three path, pressed the issue in the final turn, rallied determinedly
through the stretch, and finished third best on the wire with TOOL TIME. SAXON SAGA tracked the pace from the three path, rallied four to five wide in the
final turn, and gave way late stretch. *Photo Finish Malfunction- The order of finish was determined by the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the pace from the rail, shifted outside into the final turn, rallied gradually through the stretch, and inched clear. COMMON
KNOWLEDGE broke alertly to set the pace, showed the way through the backstretch, and was worn down late. EXAMINER sat midpack, angled down to
the rail at the head of the stretch, and improved position late. BIG AL'S VISION raced three to four wide into the opening turn, and lacked a closing response
that was needed. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR trailed early, and lodged a late mild bid. DUNE D'ORO stumbled after the start, and lacked a serious bid. ISLE
OF SKYE offered little. PUMP THE BRAKES chased the pace from the three path, and yielded into stretch.
