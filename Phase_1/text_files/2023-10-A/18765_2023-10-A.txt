Footnotes
PUGLIA stalked the leaders in the early going, took the advantage around the final turn, pulled away and was in hand late. MSCHITCHATTOUR lacked
early speed, made a steady gain, racing outside around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SENSE OF FLURRY went to
the front, drove clear, saved ground and lacked a late rally. STOP SHOP N DROP raced near the middle of the field, came around the first turn on the
outside, made a mild bid and hung. MARDI GRAS ALARM pressed the early pace and faded. RYAN'S GRACE raced within striking distance, faded and
finished evenly near the back. CAJUN TWO STEP void of early speed, finished wide and was never close. INDY LOVER raced in the middle of the field and
dropped back. SODDY DAISY lacked early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
BITSY C C LIL GIRL unhurried in the beginning, racing wide around the first turn, moved up around the final turn, took command, drove clear and was very
much in hand at the wire. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN dueled on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear
second. SHE'S MY PRIORITY raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid and got up for the show. MISS CHARLIE GRAS dueled for the early lead,
saved ground and weakened. LOVIN LIVIN lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE raced within striking distance
and faded. COZZOLANI always raced near the back and was outrun. MO BELLA raced within contention and dropped.

MO CREDO unhurried in the early part, moved up, racing between rivals around the final turn, angled out at the head of the home stretch, rallied and
finished well. LO LO'S LAUGHTER bumped at the start, went to the front, drove clear, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. GOBOT
lacked early speed, gained ground and proved third best. COCAL raced within contention, made a mild bid, hung and lacked a finish. KING OF
CONTRABAND raced near the middle of the pack, made a bid and faded. PINCH HITTER pressed the early pace and dropped back. TACTICAL VISION
broke out, bumped, raced in the back and showed little.

OAK HILL LG raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a bid and rider hand rode him to the front in a confident
ride. I WILL STAND vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead down the home stretch, but couldn't hold off the winner.
FLASHY PREMO lacked early speed, gained ground late and was a clear third at the wire. ARCTIC ROSE had an awkward start, racing from the back,
gained ground, but was no real factor. CHIEF CHARLIE pressed the pace, faded, finished evenly, lacking a late kick. SECOND OF JULY broke in, went to
the front and tired down the final stretch. AUTOPILOT raced in the middle of the field and weakened. INDIMAAJ pressed the early pace and was finished
early. LIARS CLUB raced near the middle of the pack in the beginning and retreated. PROMISING SHOES bumped at the start, raced in the back and was
never close.
