Footnotes
SECRET ZIPPER pressed the pace four wide early, then three wide on the turn, made a bid off the turn and had a long drive with WESLEY THOMAS and
was bumped by that rival by the sixteenth marker and then prevailed late to prove best. WESLEY THOMAS rushed up the inside to vie for command by the
half mile peg, then went on to set a pressured pace on the inside, then dueled for command off the turn, had a stretch duel with the winner and dug in
gamely but just missed late in a gutsy effort. FREE DROP BACH vied for the early lead between rivals three wide, then prompted the pace two wide on the
turn, tipped out leaving the turn and weakened, held show award. MINNY SPEIGHTSTER was away alertly to show good speed early, vied for the lead two
wide and in between rivals by the half mile marker, then fell back on the turn and dropped to the inside, then was no threat in the lane. DOWNPATRICK was
bumped at the start, settled and three wide on the turn but had no rally. HORSESHOE PATSY was reserved on the inside and failed to menace. HOT ON
YOUR HEELS was bumped and had to steady after the start, then was three wide on the turn and not a factor.

Footnotes
PRACTICAL WAY set the pace while clear early on the inside, then turned back an early bid at the half mile marker, shook clear on the turn and then drew
off in the stretch to prove much the best, ridden out. LEAOFLITTLEFAITH stalked the pace three wide, made an early bid by the half mile marker to press
the pacesetter, could not sustain that bid so stalked the pace on the turn and then proved to be no match for that rival in the lane, clearly second best.
MIDNIGHT STRIKES chased the pace on the inside and continued to save ground on the turn and weakened, stayed on for the show award. OILER was
four wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and made a mild bid four wide by the half mile marker, then continued to chase the pace four wide on
the turn and weakened. BOCA GUY chased the pace in between rivals three wide and weakened. THE BEARRISH ONE was five wide into the first turn,
then settled on the turn and was three wide, then moved out and had a wide pursuit by the half mile marker, five wide on the far turn and tired.
DAREDAVITE chased the pace in between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
MUCHO TIGGER showed good speed from the outside to set a pressured pace early three wide, then drew clear on the turn in hand, then remained clear
by the furlong marker, then was given a couple of pops left handed with the crop inside the furlong grounds to maintain attention to prove much the best,
sharp. BOLD BABY stalked the pace three wide, then chased the winner three to two wide on the turn while under urging, proved to be no match for that
rival while clearly second best. LATE NITE LIZZIE was off slowly and hit the gate at the start, outrun early, three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and
was along for the show award. JUST THE THING was reserved early, advanced on the turn but lacked a late rally. LITTLE CRYBABY was settled back
early, angled out in the lane and had no rally. AMIRATI chased the pace four to five wide and weakened. LADY PROSPECT pressed the pace on the inside
and stopped.

POWER SQUEEZE was four wide into the first turn,was reserved early four wide,, made a huge five wide move on the turn to move into contention, vied for
command off the turn and then drew out in the final furlong to prove much the best, driving. MATCHING ENERGY was fractious pre-race, reluctant to load,
then broke sharply to set a pressured pace early on the inside, then shook clear by the half mile marker, then was headed leaving the turn and could not go
with the winner in the final furlong while staying on to be second best. STILL TEMPER tracked the early pace four wide, made a bid four wide nearing the
quarter pole but flattened out, stayed on for the show award. FREE CHARGING tracked the pace and made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole but
came up empty in the drive. VICTORIA'S DANCER was off slowly, reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn
and had a mild late rally. BIG BOLT was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a rally. SALTY GIRL was off slowly, settled back early, three wide on the
turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and was not a threat. PURE MAGIC GIRL was settled back early and failed to menace. BERNA DITTY was off
slowly, five wide into the first turn, then had a outside pursuit on the backstretch, four wide on the far turn and tired. TAKE THE COOKIES prompted the
pace three wide and stopped.

OFFSHORE AFFAIR was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then dueled for
lead off the turn, dug in gamely in the furlong grounds and edged clear late to prove best, driving. COLONEL MOORHEAD tracked the pace three wide,
made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, dueled for command off the turn and stuck a nose in front in th e furlong grounds but hung late. MARVIN set the
pace while in the two path, then was headed on the turn, drifted out in the lane and stayed on for the show award. MOUNT TRAVERS was reserved early,
advanced four wide on the turn, angled in leaving the turn and had no late kick. DREAM LINER (BRZ) was allowed to settle early, three wide on the turn and
had no rally. OFFICER COUNTRY stumbled at the start, raced wide and was not a threat. JOE PHILLIPS tracked the pace on the inside and tired. ROCK
SOLID GOLFER raced on the inside and was through after a half, eased in the lane, walked off.

Footnotes
KIRBY was rated early, inside to two wide on the turn while in hand, awaited room leaving the quarter pole, then slipped through on the inside of MOON ME
AGAIN by the furlong marker and then was given one pop right handed with the crop and drew away to prove best. PLAYERA was settled early on the
outside, made a six wide move on the turn by the quarter pole, came widest into the lane and finished well to gain the place award on the wire. MOON ME
AGAIN tracked the pace on the inside, then was boxed by the quarter pole, made a inside bid leaving the turn to take over and draw clear by the three
sixteenths, then was headed leaving the furlong marker and faded, lost place award wire. ROSY APPLE stalked the pace five wide and made a five wide bid
by the quarter pole to vie for command but then came up empty in the lane. BEACH HOUSE vied for the lead on the inside, two wide off the turn and
weakened. CUP OF LIFE prompted the pace four wide, between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. SALSA RITA vied for the lead three wide,
between rivals by the quarter pole and stopped.
