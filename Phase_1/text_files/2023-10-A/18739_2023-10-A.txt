was outfinished. SUPER GEUSE rated between rivals mid pack, moved up inside through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
steadied slightly, made a steady gain, angling out late and missed the place. MULSANNE (IRE) mid pack and outside, looped up two and three wide

Footnotes
I STRONG well placed between, angled in and moved up inside through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain,
edged ahead, then drew off late and was kept to the task. ON AN ISLAND tracked the pace, moved up inside to gain a short lead through the turn, then was
no match the final furlong and stayed on to hold the place safe. BANG A RANG broke sharply and vied for the early lead on the outside, dropped back
through the turn, came through on the two path into the stretch, evened out and gained the show. BRADY unhurried early, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside into the stretch and got up for a share. CACTUS KEVIN allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the stretch and flattened out. WEEKEND CHARGE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, then faded
four wide into the stretch. LARRY'S LUNCHBOX well placed and between, held position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and
had no rally. INSTIGATING set the early pace on the inside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
FLIGHT TO PARADISE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through on the two path into the stretch, made a steady gain, shook clear
late and lasted under steady pressure. PHARAOH FANCY PANT mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the
stretch, angled out, then was carried out and closed the gap on the winner late. PONT DU GARD mid pack and outside, gained position into the second
turn, moved up three and four wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out late. MOUNTAIN TREE allowed to settle, looped up
three and four wide through the second turn, angled widest into the stretch and got up for a share. HEATHER'S GOLD sprinted away from the field early,
stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded in the final yards. EXPRESS PHAROAH well placed and outside, moved up to gain a short lead
through the second turn, then drifted out in the stretch and faded. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was no factor. PREFECT was never involved.
