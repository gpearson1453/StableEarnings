Footnotes
DISCREETLY THRIFTY was reserved early, made a five wide move on the far turn to move into contention, then closed well to duel for command by the
sixteenth marker and then got up late to prove best, driving. UNXPECTED TIGER was settled on the outside, made a four wide move on the turn to vie for
command, then dueled for the lead by the sixteenth marker and was out-gamed late by the winner. NEW JERSEY HEIST stalked the early pace, then went
up to vie for the lead three wide, then was between rivals by the quarter pole and faded the final furlong, bested rest. LIOTTA stalked the early pace, then
made a bid between rivals by the five sixteenths, then vied for the lead on the inside by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. FINN'S POINT was off a
step slow, then void of early speed, seven wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally. SETTE STELLE was reserved early, made a six wide move on
the turn but flattened out in the lane. EL BUFFALO was allowed to settle on the inside and lacked a serious rally. SUN OF SILVER was allowed to settle
early, advanced two wide on the turn, inside entering the drive but lacked the needed stretch bid. EL GRAN CUYAYA was keen early and set a fast pace
early and then gave way on the turn. TAKEOVER KASH stumbled badly at the start, made a five wide move on the far turn to be in contention, then went
bad leaving the quarter pole and was pulled up leaving the turn, vanned off.

then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. THE GREAT GAZOO was allowed to settle, three wide on the turn, swung out five wide
leaving the turn and finished well, second best. MY HANDSOME MAN was settled back early, two wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show
award. TUNA N STAMPS was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, made a mild bid off the turn on the inside but had no late kick, missed show
award. HEXAGON was away alertly, stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command nearing the quarter pole, but flattened out.

needed more late. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED tracked the pace on the inside and tipped out three wide leaving the turn but had no kick. NOTTOWAY tracked
the pace five wide, four wide on the turn and weakened. SALTO DE TIGRE was off a step slow, outrun early, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally.

Footnotes
POLTERER vied for the early lead on the inside, then rated off the pace, then made a inside bid nearing the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best,
driving. WHAT DOES IT TAKE vied for the lead three wide on the first turn, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch and two wide, then was
pressured on the turn but dug in gamely but was out-kicked in the lane, held place award. BOBBY G was off a step slow, then was reserved early, made a
five wide move on the turn and then had a late gain to just miss the place award. AIN'T WASTING TIME vied for the early lead in between rivals, then rated
off the pace, made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out the final furlong. MY MAN VITO was allowed to settle early, two to three wide on the turn
but lacked the needed bid. IT'S SIZZLING TIME was five wide into the first turn, then chased the early pace on the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. SPEARGUN was rated between rivals on the first turn, then was three to four wide on the far turn, had to check when
GOLDEN GULLEY fell in front of him leaving the five sixteenths, then had no late rally. GOLDEN GULLEY tracked the pace four wide, then was between
rivals three to four wide on the turn and clipped heels by the five sixteenths and fell, walked off. There was no head on replay so notes are from pan view.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT CLASS tracked the early pace on the inside, made a two wide bid off the turn and edged clear leaving the furlong marker, then held on late
to prove best. MY MAGGIE MOO was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and closed well to
just miss. IT'S HER TIME was keen early to set the early pace on the inside while clear under a hard hold, then was headed nearing the furlong marker and
weakened, bested rest. MAKEMEBELIEVE was allowed to settle early, four wide on the turn and had no rally. BELLA PALOMA was allowed to settle early,
five to six wide on the far turn and had no rally. KIZZY was off slowly, advanced on the inside on the turn but had no late rally. VODKATINI was settled early,
four to five wide on the turn and weakened. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS tracked the early pace four wide, then was three wide and tired.

Footnotes
LUNITA was away alertly, vied for the early lead three to two wide, then made a bid to shake clear on the turn and drop to the inside, then drew out leaving
the turn and was given one reminder right handed in the furlong grounds and then was under mild urging to prove best while clear. SANSA ARIEL tracked
the early pace in between rivals, then advanced three wide on the turn and gained the place award in the furlong grounds while no match for the winner.
CHEM MAJOR was off slowly, advanced three wide to track the pace, made a two wide bid on the turn but flattened out, bested rest. CHILD PROOF
tracked the early pace from the inside, steadied slightly nearing the seven sixteenths, then saved ground but had no kick. SCOREBOARD LILY was outrun
early, three wide on the turn, angled out widest in the lane and had no rally. MO STYLISH vied for the lead on the inside and wealened.
