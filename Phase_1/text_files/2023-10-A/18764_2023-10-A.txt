came around the far turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. ALEXA'S DREAM raced in the two path early, settled
off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and passed tiring horses in the lane. PATTY
CAKES was fractious in the gate, stumbled leaving it, saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. SIX THE HARD WAY chased the leader on the outside around the first turn and up
the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and faded from there. INDY AGAIN saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and made no bid.

and drew off in the lane. THEDINGOATEYOBABY raced in the two path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the second
bend from the three path and chased the winner home. CRAZY MASON raced off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, began to move up
while racing in the three path around the far turn and continued to improve position in the lane. DEPOSITION raced in the four path around the first bend,
tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four path and finished evenly. BOLT OF AURUM saved ground
early, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch and around the far bend and was outkicked in the lane. FRANKIE'S EMPIRE saved ground around

stretch. REAL SENSATION saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path and never
threatened. AMERICAN WAR HERO raced in the middle of the pack in the three path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path
