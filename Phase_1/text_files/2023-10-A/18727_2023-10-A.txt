LAWN DART sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. GOOD
MONGOLIA stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide outside the leader into the stretch, then closed
well for the place. DOWN TO EARTH unhurried, moved up on the two path through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up for the show in the final strides. CINCO DE MANDEE tracked the pace, moved up through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch,
angled out for clear racing room and flattened out. MONGOLIAN MISSION allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch and passed a tiring rival. WILD LOOKER well placed and outside, steadily lost ground.

edged up for a share. MIDNIGHT PIRATE mid pack, moved to a striking position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the

Footnotes
OLDZFOURFORTYTWO well placed and outside, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and
edged up in the final strides. PAPA HONOR allowed to settle, circled the field through the turn, came widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and
missed. FEVOLA mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady
gain, then angled in late finding room and edged up for the show. EPIC (ARG) tracked the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled three
wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead inside the furlong marker, then flattened and held a share. WHERE YOU WAS hopped at the start,
looped up three wide through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch and ran evenly. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR stalked the pace on the outside, moved up
to vie for the lead through the turn, bid outside of that one into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened the final furlong. GOLD WING was no factor.
PROFESSOR DAVE set the pace on the inside and faded the final furlong.
