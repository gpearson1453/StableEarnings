Footnotes
LULU'S LULLABY had a perfect setup sitting all alone comfortably behind the embattled trio down the backstretch at the half, was content throughout the
turn in the third flight waiting to move, began to reel in foes outside at the quarter pole, swung out four wide looming the threat turning for home, pounced
quickly to take control at the eighth pole and was going away for the win at the wire. BELLASPINA stalked near the rear on the fence down the backside,
made little impact saving ground on the turn, surged late on the fence passing the early speed horses at the furlong marker and got up for the runners up
share crossing the finish. ROSES ARE FREE prompted the pace four wide right from the start, emerged alone with the lead entering the turn, continued
setting quick fractions up front around the bend, was collared, giving way to the outside winner at the furlong marker and faded late between foes to
narrowly hold for third money at the line. TANGERINE TWIST had a slim lead between runners in the early going, chased the pacesetter outside horses
running through the turn, stubbornly battled with others on each side at the top of the lane and just missed out for place at the wire when involved in the
three horse photo for second at the finish. MY ASSISTANT dueled on the rail for the lead from the start, was relegated to chase the loose frontrunner on the
rail through the turn, fought on to be in the mix in the two path in upper stretch for a share and levelled off in the final sixteenth. MAGNETIZE broke outwards
on the start, trailed the field outside down the back straight, offered a mild run catching up to a rival through the turn and had nothing to give in the stretch
run to the wire.

Footnotes
RIVER OF BABYLON was unhurried to trail down the back straight, began to pick up horses when nudged three wide at the three eighths marker, sharply
moved around foes extending his stride at the quarter pole, lurked outside runners in the five path turning for home and wore down the leaders through the
stretch to get up just before the wire in a well timed late move. SERENADE AT SEA chased outside in the three path down the backside, continued to chase
after the pacesetter inching closer on the turn, was in the hunt three wide between challengers at the top of the stretch, determinedly poked his head in front
briefly with a sixteenth to go but could not hold off the closing winner outside nearing the finish. AMAZON FORESTER broke in brushing rival at the start,
made an early move five wide around horses seven sixteenths from the line, continued to gain through the turn to loom the threat in the four path
straightening out for the drive, could not sustain the run and was outkicked in the final sixteenth of a mile to settle for third money in the end. SMOKIN
HOLIDAY was brushed outside on the break, travelled in mid-pack between rivals down the backstretch, rallied when splitting runners midway on the turn,
started to gain more momentum up the fence at the quarter marker, shifted just outside in range driving to the wire, battled gamely in tight surroundings with
an eighth to run but needed more late to threaten at the wire. MAKES NO CENTS took command from the start, dictated the pace alone running around the
bend, was asking for the wire having a slim advantage on the fence with a furlong remaining and faltered inside with a sixteenth to run. BUSTA GROOVE
tracked in the third flight in the two path at the half mile marker, was shuffled back in tight quarters between runners three furlongs to go, put in a brief rally
running inside with the winner at the quarter pole but lacked a bid through the stretch run. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN settled on the outside in midfield four wide
down the backstretch, offered a mild run between foes taking closer order three eighths from the finish and gave way at the quarter marker. STARSHIP BAY
tracked on the rail in the the third flight down the backside, lost ground and position to runners on the fence three furlongs from the line, could see the field
at the top of the lane and passed a straggler running to the wire. HOLIDAY IN CHILE chased the frontrunner in the two path down the back straight, came
under a ride losing ground to foes at the three furlong marker and could not find more to reach contention through the stretch run.

Footnotes
YOGA pressed the issue outside in the early going, assumed control going around the leader at the half, opened up at will running on the turn and cruised
home unchallenged for the impressive victory. ANOTHER PINKY was bumped inside on the break, co-trailed on the rail down the backside, made no
headway seeing the field running on the turn, angled out widest in the five path for the drive and was full of run late to close for a non threatening runner up
finish at the wire. TIME TO RELOAD tracked outside in the second flight down the back straight, rallied between runners three eighths from the line, was in
the mix in upper stretch three wide but could not find more late and finished up one paced one the fence to garner third money in the end. STOLEN was off
slowly on the break, co-trailed on the outside down the backside, made a move three wide circling around horses three furlongs from the prize, posed the
main threat in the four path straightening out for home and levelled off at the furlong marker while not switching leads down the lane. GAMBLER'S POSE
broke outwards to begin, had a good position sitting behind the engaging duo at the half, could not quicken with others outside in midturn and weakened
inside at the top of the stretch. QUEEN SAHARA was hustled for the lead inside at the start, gave way up front to the winner at the half, shifted outside
chasing but to no avail throughout the turn and stopped on the fence in the last furlong.

Footnotes
KHOZZY VALINTINE settled off the pace, went four wide through the turn coming out six deep into upper stretch, bid six wide between runners taking a
narrow lead seventy yards out and prevailed. NORTHERN RUBY raced outside into the turn going five then six wide on that bend, came out a bit further for
the drive, missed. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER settled off the pace saving ground inside till the very end of the turn, angled five wide, bid for the lead near the
eighth pole, was outfinished. KATCHY NAME was forced in just a hair in the early going, was within range of the leader two to three wide, kept on in the
stretch but needed more. OHEAVENS shifted in racing last but one into the turn, went two to three wide on that bend, advanced between runners in
mid-stretch needed more. STORMY SUZIE settled at the rear, swung eight wide, kicked on with mild late interest. LOADED VIXEN ducked in at the gap, set
the pace inside, faded. SUGAR IS GOLDEN checked in the early going as the leader ducked in crossing the gap, switched out at that juncture and moved
forward, was in pursuit three wide into the turn, asked outside the quarter pole but had no response and came up empty. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY
THE RIDER OF SUGAR IS GOLDEN AGAINST KATCHY NAME ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SILENT RESERVE had a narrow early lead, spurted clear coming to the three-eighths, extended the advantage under just moderate urging while much the
best. SMART COVERAGE was coaxed forward inside, pressed the eventual winner from inside briefly, continued to chase that one, was no match but held
second. SOONER LUNAR broke just a step slowly, settled off the pace inside through the turn, came out four wide in upper stretch, just missed second.
HE'S FULLY LOADED had brief early speed between runners, dropped back off the leading pair soon after, chased from inside a runner, failed to rally.
GATLING GUN settled outside two to three wide on the turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch, failed to rally. KINETIC STONE raced outside a foe three
wide on the turn, encouraged along at the quarter pole, had no rally.

Footnotes
HARDWARE GAP was allowed to settle on the fence close to the back of the pack in the beginning, began to pick up foes midway on the turn when ridden
for more, found running room in the four path with an eighth to go and surged late, getting the nod at the finish. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE broke inwards
hitting the gate on the break, was coaxed on the rail getting better position down the backside watching the front duo, rallied between foes with five
sixteenths to go, bid for the lead in the four path straightening out for the drive, took command at the sixteenth pole and just missed losing the nod at the
wire in a hard fought loss. SILENT RISK travelled near the rear in a stalking position on the outside early on, started to gain on rivals when urged three
furlongs out, with momentum swung out to the five path turning for home, could not match strides with the winner at the furlong marker but closed belatedly
to get up for the show award. MR. MARSHALL took this field down the backside, opened up on rivals through the turn, maintained a narrow margin up front
in the three path at the top of the lane, was collared by the eighth pole and held on to be a fringe player in the end. SEA TO AIR broke in to begin, settled
outside rivals in the middle of the pack at the half, kept pace with the leaders when asked midpoint on the turn, was in with a chance two wide turning for
home, lost his path in mid- stretch, shifted outside at the eighth pole and finished up mildly crossing the finish line. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ travelled in
mid-pack down the backside in the two path running in hand, was roused inside three furlongs from the wire, improved up the fence midturn to the top of the
lane and stalled on the fence at the furlong marker. LOBBY BAR was squeezed at the start, trailed down the backstretch outside, offered a mild run catching
up to the pack outside four wide midway on the turn, swung out to the seven path for the stretch run but could not get involved in the late stages. MUSICAL
STRIDE pressed the issue outside down the back straight, chased the frontrunner on the turn, angled out in the six path turning for home with a chance for
a piece of the prize and weakened in mid-stretch to be a non factor at the finish. ADELAIDE COURT broke outwards at the start, stalked near the rear
between runners down the backside, lost ground with horses on either side through the turn to trail and was never a presence in the stretch drive to the wire.

Footnotes
LADY BREW settled near the back of the pack on the rail into the first of two turns, was allowed to find her stride on the rail still at the rear with a half left to
run, was in hand, patiently ridden, waiting to move on the fence in the far turn, was let loose shifting outside in the three path turning for home and sharply
took control at the sixteenth pole to win going away under a hand ride. BEYOND MYBUDGET took this field into the first turn, was relegated to tracking the
loose speed inside down the back straight, began to close in on the frontrunner with five sixteenths to go, battled between runners down the lane and
finished up willingly to be second best on this day. INVENTING quickly moved around the early leader through the first turn, took command opening up
down the backstretch setting a brisk pace at the half, continued uncontested up top running on the final turn, was asked at the top of the stretch, found more
in reserve to hold the closers at bay until the sixteenth pole and faded late to be a clear third at the wire. KEYFLOWER (FR) tracked the top pair alone on
the first turn, settled on the outside in the middle of the pack down the back straight, began to reel in the pacesetter in the second flight outside midpoint on
the far turn, offered little closing kick when set down in upper stretch and tired at the furlong marker to settle for a small share at the finish line. PEMBERLEY
travelled near the rear just outside in the two path on the first turn, could see the compact field down the backside, was under a drive two wide outside while
keeping pace to the rivals through the far turn and had nothing left to give in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MEHLEK saved ground getting smartly to the rail stalking at the back in the first turn, advanced mildly on the rail down the back straight, was on hold in
midfield through the far turn, swung out six wide with momentum at the top of the lane, was full of run at the furlong marker closing in and got up in the
shadow of the wire for the win. INFAMOUS COVERT had a good position watching the engaging duo on the first turn, rated kindly tracking the contesting
pair all alone down the backstretch, pounced three wide making a bold move around the tiring early leaders at the quarter pole, extended the advantage at
the furlong marker but was was caught by the winner a few jumps before the wire. JMR PURE SENSATION prompted the pace outside in the first turn,
continued to hound the inside pacesetter down the backside, was inching clear of the early speed foe at the quarter pole, offered little resistance to the top
pair in upper stretch but bravely fought on with runners swarming in on each side late to hold for third in the end. CHELSEA DAGGER was situated on the
rail tracking in the third flight on the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack inside at the half, rallied on the fence three furlongs from home, found a seam
in the two path at the top of the lane and finished with intent to just miss out for third between runners in a tight photo at the finish. EXULT was unhurried
trailing on the fence in the beginning, took closer order to the leaders improving inside down the backstretch, had nowhere to go on the fence with run in
upper stretch, finally shifted outside off the tiring early pacesetter at the eighth pole, angled to the rail late and finished up well to be involved in a photo for
third at the wire. OCTOBER FROST was allowed to settle near the rear down the back straight, was roused three furlongs from the line weaving through
traffic, lacked running room briefly when starting a rally inside the furlong pole and ran on willingly late to the finish line. BONGINO tracked on the rail in the
second flight around the first bend, settled nicely by oneself watching the front three down the backside, was nudged for more run two wide three eighths
from the line, shifted out in the five path in range of the leaders driving to the wire but evened out in the final furlong. GENDRAGON tracked outside in the
third flight into the first turn, settled in midfield down the backside outside of runners, made little impression between rivals midpoint on the far turn, swung
out to the six path straightening out for home and never was a factor running to the wire. SUPER HEADLINE contested for the pace inside in the early
stages, battled on the rail setting the fractions down the backside, began to give way inside at the quarter pole and retreated on the fence in the final furlong.
ABSOLUTE JEWEL travelled near the rear four wide entering the first turn, made little progress outside down the backstretch, offered a mild run three wide
outside three furlongs from home, was floated out to the five path turning for home, shifted in to the rail for the drive but could not make any impact down the
lane.
