Footnotes
ROCK N REWARD stalked the pace on the outside, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady
gain, edged ahead late and held. MOM'S OPAL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three
wide for clear racing room, made a steady gain and missed. QUEEN OF HEARTS sprinted clear soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, then weakened late and held the show. REIGERT GIRLS mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned four wide into the stretch
and got up for a share. CHANNEL ME IN unhurried, moved up two and three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch, drifted in and improved
position. TWISTED EMPRESS well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened.
CONTEMPTUOUS MISS was no factor. MY JENNY was never involved.

Footnotes
R ADMIRAL set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then dueled in the late going and prevailed. ALEMAN well
placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, made a steady gain, dueled with the winner and
lugged in on that one and lacked the needed late kick. SAM STORMY well placed and inside, moved up two and three wide trough the second turn, came
four wide into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. INAPPROPRIATE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns,
came through inside into the stretch, then could not gain and held a share. UNSTABLE PRINCE allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the
second turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. WATCHOUTFORWEAVER was no factor. MOONSTRIKE (GB) pulled to contention in
the early going, stalked the pace to the stretch, then faded. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN OF THE RACE, RESULTED IN NO

GET EVEN tracked the pace pulling, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain, edged
ahead and drove clear late. SHAKIN IT UP LARRY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch,
then could not threaten, while clearly best of the rest. GAMBLER ROCKET stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the
turn, came three wide into the stretch, then could not gain the final furlong and held the show. BRADITUDE unhurried, moved up on the two path through
the turn, came three wide into the stretch and edged up for a share. HOLLA AT YOUR BOY well placed and between, angled in and saved ground through
the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. BEACH HOLIDAY passed tiring rivals, outside. HARD ROCK GOLD well placed and
outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded four wide into the stretch. CERTAIN JUSTICE was no factor.

LIFE MISSION rated outside the pace, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then made a steady gain and
drew off late. TAPSOLUTION well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then made a steady gain
and edged up for the place. J W RUCKUS well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady
gain and got up for the show. LORD OF LEGENDS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened
late and held a share. BOOMIN GOOSE was never involved. CREATIVE CHOICE was no factor.
