Footnotes
QUEENSBORO stalked the pace early, made a run outside rivals to take the lead nearing the second turn then pushed away and held under steady urging.
SUE GENEROUS dueled for the lead from the rail, was overtaken by the winner then dug in late to hold the place. GET MY POINT tracked the pace from
the rail to the stretch then could not make an impact. DATQUICKCAT had no speed, trailed for a half mile then could only pick off rivals. GOOD JOB
JACKIE was outsprinted to the backstretch, tried to respond two deep but came up empty. SHE HAD A SECRET had no speed and was never a threat.
HEY WILMAAA dueled for the lead for a half mile then tired.

RED NOON RISING was on a three horse duel to the backstretch, inched away from the runner up on the second turn and held driving. MS PARKSIDE
attended the pace three wide, got outkicked on the second turn then was no threat in the lane. BETE ROUGE had brief speed, dropped back to last on the
backstretch then tripped over the fallen horse on the second turn and fell. QUEEN BREEZY trailed to the backstretch, went by BETE ROUGE to chase the
top two but suffered an injury on the second turn and was vanned off. A stewards inquiry into the accident did not alter the results.

Footnotes
SEVENTH HOUSE was slow to begin and lagged to the first turn, rallied two then three wide on the second turn then closed with a rush to win going away.
ELUSIVE GOLD stalked the pace to the second turn, came off the rail and dueled to mid stretch then could not stall the winner. ST PATRICKS SWORD
chased the leaders, saved ground to the stretch, dueled late but was also bested by the winner. POCO DIABLO ROJO had no speed, swung out four wide
on the second turn and made a belated run. GOTHAM'S FINALE hustled to contest the pace for five furlongs then tired. RED MEMORYS tracked the pace
two wide but lacked a closing response. COLE'S DYNAMITE was four then three wide throughout and not a threat. WORK YOUR MAGIC had brief speed
and gave way.

Footnotes
LOW DOSE had good speed, dueled outside of FIRE ESCAPE to the second turn but came in slightly, bumped that one, inched away to the stretch and
held driving. MOSCOW LADY trailed for three eighths, swung out five wide on the far turn then made a steady late run to the line. FIRE ESCAPE dueled
inside LOW DOSE to the second turn, was bumped and took up slightly then weakened. COWLITZ tracked the pace two wide for a half mile but lacked a
closing response. CONFIDENCE BUILDER got outsprinted to the backstretch, was three then four wide to the stretch but could not threaten. CAL had no
speed and was not a factor. The rider on FIRE ESCAPE lodged an objection against the winner LOW DOSE and following a review by the stewards, LOW
DOSE was disqualified and placed third behind FIRE ESCAPE.

Footnotes
CAMDEN HIGH was well placed then responded with a strong run to collar STEEL NERVES into the second turn and drew clear under steady urging. MISS
MENSA pressed the pace for a half, bid three wide on the far turn then was no threat to the winner but came on late for the place. STEEL NERVES set the
pace from the rail for a half mile, could not stall the winner then weakened and could not save second. ALY'S NATION chased the pace from the rail to the
stretch but failed to offer a closing bid. SHERRYS BABY also was chasing early then saved ground to no avail. FLY PATTI FLY had no speed and could not
make an immpact. TED'S CANDY GIRL also had no speed and was not a factor. ARCTIC FIRE broke a bit slow, hustled up to stalk the pace for a half mile
then tired. OUR GIRL ASHLEY was through early.

Footnotes
TRIBUNAL LOVE had the best speed, set all the pace and held driving. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY stalked the winner after avoiding the trouble on the first
turn but could not make an impact while saving second. LET GEORGE DO IT was forced out four then five wide on the first turn, tracked to the second turn,
raced three wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late response. ANOTHER STRIKE was forced out five then six wide to the backstretch, chased for
three furlongs, was two wide to the stretch but came up empty. LONGFORD was forced widest of all when seven wide to the backstretch then was
outsprinted and not a factor. SMOKIN KEN bore out badly on the first turn, causing all the problems then stopped after half a mile.

Footnotes
DYF pressed the pace early, moved the lead inside on the backstretch the second time, pushed away to the stretch and held driving. MISO FAST was five
wide early, settled, eased in then saved ground to the stretch and was an easy second. MR BOTANICALS had no speed, raced two wide to the second turn
then could only pick off rivals. RIVER ROSE tracked the pace early then saved ground to no avail. OUR EMPIRE hustled to the front early, was overtaken
after
three
eighths
and
tired.
SHOCKAZULU
chased
the
pace
four
wide
early,
was
asked
for
more
two
wide
but
came
up
empty.
PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE stumbled badly at the start and did not recover. TUMAC MOUNTAIN was through early.
