S. MUFFIN broke in at the start, rushed up and sprinted away from the field, held sway without challenge, then lasted under steady pressure. CHAOS
THEORY unhurried, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed, then was pulled up and
vanned off. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had a mild
gain. UNCLE EARL well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened out.

RECORD TIME set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the second turn, drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. RIGHTHERE RIGHTNOW
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then was no threat to that one, while clearly best of
the rest. MADURAI well placed and outside, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and edged up for
the show. BAYTOWN BRUISER stalked the pace on the outside, vied down the backstretch, then lost some ground on the two path through the second
turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in and weakened. EXPRESS STAR was never involved.

YANKEE DOLLAR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was ridden out. BALI KUTA
stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten that
one and held the place. HAPPY BEE tracked the pace pulling, saved ground through the turns, angled three wide into the stretch, then had a mild late gain.
PEACE SEEKER chased and could not gain.
