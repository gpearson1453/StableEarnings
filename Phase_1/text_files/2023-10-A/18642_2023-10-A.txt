Footnotes
MOON ROSE rated in the two path, cut the corner under a drive turning into the lane, rallied inside of foes into the final furlong, and was up nearing the final
sixteenth. EXTRA INDY brushed at the start with an inner foe, chased in the six path, was under right handed encouragement in the five path around the
turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and ran on for place. GREEK MOJO broke out and bumped an outer foe, set the pace in the three path,
was challenged by an outer foe while in the two path early into the turn, tipped back out to the three path in upper stretch, but evened out in the final furlong
to show. MADEFORSUMMER got bumped by an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the
lane, but flattened. WILDCAT LUNITA brushed on both sides at the start, pressed in the five path, bid from the three path early into the turn, but faded from
back in the five path down the stretch. KILLARGUE'S GIRL got pinched at the start, trailed in the seven path and did not threaten while drifting out in the
stretch. IMAHONKYTONKGIRL stalked along the rail but backed up early around the turn.

four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and just missed second. LIGHT AND PATH hit the starting gate, saved ground off the pace, tipped out near
the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. MUDSHAFT trailed in the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and never threatened. BLAZINGLY
hit the starting gate, advanced between foes down the backstretch, prompted the winner in the three path and tired in the lane.

ST. PAT'S DAY stalked in the two path, waited patiently behind the leader around the turn, swung out to the seven path under coaxing entering the lane,
and rallied outside of rivals to be up around the final sixteenth. BAHAMIAN MOON dueled for the lead in the three path, led under urging from the two path
turning into the stretch, stayed on, but was caught by the eventual winner around the final sixteenth to place. LI LI BEAR prompted the leading duo in the
four path, bid under a ride around the turn, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. LOVIN MAKES CENTS rated in the three path,
was cued turning into the stretch, but was one paced. ALA TURKA broke out at the start, trailed in the four path and made no impact from the six path in the
stretch. BARBARA chased in the five path but did not threaten. NOEL'S ANGEL vied for the lead in the two path, was coaxed from the rail midway around

Footnotes
DE REGRESO set an open pace in the two path, was roused early into the far turn, kicked away along the inside entering the lane, and was driven out.
SPUNFORFUN rated in the three path, was roused into the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and kept on for place. TIME IS MAGIC
tracked in the two path, was ridden from the rail around the far turn, tipped back out to the two path entering the lane, but evened out for show. LOVEYS
EMBRACE stalked in the three path, was driven in the two path around the far turn, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but faded. PARTY SHAKER
hesitated at the start, trailed in the three path and did not threaten from out in the six path down the lane. IRON SHIELD settled in range around the four
path, began to backup between foes midway around the far turn, and had to steady passing the quarter.
