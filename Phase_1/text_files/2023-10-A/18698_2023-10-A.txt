Footnotes
WEE BEASTIE was sent leaving the break and established the early lead in the opening furlong, set moderate fractions into the turn, drifted out a bit leaving
the quarter marker and raced two wide into the stretch, extended the lead approaching the furlong marker, was kept to steady urging into deep stretch and
held the runner-up at bay in the final stages to prevail. MAVERICK ROSE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to WEE BEASTIE and stalked outside of that
rival heading to the half-mile marker, kept close attendance along the turn while two wide, came three wide into the stretch and lost a bit of ground to WEE
BEASTIE at the furlong pole, was held at bay by the winner into deep stretch and was a clear second best. GALLO DEL CIELO tracked the early pace while
outside of rivals, came three wide into the turn and was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair heading to the furlong
grounds, lacked a response in deep stretch and held clearly for third. ZEE CARROT EAGLE bobbled at the start, came in a bit tight leaving the break and
was away a step slowly, stalked the decent early pace and was steered to the rail approaching the turn, lost position while saving ground heading to the
quarter marker, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn, swung four wide into the
stretch and did not factor.

SHE'S SO SHINY showed good speed away from the start and assumed command in the early running, showed the way into the first turn and rated into the
backstretch run, carved out a moderate pace while well handled heading to the half-mile marker, set the pace while off of the rail along the far turn, turned
away a challenge by LIAM'S SECRET at the quarter pole and held foes at bay into the stretch, was confronted at the furlong grounds by BEACHGRASS,
repelled that bid and kept to task into deep stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up and held in a drive to prevail. HARBOR ABBEY settled outside
of runners into the first turn, tracked the modest pace through the backstretch run from a three wide path, came two wide into the far turn and chased
between rivals heading to the quarter marker, swung three deep into the stretch and advanced at the furlong grounds, was gaining in deep stretch, could not
reel in the winner in the final sixteenth and outfinished BEACHGRASS to secure second. BEACHGRASS took back off of the early pace and saved ground
into the first turn, was steered to the two path into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace while not far back approaching the half-mile marker, was
well placed while chasing from the rail into the far turn, mounted an inside bid into upper stretch and vied for the lead approaching the furlong grounds, could
not keep pace into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while holding for third. LIAM'S SECRET was forwardly placed away from the start and
stalked outside of SHE'S SO SHINY into the first turn, raced four wide into the backstretch run and advanced heading to the half-mile pole, maintained an
outside position into the far turn and advanced to challenge SHE'S SO SHINY at the quarter marker, was turned away in that effort and came four wide into
the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
HAY JUAN was asked for speed while between runners leaving the break, disputed the quick early pace with AUTISM BLUE then shook free nearing the
half-mile marker, set a quick pace into the turn and drew to a clear lead heading to the quarter marker, widened the lead into the stretch, was kept to
moderate urging into deep stretch, had the lead cut into in the final stages by the oncoming runner-up and remained clear to the wire. SUMMANUS settled
off of the quick early pace, tracked outside of rivals into the turn and was roused four then five wide into the stretch, responded to urging in the final furlong,
could not impact the winner in deep stretch but finished well in the late stages and was up in time to secure second. AUTISM BLUE broke alertly and
disputed the solid early pace while inside of HAY JUAN, lost ground heading into the turn and chased from the rail approaching the quarter pole, was outrun
into the drive, was able to offer a mild late bid but could not impact the winner in the final stages and was outfinished in deep stretch for second, while clear
in the end for third. EPIC DRAMA tracked the quick early pace from the outside, gave chase three wide to the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch
and weakened in the final furlong. BIG CHEDDAR chased the early pace while inside of an outer rival, ran in pursuit while two wide and between runners
along the turn, dropped back into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
FEISTY ELLA broke out a step at the start, tracked the decent early pace while outside of an inner rival, chased four wide into the turn and gained ground at
the quarter marker, swung four wide into the stretch and continued that bid approaching the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth,
overtook RUNAWAY SALLY in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final strides to prevail in a good debut. RUNAWAY SALLY was away in good order
and showed speed away from the gate, was engaged by FLY SOUTH in the opening stages and set a pressured pace into the turn while outside of that
runner, shook free entering the turn and rated nicely while controlling the pace heading to the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, was kept
to task while holding a safe lead into the final sixteenth, was collared by the winner in deep stretch and held clearly for second. FLY SOUTH raced close to
the decent early pace and pressed RUNAWAY SALLY into the turn, took back entering the turn and shifted to the outside of the pacesetter heading to the
quarter marker, chased three wide into the stretch, shifted to the inside at the furlong grounds and ran in pursuit into deep stretch, could not muster the
needed late response and weakened while holding clearly for third. HARBOR DEAREST tracked the decent early pace while inside of an inner rival, was
steered to the three path into the turn and improved position heading to the quarter pole, came two wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker
and flattened out in the final sixteenth. LIT DE TIGER lost her path at the start and was off slowly, raced greenly while trailing into the turn, saved ground to
the quarter marker, advanced into the stretch but was unable to threaten in the final stages.

Footnotes
WRONG SPOT was unhurried away from the start, improved position into the first turn and tracked the early pace while four wide, was well positioned while
outside of rivals along the backstretch run, was roused into the far turn and mounted a four then five wide bid nearing the top of the stretch, took command
into upper stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong grounds, shifted to the right lead inside of the furlong marker, was kept to steady urging into the
final sixteenth and drew away in deep stretch. DARK MYSTERY was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked the decent early pace from a four wide
path, gained ground into the backstretch run and tracked the leading pair to the half-mile pole, came within aim while three wide heading to the quarter
marker, chased WRONG SPOT into the stretch, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and just held for second at the finish.
WINTER SOLDIER settled in the second flight into the first turn, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run and improved position heading to the
half-mile marker, raced two wide into the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more in the final stages but
stayed on in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding clearly for third. LORD OF LIGHT settled along the inside into the first turn, saved all of
the ground while unhurried through the backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile pole, maintained a ground saving trip into the far turn, tipped
two wide for the stretch run and continued to gain heading to mid-stretch, was blocked at the furlong pole, shifted four wide into deep stretch and could not
muster a final response. MUCHO MACHISMO was hustled leaving the break and showed the way into the first turn, was engaged early on by JERSEY
BABE, disputed the pace with that rival then took back to stalk into the backstretch run, attended to the decent pace to the half-mile marker, lost position
while saving ground along the far turn, chased into the stretch and faded in deep stretch. JERSEY BABE was prominent away from the start, shifted to the
three path into the first turn and contested the early pace, pulled a bit on the rider into the backstretch run and assumed command at the five furlong pole,
set decent fractions to the half-mile marker and extended the lead into the far turn while off of the rail, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased WRONG
SPOT to the furlong grounds and tired in the final stages. MR. BUGS was a bit slow into stride away from the start and was hard to place into the first turn,
remained rank into backstretch run and trailed to the half-mile marker, chased outside of runners along the far turn and did not factor in the stretch.

BOSS OF THEMOSS broke a step slow then rushed up the rail to join up with COMMANDER KHAI to contest the early pace while racing under a snug
hold, slipped away a length on that rival passing the five-sixteenths pole, extended the lead in the stretch while being kept to task and held sway. LESSONS
OF AUTISM bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, was outrun from the break despite being pushed to keep up with the pack, chased the field
through the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then unleashed a furious rally to get the place. AWESOME DUDE was not pushed for speed from the break
and allowed to find his best stride early, made some forward progress while racing along the rail down the backstretch, moved into serious contention
through the turn, came under a ride passing the quarter pole, was kept to task and ran on courageously in the late stages to gain the third spot. MY
DOMINATOR settled outside of the tracking pack four wide down the backstretch, made a wide sweeping bid from the three furlong pole to get into
contention, came four wide into the stretch with every chance then had trouble changing leads and was passed for a minor award. PAPAPIFAS raced
between horses in the tracking group, changed paths to the outside in the middle of the turn then swung five wide into the stretch, angled to the inside
approaching the eighth pole and ran on some but was not good enough. COMMANDER KHAI broke sharply and was sent for the lead, was quickly joined
by BOSS OF THE MOSS to the inside. dueled with that rival to the turn then had that foe slip away a length near the five-sixteenths marker had nothing to
offer for the stretch run. R M C HOOK'EM got away awkwardly then was slow to get going, chased the field throughout and was never a factor. QUANTUM
QUEST bobbled slightly at the break, tracked the dueling leaders two lengths in arrears, made a move to challenge for the lead on the turn then stopped just
past the quarter pole and galloped to the wire.
