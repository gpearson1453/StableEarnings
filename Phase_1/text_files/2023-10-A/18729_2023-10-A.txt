MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS prompted the early pace three wide, made the lead entering the turn, set the balance of the pace and drew off through deep
stretch under strong handling to win as much the best. POWERFUL PHIL settled just behind the leaders two wide, moved up three then two wide through
the turn and finished second best in the five path. SPIN DOCTOR never far back, finished with good courage in the six path. HOPPY GILMORE settled
close up along the inside, advanced two wide into the stretch then finished evenly. ATTACK ANGLE failed to menace. THE MAN CAN pressed the early
pace two wide, led briefly nearing the turn, kept pressured along the rail into the stretch then came up empty. WEEKEND BUZZ was outrun. FOREIGN
sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, checked entering the turn then stopped.

GUESS AGAIN stalked the pace through the turn, rallied three wide to make the lead in upper stretch, was put to left handed urging in mid stretch and just
lasted under a strong hand ride. SEEKING FREEDOM never far back, closed willingly four wide through deep stretch and just missed getting up in time.
VECCHI advanced steadily along the inside to gain a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch then was outfinished. AFTER
SUNRISE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and was outfinished. ONE STEP ASIDE improved position outside on the turn, angled into the four
path in upper stretch then finished evenly. LIVING THE DREAM was no factor. STRIKING LAD six wide early, failed to respond. RIVERS OF DENIRO had
brief speed. DREAMINGABOUTTIME was no threat.

drew off in the six path. TYRONA pressed the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, assumed command, opened a daylight lead on the far turn,
maintained the advantage until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. ALSANAH slow early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path.

six furlongs, weakened. DATTTSAFANCYFOX set the pace along the inside around the first turn and stopped after a half.
