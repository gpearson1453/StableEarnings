AUTHORITARIAN no speed to the far turn, rallied off rail into the stretch under stout handling while all out to prevail. WRITTENINTHESTARS awkward from
the gate, saved ground, shuffled back to last far turn all out rally missed, probably best today. HEMP HEAVEN off last with no speed to far turn, rallied in
stretch for third. DANCE THE DAY AWAY outside first turn, chased to half, pressed far turn led empty. EPIMYTHIUM saved ground throughout never far
back, no late kick. AZURE SKY chased pace to the half with nothing left thereafter. DEVOTED TO YOU set pace to far turn under pressure weakened in the
stretch run. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

Footnotes
DRIFTWOOD loped to the front while well handled throughout stayed clear into the stretch and held sway to wire. JUANITA'S EXPRESS no speed from
gate, raced well back, finished with good energy. NOBLE PURSUIT saved ground throughout, rallied in the stretch for show spot. SCAT SHACK pressed
winner to the stretch, stayed game in the drive to wire. VIOLIN MAKER never far back to the half, shuffled back, rallied back stretch. WHERE'D THE DAY
GO off rail position never far back to far turn, weakened in stretch. SON OF GRACE never menaced throughout. SUBDUED never a threat throughout.
BLUEMOON JUSTICE could not keep up and faded back readily. Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand
timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm

YES POINT just off leaders between horses early on, split horses to the front dueled and gamely in a game effort to the wire and prevailed. COMMANDER
COMPTON never far back, up outside to pressure winner stayed on gamely and just missed at the wire. BRODY'S FLY saved ground to the stretch angled
out for run and rallied up for show spot. BELL CURVE never a real factor throughout and only improved position in the late going. FRADY rushed between
horses first turn to front but caved in from the far turn. HINDOSTAIN FALLS tried to keep up to the half with nothing left and retreated. MR JOKE off rail run
backstretch, bunched up far turn but faded in the stretch run.

CARTOON CAPER bore in start and bumped, raced between horses to the front, dueled into the stretch run, roused at the eighth pole and cleared off to the
wire. PROTEST rushed up three wide to the turn, pressured winner but out-gamed late to hold the place spot to the wire. GUS GUS quick from gate, raced
along evenly with no late kick in the stretch. LITTLE BANKER MAN bumped out of the gate, tried to keep up from inside to turn to no avail and folded late.
Race was hand timed due to a bad sensor on the turf course, all turf races will be hand timed for the remainder of the meet. Acm
