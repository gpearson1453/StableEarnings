Footnotes
BIGOFROMFRESNO cleared from outside and crossed over into the clubhouse turn, set the pace under pressure to the second bend, shook free at the
quarter pole, then drew away under steady handling and right handed urging. GHOSTLY ACT stalked early then shifted three wide into the first turn before
moving back to the two path, went up to apply pressure from outside, failed to kick on with the winner at the quarter pole, stayed on through the lane and
was clearly second best. SILENT HEAT stalked between rivals then two wide on the first turn, remained in that path to the stretch, could not summon the
needed response in the drive but churned on to hold the show. MAXVILLE tracked three to four wide early, sat off the pace up the backstretch, rounded the
far turn two wide and kept on to edge BLACK AS MY HEART for a minor award. BLACK AS MY HEART reserved early, got bothered by inner rival near the
three-quarter pole, cut down to the inside after, saved ground to the stretch and kept trying through the stretch run but was beaten for a minor placing.
VENOM stalked outside rivals then got floated out into the first turn, went two wide then angled over to the rail on the second bend and could not rally. BIG
GEORGE reserved from inside early then had to steady off heels approaching the first turn, trailed two wide into the far turn, had one rival beat into the lane
and improved through the final furlong. GIANOLA pulled along the inside behind the leader early, stalked up the backstretch, cut the corner into the lane and
weakened. TORQUEWRENCH broke a step slow, traveled two wide near the back, tipped out in the lane and proved no menace. SURE PROSPECT lost
path when rival shifted over prior to the clubhouse turn, raced two wide around that bend, asked along the inside through the second turn and was not a
factor. GRANNY'S IPA had to steady in tight into the first turn, traveled along the inside near the back early on, trailed into the lane and made no impact.

Footnotes
ESPRIT ENCHANTE eased over to the inside early giving chase then got crowded by UR IN TROUBLE and altered out, chased two then three wide on the
turn, tipped out into the lane, rallied in upper stretch, took a bump near the eighth pole, fought three deep late and was all out to get up. UR IN TROUBLE
broke well then ceded command to ELEGANT, stalked along the inside into the turn, waited for room behind the leaders while easing out to the two path,
tipped out, tried to split rivals in upper stretch but lost her path and bumped outer rival, altered to the inside, re-bid inside the top pair and just missed.
WHERE'S MY RING broke a step slow, got crowded on the inside early, altered out and rushed up from outside, bid three deep on the turn, took over at the
quarter pole, put away ELEGANT in upper stretch, shifted out approaching the eighth pole, fought with challengers from both sides in deep stretch and
yielded grudgingly. NOTHING LIKE YOU forwardly placed for a bit then went up to press from outside, vied two wide then between rivals around the bend,
stayed on to the sixteenth pole and flattened late. SUGAR FISH broke a step slow, trailed while not far back three wide into the turn, went four wide into the
lane and could not rally. ELEGANT took control early then set the pace inside NOTHING LIKE YOU up the backstretch, vied outer rivals around the bend,
lost command at the quarter pole and faded in the stretch. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT WHERE'S MY RING DRIFTED OUT NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE FORCING UR IN TROUBLE TO ALTER COURSE BUT
SINCE WHERE'S MY RING FINISHED BEHIND UR IN TROUBLE THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LIVING LIFE came away sluggishly to start, trailed early then went outside a rival, rounded the bend two wide, angled out and rallied seven deep to get up
in time. BAD UNCLE BARRY stalked on the inside into the turn, roused at the three furlong marker, had to pause when lacking room behind the leader
through the turn, rallied between foes and took over late but was run down by the winner in the closing moments. SEA OF CORTEZ (IRE) was off a bit slow
to begin, settle inside, was on the move around the bend while moving over to the two path, found traffic leaving the turn, angled out and bumped PETCOFF
a few times in upper stretch, kept to task and challenged between foes, got bumped from inside at the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to the wire.
PETCOFF chased outside a rival then between foes into the turn, tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths pole, rallied while getting bumped repeatedly from
inside and finished gamely. CLASSICAL set a pressured pace from inside to the top of the lane, headed in upper stretch and lost command at the eighth
pole, fought back to regain the advantage midstretch and was outfinished late stages. VEGAS BURNER pressed from outside, took over at the eight pole,
drifted out and bumped at the sixteenth pole and faltered late. DR. SOULFIRE saved ground at the back, tried to rallied up the fence but lacked room in the
the final sixteenth and had to steady twice, halting all late momentum. JOHNNY DRAMA forwardly placed outside the top pair early, traveled four deep
midway through the turn and weakened in the drive. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SEA OF CORTEZ (IRE) FROM THIRD
TO FOURTH FOR COMING OUT AND INTERFERING WITH PETCOFF IN THE STRETCH RUN, COSTING PETCOFF A CHANCE AT A BETTER
PLACING.

Footnotes
ADARE MANOR coaxed from the gate, sped clear from inside, controlled the pace through the early going, had the rider take a look back leaving the far
turn and padded the margin in the stretch under confident handling. DESERT DAWN stalked in the two path then moved inside on the clubhouse turn,
chased after ADARE MANOR inside a pair of rivals into the far turn, was closest in pursuit turning for home, could not make any headway on the winner but
was clearly second best. MICRO SHARE stalked two wide early then between rivals, coaxed along still in the two path on the far turn offered no response
and weakened in the lane. WINDOW SHOPPING tracked three wide early then three deep, remained three wide through the far turn, tired and eased in the
final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
RUBY NELL stalked four deep into the turn, drifted slightly crossing over the dirt, challenged in upper stretch, dueled with FAST AND SHINY in the final
furlong and edged away late. FAST AND SHINY pressed the pace from outside, took over past the quarter pole, put away WIDE WEST (IRE) in upper
stretch but was soon challenged by RUBY NELL, dueled with that rival in the furlong grounds and was outkicked in deep stretch. FREE AND HUMBLE rated
early, came in and brushed rival early on the turn, continued two wide then angled to the inside, steered out in the lane and rallied for the show. MAKE IT
SNOW stalked three deep into and around the bend, chased within striking distance into the final furlong but could not summon the needed response and
weakened in the late stages. JUSTIQUE was off sluggishly and lagged far back early, trailed on the inside around the bend then moved out across the dirt,
finished a mild rally but failed to threaten. LUNAR IMPACT (GB) settled inside, got brushed, put in tight and had to check early on the turn, angled out
across the dirt, moved out further in the lane and could not threaten. WED (FR) was off a bit slow to begin, chased three deep into the turn, four wide into
the lane and lacked a response when called upon. ALTERNATE ROCK raced up close on the inside early, saved ground through the turn and weakened.
WIDE WEST (IRE) set the pace under pressure from outer rival, lost command past the quarter pole, fought to upper stretch and weakened. HAVANA
ANGEL (IRE) stalked off the rail then moved into the two path for the turn, steadied early on the bend, remained two wide to the stretch and faded down the
lane. THE JOCKEY ABOARD LUNAR IMPACT (GB) LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST FREE AND HUMBLE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE EARLY ON
THE TURN. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

backstretch then moved up to apply pressure to AZUL COAST at the half-mile pole, dueled on the far turn, fought between rivals in upper stretch, could not
match strides with MISSED THE CUT approaching the eight pole and stayed on to secure the place. AZUL COAST cleared and crossed over on the first
turn, showed the way inside KISS TODAY GOODBYE first time through the stretch, cleared around the clubhouse turn, came under pressure at the
half-mile pole, dueled past the five-sixteenths pole, fought with outer rivals in upper stretch and weakened past the eighth pole. ORDER AND LAW stalked

Footnotes
BALLADEER dueled for the lead outside MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS briefly, lugged out crossing over the dirt, opened up a comfortable lead first time
through the stretch, held a diminished lead still unchallenged leaving the backstretch, responded when tested from outside late on the far turn, maintained a
short lead through the lane and would not let the runner-up go by. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS broke out and bumped OFFLEE NAUGHTY leaving the gate,
dueled briefly then stalked the leader from inside, moved into range on the backstretch, launched a bid from outside late on the far turn, fought with
BALLADEER down the stretch and could not summon the needed late kick to overtake the winner. SPEAKING SCOUT settled in the two path then moved
inside, got boxed in on the final bend, tipped two wide entering the lane but ran into traffic again in upper stretch, angled out to a clear path and rallied for
the show. PLANETARIO (BRZ) got bumped from inside at the start, settled off the pace along the rail, saved ground through the far turn, came out in upper
stretch and got edged for the show honors. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) chased three wide leaving the dirt then steered into the two path, traveled near the back
in the early going, chased three deep at the quarter pole and could not rally. YES THIS TIME rated off the rail early then moved inside, roused past the
five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the stretch run. OFFLEE NAUGHTY got pinballed leaving the gate and trailed early, traveled along the inside into the
far turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace. CASH EQUITY (FR) chased four wide into the stretch for the first time, steered over to the two
path, got crowded between rivals and had to check in upper stretch and could not regain momentum.

Footnotes
BALLY'S CHARM coaxed along to clear early then tucked inside, set the pace pace along the rail to the top of the stretch, put to right then left handed
urging and stayed clear while kept busy to the wire. WIN THE DAY bumped with outer rival at the start, traveled along the inside near the back of the field,
tipped two wide leaving the far turn, steered out into the clear with a sixteenth remaining, surged and got up for second. CARMELITA'S MAN chased three
wide off the pace, spun four wide into the lane, moved out further in upper stretch, rallied and got up for the show honors. EASTERN OCEAN stalked from
inside, saved ground to the stretch, finished willingly through the lane but lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch and lost the place and show. TIO
MAGICO stalked in the two path, entered the lane three wide, steered out further in upper stretch and kept on while needing to find more late. SARWAR
(FR) bumped with inner rival at the start, settled inside, cut the corner into the lane, tried to rally through traffic and finished willingly between rivals.

out. VANTASTIC broke a bit slow and trailed into the first turn, raced outside a rival into the second bend, lacked room and steadied entering the stretch,

rivals at the sixteenth pole and flattened out. KID AZTECA reserved in the early going, traveled between rivals leaving the backstretch, angled out in the
lane and lacked a rally. CASTLE LEOCH pulled early then raced in range three deep, stayed outside rivals on the far turn and tired in the stretch run.
