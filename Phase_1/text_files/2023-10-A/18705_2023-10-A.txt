MERLIN'S SONG allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, angled four wide in the stretch, then made a steady gain and drove clear
late. BIG CHICKEN MAN broke sharply and sprinted clear quickly, stayed on when challenged through the turn, turned back a bid and shook clear into the
stretch, then was no match for the winner late and held the place. GAGE HAS A GRAY broke in, bumping a rival, moved up quickly to be well placed off the
rail, gained position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and edged up for the show.
PRESS SNOOZE unhurried, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then flattened the final furlong and missed the
show. UNBRIDLEDSELECTION never far back, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed a tiring rival. POLLOCK well
placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch.

ANIPPE unsettled in the gate, broke sharply and sprinted clear quickly, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, drew off, then held under steady
pressure. MERINO WOOL allowed to settle, looped to position three wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the
place. BECKON well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch, then closed willingly
and had a mild late gain. FOLK HERO rated back early, was well placed inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and flattened the final furlong. MIDNIGHT FROST stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second
turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then faded late. PHANCY PHILLY was never involved.

Footnotes
DREAM ASTRAY set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the second turn, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. TIZ TACT TOE well
placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled three wide, made a steady gain and closed well for
the place. DUDEWITHTHEDIAMOND tracked the pace, moved up inside through the second turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then
weakened and held the show. GRAEL mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, then
could not gain the final furlong and held a share. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the second turn,
came four wide into the stretch and had no rally. DAD'S LIL SPARK stalked the pace on the outside and faded through the second turn. JUST PRAISE was
never involved.
