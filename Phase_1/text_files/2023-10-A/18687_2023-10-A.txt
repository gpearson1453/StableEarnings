edge clear under strong handling. SPIRIT SKY settled off the early pace two deep, raced three wide near the eighth pole, shifted to the rail and finished
gamely to the wire. EXERCISE OF POWER settled to race mid pack early on, was blocked near the three eighths pole while racing from the inside, angled
out to race four deep and finished gamely to the wire. TWIRLING EXPRESS stalked the pace, moved up four to five wide into the upper stretch to take aim
and flattened out. SIG sent along early to show good speed along the inside and weakened through the drive. DYNA BLAST raced in tight at the start,
moved up three wide through the far turn and raced even late with no closing run. WON AN AWARD raced two wide early, checked sharply near the three
eighths pole, shuffled back to last after the trouble, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. ELON dropped back off the early pace, raced
three to four wide around the far turn and had no late rally while racing from the outside. TRUSTME IAMADOCTOR race near the inside, checked sharply
near the three eighths pole and had no rally. FIRE AND KNIVES coaxed along from the inside to lay close, threw head, checked near the three eighths and

continued an inside run near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. CAP COM dropped back off the early pace, raced from the inside around the far
turn and lacked a bid. CHAT BLANC dropped back off the early pace, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. LADDIE DANCE

Footnotes
CHORUS GIRL set his own uncontested early pace while racing in hand and held well to prove best under strong encouragement. TRACY FLICK tracked
the early leader two deep, too aim on the leader into the upper lane, drifted through the stretch and kept on gamely. YOUENS raced off the early pace, was
along the inside near the quarter pole, angled through the upper lane to race off the inside and rallied well between rivals. COLOR CRUSH settled off the
early going, raced three deep near the three eighths pole from the outside of rivals, was five deep near the three sixteenths pole and was even late with no
closing run. GIRLY THE BUTCHER rated along early, made an inside through the far turn and weakened in the lane. CHA CHA TAP was allowed to settle
early, saved ground and never threatened. MILLE DREAMS (FR) raced off the early going, raced three to four wide and lacked a bid.
PREPAREFORTAKEOFF stalked the pace three wide from the outside of rivals and tired.

Footnotes
FOOD FOODIE settled off the early pace, made a strong four wide bid near the five sixteenths pole and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride.
SPIRITUAL GHOST was squeezed back at the break, moved up from the inside around the far turn through the stretch and rallied for the place position.
CALIFORNIA GHOST raced along the inside under a early pressured pace and weakened a bit through the drive. SIR LUMPALOT was bumped at the start,
stalked the pace three deep and weakened in the stretch run. LONG LIVE NOW broke to the outside, bumped rival, showed good early foot two deep and
faded. OVER THE BORDER rated along to race under a hold, was along the inside around the far turn and never threatened. I RUN raced mid pack, swung
six wide into the upper stretch and tired.
