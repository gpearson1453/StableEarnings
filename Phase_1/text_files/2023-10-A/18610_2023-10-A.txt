Footnotes
SNAPP DADDY ran a the back of the pack then on the turn snuck to the rail and made a move to the front coming down the stretch and overtook the leader
within the last half furlong. GALACTIC CORE pressed the pace which wore down foes over took them on the outside coming around the turn then got
caught late into the stretch. LOOPY DUDE had good early speed then maintained pace throughout the race. STORMIN ATTILA ran at the back of the pack
then coming down the stretch impeded the path of STACKERS causing loss of positioning. SECOND BATTALION ran evenly throughout the race.
STACKERS ran with early speed as they pressed the pace coming around the stretch two wide then STORMIN ATTILA cut infront and impeded path. BLUE
JEAN BOURBON had early speed then faded hard on the rail coming out of the turn. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY ON STORMIN ATTILA, IT
WAS DETERMINED THAT STORMIN ATTILA IMPEDED STACKERS MID STRETCH CAUSING THE LOSS OF PLACEMENT. THIS RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
RONAMO set the pace shortly after the start of the race then held out in the two path for the win. THUNDER DOME had good early speed then got passed
but continued to press the pace coming down the stretch dueled for the lead then unfortunately missed the nod at the wire. HOLLAND ran in the four path
had a mild gain throughout the race then had a outside bid to make up ground on the leaders. GREY STORM had good early speed then as the turn came
up slowly shuffled back from the podium. CREATIVE BID ran evenly throughout the race did not make an advance. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP ran on the
rail with a steady pace. CLAVICHORD had a slight bid on the turn but it wasn't enough to make up ground on the rest of the pack. THIS RACE WAS HAND
TIMED. PER HISA RULING, THUNDER DOME WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO THE HISA RULE ON EXCESSIVE WHIP
STRIKES.
