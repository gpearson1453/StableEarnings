JACKIE FLASH stalked the pace while two wide on the backstretch, rallied on the far turn to take command, was in a long drive and gamely dug in
throughout the stretch and proved best in the end. ITSONLYMONEYHONEY was allowed to settled then rallied four wide on the far turn, made a bid five
wide in the stretch but failed to sustain that bid in deep stretch. POETIC UNION was allowed to settled then rallied three wide on the far turn, was in a long
drive but came up empty in late stretch. SMART OKIE stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, made a bid into the far turn then flattened out in
the drive. HIGHWAY SIXTY ONE was unhurried early and failed to menace. CAMDEN'S BEAUTY set a pressured pace from the inside, was used up then
stopped.

while three wide, made a bid in upper stretch and was second best in the end. DIXIE FURY was saving ground on the turn then raced inside in the stretch
making a bid but came up empty in late stretch. YACHT ROCK (IRE) rallied four wide on the turn making a bid then flattened out in the drive. IM THE MAN
NOW pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, was hard used then gave way. AARON'S SPIRIT raced two wide on the turn and failed to menace.
