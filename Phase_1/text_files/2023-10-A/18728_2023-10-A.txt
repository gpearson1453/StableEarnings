the end. DIVA DE KELA chased the early pace while two wide into the turn, made a bid in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in late stretch.
CATO'S LADY was saving ground on the turn then rallied two wide in upper stretch, made a bid but was no menace in late stretch. STRONG WOMAN
rallied two wide on the turn making a bid but was no menace. GENUINE DRAFT chased the early pace while three wide on the turn then made a bid and
faltered in the drive. SHELL GAME chased the early pace while inside, was used up and faltered in the stretch. G KATE raced four wide on the turn and
faltered. STAN'S GOLDEN PATH raced three wide on the turn and was no factor.
