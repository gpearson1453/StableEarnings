Footnotes
INVEIGLED broke alertly to make the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, responded to the whip in mid stretch and eagerly pulled away. TRAILING
MONSTER lacked speed, worked between horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, rallied outside horses and was reported by the
stewards to have bled. NAPTOWN advanced three deep leaving the turn to reach a striking position then flattened out. GOODBYE NOTE raced along the
inner rail throughout, had a mild move to the eighth pole and lacked the necessary rally. REMEMBER THE NAME , along the inner rail most of the trip,
failed to be a factor and passed tired foes. EL DIVINO NINO broke slowly, circled the turn four wide and weakened. OUR LEGAL TENDER prompted the
pace outside the winner and faltered in upper stretch. SQUARE SLICE chased the pace racing in the two path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PICKIN SEA GLASS quickly went clear, dropped in and secured the inner rail, set the pace under a light hold, responded to solid asking through the lane
and held firm. CRAZY ODDS drafted back off the pace while saving ground, remained inside gathering some steam in upper stretch, advanced inside rivals
in mid stretch, switched over to his correct lead near the sixteenth pole and finished gamely to earn the place. HAMPDEN LANE rated between foes while in
range early, eased back off of a foe then angled out near the three eighths, crept up four wide into the stretch, chased outside rivals leaving mid stretch and
churned on. STRONG FINISH stalked to the inside of a rival, eased out for the drive, pursued between runners leaving mid stretch but faded late. BUBBA
CHROME was steadied back from between foes soon after the break, settled back in last, angled six wide into the lane and closed belatedly. EVENLY
DIVIDED , off last after breaking a bit awkwardly, regrouped and advanced three deep nearing the turn to be in range, chased outside a rival around the
turn, failed to on while between runners leaving mid stretch and weakened. FLASH IS BACK rated along between runners early on, shifted four wide in
upper stretch but came up empty. REAP WHAT YOU SOW , in hand saving ground in mid pack, eased out three wide in upper stretch, lacked a punch in
mid stretch and gave way. GET THEM DIGITS , in a bit tight after the break, raced three wide around the turn, angled five wide for the drive, moved up a bit
soon after, lacked a response near mid stretch and faded.

Footnotes
NEW ROME , under a firm hold while saving ground into and around the turn, steadied briefly awaiting room nearing the lane, advanced inside past the
three sixteenths, worked outward into the course leaving mid stretch, closed sharply to take command outside CORA'S CHOICE with a sixteenth to go then
kicked away while kept alert. POLICE WOMAN , a bit rank leaving the gate, regrouped and settled off the pace, angled out mid turn, circled five wide into
the lane, closed steadily and nabbed the place in the final yards. CORA'S CHOICE had speed to the inside of KENTUCKY REIGN, rated back off that one
nearing the turn, eased out mid turn and tracked in hand, moved up three wide to re engage past the quarter pole, took over while put to rousing near mid
stretch, failed to contain the winner's charge, flattened out late but held down the show. SKY BUY , in range while saving ground, eased out into the stretch,
chased behind rivals leaving mid stretch but went evenly late. KENTUCKY REIGN vied outside a rival before clearing in hand into the turn, dropped in to set
a rated pace, came under a ride soon into the lane, dueled past mid stretch then faded very late. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD , bumped at the break, was lightly
shuffled soon after, settled off the pace and off the inside, raced four wide into the stretch, swung out for the final furlong and had a mild late kick. SOUTH
PACIFIC , three deep pursuing the pace, came four wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. REVEILLE SONG , between rivals mid turn, shifted in for the
drive and faded. DON DIVA , in a bit tight at the break, saved ground off the pace, angled out into the lane but lacked a bid. AND WHISTLE chased outside
a rival, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SPENCERIAN advanced nicely four deep leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch then drew away. GINGER GIRL bumped with SULLIVAN
STREET at the start, set the pace slightly off the rail around the turn, drifted out turning for home then tightened quarters on LOVELY LIZA when drifting out
inside the three sixteenths pole. LOVELY LIZA , four deep leaving the backstretch, moved to the three path on the turn, was well placed turning for home,
steadied in tight quarters inside the three sixteenth pole, altered course to the inside of GINGER GIRL inside the eighth pole and finished willingly.
FASHIONISTA , always inside horses,, failed to be a factor. SULLIVAN STREET bumped with GINGER GIRL at the break, chased the pace while three
wide leaving the turn and gave way. LOOKING FOR WATER , shuffled back leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail and failed to get a clear path in
the stretch until inside the sixteenth pole. SISTREN , three deep on the turn, was outrun. Following an objection by the rider of LOVELY LIZA, GINGER
GIRL was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
STREET ROCKIN rated between rivals into the turn, steadied briefly when held a bit soon after, advanced between runners into the lane, shifted out near
mid stretch, leveled off to a nice stride past the sixteenth marker, surged under a right handed ask and got up in the final jumps. BELTANE took command
early and set a rated pace towards the inside, spurted away some after being roused past the quarter pole, kept on under left handed asks inside the furlong
grounds, drifted out a bit in deep stretch, fought courageously but just could not fend off the winner. EASTERN EXTENSION (IRE) , hustled along four wide
to advance into the turn, circled five wide under a ride into the lane and churned on to bridge the gap. POPS HARPER drifted in at the break, corrected and
rushed up between rivals to prompt the pace outside the winner, came back on past the three sixteenths to loom on his left lead, gave hard chase inside the
sixteenth pole, failed to seriously kick on then steadied very late. ENZO broke a step slow, settled off the pace, raced three wide leaving the far turn, angled
five wide when making some progress nearing the lane, raced a bit greenly off the heels of a rival near mid stretch, angled out and kept on with interest.
MISSION NORTH rated close up while saving ground, had aim under asking past the furlong grounds but one paced late. SHADOW MAN broke sluggishly,
dropped well back leaving the far turn, was under a hustling ride two wide into the stretch and had some late action. SUGA STEVE , three deep attending
the pace, failed to kick on with the leaders while four wide past the quarter pole and gave way. TAKETHEFIFTH saved ground and faded. NAVY ADMIRAL
broke a bit slow then drifted in, was pushed along early, trailed while saving ground in upper stretch, shifted out for the final furlong and had some interest.
An objection by the rider of POPS HARPER against BELTANE alleging interference in deep stretch was not allowed.

SUMO , four wide leaving the backstretch, was taken to the three path on the turn, took the lead outside GIUSEPPE in mid stretch and edged clear. NORTH
HIGHLAND , a forward factor along the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, checked in tight quarters near the eighth pole, altered course to the
two path and finished gamely. CARBONITE worked between horses in upper stretch, was well placed in mid stretch and flattened out outside the top pair.
GIUSEPPE , sent to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the inner rail and gave way in the driven. ABUELO PAPS saved ground on the turn, swung to the
five path in mid stretch and passed tired foes. LOOKIN' SUPER , steadied in traffic near the half mile pole, was not a factor. PUDGE BOY PALACE , four
deep on the turn, chased the pace to upper stretch and faltered. SHACKINTHEBOX , never a factor, raced along the inner rail around the turn. TRIPLE
TITOS , outrun, swung four wide leaving the turn.

GRADED ON A CURVE , patiently handled off the pace while saving ground, edged up behind a trio of rivals leaving the far turn, angled out, circled five
wide advancing into the lane, was floated out a bit past the three sixteenths, closed determinedly under right handed asks, drifted in through the final
sixteenth while sustaining his run and forged ahead near the wire. BODECREAM was sent from the gate and took command, rated kindly on the front end
while towards the rail, met an outside challenge from PAPAL LAW entering the far turn, sparred on near even terms into the lane, spurted clear under strong
handling in mid stretch, kept on gamely through the final sixteenth but just failed to hold off the winner. YOU MUST CHILL settled off the pace while saving
ground, crept up along the rail in upper stretch, could not find significant room through the final furlong, remained inside and steadied near the wire. PAPAL
LAW prompted outside the leader, moved to threaten nearing the far turn, battled head to head into the lane, could not quite quicken with BODECREAM
leaving mid stretch and faded late. MR. SHADES OF GRAY , three wide early, relaxed in the clear past the five eighths, took closer order three deep past
the five sixteenths, was floated out some while between foes heading to the furlong grounds then came up empty. SWEEPING GIANT , three wide stalking
the leaders, was under pressure trying to keep up into the stretch, drifted out some nearing mid stretch and faded. GLOBAL SENSATION settled off the
pace, was caught between rivals leaving the far turn and into the stretch, angled out but lacked a bid. POWER BACK rated forwardly while to the inside of a
rival, came out to be about three wide with pursuit into the lane and gave way. SUPER E was outrun.

BROTHER CONWAY angled in mid way down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail on the turn, swept to command approaching the stretch, was under
brisk urging and pulled away. CHILDERS drifted in leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four to three wide, failed to menace the winner and held the
place. SHERIFF RONNIE raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and finished willingly. AMITY ROAD , three deep chasing the
pace around the turn, gave way through the stretch. WOODLINE , three wide on the turn, was taken to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally in an
even effort. MIDNIGHT RENEGADE broke slowly, was outrun and hugged the inner rail on the turn. BYK sped to the early lead, set the pace in the two path
on the turn and gave way in the stretch run. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE bore out leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn and weakened. SWITZER
, caught in tight quarters soon after the break, was outrun. PENZANCE stumbled after being pinched back at the start.

Footnotes
DREAM RIVER dueled to the inside of three rivals heading to the turn, battled inside a pair foe foes mid turn, gained a slim lead when emerging in a tussle
with RUBYS FLASH in upper stretch, kept on tenaciously under strong handling and narrowly prevailed. RUBYS FLASH was hustled up between rivals to
gain a short lead early on, maintained the advantage past the five sixteenths, ceded command in upper stretch, stayed on gamely outside the winner
through the final furlong but wasn't quite good enough. MALIBU SLEW broke outward, corrected and moved up four deep to be with the leaders into the
turn, raced three deep disputing the pace past the five sixteenths, failed to quicken with the leading pair heading to the sixteenth marker then gave way
grudgingly. SUGAR HOOF saved ground mid turn and failed to menace STANDINGINTHEFIRE vied three wide and between runners into the turn, backed
out from the scrum leaving the three furlong pole, raced between runners in mid stretch and faded. SEEKER flashed speed then rated back off the leaders,
moved up some while saving ground mid turn, angled four wide for the drive but lacked a serious finish. STEAL N DREAMS broke slowly, dropped off the
pace, swung well wide in upper stretch and failed to menace. SUBSCRIBED refused to break. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of SUBSCRIBED.
