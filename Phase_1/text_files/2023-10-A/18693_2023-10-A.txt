Footnotes
BRAVO KATE took command into the first turn, was uncontested getting a wind aided breather down the backstretch, continued to be left alone setting a
soft pace on the final turn and when challenged in upper stretch held the rivals at back in a well rationed front end score. CAMAROSA travelled in mid-pack
outside in the beginning, tracked the loose pacesetter down the back straight on the outside, closed in through the far turn to loom the threat in the four path
at the top of the stretch but could not make any headway down the lane. COZY CURLIN KITTEN was tucked on the rail behind the leader in the first turn,
had a good position behind the top two down the backstretch, could not quicken with others through the far turn, was shuffled to near the back turning for
home and resurged in deep stretch to capture third money at the wire. SECORD tracked three wide in the early going, was content to sit back watching the
frontrunner down the backside, chased the pacesetting winner through the far turn inside and faded near the wire losing third place on the line.
INITTOWINIT nestled on the rail at the back of the pack in the beginning, was unhurried behind runners down the backstretch, was asked for more run
between runners at the quarter pole and ran on willingly through the stretch to be involved for the minor awards in the end. MAGICAL TRICK settled at the
rear with rivals on either side on the first of two turns, continued to see the field down the backside, was urged three wide three furlongs out commencing a
mild run, angled out in the five path to be in the mix at the top of the lane and levelled out late to be on the losing end of a four horse photo for third.
TEXENSIS was the outside part of the threesome trailing three wide on the first turn, improved outside runners down the back straight, relegated to last
entering the far turn, lost touch with the field four wide running on the far turn and was not involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN had an ideal trip in the early going, tracked the front contesting duo rating kindly all alone down the backside, began to reel in the
engaging frontrunners at the three furlong pole, pounced to the lead in the four path turning for home and was kept to the task late, prevailing through the
stretch. MAGNIFICENT MARIO stalked close to the back in the beginning, rallied three wide outside midway on the turn, was in range if good enough five
wide driving to the wire and surged late but was not in time. WALTER ME LAD rated in mid-pack three wide outside down the backstretch, began to
lengthen stride four wide at the quarter pole, loom a threat in the four path driving to the finish and was inching closer late but just could not close in enough
at the wire. JIMMIES BIG DAY travelled in midfield on the rail, improved running on the fence throughout the turn, was in with a chance behind a wall of
runners straightening out for the drive and found a seam in the three path, bursting between horses to settle on the fringes in the end. GRACEFUL
FIGHTER settled at the rear on the rail down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn making small progress inside, angled out off tiring rivals at the
furlong pole and finished with intent outside and was gaining smartly in the late stages of the race. HEAT MERCHANT stalked close to the back outside
runners in the two path in the early going, was urged midway on the turn making little headway and fought on willingly down the lane gaining in deep stretch.
TAZMAN battled up front on the rail down the backside, pressed the pace running on the rail in the turn, was collared outside turning for home and retreated
on the fence with an eighth remaining. SILVER SMOKE dueled on the lead outside down the back straight, continued up front fighting for the top spot
through the turn, was swallowed up by closing runners at the top of the lane and backed away through the field in the final furlong. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE
ducked inwards at the gap leaving the chute, almost unseated the rider, recovered to trail by many down the backstretch but could not get involved after the
horrible beginning.

NO MORE OPTIONS tucked in behind the leaders tracking on or just off the rail through the early going, moved out a bit to pass the tiring pacesetter
coming to the quarter pole, bid inside the leader taking over past the three-sixteenths, spurted clear under urging. NIGHT STRIKER broke outwardly a bit,
moved forward outside stalking then pressing the leader leaving the first turn and up the backstretch, took the lead by the five-sixteenths, lugged out past
the three-sixteenths, could not kick on with the winner but held the place. I'M FREE drifted out entering the first turn racing about four deep through that
bend, was taken in hand and reserved toward the back shifting in a bit up the backstretch, moved out again three wide coming to the quarter pole still with a
lot to do, advanced between runners in upper stretch, gained late but just missed the place. LONHRO'S GAMBLE was a bit reluctant to load, floated six
wide outside runners mid-pack into the first turn, advanced outside four deep up the backstretch and into the far turn, was within range coming to the top of
the stretch, was carried out in upper stretch, evened out thereafter. HATMAKER GIZMO exchanged a significant bump at the start, steadied slightly in
between runners in the early going then was carried out wide by a drifting inside foe into the first turn racing five wide on that bend, shifted in while moving
up to take closer order of the leaders heading up the backstretch, raced near but off the inside mid-pack into the far turn, angled seven wide coming out of
that bend, needed more. MY MUNNINGS MODEL was unhurried at the back racing off the inside, fanned six wide into upper stretch and ran on. DUBAWI
BULL saved ground inside, failed to menace. OH PEANUTS broke outwardly a bit, moved forward shifting in a bit within range of the leaders stalking about
three wide, weakened. HE SHOOTS HE WINS exchanged a stout bump at the start, soon went to the lead and shifted in, set the pace inside facing outside
pressure up the backstretch, was overtaken later on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
LAC MACAZA stalked outside near the rear in the early parts of the race, coaxed for more gaining on foes three wide three furlongs from the line, was on
hold in the four path turning for home lacking running room, surged between horses finding a seam at the furlong marker and was full of run in the last
sixteenth to edge away for the victory. A THREAD OF BLUE bobbled at the start, tracked in the second flight three wide early on, relaxed comfortably three
wide outside horses in mid-pack down the backstretch, moved three wide between rivals in midturn, bid for the lead in the four path at the top of the lane,
briefly took control inside the furlong marker but could not hold of the winner late in a game effort. PAT'SSEWINGMACHINE was allowed to settle trailing
the field on the rail in the first turn, continued to be unhurried seeing the pack down the backstretch, angled outside at the quarter pole gaining momentum,
swung out widest in the seven path for the drive and put in a strong late rally outside to be a clear third when crossing the line. COLLECTIVE FORCE kept a
close eye on the front threesome into the first turn, two wide outside rivals, had a good tracking position along the backstretch two wide outside runners
watching the leaders duel up front, rallied smartly on the far turn to poke his head in front in the three path straightening out for the drive, held on stubbornly
until the eighth pole and stalled late to settle for a minor role at the wire. STOWAWAY hopped at the start, recovered to prompt the pace three deep into the
first turn, settled back to track the contesting pair three wide down the backstretch on the outside, kept pace with runners three wide through the far turn,
was in range in the five path in upper stretch but needed more late to pose a threat in the end. SPRING MOUNTAIN had a slim lead pressed by two rivals
into the first turn, continued up front having a narrow advantage down the backside, battled up top around the last turn, was headed outside by closing in
runners at the top of the stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. ELUSIVE KNIGHT settled comfortably between runners in the third flight down the
backstretch, had to wait with horse on the far turn surrounded by rivals in every direction, tried to quicken for a seam in the four path at the top of the stretch,
was steadied sharply when to path closed and could not recover to be involved to the finish. TAPSASIONAL was nestled on the rail watching the front trio
into the first turn, rated kindly in hand behind the engaging duo down the backstretch, waited behind the fading leaders inside through the final turn, shifted
inside to get rail seam in upper stretch but had not finish to give in deep stretch. UPTOWN LIGHTS stalked in the third flight on the rail in the early stages,
was ridden for more saving ground three furlongs from the wire, could not make any advancement running on the fence through the far turn and lacked a
rally on the rail down the lane. STOLEN MONEY pressed the pace between horses into the first turn, hounded the leader outside down the back straight,
was headed outside when dueling for the lead turning for home and faltered in upper stretch.

TWIRLING POINT bumped the inner rival at the start, quickly moved to the lead in hand, shifted in to set the pace inside, was challenged coming to the
quarter pole, had enough in reserve to hold that rival and re-establish a clear advantage by mid-stretch, held sway. BEDARD settled mid-division through
the first turn, switched out well off the inside early up the backstretch, advanced steadily to commend a bid four then three wide coming past the
five-sixteenths, was turned away but maintained the place. JOKESTAR was urged from the break and well-placed in behind the leader tracking inside
heading into the first turn, settled up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came out a bit in mid-stretch, ran on evenly. STUD MUFFIN bobbled at
the start, settled at the back, saved ground through both turns, improved. PET SOUNDS broke outwardly, was caught four to five deep outside runners off
the pace in the early going, advanced some to race mid-pack still wide up the backstretch, shifted in a bit to enter the far turn three abreast, fanned out five
wide and ran on. MOTION GRANTED was bumped at the start, raced outside just off the leaders three to four wide on the first turn, was forced out a bit
midway up the backstretch, dropped back four to five wide on the far turn fanning out six deep turning for home, failed to rally. SOUPER JUSTIFIED was
forwardly-positioned stalking the eventual winner two to three wide, came up empty. EAT FOOD EVERYDAY raced mostly three wide while between
runners at the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
DANCING DUCHESS broke in bumping foe at the start, was allowed to settle near the back of the pack in the early going, could see the field travelling
throughout the turn, swung out widest for clear running room in the five path driving to the wire, was full of run at the furlong marker gaining quickly and got
up in the shadow of the wire for a well measured rally to win. PIPIT watching the duo contest up front sitting on the rail down the backstretch, waited inside
on turn to pounce, shifted out to the three path in range of the leaders turning for home and was gaining with every stride late running in tight quarters at the
finish. GOLDEN CANARY stalked near the rear four wide in the beginning, waited to move in the two path running on the turn close to the back of the pack,
began to reach for more ground inside at the top of the stretch, found his best stride late and burst between horses to just miss at the wire. SPLIT STRIKE
tracked the engaging twosome between horses down the backside, began to inch close to the front through the turn, loomed the threat four wide at the top
of the stretch, poked his nose in front briefly with a sixteenth to go but was outfinished very late to settle for a minor role in the end. ROCK TO FAME took
this field while hounded inside along the backstretch, dictated the pace while harassed inside around the bend, was clinging to the lead at the eighth pole
with rivals closing in on each side, stubbornly fought to the wire but gave way a few jumps before the finish between horses. RHAPSODY pressed the pace
on the rail down the backside, continued to hug the fence forced the issue on the turn, was in the hunt inside at the top of the lane, could not find another
gear late and levelled off at the sixteenth pole. SUGAR TREAT tracked the front pair three outside down the back straight, kept pace with rivals running
three wide on the turn, angled out to the five path with a chance for a small piece of the prize turning for home and faded in the last furlong. LODGE HILL
was bumped at the break outside, trailed in the beginning, stalked inside near the rear down the backstretch, saved ground turn making little progress, tried
to rally on the fence in upper stretch but lacked a finish in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FEV ROVER (IRE) moved straight to the lead, set the pace inside facing outside pressure through the early going, ceded the lead and dropped back
nearing the five-eighths pole, lost ground on the new leader early on the turn, switched outside the leading pair and rebid three to four wide at the top of the
stretch taking the lead about the quarter pole, moved clear, was in hand late. WITH THE MOONLIGHT (IRE) was caught three to four wide through the
initial bend, settled just off the leaders stalking outside and in the clear, continued three to four wide on the main turn, kept on late under urging but was only
second best. MOIRA settled off the inside and in the back half of the field, raced outside a foe up the backstretch, began to advance on the turn while
fanning six wide late on that bend, was within striking distance in upper stretch but evened out. SKIMS (GB) rated in behind the leaders two to three wide
early, was allowed to go on a bit on the turn, was within range coming to the five-sixteenths, bid at the top of the stretch briefly putting a nose in front at the
quarter pole, had no extra for the drive. KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) was unhurried early, trailed up the backstretch, came out turning for home, rallied
between foes three to four wide in the stretch, just missed the super. ASPEN GROVE (IRE) was caught four deep into the initial bend, eased back off rivals
and shifted in two wide for the remainder, settled outside a foe mid-pack up the backstretch, came out seven wide at the top of the stretch, kept on with mild
late interest. AMAZING GRACE (GER) settled mid-pack tracking from inside, came out in upper stretch, was one-paced. ATOMIC BLONDE (GER) settled
well back racing just off the rail, was never near enough to threaten. CONSUMER SPENDING was in just a hair tight soon after the start and was angled in
at that juncture, raced inside a rival in behind foes off the rail, came out a few paths turning for home, failed to rally. ROCKY SKY (IRE) moved forward
intently soon after the start, pressed the pace from outside, took the lead about the five- and one-half, was overtaken at the top of the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
LIKE THE KING took control getting to the rail into the first turn, was under a good hold comfortably leading the field with only mild pressure being applied
down the backstretch, continued up front unchallenged on the final turn, was headed outside turning for home, let a notch by his rider finding more run and
repelled the challenger through the stretch for the victory. CRUDEN BAY was nestled on the rail a little behind the leader in the first turn, took closer order
down the back straight, was nudged for more to bid just outside the winner at the quarter pole, chased the winner determinedly through the stretch but in the
end just could not reel in the winner had something in reserve in the end. HENLEY'S JOY trailed on the rail in the beginning, stalked at the back on the rail
at the half mile marker, improved on the fence closing in on the leaders throughout the far turn, shifted to the three path entering the stretch, won the battle
for third money at the furlong marker and was gaining on the top pair late, but ran out of room at the wire. CONCEALED CARRY tracked three wide in the
first turn, stalked this compact field in the third flight outside down the back straightaway, was roused between runners three furlongs from home, had a
chance being in the mix in the four path at the top of the lane, battled for third money until mid-stretch and faded for a small share of the prize at the finish.
ROCKEFELLER broke poorly at the start, recovered prompt the pace two wide on the first turn, was content to sit just behind the frontrunning winner down
the backside, was roused for more but was losing ground and positions throughout the final turn, could see the field at the quarter pole and was not
persevered with running to the finish.

Footnotes
NATIONS PRIDE (IRE) was caught three to four wide through the initial bend after breaking just a half-step slowly, moved forward into good position
stalking in behind the leader, gradually inched closer to that one on the far turn, put to urging past the quarter pole, wore down the leader inside the final
furlong and edged away through the final sixteenth under moderate urging. ROYAL CHAMPION (IRE) moved forward from outside intent on the lead,
cleared and shifted in early on the first bend, set the pace in the clear and in hand up the backstretch, saw the advantage gradually diminish through the
turn, ridden strongly at the top of the stretch, was overtaken in mid- to late-stretch and second best. ADHAMO (IRE) was bumped at the start, settled outside
off the pace three wide, advanced up the backstretch to stalk unencumbered three deep into the far turn, was within striking distance on that bend, lacked
the needed late kick. PALAZZI settled at the back, advanced between foes about the seven-sixteenths, came out five wide at the top of the stretch, needed
more. ENGLISH CONQUEROR was mid-pack about three wide in the early going, dropped back between runners up the backstretch, continued at the back
two to three wide, improved position in upper stretch. STARTING OVER bumped a rival at the start, shifted in, saved ground about mid-pack and up close
early, failed to rally. BRITISH ROYALTY switched out heading up the backstretch, raced outside foes four wide into the far turn, had no rally in the stretch.
DYNADRIVE was unhurried early, raced off the inside up the backstretch at the back, moved out from three to five wide on the far turn swinging out seven
deep turning into the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
BIG INVASION travelled in midfield four wide down the back straight, rated smartly finding his stride through the turn, shifted out to the seven path at the top
of the lane, found another gear under a vigorous ride closing in at the furlong marker and got up near the finish for a well timed stretch rally. LUCKY SCORE
was void of early speed, stalking near the back in the three path in the beginning, saved ground unhurried at the back on the turn, began to pick up runners
on the inside turning for home, burst between rivals two wide at the eighth pole and was full of run on the fence, just coming up short with a gritty stretch
running performance. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) settled in mid-pack three wide inside runners down the backside, was coaxed to keep up on the turn, began
to rally between runners in the eight path in upper stretch and finished strongly in the late stages to get up and capture third in the end. DHABAB (IRE) was
unhurried from the outside post, trailing down the backside, caught up to the field splitting runners at the three furlong marker, shifted to the outside with
momentum turning for home, widest in the twelve path, was closing in with every stride through the stretch and just missed with a late surge coming to the
wire. DREAM SHAKE settled on the rail near the rear down the back straight, made little impression travelling throughout the turn, angled out between
runners in the eleven path driving to the wire, responded to right handed urging, gaining on the leaders down the lane and fell just short but was involved at
the finish in a photo for the minors. ROCKCREST prompted three wide in the beginning, settled back to track in the second flight running three wide around
the bend, loomed boldly in the four path driving to the finish, opened up mildly at the furlong marker and just tired in the shadow of the wire, losing many
positions late in a very game hard fought loss. OCEANIC had a good position on the fence watching the quartet down the backside, saved ground keeping
pace with others travelling in hand on the turn, loomed in the five path at the quarter pole, fought determinedly between foes through the stretch battling
near the front and faded in deep stretch. WAR BOMBER (IRE) was checked between runners trying to get forwardly placed in the early part of the
backstretch, shuffled back to stalk close to the rear at the half, improved four wide around horses running on the turn, could not quicken with closing rivals
on either side in mid-stretch and levelled off running to the finish. MASEN (GB) emerged with a slim advantage up front down the back straight, inched away
from the pressuring rival through the turn, relinquished the lead inside with three sixteenths remaining and tired in the three path in the last sixteenth of a
mile. COUNTY FINAL had a good spot securing the rail watching the foursome contest in the early going, kept pace saving ground in mid-pack through the
turn, could not offer a run when roused at the top of the lane and yielded between runners in mid-stretch. JAZZ HANDS broke in brushing rival at the start,
was steadied in tight quarters at the five furlong marker, regrouped to track in the second flight on the rail throughout the turn, ran in the three path
straightening out for the drive in range if good enough, could not find more in upper stretch and faltered with horses on each side with an eighth remaining.
LAST AMERICAN EXIT stumbled on the break, stalked in the three path near the rear down the backside, made little headway running three wide through
the turn, angled out to the twelve path at the top of the stretch and could not get involved shifting inwards down the lane to the wire. REMUDA was brushed
outside to begin, forced the pace on the rail down the backstretch, could not match strides with the frontrunner midturn, began to give way on the fence at
the top of the stretch and retreated on the rail at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
HUNGRY WOLF was bumped into a rival at the start, moved forward leaving the backstretch to race just off the leaders stalking into the turn, moved out
advancing three then four then five wide on that bend, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch while commencing a bid, surged past. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW came out
and bumped a rival at the start, tracked from inside in behind the leaders into the turn, bid inside in upper stretch taking the lead past the three-sixteenths,
was outkicked. COHERENCE moved five then six wide through the turn, loomed a threat, could not kick on with the top pair but kept on for show honors.
SO CALLED VACATION settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, kept on inside to improve. POLITICAL WARFARE was well-placed stalking three to
four wide into the turn, bid at the three-sixteenths, flattened out. DEMBA moved forward between runners, dueled inside for the lead but just off the fence,
weakened. REASON TO DREAM was bumped, clipped heels and checked at the start spotting the field nearly ten lengths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and showed late interest. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN chased between runners three to four wide on the turn, needed more. CLIVE CROSS was
outpaced racing inside on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. ASTAPOVO broke outwardly then shot clear early setting the pace from well off the
inside, faced inside challengers and dueled outside a foe about three wide into the turn, came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START, CHAIRMAN RAINBOW WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED SEVENTH BEHIND REASON TO DREAM FOR CAUSING A
CHAIN REACTION THAT INTERFERED WITH THE LATTER.
