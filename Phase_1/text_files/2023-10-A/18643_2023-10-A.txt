little in the lane. FLATTERING WAY raced off the rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LOCKDOWN VANNA stumbled

Footnotes
DIVINE FASHION saved ground on the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased to the outside of the
pace-setter into the stretch, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. MELODIOUS SINGER rated a slim lead inside, came under
pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. VOLNAY was brushed leaving the
gate then stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and ran evenly in the
lane. SHERIFF'S KID rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane.
KATY THE CAT settled off the rail on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. FLAVA'S DREAM settled in the two and three
paths the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path. R WORKING GIRL came away awkwardly and
made light contact with Volnay, tapered in and stalked two deep the first turn but gave way leaving the three eighths pole and was eased the final quarter
mile.

turn, gave up the lead toward mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. SURCHARGE chased outside, rounded the turn about the five path and ran
evenly in the lane. TALENTED CORINNA was bumped off stride at the start then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and flattened later yards.
WATERLOO ROSE chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. STOPWATCHSONNY chased the early pace
outside, entered the turn about the six path, angled in toward the head of the lane and showed little more. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS gave chase, raced
in the four path on the turn, drifted leaving the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
JAYJAYDEE tapered in and stalked from the three path the first turn, closed to the front approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear approaching the
head of the lane, was steadily handled to extend his lead to mid-stretch then taken in hand late yards. RIDICULOUS settled in the two and three paths the
first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn, left the turn outside and dug in to take second later yards.
ANTIPOISON angled to the four path into the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and
dueled through the stretch for third. SCOTTSDALE moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met
toward the five sixteenths and raced close at the rail most of the far turn, but dropped back approaching the head of the lane and was outfinished in the
stretch duel for third. UNCAPTURED KING raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail then flattened stride. PYEONG CHANG saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn
and showed little further. RAISE A SPEIGHTS stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened off the rail on the
far turn.

HARPERSGONEFISHING veered in leaving the gate then raced with a slim lead inside on the opening turn, was met toward the three eighths pole and
dueled with a slight disadvantage from that point, checked in tight at the rail midway on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to take the nod in
the final stride. DOCTOR PARDO exchanged contact with Red Hot Toddy leaving the gate then saved ground, started a bid approaching the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to take second under the wire. LASTWALKTOFREEDOM was a bit reluctant to
load then tapered in and raced with the pace through the front stretch, stalked into the backstretch and challenged approaching the three eighths pole,
dueled with the advantage from that point and drew clear midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught in the final strides.
LIEUTENANT BROWN rounded the first turn in the five path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and
showed little further. RED HOT TODDY exchanged contact with Doctor Pardo leaving the gate then settled off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MONKEY WRENCH raced in the four path the first turn then stalked into the
backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths then weakened. COMEONTURNMELOOSE
was forced inward leaving the gate, saved ground well back on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. HILLBILLY ROCK was

GRAN ANDREWS settled off the rail on the first turn, rallied to the lead three wide approaching the three eighths pole, raced clear at the five sixteenths,
widened near the rail on the far turn then kept alert to mid-stretch before being taken in hand. MARK DID IT saved ground into the opening turn, started a
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but proved no match for the winner and had to settle for second. VAIL OF HONOR angled in entering the first turn and
raced well back from early contention, started a bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly to take third
the final stride. SPUNMAN settled in the three path the first turn then saved ground on the second turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at
the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. ROCKY DICE raced off the rail on the first turn and never factored. LANGLEE AVENUE settled off the
rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole but weakened into the far turn. OVER AND THUNDER took over into the first turn
and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught toward the three eighths and weakened into
the far turn.

Footnotes
HAGGERSDALE set a pressured pace and contested even terms at the rail on the turn, then dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the game
challenge of SWEET SYNTAX, who was forced inward and into Seize The Breeze leaving the gate then closed and dueled at mostly even terms past the
three eighths pole, contested the turn two deep and dug in gamely to the finish. RUNAWAY ROAD veered in leaving the gate then gave chase, raced at the
rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for third. SEIZE THE BREEZE was bumped then shuffled back on the chute, gave chase through the
backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. D TACHYON chased toward mid track, angled to the seven path through the turn, left
the turn widest and passed some rivals. SURF CITY GOLD gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. PERSONAL FINANCE
stumbled leaving the gate but quickly recovered to take a brief early lead, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, dropped back approaching the five
sixteenths, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened. SAAFEN gave chase, raced in the three and four paths on the turn and showed little in the
lane. SKY OF GOLD gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path and weakened.
