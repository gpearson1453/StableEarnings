Footnotes
VERMEER away well and sent for the lead, cleared rivals mid backstretch, continued to lead on the turn and opened up in the lane, kept to task and safely
held. AWESOME HEIGHTS stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, launched bid five wide and kept on willingly to get
up for a no threatening second. NAUGHTY CHILD chased leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, took aim in upper stretch,
failed to make any headway on clear leader, and kept on in final sixteenth while being passed late for second. ROCKY JACK tracked pace three wide on the
backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, entered lane in contention and kept on while besting the rest. PAUL L stalked pace along the inside on the
backstretch, continued along the rail on the turn, entered lane in the two path and finished up evenly. B D R DRAGSTER away cleanly, dropped to the back
and trailed throughout, showed mild late progress in the lane. BETITO chased leader along the rail on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn,
entered lane with some promise and failed to deliver when flattening out. WE MISS GENO tracked leader four wide on the backstretch, kept wide on the
turn, drifted out and went into the lane in the seven path, and came up empty when asked.
