Footnotes
FORREST CITY pressed the leader from the four to three path into the turn, chased that well-traveling rival entering the lane, yet ranged up to bid in
midstretch, wrestled a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, sparred through the late stages and prevailed. ONE GIANT LEAP broke a touch outwardly
and brushed a rival at the start, dictated terms in the three to two path into the turn as an outer rival applied pressure, led confidently from that one entering
the lane, but embraced that one's challenge in midstretch, got subtly headed at the furlong grounds, battled on gamely to sustain the duel through the late
stages but narrowly missed. ATTACHE tracked the leaders in the three path, then only managed to chase them from the four path through the lane.
CHANCE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, shifted inwardly while changing leads at the furlong grounds and
failed to menace. GOLD LUCK took contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased turning for home and faded. KATTATH raced at
the rear between horses into the turn, but failed to respond to strong urging in the four to five path while trailing around the bend and got outrun.

Footnotes
HUNTSVILLE laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied outside of foes, gained place and took aim on the clear
and tiring leader in the final furlong, then reeled in that one within the shadow of the wire. LUNDBERG dueled for the lead outside of a rival and in the three
path into the turn, sparred between horses as an outer rival joined the fray at the three furlong pole before their inner counterpart faltered with five sixteenths
to go, shook clear of his outer companion in upper stretch, maintained a wide margin into the final sixteenth while beginning to tire, but got worn down in the
final strides. PASS LINE tracked two wide and between horses, bid for place inside of rivals at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer foe
leaving that station. SMOKE WAGON stalked in the four path, bid at the three furlong pole, dueled with an inner rival turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with that one in upper stretch and faded between horses in the final furlong. FUJIN trailed in the three path then surpassed tired rivals. TAMASHI
leaned outwardly and bumped an outer rival at the start, vied along the inside while remaining just off of the inner railing, but weakened nearing the five
sixteenths pole. LOUIS transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe before exchanging multiple bumps with that one at the start, chased along the
inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring foe at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. AMEREASE was last away before taking light contact from an
outer rival at the start, lacked speed, shifted to the six path to avoid a troubled rival at the three furlong pole and was outrun thereafter. OFF THE CLOCK
received and exchanged multiple bumps with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, but sustained an injury approaching the three
furlong pole, pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
JACKIE'S LOVE prompted the pace three wide, bid passing the three furlong pole, kicked clear entering midstretch, but drifted out while meeting MISS
TAPPY TONE's outer challenge in the final sixteenth, then brushed that one before fending her off to the wire. MISS TAPPY TONE broke slowly but avoided
pinched quarters in the process, raced at the rear in the three path, crept closer outside of rivals turning for home, tipped out to take aim in the six path in
upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the leader in the final sixteenth, but was herded outwardly before taking mild contact from that one in the late stages,
and was kept at bay. ROYAL LAUGHTER was a bit antsy awaiting the start, broke outwardly and bumped a rival when the gates sprung, raced at the rear in
the two path, tipped to the three path turning for home, then ran on to gain show from an inner foe at the sixteenth pole. ROYAL BLOOD broke outwardly,
tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home before drifting to the five path entering the lane, but got outkicked by an outer rival while flattening out
approaching midstretch. WATER FIGHT set the pace inside of a vying pair into the turn, then yielded in upper stretch. MINNIE'S READY vied two wide and
between horses, but weakened turning for home. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD stalked along the inside, but chased around the turn and faded. BEAUXS
ARTES took firm contact from an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses and gave way approaching the lane. THE RIDER OF MISS
TAPPY TONE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST JACKIE'S LOVE FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY
THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
ACCOMMODATE EVA set the pace in the two path, then along the inside around the turn, drew clear at the quarter pole and held sway from chasers
thereafter. MIXER brushed with an outer rival at the start, advanced four wide approaching the turn to a tracking position, pursued three wide around the
turn, took aim in upper stretch, but only managed to chase through the final furlong while securing place. PROMISEMEANEMPIRE bobbled slightly and
leaned outwardly at the start, stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase the leader while pulling away from the rest. MYSIDEHUSTLE raced off of
the pace two wide, lugged inwardly subtly and brushed a foe approaching the far turn, cleared that one and moved in entering the bend, but bumped and
scraped the inner railing approaching the five sixteenths pole, steadied in the aftermath, yet regained stride in upper stretch and ran on for a minor reward.
PAM PAM was pinched back between horses at the start, trailed, advanced in the five path around the turn and moved up. FULLY ENTITLED was reluctant
to load, bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack in the two path and failed to menace. PRAY FOR CHAMPAGNE raced off of the pace
three wide and between horses and failed to factor. ANNAMARIA brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked two wide but weakened between horses
entering the lane. VINO FROM ERNIES laid off of the pace four to three wide and gave way between horses. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT took contact from an
outer rival and contributed to putting an inner rival to pinched quarters at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, took a light brush from an outer
rival approaching the turn, dropped back to trail entering the bend and was outrun thereafter.

THOMAS AQUINAS, briefly lost action while bumping the inner railing entering the lane, yet shook free from his outer counterpart in upper stretch, held
sway into the final furlong, but met that one's rebid at the sixteenth pole and gave in late. GAMBLIN GEORGE stalked along the inside while under strong
restraint around the first turn, then chased the leaders around the far turn, sustained stride while vying for show with an outer foe in the final furlong and
edged that position entering the final sixteenth. MANDATORY MEETING tracked two wide, then outside of the top pair around the far turn, but shifted in
behind them while failing to keep pace entering the lane, chased while vying with an inner rival for show in the final furlong but yielded. PHREDDIE MAC
saved ground off of the pace and improved along the rail. GOULD'S GOLD pursued from midpack along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn
and lacked a bid. RADIO LIBERTY laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn and gave way. ELM STREET pursued from midpack
three wide, then weakened through the final furlong. THUNDER BALL leaned outwardly at the start, then saved ground far back but to no avail. ZVEREV
was severely bothered and carried very wide by an inner rival around the first turn, trailed in the two path in the aftermath and was outrun thereafter.
MENDELSFLY lacked speed four to two wide, then tired four wide in upper stretch. AGAPEE MOU bolted outwardly due to a broken right iron into the first
turn, bothered an outer rival in the process, raced along the outside fence down the backstretch before being eased around the far turn and pulled up in the

lane in the five path, sustained stride to close in on the clear leader in the final furlong while hanging on his left lead, produced a bid along with an inner rival
while being herded outwardly by the tiring leader in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed at the wrie. RUNGIUS lacked speed in the two to three path
into the turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, changed leads at the furlong grounds, sustained progress along with an outer rival in the late stages,
offered a bid inside of the drifting leader in the final sixteenth but got outfinished. MUMAYAZ bumped an inner rival in the early stages, advanced in the four
path into the turn, sustained progress to range up to the leaders entering the lane, drove clear while flopping to and from his left lead at the furlong grounds,
drifted outwardly while meeting challenges from a rival on either side in the final sixteenth and was caught between horses. MONEY RUN set the pace in
the two path, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and yielded entering the final sixteenth. INDULGE lacked speed in the three to four path
and moved up while hanging on his left lead. GOOD HEART pressed the leader from the three path, but gave way between horses entering the lane and
weakened. TREATY was a bit antsy just before the start, then bumped with rivals on both sides in the opening stages before steadying out of pinched
quarters in the aftermath, lagged behind into the turn and was outrun. CARMICHAEL tracked in the three to two path and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
FRONTLINE WARRIOR saved ground off of the pace, took closer order while improving inside of rivals entering the lane, searched for racing room behind
the leaders before committing to a rail bid nearing midstretch, produced a challenge at the furlong grounds, forged an advantage shortly after and held from
an outer rival through the late stages. EDGARTOWN stalked along the inside, shifted out entering the lane, took aim from the five path in upper stretch, bid
at the furlong grounds along with an inner FRONTLINE WARRIOR, but was outkicked by that rival leaving that station, ran on in hopes of regaining even
terms late, but was kept at bay. REAL MEN VIOLIN pursued from midpack two wide, fanned to the six to seven path in upper stretch, then ran on to vie for
show with an inner bidder in the final sixteenth and prevailed. MILL STREET broke a step slow at the start and came under urging in the aftermath, lacked
speed in the three to two path around the first turn, pursued from behind foes into the final furlong, altered course to the four path while between horses
entering the final sixteenth, stayed on to bid for show along with an outer rival soon after, but got outfinished. TIRELESS laid off of the pace three wide,
fanned out to the eight path in upper stretch and only offered a mild kick. PHENOMENAL DREAM was off slow, saved ground while trailing, rallied inside of
foes in upper stretch to be within range of the leaders entering the final furlong, but flattened out. ALL ABOUT TONITE set the pace along the inside, vied
with an outer bidder around the far turn, dueled with that one while shifting off of the rail in upper stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side at the
furlong grounds and gave way. SHARON'S PRINCE pressed two wide, bid around the far turn, dueled while floated to the four path in upper stretch, then
faltered between bidders leaving the furlong grounds. DROBNY was taken in hand between horses at the start, pulled and steadied under strong restraint
entering the first turn, fanned out to the five path around that bend, then swung to the nine path entering the lane and made little impact. MUGATU tracked
three wide, was roused to press into the far turn, but weakened once floated to the six path entering the lane.

LITTLE PRANKSTER broke a step slow at the start, tracked in the four path, loomed a danger while inching closer entering the lane, bid in upper stretch,
led approaching the final furlong and drove clear. MISS ARLINGTON set the pace in the two path, embraced an outer challenge in upper stretch, got bested
entering midstretch, gave way in the final furlong yet lasted for place. LOVER GIRL lacked speed in the four path around the turn, picked up stride in the five
path entering the lane, rallied but needed more to reel in place. MAGICAL LUTE broke multiple lengths slow, lagged behind along the inside, shifted out in
upper stretch and moved up. BLACK FOREST pressed the leader from the three path entering the turn, but chased between rivals turning for home and
gave way at the quarter pole. WILMA MANKILLER chased along the inside and faded. AUNT BECCA chased from midpack in the three path and between
horses, then entered the lane in the four path and tired.

Footnotes
IRISH ACES bumped an inner rival before brushing with an outer foe at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, inched closer in upper stretch, bid
outside of the leader at the furlong grounds and drove clear. KING CURLIN tracked two wide and between horses, was urged along three wide around the
far turn, shifted out to the five path entering upper stretch, then stayed on in the final furlong to gain place late. GATLINBURG brushed with an inner rival at
the start, set the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded, lost place late but narrowly saved show. SAFE TRIP
HOME brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, but got severely rank approaching the first turn,
bumped an outer rival entering that bend, finally settled into stride among foes entering the backstretch, drifted out to the six to seven path at the three
sixteenths pole, changed leads at the furlong grounds and offered late kick. MR MCGREGOR stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the leader
entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the furlong grounds then chased before getting outfinished between horses for minor placings.
TALL BOY took firm contact from an outer rival at the start and was momentarily knocked off stride, lacked speed two wide and between horses, spun into
the lane in the four path, shifted out nearing midstretch and moved up. FINGAL tracked three wide, came under coaxing while in range turning for home, but
was floated to the four path in upper stretch and gave way between horses. BASELINE BEATER laid unhurried while under snug restraint along the inside
around the first turn, then saved ground around the far turn but to no avail. OSCAR AWARD trailed, took the far turn three wide before entering the lane in
the six path and failed to factor. BLAMETHEGOODTIMES stalked two wide and weakened between horses turning for home. LE GRIFFON lacked speed
five to three wide and made little impact. ALL CHOKED UP laid off of the pace in the four path, took contact from an inner foe into the first turn, pursued
outside of rivals then faded turning for home.
