Footnotes
BEST PERFORMER stalked along the inside, slipped through to offer a rail bid in upper stretch, dueled with an outer rival through the final furlong and
prevailed. SPARTAN QUEEN tracked two to three wide, ranged up in the four path entering the lane to bid along with a rail-skimmer, battled with that one
while pulling away from the rest through the final furlong but was bested. EXCELLENT QUESTION brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the
pace two wide, steadied and lost action briefly entering the backstretch, pursued three wide around the far turn, fanned to the five to six path in upper stretch
and stayed on to gain show in the late stages. TOFFEE set the pace along the inside, tipped off the rail entering the lane, but was bested by a rival on either
side in upper stretch, gave way and lost show late. COLETTE'S JOY broke awkwardly and brushed an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the three
path, moved out to the seven path in upper stretch and moved up. BLUE TOPAZ lacked speed along the inside, shifted from the three to the six path around
the far turn and improved position. LADY EMILY KATHRYN stalked two wide, but lacked a response to urging between horses around the far turn, got
outmoved entering the lane and faded. QUEEN RHAENYRA pursued from midpack three wide, but lost position down the backstretch before tucking
approaching the far turn, saved ground around that bend, then faded. TAPITARA pursued from midpack along the inside, then faded in the four path. MILAN
MISCHIEF broke a step slow, leaned inwardly, and bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path, got hung in the five path into the far turn and
made little impact. LIPOCHROME bumped with an inner rival at the start, got rank among foes in midpack early on, backed out approaching the first turn,
tugged under tight restraint around the first turn then weakened around the far bend. HAMO pursued from midpack two wide and between horses then
weakened turning for home.

OVERINDULGENCE set the pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and widened while drifted outwardly. TRIBEST (ARG) tracked two wide, gained
place in the four path passing the five sixteenths pole, but was no match for the leader through the lane. MISS ANALYZED tracked along the inside, chased
under urging around the far turn while a bit off of the rail and lacked a bid. JAYLA stalked in the three path, chased between horses around the far turn and
weakened. BEAUTIFUL MANDATE was outrun in the three path. MIDNIGHT WALTZ was fractious in the starting gate, then saved ground off of the pace
and tired.

Footnotes
CATCHING FREEDOM checked out of tight quarters between horses passing the seven furlong pole, pursued from midpack in the two path, shifted out four
wide to be outside of the leading group at the three furlong pole, ranged up while fanning to the six path entering the lane, offered a bid at the three
sixteenths pole and drove clear. CASH ONLY vied two wide around the turn, but was outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch and secured place
leaving the furlong grounds. PLANET was put to crowded quarters between horses at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, gained in the two path
turning for home, shifted out in midstretch and sustained a rally to gain show late. CRUSADING stalked in the three path and between horses, was roused
in hopes of ranging up to the leading pair turning for home, but only offered a mild bid nearing the lane, got outkicked while entering the lane in the four path,
vied for show through the final furlong, but was surpassed by an outer rival late. PENROD vied along the inside, yielded passing the three sixteenths pole
and gave way. TIS CHARMING failed to factor from the three path. HIGH ENOUGH broke slowly but avoided contact from an inner rival by doing so, lagged
behind around the turn and made little impact. SPEEDTAIL stalked along the inside while a path off of the inner rail, but weakened on his left lead.
BURGUNDY ROYALE broke outwardly and bobbled at the start, tracked four wide but faded after getting floated to the five path at the three furlong pole
and was eased through the final furlong.

CHARGE ACCOUNT tracked the embattled leading pair from the three path, bid while shifting ground out and away from them in upper stretch, drove clear
at the furlong grounds and drifted out. EVERYOTHERWON vied two wide, but was bested by an outer bidder in upper stretch, then fended off an inner
bidder for place in the late stages. APRIL'S NO FOOL laid off of the pace in the three to two path, rallied into midstretch, took aim inside of place in the late
stages but was denied reaching that position. FOREVER HOME set the pace inside of a vying rival, dueled with that one around the turn, but gave way in
upper stretch. ICY STARE DOWN bumped with an inner rival at the start leaving them multiple lengths behind the rest exiting the chute, pursued from
midpack outside of rivals, chased in the four to five path around the turn, then lacked a bid before fading. LA TOURISTA bumped with an outer rival at the
start and got outrun. BEACH KITTEN stalked along the inside, but faded at the three furlong pole and was done early.

HIDEKI laid off of the pace three wide and between horses, fanned five wide while picking up stride entering the lane, then rallied outside of rivals to offer a
bid approaching the wire and narrowly prevailed. DEVINE CHARGER tracked along the inside, rallied in the two path through the final furlong to offer a late
bi along with an outer rival, but got outfinished. EMPIRE OF MY OWN set a clear pace around the turn, opened up a larger margin in upper stretch, but
began to tire entering the final sixteenth as an outer pair closed in and was caught nearing the wire. HURRICANE DEBBIE leaned out at the start, tracked
four wide, chased through the lane and got outkicked for a minor placing by an outer rival nearing the final sixteenth. SWEET ALYSSA broke outwardly, laid
off of the pace four wide, fanned six wide entering the lane but lacked a rally. SHOPPINGFORPHAROAH broke a step slow, raced off of the pace two wide
and between horses and failed to menace. MAGNILOQUENT stalked the clear leader from the two path, chased that one from the three path in upper
stretch but faded between horses in the final furlong. RUM RUNNER READY trailed in the two path into the turn and made little impact.
STRAWBERRYLEMONADE stalked in the three path, then weakened between horses in the four path. MOON MAGIC CHRISSY broke a step slow, then

STRONGHOLD stalked in the four path and between horses, emerged to engage the leader from the three path into the turn, bid and vied turning for home,
gained an advantage in upper stretch, drove clear in the final furlong and held sway. RESILIENCE raced forwardly in the three path and between horses,
tracked outside of the leading pair and from the four path around the turn, chased them through upper stretch, then sustained a grinding charge in the late
stages, flopped back to his left lead late and edged place. TRACK PHANTOM set the pace in the three to two path into the turn, met the eventual winner's
challenge at the three furlong pole, was headed by that one in upper stretch and yielded late. MO' SPRESSO was off a step slow while lunging a bit
inwardly, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, fanned to the five path entering the lane and ran on mildly. HEY JOE JOE saved ground off of
the pace but failed to threaten. SEARCY stalked along the inside, chased din the two path around the turn and gave way between horses. ONE RED CENT
laid off of the pace in the five to six path and faded. QUIET RUSH never got involved from the two path. COWBOY CODE tracked in the five path and
weakened between horses entering the tur.

TRAFALGAR broke slowly but avoided contact from an inner rival in the process, lacked speed in the two to three path into the turn, entered the lane in the
five path, awaited racing room behind rivals in upper stretch, split foes with clear sailing at the three sixteenths pole, surged and reeled in the leader in the
closing stages. STORMY PATTERN prompted outside of the leader and from the four path, vied in the three path around the turn, led nearing the lane, built
a subtly clear margin approaching midstretch, but was caught by an outer on-charging rival in the final sixteenth. SHOOTERS SHOOT stalked along the
inside, took aim along the rail in upper stretch but only managed to chase through the final furlong. GREENER PASTURES tracked two wide and between
horses, tipped to the four path for clear sailing entering the lane, but lacked progress while hanging on his left lead. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) tracked in the
four path and between horse, got floated to the five path entering the lane and gave way. TEXAS RED HOT had his head down when the gates opened and
broke multiple lengths slow, lagged behind in the three path into the turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. BRESLAU tracked
outside of rivals, chased five wide around the turn, entered the lane six wide and faded. HEARTBREAKER broke outwardly, set the pace inside of a vying
rival while remaining a path off of the rail, but was headed approaching the lane and weakened between horses in upper stretch. SEVEN FURLONG
FRACTION WAS GATHERED VIA E-GPS DATA.

Footnotes
LOVED REIKO broke a step slow, got rank while trailing into the first turn, shifted four wide into the far turn, gained down the backstretch to bid entering the
final turn, led two wide around that bend, then drew clear nearing the lane and held sway. VIVA LA RED broke a beat slow, pursued from midpack three
wide, crept closer around the far turn, gained place entering the lane and chased the leader home. MODERN LOVE settled three wide, then gained five
wide around the final turn to reach show at the three sixteenths pole. ROBIN SAGE laid off of the pace two to three wide, pursued four wide and between
horses around the far turn and ran on. R ROSE' ALL DAY was reluctant to load, bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the
inside, tracked between horses around the final bend but lacked a bid. LAVISH HABITS bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the
inside, then just off of the rail around the final turn, awaited racing room nearing the lane, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked a rally. TITUBA pursued
from midpack to wide and between horses and faded around the far turn. AUTISM COMMUNITY lacked speed two wide and made little impact. FACCIA
BELLA stalked in the three path, bid along with the eventual winner into the far turn, proved no match for that one turning for home and caved along the
inside. J M VELA tracked three wide but weakened between horses around the far turn. DAME JOVIALE set a clear pace in the two path, but was
overhauled by an outer pair entering the final turn and stopped. THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.
