Footnotes
METALLIC MAN took the lead shortly from the gate while in hand, opened a clear advantage into the turn and finished well having never been threatened.
BOOTDADDY JUSTICE stalked the pace through the turn along the fence, tipped out to mount a rally at the head of the lane, could not gain on the winner
but kept on willingly to hold the place. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER tracked the pacesetter from mid-field, rallied three wide down the lane splitting horses
and got the nod for the show. AZZARO STEEL reserved off the pace through the turn, cut the corner turning for home and rallied up the fence to just miss.
BONNIE BILL prompted the pace from two wide to the turn and gradually faded from contention. CIELO AZUL raced three wide in the turn to mount an early
challenge and flattened out down the lane. GUARD slow early to trail and passed weakening rivals in the stretch. FERDAN failed to menace. HIGHCOTTON
JUSTICE was never a threat.

match that one but finished willingly while second best. NINE POINTER slow early to be at the rear of the field, made a steady advance to the far turn,
circled five wide while rallying and finished well to be gaining late. STARSPANGLEDIMAGE reserved to be well off the pace down the backside and made a
mild bid down the lane. STAR REVIEW tracked the pace down the backside, lost some position through the final bend, rallied in the lane splitting horses,
ducked out bumping rival at the eighth pole and finished evenly. BIGLEY HUGE sped to the lead in the first turn, weakened turning for home, brushed rival
stretch and continued to give way in the lane. YOSHIDA'S IMPACT dropped to the back of the field down the backstretch and passed weakened rivals in the
stretch. CHARMING VICTORY chased three wide to the far turn, raced three wide down the lane was bumped hard by STAR REVIEW when that one

GIRLS ARE TUFFER took command while in hand on a well rated lead, responded when challenged in upper stretch and prevailed through the drive in a
game effort. TIZZY JOJO pressed the pacesetter through the turn, rallied turning for home to loom boldly and could not get passed the winner in a good
effort to be second best. TU CHA reserved off the early pace, was set to a drive early in the turn and made a steady gain to garner the show.

pace from the rail through the turn and weakened coming home. ANJAWAY passed weaker rivals in the stretch. LEXI SUN stalked the pace to the turn,
rallied up three wide to threaten and gave way turning for home. PASSIONFORJUSTICE failed to menace. HOOSIER PREMIUM was never a threat.

Footnotes
WELLAREYOUHAPPYNOW reserved off the pace for the first three-eighths, rallied in the turn along the fence, angled out five wide turning for home and
closed strongly to be up in the final strides. ONDA BRAVA rated in mid-pack off the pace through the turn, closed down the lane in traffic around a
weakening foe, surged between rivals nearing the wire and just missed in a game effort. JANEY CREED slow early to be at the back, circled widest of all
turning for home and closed with a belated rush to come up just short. HAPPY BAYTOWN pressed the pace to the turn, assumed command on the bend
and finished willingly while outkicked late in the drive. MIDNIGHT ANGEL steadily advanced in the turn from two wide, lost position in traffic in upper stretch
and came on late. SELES well placed in striking distance turning for home and was out-finished late. KAM'S ROCKIN GOLD set the pace into the turn under
pressure, kept on through the lane battling to deep stretch and weakened in the final hundred yards. HIGH SHOT prominently placed four wide through the
turn and faded in the stretch. VEECATION stalked the pace to the head of the lane, loomed in mid-stretch and gave way late. HALEY'S HONOR failed to
menace. PRIX rated in mid-pack from three wide into the turn and gout out badly carrying a foe with him and finished evenly. ELLIOTT MOON was carried
out when racing four wide on the turn to be in the middle of the track and lost all chance.

BARKSDALE was clear early in the two path, was challenged at the five-eighths pole, took command by a half mile, drew off in the stretch and lasted
against the closer under steady urging. COMPANY YOU KEEP pressed the pace early in the three path, settled, rallied belatedly in the five path and
missed. DIVINE EMPIRE pressed the pace in the four path, was left behind in the stretch and came again late inside. ICE EXPRESS stalked the pace
inside, bid at the half, then faltered in the stretch. TIZZY INDY raced four wide around the first turn, in the three path down the backstretch, saved ground
around the far turn, then faded. COOPERSTOWN was pinballed and squeezed back at the start, being three lengths back, then raced five wide. SHOTGUN

Footnotes
FIELD DAY reserved off the early pace, rallied to close ground turning for home, angled to the inside and drove up the fence to prevail in a head bob.
SHIMMER ME TIMBERS pressed the early pace from two wide through the turn, assumed command at the head of the lane, dueled from between horses
down the lane and just missed. STORM THE COURT tracked the pace to the top of the lane, made a four wide bid to loom large in upper stretch and was
outkicked late in the drive. CIRCLE BACK JACK unhurried for a half mile, rallied up the fence down the lane to be gaining late. GET BACK GOLDIE raced
wide through the turn and improved his position down the lane. RACE DRIVER went evenly in mid-pack failing to mount a bid. REAL NEWS stalked the
pace from three wide through the turn, threatened in upper stretch and weakened late. SEVEN SCENTS slow early to be at the rear of the field and passed
tiring rivals in the lane. SMOKIN RICHIE set a pressured pace early, opened a clear advantage in the turn through rapid fractions and tired coming home.
NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) flashed speed early on and stopped in the lane. CLASSIC MAX was never a threat.

Footnotes
ICE COLD tracked the leaders through the far turn, angled four wide at the quarter pole, quickly asserted herself turning for home to take command and
drew off through the lane as much best. LILMORECRAKEN stalked the pace down the backside from three wide, ranged up on the turn to engage the
leaders, was instantly overtaken by the winner but kept on willingly through the stretch to hold the place. SI CERTO prompted the pace the entire way,
moved to the lead leaving the quarter pole from two wide, could not go with the winner but battled the runner-up gamely to the wire to be best of the rest.
CHARGED LEGACY set a pressured pace to the top of the lane, weakened through the stretch but kept on to hold the minor placing. I MADE IT raced near
the rear of the field most of the way and made a late gain passed weaker rivals in the lane. PRIMROSE GIRL failed to menace finishing without a rally.
CLASSIC KITTEN was one paced without being a threat. POISED was never a factor. FRONT COVER well placed for the first half mile and gave way.
MARTZ ROSEY was always outrun.

Footnotes
MOLLY'S TOWN raced four wide in the first turn, pulled to the lead down the backside from between rivals, took command in the turn, widened his
advantage in upper stretch and drew off as much best. GOODLOOKINJUSTICE stalked the pace down the backside, lost position when several rivals made
an early move at the half mile pole, rallied splitting horses nearing the quarter pole and finished willingly to be second best. KINGSBURY ROAD raced three
wide in the first turn, rallied up five wide at the half mile pole with an early bid to loom large, could not go with the winner and kept on well for the show.
JUSTHAPPYTOBEHERE slow early to be at the back of a strung out field and steadily gained ground to the wire to hit the board. BOLD SPIRIT set the
pace from the fence to the backside, was engulfed when four rivals made a move at the half mile pole, weakened through the turn and finished evenly.
HADLEY'S MAX well placed to the far turn and failed to keep pace with the leaders. FIREBALL JUSTICE raced near the rear of the field to the far turn and
passed weakened rivals. UNBRIDLED SLOPE dropped back into the far turn and was never a threat. POSITIVE CHANGE failed to menace. SHAGBARK
was never a factor. TACKLIN FUEL showed brief speed and came up empty.

Footnotes
KING ICE unhurried early to be well off the pace, quickly made up ground entering the turn to make four wide bid at the quarter pole, took command in
mid-stretch and drew away in a well handled ride. MANSFIELD TIGER reserved off the pace in mid-pack, rallied five wide and closed well to gain the place.
CASH LOGISTICS rated in hand for the run down the backside, made a steady gain and dug-in between horses to just miss the place but gain the show in
a three horse photo. ONE BIG DUDE stalked the pace to the far turn, ranged up three wide to take the lead on the bend, could not go with the winner and
was out-finished in the final strides for the minor placings. GRAND IN BAY slow early to trail through the first turn, continued on near the rear into the far turn
and mounted a belated rally down the lane. D'ORO'S WISH went one-paced lacking a rally. BLUEGRASS PRAYER raced near the rear of the field most of
the way and passed tiring rivals down the lane. MR CHAOS tracked the leaders through the far turn, loomed in upper stretch and flattened out in the lane.
LATIGO rated in striking position down the backside, mounted an early bid threatening in the turn and weakened turning for home. TAILLIGHTS was never
a threat. PRINCE SHIM set the pace to the far turn and came up empty. ON THE RAYDAR pressed the pace to the three-eighths pole and stopped in the
turn.

Footnotes
BLUELIGHTSPECIAL prompted the early pace through the first turn, took control down the backside, opened up on the turn, responded when engaged in
mid-stretch and repelled the challenge gamely. LOUDER THAN WORDS reserved in mid-pack down the backside, rallied three wide in the turn steadily
gaining ground to challenge the winner in the lane and was denied in deep stretch. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE unhurried early to be near the back of the pack
and mounted a rally in the lane to be up for the show. SASSY KATIE stalked the pace from three wide to be well placed in striking distance turning for home
and failed to gain down the stretch. BUMBLE OF LOVE trailed to midway on the final bend and passed weakened rivals in the lane. QUICK AND EASY
tracked the leaders for a half mile and weakened. MINTCHOCOLATECHIP showed speed for the first half mile to be on the pace and came up empty.
