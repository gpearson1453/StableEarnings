Footnotes
KNIGHT OF HONOR challenged, racing near the front, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane and proved the best. LOVELY SASSICAIA went
to the front, drove clear, was collared down the stretch by KNIGHT OF HONOR, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was best of others. ARKANSAS
ZONG raced within contention, made a late bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. GROSSE TETE IAN raced near the middle of the
field, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. INGLIS raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside,
made a bid and hung. STRIKE A BARGAIN lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. HALF CRAZY pressed the early pace and made a
steady retreat. RED ON THE HEAD lacked early speed, always raced near the back, bled and was vanned off. WAUCHULA broke a step slow and showed
little.

Footnotes
MOLTO VINO unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a bid, racing four wide and was going away at the end. GIRL
LIKES BLING pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner deep in the lane, but held on for second. ASTROLOGY GIRL
went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was outfinished for second. BUCKSKIN JERRY raced within striking distance, saved ground around the
turn, made a mild bid, racing four wide and was no factor. CUSTOM SUNSHINE showed early speed, faded and was no threat late.
COMMUNICATIONISKEY broke a step slow, raced in the rear, improved position, but was no factor. F J'S CHAOS was green in the post parade, broke
slow, gained ground racing wide and looked promising. MARION ROSES GIRL broke poorly and was never close. RACHEL'S GEM raced within contention
and dropped back. BETONYA always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
LOUISIANA COWGIRL pressed the pace, moved up between rivals around the turn, dueled down the lane and was just up. MALIBU TOAST raced within
striking distance, had an outside trip, dueled down the home stretch and just missed the win. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE lacked early speed, had an outside
trip, made a steady gain and proved third best. LAST OF THE NILE void of early speed, made a wide gain and finished willingly. CRYSTAL D'ORO raced
within contention, put forth an even effort and lacked a late kick. CINCY'S ANNA raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. LA VILLANA always
raced near the back and showed little. THISONESFORLOVE dueled on the front end, saved ground and dropped back. WA WA WEE WA challenged for
the early advantage and retreated to the rear.

and prevailed for the win. NOT LISTENING lacked early speed, racing in the rear, made a late bid, dueled down the home stretch, was bumped and
outfinished for the win. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS pressed the pace, saved ground around the final turn and proved no match for the top two. FREE DROP

lacked a late kick. DREWMANIA went to the front, drove clear and faded. LATE NIGHT CRUISER broke a step slow, raced outside around the final turn,
improved position, but was no threat. BABY'S LAST DANCE pressed the early pace and was finished early. STRONG DIAMOND void of early speed and
was never close. EL PAJARO LOCO showed early speed and dropped back. THE JOCKEY OF #7 NOT LISTENING LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL

DOUBLE BARREL MAN stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the stretch and finished well. MUCHO
MARVIN lacked early speed, made a late bid, racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. LAUGHINGSAINTSSONG pressed
the pace, came around the turn three wide and proved no match for the top two. HOSTILE AFLEET raced evenly in the middle of the pack, made a late bid
and was outfinished for third. SLITHER raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. JAKE THE BAND MAN showed early speed, drove clear,
finished early and faded. SMOOTH COLLIERY lacked early speed and was never a factor. LION HEART LEGEND vied for the early advantage and
dropped back. BIG BELLA BROWN always raced near the back and showed little. MORRICONE raced in the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TWO MINUTE DRILL vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn and was kept to the task. HAMAZING DEBATE lacked early speed, made a
steady gain, rallied four wide down the home stretch, proved no match for the winner, but got up for place. WUPKAR pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and was caught for second. MISS TULSA raced near the back in the early part, came around the second turn four wide, showed late interest, but
was no factor. CARSON'S PRINCESS raced evenly near the middle of the field, made a bid, weakened and was no threat late. BIRDIE CALL raced near
the middle of the pack, weakened and was never a factor. MARINA'S GOLD had a wide trip and was never close. TEXAS RED BEL dueled on the front end
in the beginning and made a steady retreat. CAVE CREEK stumbled badly at the start, racing in the rear, moved up, then dropped back.
