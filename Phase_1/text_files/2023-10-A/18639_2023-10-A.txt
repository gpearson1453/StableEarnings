MIDNIGHT FAITH raced within striking distance, moved up around the turn, rallied down the stretch and drove clear before the wire. EARLY DAWN went to
the front, drove clear, but couldn't match strides with the winner deep in the stretch. HIDDEN LOVE raced near the middle of the field, came around the turn
on the outside, made a wide gain and missed second. PINTORA broke a step slow, moved up to the middle of the pack, while saving ground and finished
evenly. DREAMED I AM FAST lacked early speed and passed tired ones down the lane. SENSE OF HEART raced evenly near the back and showed little.
KOSTROMA'S DANCER void of early speed and was outrun. AMELIES DREAMER pressed the early pace and was finished early. SHESTHEBIGGAME
showed brief speed and dropped to the rear.

Footnotes
BODE'S LIGHT pressed the pace, moved up around the second turn, took the advantage at the head of the stretch and was going away at the end. HERE
COMES MAGIC stalked the leaders throughout, had an outside trip, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SEEHOSS lacked early
speed, moved up around the final turn and got up for show. MONITOR MILLS went to the front, drove clear, faded around the second turn and was no
threat late. FLIT N FLOT TIME void of early speed, raced inside and was never a factor. BAND BOSS lacked early speed and was never close.
WEDINGTON pressed the early pace, saved ground and dropped back.

and hung. CUNIMBUS raced evenly near the back in the early part, moved up, within striking distance, weakened and was no threat late. SKINNY BOBBY

CHEROKEE TAKEOVER unhurried in the beginning, racing near the middle of the field, moved up on the outside around the final turn, came in down the
home stretch and pulled away. U S NAVY CROSS void of early speed, racing in the rear, moved up, made a late bid and got up for second. MR. FOUR
SEVENS raced within striking distance, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the second turn and was caught late for second. STANDING
MAN raced within contention, made a bid around the final turn, checked down the stretch, getting in tight quarters and went to the wire evenly.
APPLEWOOD lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. HONOR MY SPEED pressed the pace, faded and was no threat late. I'M D'CAT void of
early speed and was never close. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) raced within contention and dropped back. DONNA'S COURT went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground and stopped. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST raced near the middle of the pack, dropped back, stumbled down the home stretch, fell, lost rider and
walked off. THE JOCKEY OF #5 MR. FOUR SEVENS AND #6 STANDING MAN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #9 CHEROKEE TAKEOVER
FOR INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRECH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

EXPECT A DANCER pressed the pace, took the advantage around the turn, drove down the lane, was all out and just held on for the win. PETTICOAT
raced within striking distance, angled out entering the stretch, rallied down the lane and needed more ground, just missing the win. MYSTIC CREED raced
near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. STOLEN ART broke a step slow, showed late interest and finished
willingly. SASSY FLYER went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and weakened. R T'S CAJUN LADY raced within striking distance, faded and finished
evenly. DAT DARES RIGHT raced in the middle of the field, weakened and was no threat late. MO BANDI void of early speed and was never close.
LYRICAL MUSIC always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
MANGUM stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a bid, racing five wide and drove clear. SAMMY
DANSEUR JR. pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but got up in a close finish for second. WISE VERDICT
went to the front, drove clear, raced close throughout and missed second. BILOXI raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the second turn,
angled out and gained ground willingly. LUNAR MODULE was an early factor, saved ground and weakened. HEZA PICKLE raced evenly near the back and
was never a factor. MOTAWAAFEQ void of early speed and was never close. OCEAN OF STORMS always raced near the back and was outrun.
IRONICAL was never a threat, racing in the rear throughout.
