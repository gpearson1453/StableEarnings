the far turn proving no match down the lane a clear second best. MYRA FLEENER raced evenly moving past the others late. GORILLA GIRL slow early
saved ground to upper stretch finishing evenly on the rail. TOO CROWDED gained on the backside chasing on the far turn tiring down the lane. PAINTED
ROCKET was never involved. WICKED VALENTINE was always outrun. IRON WILMA sent clear set the early pace then stopped on the far turn.
