Footnotes
CHARLIE LIGHTNING set the pace in the two path, was put to a ride early around the turn, kicked clear turning into the lane, and held sway under a drive.
TAPIT'S DIRECTION rated in the three path, was roused between foes early around the turn, floated out to the five path going into the stretch, and kept on
for place. CORPORATE AFFAIR stalked inside, was driven along the rail around the turn, and finished evenly from the three path in the stretch for show.
WILD FLIGHT prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, but faded on his left lead from the four path in the stretch.
LITTLE STEVEN chased in the five path but made no impact.

Footnotes
HARLAN'S LEGACY settled off the duel while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch and dug in inside of
KATZ THAT GAL to narrowly prevail. KATZ THAT GAL raced well back two wide around the first turn, advanced four wide around the far turn, gained
outside of the winner through the lane but was unable to get by that foe. WHAT A KNOCKOUT broke slowly, raced well back inside and rallied for the show.
A RING THING broke out and bumped a foe at the start, dueled two wide to midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. BELLA MIURA saved
ground and failed to menace. VELOCISSIMA had early speed between the duelers, settled off the duel in two path early on the first turn, chased two wide
around the far turn and faded through the stretch. DOWNTON TABBY dueled inside to upper stretch and tired. SWEET ACTRESS was soundly bumped at
the start and never involved while racing four wide.

LIGHTING CLOUDS chased in the three path, waited under a nudge in the two path rounding the turn, swung out to the six path and bumped an outer foe
turning into the stretch, rallied past an inner trio, and went clear under a drive. GALIPAN stalked in the five path, was cued in the three path approaching the
quarter, got bumped out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on to be up for place. PRAISEWORTHY pressed in the three path, bid under
coaxing in the two path around the turn, took a short lead between foes passing the eighth pole, but evened out for show. TIZAFASTBULLET was behind in
the five path going into the turn, fanned out to the eight path entering the lane, but made no impact. MAURICIO prompted the pace in the four path, floated
out to the five path turning into the lane, but faded passing the eighth pole. JIGGERY POKERY set the pace in the two path, was roused from the rail early
around the turn, led along the inside entering the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. FIRST COAST STORM tracked inside but backed up rounding the
turn. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF GALIPAN AGAINST THE RIDER OF LIGHTING CLOUDS FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE
QUARTER POLE WAS DISALLOWED.

winner late. SMOKIN CLOUD raced off the pace four and five and ran on to gain the show late. GONE NUTS dueled two wide between foes and weakened
in the drive. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY went evenly while racing three wide. MONTANA MAN failed to menace while racing two wide. ETERNAL FLAME played
no factor while racing three wide. LOST A LEGEND dueled at the rail and tired in the stretch. RUN LEA RUN trailed inside.

clear under a drive. THELASTBULLETSMINE raced off the pace three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied to gain the place in deep stretch.
ANATOMY was off a bit slowly, sped to the front, set a clear pace inside and yielded near the sixteenth marker. GUNESH raced off the pace two wide,
swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. TREVESS saved ground off the pace, swung five wide in midstretch and never threatened. TOWSER
chased the pace three wide and faded in the stretch. CALL ME SPICY prompted the pace two wide, angled to the rail near the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
SANDPIPER MEMORIES stalked in the five path, bid under a ride in the four path around the turn, took the lead while back in the five path passing the
eighth pole, and inched clear late. L. E. GRAY chased in the three path, was roused early into the turn, tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and ran on
for place. AMOR Y CONTROL set the pace in the three path, was under a heavy drive while holding onto the lead turning into the stretch, but evened out in
the final furlong for show. THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) bobbled at the start, pressed in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, but faded.
TEMERITY trailed in the two path, angled out to the seven path into the lane, but made no impact. WIN DIXIE RONNIE tracked in the two path, was ridden
from the rail around the turn, but flattened down the lane. LADY NOY rated in the four path early but never threatened. AWESOME APEAL raced off the
pace in the five path but was no menace.
