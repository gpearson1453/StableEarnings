SPARKLE IN THE SKY ran off pace early in the race then passed foe on the turn with an outside path, coming on to the stretch started to draw off from the
rest of the pack. GONE KAT ran at the back of the pack then coming on to the stretch had a massive change in pace to pass the whole field almost. CANDY
TRACK ran at the back of the pack then late into the stretch made a strong closing bid to most foes. TAMMY MACHO ran in the middle of the pack then had
a late gain coming down the stretch. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE ran with an even pace throughout the race. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW ran in the middle of the
pack but as the stretch approached made a small bid at the sixteenth pole but the pace was too much and fell back. BURNINGDAYLIGHT had good early
speed then mid turn started to fall back, but really faded late into the stretch. COWGIRLLOVER ran at the back of the pack did not make a move to advance
but got tired late stretch. STAY BY THE BEACH was up at the front of the pack early on but the pace was too much and faded hard starting mid stretch.

Footnotes
CREME DE LA CHROME had a steady gain throughout the race and when it came down to the wire, got the nod to win. TACTICAL ATTACK set the early
pace with a comfortable length lead then coming down the stretch bumped against CREME DE LA CHROME slightly, but unfortunately did not get the nod.
SWEET RIVER BAINES ran at the back of the pack then coming on to the stretch had a steady gain to catch foes. AXEL STEEL had a slight gain at the end
of the back stretch and thru the turn then maintained pace once on the final stretch. BEDROCK ran with an even pace throughout. KEEN CAT ran at the
back of the pack then at the wire passed a tired foe. GIANT'S BRITE EYE ran in the middle of the pack then slowly shuffled back throughout the race.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY WITH CREME DE LA CHROME AND TACTICAL ATTACK WITH BUMPING DOWN THE STRETCH, THEY
DETERMINED THERE WAS NO FAULT AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
