Footnotes
STAR OF THE NIGHT (IRE) rated behind the leader on the inside, shifted out on the far turn and drew alongside HAPPY HAPPY, gained command leaving
the far turn, put away inner rival in upper stretch and drew away under a crack of right handed urging and steady handling. DEN OF INIQUITY (GB) settled
inside, drew closer while easing off the rail on the far turn, moved out further in the lane, could not reach the winner but managed to hold the place. BOLT'S
BROAD unhurried in the early going and steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and got outkicked for second. HAPPY
HAPPY vied between briefly then took control early and moved inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged from outside past the five-sixteenths pole,
lost the lead leaving the far turn and weakened in the stretch run. SAKURA FLAVOR (IRE) took back early and traveled two wide outside a rival, ran up
behind weakening rival and had to steady at the quarter pole, altered to the three path and could not rally once in the clear. ADELIE (IRE) tracked two wide
around the clubhouse turn, followed that path into the second bend, roused while tipping four wide on the far turn then came back to the three path late on
the bend and weakened. CHROME DESSERT prominent early from outside then stalked the pacesetter in the two path, started to weaken under coaxing
two to three wide on the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SMUGGLER'S RUN contested the pace from outside, kept the pressure on through the turn, dueled into the stretch, inched ahead from inner rival, cleared
past the eighth pole and was kept to task before coasting in the final strides. SANTOS TO WILSON coaxed to the front, set the pace under pressure from
SMUGGLER'S RUN, maintained a short lead through the bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. GOOD JUJU chased
three deep at the back, raced widest through the turn, came four wide into the lane, finished willingly in the final furlong but could not get by SANTOS TO
WILSON for the place honors. ESTABLISHED raced up close outside the top pair to the turn, chased three wide around the bend and lacked the needed
response in the stretch run. QUICK FINISH tracked outside a rival leaving the backstretch, angled to the rail around the bend and weakened. NAUVOO
chased along the inside, ridden along at the half-mile pole, dropped back on the turn, trailed three wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SARANDE bumped with inner rival early, settled off the inside, went two wide around the turn, three wide into the lane, bid three deep upper stretch and
proved best in the final sixteenth. SAND TO SEA pressured the leader from outside, vied between rivals while taking a narrow lead midway around the turn,
lost command in upper stretch, fought back through the final furlong and finished gamely for second. SATOSHI got bumped on both sides crossing over the
dirt then attended the pace three deep, challenged three wide through the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, battled between rivals into the final
sixteenth and faltered late. GRAZEN TOUCH got bumped between rivals crossing surfaces, chased keenly up the backstretch and steered to the inside,
tipped two wide while waiting for room on the turn, lacked room in traffic to midstretch, moved out and finished willingly to round out the superfecta. DUSTY
SPRINGFIELD was off slow to begin and tailed up the backstretch, went outside a rival into the turn, angled over to the rail then back out approaching the
stretch, angled out in upper stretch, drifted in at the sixteenth pole and was edged for a minor award. TAKE CARAMIE altered out crossing back onto the
turn from the dirt, chased off the pace three wide through the turn and lacked a rally. THE MUSIC WE MAKE got bumped and crowded crossing over the
dirt, moved over to the inside, saved ground through the bend and was not a factor. SMILING AMY took control early while pressure from outside, vied for
the lead around the bend and gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
BENDETTIJOE forwardly placed four deep into the first turn then took a stalking position in the three path, bid three deep in the middle stages, chased the
inner rivals with three furlongs remaining, re-bid from outside entering the stretch, cleared quickly and was ridden out to the wire. MONTANA settled inside
off the pace, remained along the fence into the far turn, eased out and came four wide into the stretch, finished well under right and left handed
encouragement but had to settle for second best. CRYPTOHOLIC vied for command inside rivals into the first turn then cleared around the bend, gained
company again in the middle stages, fought with MEMES through the far turn, was overtaken at the quarter pole, stayed on to upper stretch, then weakened
in the furlong grounds while outfinishing outer rival for the show honors. MEMES vied between rivals into the first turn then ceded command to inner rival,
went up to apply pressure from between rivals on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and put a head in front at the quarter pole, could not offer any
resistance to the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BLUEGRASS RYDER chased five deep into the clubhouse turn then moved into
the four path, continued wide through the far turn and could not rally. BUFFETT stumbled leaving the gate, stalked three wide then angled to the rail on the
clubhouse turn, chased two to three wide into the lane and weakened. WHISKEY VISION tucked inside at the back, went outside a rival into the
backstretch, moved back inside on the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BENEDICT CANYON stalked two wide into the turn, got moved out to the three path by CARMEN MIRANDA on the turn, challenged three deep in upper
stretch, took over midstretch and drew clear under urging. CARMEN MIRANDA raced up close on the inside, switched to the outside giving chase after
STRESSED around the bend, bid between foes in upper stretch, was no match for BENEDICT CANYON in deep stretch and saved the place. WET MY
BEAK tracked along the rail into the turn, brushed outer rival at the three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, altered out
past the eighth pole, rallied and missed second. M IS FOR MAGIC hopped at the start, ran up on heels early and steered out into the clear, chased three
deep into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, came out in the lane and finished willingly. STRESSED sped to the front and set the pace two
wide, crossed over to the rail on the turn, tested by outer rivals in upper stretch, lost command in the final furlong and weakened late. BELLA D chased
outside a rival then between into the turn, got brushed from inside and steadied at the three-eighths pole, moved in and trailed on the inside into the stretch
and could not rally.

Footnotes
NOBLE UNION dueled from inside then stalked the leader leaving the first turn, switched off the rail, bid outside on the far turn, cleared with a quarter mile
left to run, met the bid from LEN'S LUCK in the stretch and held gamely to the line. LEN'S LUCK trailed four wide into the first turn then moved to the rail,
made progress while moving to the two path on the far turn, drew alongside the NOBLE UNION in upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong and could
not go by. DONTTESTYOURLUCK stalked in the two path then moved inside leaving the first turn, angled out to the three path, chased within striking
distance entering the final furlong but flattened in the late stages. QUINCEY chased three to four wide on the clubhouse turn, went three then two wide on
the second bend and weakened. AMERICAN LIVIN dueled for command two wide into the first turn, cleared and crossed over around the bend, showed the
way up the backstretch, challenged by the winner past the three-eighths pole, could not kick on with that rival at the quarter pole and tired down the lane.
ACCELERAY chased four to five wide on the clubhouse turn, dropped back on the backstretch, trailed two wide into the lane and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
PALEO'S PRINCESS chased the dueling pair into the turn on the inside, tipped out and bid three deep leaving the turn, cleared briefly but was soon tested
by QUEEN OF POMPEII in upper stretch, battled through the furlong grounds and gamely prevailed. QUEEN OF POMPEII raced near the back two wide
into the turn, went between rivals closing in around the bend, drew alongside the leader with a furlong left to run but lacked the needed late punch to
overtake the winner. BIG CELEBRATION unhurried in the beginning, traveled along the rail then two wide into the stretch, angled out and rallied to get up
for third. DON'T JU FORGET settled inside, drew closer around the bend, lacked room and had to check behind YO YO MAMA in upper stretch, shifted out
into the clear and kept on while getting edged for the show honors. MISS O'BRIEN tracked the pace from inside, on the move while angling four wide
around the turn but flattened out past the eight pole. SPOILED ROTTEN settled off the pace, rounded the bend two then three wide, moved out then back
inward in the stretch and lacked a rally. YO YO MAMA broke a step slow then rushed up to challenge from inside, dueled around the turn and into the lane,
drifted in a bit in upper stretch and weakened. UNWRITTEN CODE broke well then dueled outside YO YO MAMA for command, battled two wide through
the turn and gave way in the stretch run. PER RULING FROM HIWU, BIG CELEBRATION WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

PRACTICAL MOVE stalked two then three wide early, followed the top pair from outside to the far turn, challenged three deep at the quarter pole, took over
leaving the bend, kicked clear when roused at the top of the lane and coasted in the final sixteenth. TRIPOLI hustled from the gate and dueled outside
NEWGRANGE, pressed the rival in the middle stages, headed that rival again approaching the five-sixteenths pole, took over with a quarter mile left to run,
relinquished the lead to PRACTICAL MOVE shorty after, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. NEWGRANGE
coaxed from the gate, dueled inside TRIPOLI early, inched ahead on the backstretch, raced on even terms again midway around the second bend, lost
command at the quarter pole, chased along the fence through the lane, steadied briefly approaching the wire and managed to hold third. AMERICAN
ADMIRAL tracked from inside then angled out around the first turn, rounded the second bend four wide, kept on through the lane and missed the show.

Footnotes
SHE IS ROMANTIC stalked three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled outside a rival into the second bend, driven three wide into the lane,
brushed by inner rival while launching a bid in upper stretch, took over with a sixteenth left to run and held over the late run from the runner-up to the
outside. WILLA T settled three deep early, remained three wide through the far turn, got floated out into the lane, rallied from outside and missed.
AURATIUM pulled early then chased in the two path, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, challenged at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the stretch,
shifted out approaching the eighth pole, fought between rivals into the final sixteenth and got outfinished. CIRCLE OF TRUST hit the gate to lose a step at
the start, pulled and had to steady off heels nearing the first turn then became rank, continued to pull the rider along early on the backstretch, roused around
the far turn, cornered well entering the lane, lacked room in traffic then found an opening between rivals with a sixteenth to go, split foes and earned a minor
award. BLUE OASIS stumbled badly in the beginning, trailed on the inside into the first turn, had to take up behind rivals near the three-quarter pole,
continued at the back on the inside into the second bend, angled out and came four wide into the lane, moved out and rallied widest in the stretch and
improved position. PERSIA steadied between rivals on the first turn then settled off the pace, angled out into the lane, was bothered by inner rival and
checked while brushing outer rival in upper stretch and kept trying to the wire. SABRES cleared early and crossed over to the inside, pressured with three
furlongs left to run, dueled into the lane, fought to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. MOCHA GRANDE got bumped from outside leaving the gate, took
hold shortly after then pulled more into the first turn on the inside, stalked up the backstretch, tipped out into the lane, lacked room in upper stretch and
could not regain momentum.
