VICTORIOUS TAPIT stalked the early leader, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. PERFECTION
SAVER was unhurried early, a factor from the inside on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. JIMMY IS A
BREEZE set the pace but was headed on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. BEAUTIFUL AS YOU settled off the pace
and was roused on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. MAKAYLA stumbled at the start, showed little and from the six
path at the top of the stretch was outrun.

GIVE ME MY MONEY was in range, moved up far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up in time. MISS D'S PRIDE was away alertly
and dueled on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. CHICAGO FREDDY forced the early pace and had a slim lead on
the far turn but was outfinished. GOOD SOLDIER settled off the pace, was a factor on the far turn and angled out in deep stretch while all out. UNBRIDLED
INFERNO was unhurried early and saved ground on the far turn but needed more. WAR DOCTOR was in touch and had a good position on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. AWESOME BREAK broke poorly, showed nothing, was outdistanced and walked off.

Footnotes
NATASHA'S BIZNIZ showed speed from the inside, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. JUNGLE
GODDESS was away alertly, had the lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held place. BETTABE SWIFT was off slow, moved up
on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. MS. P'S BELLA was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch needed more. FANCYSOUL was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch
evened out. SHELLY THE ROCKET was in touch and roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response. SHANGHAI
KIMMY was in mid pack but lost ground on the turn and was empty. PACENZA was unhurried and showed little in a dull effort. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO THE RUN INTO THE TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

DOT'S VISION was away alertly, had the lead on the far turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch prevailed. JACK THE CAT was unhurried early, a factor on
the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. HALF LIT set the pace but was headed on the far turn and from the three path at the
top of the stretch gave way. DOCTOR UPTOWN was in range and saved ground on the far turn but was no real threat. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was well
back and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. MAYITO settled off the pace, trailed the field on
the far turn and was never in contention. SOCIETY JOE was in touch but chased on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

CANT BEAT THE KATZ was hustled early, took command on the turn and from the three path through the stretch was much the best. FRESH DREAMS
was in range but lacked room on the turn and rallied late. SOMEONE ELSE was away alertly and was a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of
the stretch leveled off. KHOZZY VALINTINE stumbled at the start and was hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no
threat. MORE SAVVY was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch faded. SNEAKY REBEL was up close and
roused on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no response.

Footnotes
FRERET was in mid pack, gained ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. CRUMLIN BIRD was off the
pace, saved ground on the turn, angled outside in deep stretch and just missed. SPARKLE SAMMY was unhurried early, moved up on the turn and from the
three path at the top of the stretch rallied late. GREEN GABLES stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and had the lead from the three path in
mid stretch but failed to hold. HASN'T HIT ME YET was in touch and had a good position on the turn but from the four path through the stretch was
outfinished. FOREST B set the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but had nothing left. MUSICAL RIDE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn
but from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. SNELL FLICKA was in range but chased on the turn and was not as factor. BRIENNE OF TARTH
was well back and showed little while outrun.
