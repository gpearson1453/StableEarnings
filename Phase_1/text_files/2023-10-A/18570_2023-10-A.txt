then coming down the stretch ran against CASH CRUZER then got the nod at the wire. CASH CRUZER ran evenly throughout the race then dueled KING
BRYCE down the last half furlong and got outnodded at the wire. SLEEPY EYES ran off pace from the leader then coming down to the last sixteenth faded
slightly as foes pulled away. ETHAN broke a little slow but caught up quick to maintain the pace in the middle of the pack then coming down the stretch had
a late kick. MILD DISTRACTION ran in evenly in the middle of the pack on the rail. SEA OF INDY ran in the middle of the pack three wide then shuffled
back going into the turn. ARBITRO ran at the back of the pack then coming on the stretch had a late kick to make up some ground. DON HOLLYWOOD ran
two wide for most of the race then coming on to the stretch faded back. JR'S CONFIDENCE ran at the back of the pack then coming into the turn slowed to
last place. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HEAR ME ROAR ran off pace in the three path then in the middle of the stretch really had a strong close to win the race. DOUBLE STORM had good early
speed then maintained the pace with HEAR ME ROAR down the stretch but just couldn't match the closing pace. LAS TRES MARIPOSAS set the early
pace continued with a great pace but the pressure from DOUBLE STORM and HEAR ME ROAR got to them and tired out late stretch. SEE YOU AT THE
TOP ran evenly throughout the entire race. ARTFUL ROSE was off slow from the break but still made a good gain coming on to the stretch.
PREMEDITATED LILY started to gain ground on the leaders but the pace was too quick and ended up tiring late into the stretch. CAROLYN'S WAY ran with
an even pace throughout the race did not kick on the stretch. JEDI JENNIE showed little interest in racing but ran even throughout the race. MAMACITA
CARTIER started in the middle of the pack then slowly slowed throughout the race. MISS TRICKY INDY trailed throughout the race. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
