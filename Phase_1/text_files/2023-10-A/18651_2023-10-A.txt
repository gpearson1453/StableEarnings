Footnotes
STRIKE THE POSE tracked the pace two wide down the backstretch, was in tight between rivals entering the turn, shuffled back a touch three furlongs from
home, rallied on the rail at the quarter pole, shifted just outside off the fence in upper stretch and wore down the frontrunner just before the finish. GIVE ME
THE BOOTS took command from the start, led the field uncontested down the backside, dictated the pace comfortably throughout the turn, was getting leg
weary on the rail in upper stretch, fought to the finish but was collared by the winner nearing the wire and gamely held for second money. TIPSY MOON was
unhurried early trailing down the backstretch, began to lengthen stride going four wide around runners midway on the turn, loomed the the threat five wide
straightening out for the drive, could not close in at the furlong marker, stalled in deep stretch settling for show at the line, was pulled up galloping out and
was vanned off. MO TOWN MADISON stalked in the two path near the rear in the early going, put in a run two wide between runners three eighths from
home, showed some interest on the rail down the lane and finished up mildly to the wire for a minor role in the end. INFINITE PASSION stalked three deep
at the half, offered a mild run three wide outside horses three furlongs from the finish, shifted out in the four path to be in the mix for a small share turning for
home and evened out for a minor role in the final furlong. FOREST MAIDEN settled alone in mid-pack on the rail at the half, was checked mildly behind the
troubled runner at the seven sixteenths marker, could see the field through the turn and could not get involved in the stretch drive. MURDER HORNET
tracked the pacesetter three wide down the backside, chased the leader in midturn, could not keep up with others when roused at the quarter pole and
retreated between runners in mid-stretch. WAR'S END KISS had a good position nestled on the rail, keeping a close eye on the frontrunner down the back
straight, was steadied sharply on the fence inside the seven sixteenths marker, lost positions through the turn and could not regroup to be a factor in the
stretch run. STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE TURN RESULTED IN #7 STRIKE THE POSE BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR

Footnotes
UPSTART GENTLEMAN unhurried settled at the back, raced off the inside into the turn, moved out from five to seven wide under some encouragement late
on that bend, put to stronger urging in upper- to mid-stretch and drove past the final sixteenth. BOKERMIN appeared to brush the gate, settled outside off
the leaders, moved out from four to six wide while advancing, drifted in just a hair in upper stretch, could not match strides with the winner to the outside but
surged late to secure place. LUCYS CHILD exchanged a light brush at the start, pressed from between runners four wide late up the backstretch, kept on in
the stretch to get the nod for show. THREE SONNY SIDEUP coaxed to the lead soon after the start, was pressured throughout racing just off the rail, kept
on but was simply outkicked. ORPHAN HALLIE tracked from in behind saving ground inside the second group, ran on evenly. COPINSAY got away well,
was overtaken but in contention prompting the pace, went three wide on the turn, had no extra for late. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS stalked from between
runners in the second flight, came out gradually through the stretch and showed late interest once clear to the outside but far too late.
CANYOUHEARMENOW pressed from outside going five wide into the turn, was in a bit tight while weakening in upper stretch, was not persevered with late.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY FIELDS tracked three wide outside runners in the early going, was content to sit outside lurking behind the pacesetter, closed in three wide at
the quarter pole, dueled for the lead in the five path at the top of the lane and determinedly got the better of the contesting rival in deep stretch to edge clear
for the win at the wire. KEEP GRINDING had a good position on the rail watching the top two early on, was nestled rating comfortably inside down the
backstretch, waited throughout the far turn on the fence to pounce, burst between runners in the two path straightening out for the drive, battled with the
winner until deep stretch and was just outfinished late in a solid effort, besting the rest. BRINGER OF RAIN stalked between runners on the first turn, was
urged three furlongs to go improving on the outside to be in with a chance in the four path turning for home, ran on willingly to the wire but could not find
more late and settled for a non threatening third crossing the finish. NONNO'S LITTLE BOY could see the field three wide outside foes into the first turn,
took closer order to the pack down the backside, began to mildly pick up runners midway on the far turn, could not reach contention in the two path driving
to the wire and settled on the fringes in the end. ENCHANT ME settled near the rear inside on the first turn, made little progress on the rail down the
backside, was nudged for more three furlongs to go but could not gain on fellow rivals on the final turn and passed the tiring frontrunner in mid- stretch. MAD
MOCHA took this field on the rail into the first turn under a modest pace, dictated terms unchallenged through the backstretch, had a narrow diminishing
lead at the quarter pole, was collared at the top of the lane outside and faltered on the fence at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
GRACE ON THE GREEN was reluctant to load, shifted in to the two path and advanced along the inside of a foe early on the turn, angled four wide coming
to the quarter pole, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths, soon cleared then held under steady handling. MUSKOKA SUMMER settled into stride, raced off
the vying trio three wide into and on the turn, fanned five wide late on that bend, was second best. MO TOURING was encouraged along vying between
runners, kept on in the stretch while inside and outside sparring partners faded, could not match strides with the top pair but saved show. MORAL
TURPITUDE angled in early, settled off the pace saving ground on the turn, came out through the stretch finding room five wide nearing the sixteenth pole
and kicked on well late but missed show. I'M A BOURBON GIRL shifted in settled near the rail into the turn, came off the fence about three furlongs out,
went two to three wide on the turn in behind the leaders coming out four deep for the drive, ran on evenly. GOLDEN SUZIE raced outside four to six wide,
needed more. HUMOR ME JIM contested the pace from outside three deep into the turn, bid for the lead past the quarter pole, faltered in upper stretch and
faded. FANCY PHYLLIS moved forward to the lead after a sixteenth forcing the pace, vied inside through the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
GAROFOLI set the fractions with a narrow lead down the backside, put away the chasing runner with five sixteenths remaining, opened up on the field at
the top of the lane and cruised home comfortably for the win. MAXIMUS MAGIC tracked the front pair at the start, dropped back between runners at the five
furlong marker, regrouped to track the engaging duo into the turn, rallied four wide with horses on each side driving to the wire and closed belatedly to be a
distant second at the finish. RED SNEAKERS tracked in midfield on the rail, took closer watching the top duo on the fence at the half, kept pace with the
leader saving ground on the turn but raced evenly in the stretch to settle for third money at the finish line. NEEDS FULFILLED stalked four wide outside
runners at the half, made little headway near the rear running on the turn, shifted inwards to the rail in upper stretch and finished with intent on the fence for
a minor role in the end. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE stalked three wide with rivals on each side running down the backside, offered a mild run three wide in the
second flight outside horses on the turn, was in the mix for a small piece of the prize in the five path turning for home and could not offer a finish to pose a
threat at the wire. CANADIAN DADDY broke out at the start, pressed the issue outside down the backstretch, hounded the pace into the turn, came under a
ride chasing the winner five sixteenths from home and backed away through the field between runners in upper stretch. PASSION PRONE hit the gate at
the start spotting the field five wide down the back straight, could not get involved outside runners throughout the turn and made little presence in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
GRAND AMBITION broke inwardly, tracked in behind the leaders saving ground on the turn, ridden along past the five-sixteenths while dropping back
considerably off the leader, came out gradually nearing the furlong grounds under stout urging, surged from between foes to take the lead seventy yards out
and cleared. TREBUCHET stalked from outside the eventual winner just off the leading pair two to three wide on the turn, came out four to five wide for the
drive, surged late but was only second best. MIAH SAID stalked the leader from off the inside, bid coming to the sixteenth pole, was outkicked. DIXIE'S
FLATTER shifted in settling off the pace, advanced inside a foe then came out off the fence midway on the turn, came out in late stretch for room while
closing willingly. VENTI moved to the lead soon after the break, set the pace in the clear near the inside, asked for more nearing the furlong grounds, lacked
the needed late kick. DISCOVERY CHART veered out badly at the start, shifted back in while lacking significant early speed, settled at the back into the
turn, moved out from three to five wide later on that bend, ran on mildly. DREAM ON BABY dwelt at the start spotting the field nearly ten lengths then
veered out when leaving the stalls, advanced outside four wide on the turn, evened out thereafter. NITEINSHININGARMOR failed to threaten racing toward
the back three wide through the turn. SEATTLE POINT settled off the pace and racing off the inside, failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INTO
THE START IT WAS DETERMINED ALL RUNNERS HAD A FAIR BEGINNING.

Footnotes
LUV TO WIN broke sharp leading early, was then content to sit outside the frontrunner at the half, hounded the pacesetter throughout the running around
the bend, surged to take command between rivals in upper stretch and fought on gamely to hold for the narrow victory. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) was off a step
slow to begin, hustled to take command on the rail at the half, hounded outside maintaining a slim advantage on the turn, was collared outside at the top of
the stretch, battled stubbornly inside never giving in to the wire but could not re-rally late. GHOUL (BRZ) had a good position on the outside keeping a close
eye on the engaging leaders down the backstretch, continued to bide his time outside rivals waiting to move midpoint on the turn, closed in at the quarter
pole to loom a serious threat in the five path straightening out for home, needed more late, was gaining mildly at the wire but could not get there in time.
WESTERN TROUBLE was off poorly to begin, trailed in the early going, stalked inside in the third flight entering the turn, shifted outside commencing a run
with five sixteenths to go, in the six path turning for home was in range of the leaders, showed some energy gaining some late but had to settle for a small
piece of the prize in the end. GRAND ALLIANCE stalked near the rear outside of runners down the backstretch, roused to go on midpoint on the turn
making a mild rally, was floated out to the seven path being the widest runner at the top of the lane and could not get involved, only passing a weary runner
in deep stretch. TRICKY MAGICIAN was tucked in on the rail behind the contesting duo down the back straight, waited to move sitting on the fence through
the turn, was asked for run at the quarter pole, offered little response and gave way on the fence in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SIESTA BEACH tracked between rivals in the three path down the backside, was reined back to let the outside runner press for the lead at the three furlong
marker, urged to for more midpoint on the turn, quickly picked up the bit, pounced three wide at the top of the lane and drew away with authority in the final
furlong. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS co-trailed outside at the half mile marker, began to pick up runners extended her stride three furlongs from the wire, closed
in smartly at the quarter pole, was in the hunt in the seven path turning for home and ran on to the finish to be a clear second best when all was done.
VANDOO was in a good spot, all alone, sitting behind the contesting foursome at the half, settled nicely on the fence running through the turn watching the
duel up front, was in range on the inside at the top of the lane, angled outside in the four path with run at the furlong marker and closed in to capture third at
the wire. CLASSY IMAGE cleared to the lead getting to the rail along the backstretch, was pressured outside throughout the turn, fought on gamely inside in
upper stretch, was no match for the winner at the furlong pole giving way and finished up to hold for a minor placing in the end. CANTUCCI stalked outside
in midfield with four furlongs remaining, was gaining steadily outside on foes through the turn, had a chance for a piece of the prize six wide for the stretch
drive and finished mildly to the wire to be on the fringes. CHASING BOURBON was away slowly at the start, then was rushed up under a ride for better
position down the backside on the rail, shifted outside midway on the turn making little impact and could not reach contention through the stretch. VALLEY
VICTORY prompted the pace outside down the back straight, could not keep with others dueling for the lead running between horses three eighths to go
and weakened with runners on either side in mid-stretch. MEKO MAKEE tracked four wide on the outside in the beginning, was urged to force the issue up
front on the outside three furlongs from home, battled on the turn briefly getting the lead, gave way between rivals in upper stretch and stopped in the final
sixteenth. NATURAL STAR co-trailed on the inside down the backstretch, was roused for more run at the three eighths marker, lost touch with the field
running through the turn and had little to give in the drive to the wire.
