SEVEN SILVER COINS set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail, was no match and finished second best. MIDNITE MASQUERADE was taken back
early, raced six wide and was along for the show position. MUSCLE HEAD was unhurried early, went three wide into the turn, angled out and offered no
rally. ME stalked the early pace from the inside and faded. CATABILITY tracked the early pace from between rivals and was empty late. MONTEREY
SECRET pressed the early pace, went four wide and weakened. BULLY RIDE raced in mid pack and was finished early. WINDBREAK was void of speed
and was no threat. MOSTLY CLOUDY was outrun early and was no factor.
