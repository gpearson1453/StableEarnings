Footnotes
CATZALIONBYTHETALE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out in upper stretch and drove
clear. KOALA BEAR well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick.
SECOND ENCORE mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and edged up for the show. LAUGHINAGAIN mid pack,
moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. JUSTLYREWARDED stalked the pace from between rivals, held
position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, gained a short lead, then weakened the final furlong. QUANTICO (GER) mid
pack, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. EXPENSIVE TO HAVE passed tiring rivals.
REACHNFORASIXPACK sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then faded the final furlong. PITON showed little, inside.
FINESSIN was no factor. CHOCOLATE TWIST never far back, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally.

LETS RACE LADYS well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear, then lasted
under steady pressure. ROMAN CITY mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and closed
well for the place. A LITTLE FLATTERED allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside of rivals, then
angled around tiring rivals and edged up for the show. DON'T BLAME BERTIE well placed, gained a striking position three and four wide through the turn,
bid four wide into the lane, weakened late and held a share. SIX FIRE allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the
lane and closed willingly. OUR GIRL SNICK ran evenly. COUNTRY THUNDER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. NINA'S PATIENCE improved position. ACE QUEEN never far back, held position four and five wide
through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and had no rally. JEALOUS HEART was no factor. CONTROLLINGTHEGOLD sprinted to a clear lead soon after

Footnotes
DIAMOND DUST set the pace off the rail, shook clear through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. SAMEDI NIGHT allowed to settle,
looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the place. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT mid pack, looped up
three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and edged up for the show. CANADIAN GAME allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn,
fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. GLENNWOOD passed tiring rivals. FAMOUS N FLASHY rated inside, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. WHERE YOU WAS mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened in the drive. LIFE MISSION well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane and faded. GOOD ON YA well placed and between, stumbled badly into the turn and lost the rider.
