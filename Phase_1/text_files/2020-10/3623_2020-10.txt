Footnotes
COLD HEARTED GAL steadied slightly at the start and saved ground, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded most of the far turn off the
rail, drifted a bit nearing the head of the lane but took the lead past the eighth pole and drew away the final sixteenth. FLICKER'S PRINCESS rated the pace
inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught leaving the eighth pole and
flattened stride the final sixteenth. RICH IMAGE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed
little more. FREE FALLING settled off the early pace in the three and four paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close still in the three path of
the far turn but was carried out toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. LANGLEY GIRL stumbled leaving the gate and raced well off the pace then
bid only mildly outside. FULL FAITH gave chase then faded past the five sixteenths pole. REYANA REYA DREAMS raced off the pace in the four and five
paths and showed little after the opening half mile.

THREE BOPS pressured the pace well off the rail, contested at a close disadvantage two deep from the quarter pole then took the nod midway on the turn
and dug in determinedly to draw clear later yards. ROCKET RIDGE set a pressured pace toward the inside and contested the edge nearest the rail to mid
turn, gave up the nod at that point but continued gamely to deep stretch before yielding. CARSON CASTLE pressured the pace well off the rail then dropped
back nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn in the four path and took third inside the sixteenth pole. U S FUNDS chased the early pace toward
mid track then raced at the rail through the turn, though, ceded third inside the sixteenth pole. DIAMOND TRAIN angled to the outside to give chase down
the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then angled back to the outside into the lane and showed little more. CLUBIN TILL DAWN came away
awkwardly then angled out to give chase, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. OUR DIAMOND GIRL gave early chase toward the
outside, raced in the three path of the turn then weakened.

UPHEAVAL raced clear through the backstretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. MOSS BOSS angled to the outside to give chase after being
bumped at the break, was carried to the eight path on the turn but dug in to take second inside the sixteenth pole. DYNAMIC DAY came in to make contact
with Moss Boss leaving the gate then gave chase toward the inside, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MALIBU
CIRCLE exchanged contact with HELMS DEEP at the start then came in leaving the chute and gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened
stride down the lane, while the latter of whom exchanged contact with Malibu Circle at the start and was shut off at that ones' heels leaving the chute then
angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the six path and passed some rivals in the lane. GREY INVASION gave chase, raced in the
three path of the turn and showed little more. TANELEER chased the pace through the backstretch then drifted outward on the turn and weakened through
the lane. The Stewards reviewed claims of foul against the riders of Dynamic Day and Malibu Circle, lodged by the rider of Helms Deep and disqualified
Malibu Circle to fifth place for crossing the path of Helms Deep shortly after leaving the chute.

WISH IN THE CASTLE rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the three eighths
pole and raced in range of the lead in the three path of the far turn, then dug in through the stretch to get up the final yards. FAPPIANO ROCKET stalked
the pace two deep then challenged from the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths and took the nod two deep leaving the quarter,
drew clear into the lane but was caught in the final yards. SLEW THE TURN rated close the first turn then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and was just up for third. BAT TWO ONE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and
was met leaving the five sixteenths, gave up the nod past the quarter pole, dropped back into the stretch and was nipped from third under the wire.
CHAMPAGNE JAM raced well off the early pace and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the
four path and showed little more. W V ROCKET MAN was never a factor. GRECIAN ADMIRAL rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the three path of the far turn. This race was hand timed.

BACOLI settled off the early pace toward the inside then eased out into the backstretch, closed to contention nearing the five sixteenths pole and dueled to
the front leaving the far turn, then dug in under steady encouragement to move clear late yards. TIZEZZY came away a step slow and raced well off the
pace while saving ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled to the five path on the far turn and dug in to take second the final yards. STRIVE FOR
A CURE took the lead and rated the pace from the five eighths pole, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, was caught a furlong out but remained
close to late stretch before giving way. EXPECT DRAMA had a short lead through the front stretch then stalked into the first turn, picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. PATAZ raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. SILVER CASTLE closed to contention in the three path the first turn then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, though,
gave way rounding the far turn.

WAY AHEAD OF YOU set a pressured pace from the three eighths pole, was met at even terms while two deep midway on the turn, gave up the nod at the
head of the lane but dug in under steady insistence to recover the advantage and edged clear the final yards. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW set the pace most
of the opening three sixteenths then pressured the winner from the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms nearest the rail and had a slim lead toward the
head of the lane, dug in gamely from that point but relented later yards. BRASS MAGNOLIA chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn in the three
path then dueled through the lane for third. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE chased the pace and raced near the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel
for third. MEEMAW'S HEART gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little further. CHARITABLE MISS gave chase and rounded the turn
at the rail. SWEET LADY SUE gave chase and rounded the turn about the eight path. HATTA DOUBLE raced outside through the backstretch then saved

LANESBOROUGH stalked the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and dueled to the front two deep approaching the head of the lane, dug in to
the challenge of PEARLY QUEEN through the stretch and briefly ceded to that one while drifting a bit, but dug in to earn the nod the final yards, while the
latter of whom rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace leaving the first turn, bid from the three eighths pole and closed at the rail on
the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch then came inside the drifting winner toward the sixteenth pole to take a slim brief lead, but was outfinished
through the final yards. CANDYFORACAUSE saved ground off the pace the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths
pole, raced four wide on the far turn and was along for third mid-stretch. TUNSTALL angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the
three eighths pole, was caught at the rail toward the head of the lane then flattened out inside the eighth pole. EMBRACE A NEW DAY rounded the opening
turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, was strung six wide on the far turn and
weakened. NORTHERN HEAT came through the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole but
was strung seven wide on the far turn and showed little more. MABEL stalked from the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but
faded five wide toward the top of the stretch. TRINNI SUNSET saved ground.

Footnotes
COLLEGE KID was hustled clear to set the pace inside and dug in under steady encouragement to hold on. UNDENIABLE TOUCH chased the pace and
raced at the rail on the turn then dug in under steady urging to duel for second while mildly gaining on the winner. LETTS GO TO DIXIES chased the pace
and rounded the turn just off the rail, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. THISLILLIMEOFMINE chased the pace and rounded the turn at the rail
and finished evenly. QUICK ENERGY gave chase and raced in the four path of the turn, then flattened stride. JUNA chased the pace outside, rounded the
turn five wide and showed little more.

Footnotes
FLY E DUBAI rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace from the half mile pole, started a bid leaving the three eighths and took the
lead three wide past the quarter, briefly gave up the advantage to the runner-up past the eighth pole but recovered the front inside the sixteenth pole and
held on. KATMAN QUICK rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, was met at the five sixteenths and dueled at a close
disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, briefly recovered the lead into the lane and dug in gamely, but was outfinished through the final yards.
FRENCH'S QUEST settled back inside then bid leaving the three eighths pole and finished well while gaining on the top two. ROCKET ROAD became
reluctant to load then stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced close two deep while between horses on
the far turn, but dropped back leaving the turn and flattened out inside the sixteenth pole. CAT MOR BRIDGE stalked three wide the first turn then gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but, flattened stride near the rail on the far turn. OWL RUN raced close inside through the front stretch then eased out
and gave chase into the backstretch then rounded the far turn about the four path. A TRUE GENTLEMAN raced well off the pace into the backstretch.
ALMOST PERFECT drifted into the first turn, showed no response through the backstretch and was not asked the final quarter.
