Footnotes
RUVIES IN TIME established control in short order, cut over to the rail, getting there with a few jumps to spare to the half mile pole, showed the way, rated
and loosely-attended by MOVIE SCORE out in path two, shifted into the two path itself when put to a drive entering the stretch, rapidly extended the
advantage over the course of the next furlong, then maintained that healthy lead, kept busy to the end. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY took up position in midpack
after the break, was strung out four wide, the widest of all, during the run around the bend, angled into the five path stepping into the lane, venturing onward
as the widest of all, straightened away and rallied for the place. COTTON CANDY CUTIE pursued the pace from path three, commenced the stretch one
path farther off the rail, got outkicked. MOVIE SCORE briefly on the rail, abandoned it once the top one settled along it herself, was given some rein stalking
the winner on the turn, tipped into path three for entrance into the stretch, gave way. MISS LOYALTY faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey.
ZECHA two wide onto the turn, got sent out four wide exiting it, wound up trailing nearly throughout.

Footnotes
CAFE SOCIETY broke out at the start bumping HIT THE WOAH in tandem with OBLIGATORY who broke inwards, came under coaxing and prompted the
leader from the outside three wide down the backstretch and two wide through the turn, took over command patiently handled, in stark contrast to the
leader, when spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. HIT THE WOAH got
off half a beat slow and was bumped between foes who each broke her way, then got bumped by OBLIGATORY a second time due to pressure from JADE
EMPRESS breaking inwards and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on with good courage to secure the place honors. EXACT coaxed from the gate, showed the way
lightly coaxed along just off the inside down the backstretch under some pressure from CAFE SOCIETY to the outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths,
came under urging under threat through the latter portion of the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch displaced from the front, weakened in the final
furlong. OBLIGATORY broke in at the start bumping HIT THE WOAH in concert with CAFE SOCIETY who broke outwards, then got bumped solidly by
NISBET BEACH due to pressure from JADE EMPRESS breaking inwards and in turn bumped HIT THE WOAH once more and conceded five to six lengths
to the front, chased three then two wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and showed some late interest offering up a mild bid. JADE EMPRESS broke in at the start bumping NISBET BEACH into OBLIGATORY and in turn
HIT THE WOAH, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. NISBET BEACH shied in at the
break following OBLIGATORY who broke inwards, then got bumped between foes as JADE EMPRESS broke inwards from the outside conceding about five
to six lengths to the front, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
DEVAMANI (FR) away in good order, got guided over towards the rail, drafted at or near the inside route behind EN WYE CEE, shifting about ever so
slightly so as to always avail of the leader's cover, continued along at it until upper stretch, was let out a notch angling into the three path at the
three-sixteenths marker, responded when given his cue, charging to the front by the eighth pole, steadily extending the winning margin under good handling.
OLYMPICO (FR) remained stationed along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, was content to bring up the back of the pack until the end of
the second bend, rider holding something in reserve all the while, got asked for more gradually being maneuvered into path four from upper to midstretch,
rallied with willingness to garner the place. EN WYE CEE off to a sharp beginning, retained the advantage, get set up along the inside route, was in hand
carving out moderate fractions, accompanied by BREAKING THE RULES from the outside, got set down being challenged by that opponent approaching
the five-sixteenths pole, spun into the lane the with previously-mentioned foe directly abreast, staved off the bid only to have no answer once the winner
arrived on the scene, dug in well, but had to settle for the show. BREAKING THE RULES attained a forward position, stalked EN WYE CEE from path two,
rider applying a firm hold, whittled away at the deficit after three-quarters had been run, waited until the general area of the three-sixteenths marker before
giving it his best shot, wasn't up to the task at hand and weakened. SEISMIC WAVE well rated two wide during the initial stages, travelled in the three path
on the far turn, fanned out five wide during the opening stages of the stretch drive, came up empty.

Footnotes
PIER FORTY two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the front, angled four wide into
upper stretch moving into contention, rallied through the length of the stretch to issue a challenge inside the final furlong, dug in and was up in the last jumps
to the wire to score. UNBRIDLED JOHN away to the front, settled just off the inside prompting the pace of the leader, advanced on that rival in the turn
taking over command inside the three-eighths, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, edged away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was nailed in the final strides to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. RINGGOOD four
then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. STASH MY MONEY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. MR. FIDGET coaxed from the start, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn,
came under a ride at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. HAVE A HEART coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand along the inside under some pressure from UNBRIDLED JOHN to the outside, yielded the front just inside the three-eighths, cut the corner roused into
upper stretch and tired. LORENZEN chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out,
went three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. NEVER HOLD BACK broke in at the start, chased along the inside coming under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and faltered. LIQUOR bobbled at the start, recovered to chase four to five wide from near the rear of the
field, swung five wide into upper stretch and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
PUFFERY disputed the pace two wide for three-quarters, challenged in earnest spinning approximately four wide into the stretch, poked a head down in
front by the beginning of the final furlong, kicked clear, kept to the task at hand. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE grabbed the advantage in short order, was
along the inside route fending off the winner, got put to the test as the third fraction was being finalized, moved out three wide stepping onto the head of the
stretch by now fully asked, got reeled in after finishing off the run through the furlong grounds, had no difficulty salvaging second. STEFANIE ON FLEEK off
two to three lengths the tardiest, dove over to the rail, remained along it for over six furlongs, altered course into path four at the three-eighths pole, went on
to secure the show. VIBRANCY took up the chase from path two, got switched over to a drive coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch
one path farther off the rail, lost out on third.

Footnotes
MONEY IN THE BANK bumped at the start by THEITALIANAMERICAN due to pressure from PERMANENTRESIDENT breaking inwards, came under light
coaxing and raced forwardly placed four paths off the inside down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, altered out slightly near the nine-sixteenths
as BLACK IRISH shied out from a shadow before tucking three wide through the turn, steadily advanced to pressure that leader through the bend patiently
handled, swung four wide into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, dueled through the length of the stretch with BLACK IRISH getting brushed
by that rival inside the three-sixteenths, came under some cross reined urging to get some separation from his main rival and gamely prevailed at the end.
BLACK IRISH hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand from the three path down the backstretch, shied out from a shadow briefly near the
nine-sixteenths and was corrected, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under increasing pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside,
came under urging at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat coming out and brushing his main danger just
inside the three-sixteenths, dueled through to the finish and was ultimately bested at the end drifting in slightly under an off sided stick. TALESPIN hustled
from the gate, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. IMPERIO D shied in at the start and bumped PERMANENTRESIDENT into THEITALIANAMERICAN, chased five wide under a ride from
the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BRUNATE forwardly placed six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. SECOND FORTUNE seven paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under light coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper
stretch and tired. DAITHI coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, took the
inside route into upper stretch and folded. PERMANENTRESIDENT broke in at the start bumping THEITALIANAMERICAN into MONEY IN THE BANK,
then got bumped himself by IMPERIO D, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, swung four wide
for home and tired. THEITALIANAMERICAN got bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe who broke inwards and then got bumped again by that rival
due to pressure from IMPERIO D, chased four then three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, swung four wide for home and trailed throughout.

CONVICTION TRADE strung out four wide on the first turn, was one path closer to the rail and on hold on the subsequent one, got fanned out into path six
from upper to midstretch to secure optimal racing clearance, straightened away and went after the leader with a strong kick, overhauled THE LAST ZIP in
the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, maintained the momentum and edged away. THE LAST ZIP launched itself into a forward position with a three wide on the
clubhouse bend, was then rated prompting the pace from path two, continued along the same scenario for over three-quarters, was given his cue spinning
into the stretch, wrested away the advantage in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, was in possession of what turned out to be its largest lead a
sixteenth down the road, came under aim by the top one soon afterwards, surrendered with about a sixteenth to go, stayed on with good energy to save
second. MALTHAEL reserved two wide until the end of the second bend, got steered out into the three path for the stretch run, mustered up a mild response
that was sufficient enough to narrowly earn the show award. VOTING CONTROL off a half length the tardiest, was unhurried pursuing the pace two wide,
swung into action by swinging five wide into the stretch, shied out slightly between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, hitched up to a wayward
BIRD'S EYE VIEW at the time, ventured onward to be along for the last major check. ALBIE hung out three wide on the opening turn, travelled in path four
on turn two, was maneuvered all the way towards path seven after entering the stretch, made some headway in the final furlong. BIRD'S EYE VIEW along
the outside throughout, took up the chase four wide on the turn, was just as wide heading onto the top of the lane, came out for a sixteenth starting from
midlane without appearing to be making any headway. ROAD TO MEATH established the front end in short order, cut over to the inside, showed the way,
rated and being tailed by the second place finisher, was put to the test heading home, succumbed a sixteenth later and faltered. BAD BEAT BRIAN along
the inside, was through after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
HORN OF PLENTY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from mid pack, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the
three path nearing the eighth pole rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the final seventy yards to the finish inching away to
prevail at the end. EXCELLENT TIMING bumped at the start by DEE BO who broke outwards, established the front and showed the way in hand just off the
inside, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was caught in the late stages. IT'S GRAVY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside from just off the pace, got
let out spinning three wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors clear of the rest. FORTY TWO ACE coaxed from the gate, chased just
off the inside forwardly placed, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. DEE BO broke
out at the start bumping EXCELLENT TIMING, chased three then two wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. V PATTERN broke a beat slow and was slow into stride conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DOUBLEPOUR coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. MAKE IT IN NY got away to a hesitant start conceding five to six lengths
to the front, strode green and short under coaxing briefly early on and grew quickly detached and well behind at the tail of the field, remained under his own
power through the turn, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch, got asked by the rider nearing the eighth pole and showed late interest under hand
urging through to the finish while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
GET SMOKIN off to an alert beginning, maintained the advantage, was well rated along the inside route showing the way, attended by ASSIDUOUSLY in
the two path, cleverly backed down the pace after the first fraction had been set, picked up the tempo once more holding off the primary pursuer on the fuller
turn, spun into the lane still being confidently handled, was coming up to the three-sixteenths marker when finally turned loose, clung to an ever-dwindling
lead in the final furlong, preserved it by digging in with good determination in the final strides. DECORATED INVADER tucked onto the inside route after the
field had been released, was well held tracking the winner from midpack, was lightly hand urged slipping to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, got driven
three wide into the lane, gained ground in a steadfast manner, fell a head short at the wire. BODECREAM patiently pocketed eying GET SMOKIN, briefly
waited behind that opponent as three-quarters was being completed, got roused after settling onto the head of the stretch, proved no match while staying on
for the show. BUY LAND AND SEE hung out three wide on the chute, was one path closer to the inside by the half mile pole, got sent out five wide from
upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, rallied mildly. STARTING OVER rated in midpack for nearly six furlongs while racing two wide, angled four
wide into the lane, lacked the necessary response. GLYNN COUNTY at or near the two path in pursuit of the front runners, commenced the stretch slightly
wider, had no rally. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) prompted the winner from path two, pulling on the bit for a good portion of the opening half, kept pace with the top
one during the run on the fuller turn, went into the stretch and backed away.

Footnotes
CANARSIE ANGEL dueled three then two wide with WINIFRED J to her outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, took the inside route into upper
stretch, roused, came under threat from a pair shaking off her main pace rival a furlong out, dug in under an intermittent drive and prevailed gamely on the
wire rebuffing the pair of challengers. DOLL coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command through the final furlong fighting on between rivals but was ultimately repelled on the line while
getting the bob for the place honors. DEFY EXPECTATIONS five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit in range of the duel, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong battling heads apart with a pair to her inside to
the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. HENNI PENNY six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SMACK chased along the inside, got bumped near
the half mile pole and jostled when rivals to her outside fought for position into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and made no late headway. FREDDYMO FACTOR four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path and bumped and
pinched out BELLA ROSE between foes against CLASSY SADIE half a mile from home, came under coxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch and offered no response. CLASSY SADIE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from near the rear, got bumped between foes
near the half mile pole due to pressure from the aforementioned foe tucking inside and pinched back BELLA ROSE in tandem with that rival, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and offered no rally. WINIFRED J dueled from the four path down the backstretch with
CANARSIE ANGEL to her inside, tucked two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, dug in
under a drive now between foes and backed away at the eighth pole before weakening in the final furlong. BELLA ROSE three wide in pursuit from the rear
of the field, got bumped and pinched out between foes as FREDDYMO FACTOR tucked from the four path to the two path at that station jostling her before
squeezing her out in tandem with CLASSY SADIE, remained three wide through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
