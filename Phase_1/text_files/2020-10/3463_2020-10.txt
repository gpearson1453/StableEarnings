Footnotes
DOMINEERING bumped with ANDTHEBEATGOESON at the start, vied early between rivals, edged away in the two-path under a drive leaving the turn,
and widened kept to pressure. JEWEL sat perched behind the leaders around the turn, had aim in the three-path through the furlong grounds, and finished
willingly to go clear for the place. IZSHEFROSTED pressed the pace four then three wide to the head of the stretch, and stayed on into the final furlong
before getting outkicked for second. ANDTHEBEATGOESON bumped with DOMINEERING at the start, saved ground outrun to the stretch, and improved in
the two-path for a share. QUEEN CALYPSO stayed in range three to four wide to the quarter-pole, and faded. MAIKO vied early inside, and gave way after
three-eighths of a mile. THE RAIN IS COMING was no factor toward the inside. DAWNSWEETSMILE stumbled and broke out awkwardly, moved in to the
two-path, and tired before reaching the stretch. RUBY STILETTO was slow into stride, swung four wide off the turn, and had no rally. SO JADED brushed
the left side of the gate at the start, and was never close.

GITANA broke to the lead, showed the way inside to the stretch, responded to pressure and stayed clear. PRINCESS CORO stayed close early inside,
moved out three wide to loom a threat at the top of the lane, finished willingly outside but could not reach the winner. MYCRAZYXGIRLFRIEND pursued the
winner two wide to the stretch, stayed on her left lead and was outfinished. SHE'S A LADY GRIZ broke a step slowly, moved off the inside late on the turn,
and made no impact. TRINNI GIRLS fanned four wide off the turn, and could not reach contention. COMPETTI faded around the turn three wide. MISS
UNCAPTURED was through early inside.

Footnotes
TAKEDOWN stayed close inside to the far turn, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, drifted out under heavy pressure through the furlong grounds,
and wore down ALIEN INVASION from outside late. ALIEN INVASION alternated between the rail and the two-path setting the pace, dug in through the
stretch, and yielded grudgingly. TOTONO broke a step slowly, raced three wide around the far turn, and could not menace the top two while much best of
the others. MR. PAPILLON saved ground to no avail. INDEPENDENT WORKER prompted the pace outside to the far turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
INCLUDE THE BEAST was never far back, came off the turn three wide, caught PIPER from outside through the furlong grounds and drove clear. ACTING
LUCKY settled in the middle of the field early, swung four wide into the lane, and rallied to go clear for the place. PIPER led early, deferred to the iron-less
PINK FIZZ and tracked inside for three furlongs, took over when the latter could not corner appropriately a quarter-mile out, then yielded on the rail through
the last eighth of a mile. I'M A COCO PEBBLES was outrun three wide to the top of the stretch, and improved without threatening. HOT BABE broke slowly
and was outrun. PERSONAL REWARD moved inside around the turn, and lacked the needed response. LUSTROUS bumped with PINK FIZZ at the start,
and was through early. PINK FIZZ hit the left side of the gate with the rider coming out of the right iron, bumped with LUSTROUS with the rider now losing
the left iron as well, rushed up inside to the lead up the backstretch, got out steadily past the five-sixteenths with the rider still without control, and dropped
back on the far outside through the stretch. MY LITTLE GUERA broke slowly and was outrun.

INEDATEQUILA broke out but quickly recovered and rushed up to press AMBER PRINCESS into the first turn, took over outside that rival past the
three-eighths, dug in to repel a bid from NATIONALIST turning for home, and was going away late. NATIONALIST saved ground close up to the far turn,
moved out three wide with a quarter-mile left, bid outside INEDATEQUILA through upper stretch, could not get by and was much best of the others. FAST
FRACTION went along in the second flight early, came three wide into the stretch, and offered a mild response to go clear for the show. KISSES FOR
TIZZY was never prominent. AMBER PRINCESS set the pace inside, yielded to the winner midway on the far turn, and retreated. KAUFY FUTURES tugged
her way along three wide around the first turn, and came up empty when roused on the far turn. CAT'S J N J raced three to four wide around the first turn,
moved inside and dropped far back before completing six furlongs.

Footnotes
CHARGE ACCOUNT saved ground tracking behind TWILIGHT to the far turn, came through on the rail to take over after six furlongs, and edged clear
under a drive. STARSHIP MALLOMAR was never far back two then three wide, had aim outside the leaders through the furlong grounds, and finished
willingly to overhaul TWILIGHT for second. TWILIGHT set the pace removed from the rail, could not stave off CHARGE ACCOUNT past the quarter-pole,
and yielded the place late. INDICIA saved ground early, raced two then three wide around the far turn, and lacked the needed bid. INTEREST was floated
out by WITCH HUNTER into the first turn, made her way inside before reaching the backstretch, and had no solid response. ETANA moved off the inside
around the far turn, and made no impact. ZODIAC PRINCESS pressed TWILIGHT from outside, and tired before completing six furlongs. WITCH HUNTER
was keyed up shifting out three then four wide on the first turn, got pulled up past the quarter-pole, and walked off.

Footnotes
BODEXPRESS broke alertly, established an easy early pace two wide through the opening quarter-mile, moved inside entering the far turn beginning to
draw away at will, and rambled home mildly hand urged in near-record time. IDENTIFIER lagged at the back early inside, swung four wide approaching the
lane, and went clear of the others. GLORY OF FLORIDA became fractious in the gate unseating the rider prior to the start, chased inside for six furlongs,
could not keep pace into the stretch, and weakened. QUENANE moved in from the two-path early, stayed inside and was no factor. BLEWITT veered out
sharply at the start, rushed up four wide going to the first turn, stayed on the chase to midway on the far turn, and gave way. LIKE YOU bobbled at the break
and had trouble finding his footing for a few more strides, pressed the early pace between horses, and dropped back steadily into the far turn.

Footnotes
VIVA LA REINA vied inside several rivals up the backstretch, opened daylight after a half-mile, and was driving to 70 yards out before being geared down.
BATTLE CRY pressed the pace four wide from the outset, and ran on well to be clearly second best. TEQUA broke a step slow, put in a mild run two wide
on the turn, and finished evenly. NAJWA broke in bumping INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE, contested the pace between horses three wide, and weakened
approaching the stretch. INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE was bumped between STARSHIP NTERPRISE and NAJWA and pinched back at the start, put in a run
along the rail turning for home, but flattened out near the eighth-pole. STARSHIP NTERPRISE got bumped by VENEZUELAN TALENT at the start and
brushed with INTHEWINNERSCIRCLE, swung four wide off the turn, and had no rally. VENEZUELAN TALENT broke out bumping STARSHIP
NTERPRISE, battled up front between horses early, and was finished after a half-mile. HIGHLAND MOON chased outside the leaders five wide to the turn,
and tired. PONZI dwelt at the start, hit the left side of the gate and swerved in sharply, trailed far back early, lost the rider on the turn, was apprehended and
escorted off.
