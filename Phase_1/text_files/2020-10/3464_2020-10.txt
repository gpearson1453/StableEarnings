Footnotes
SHE'S A BIG STAR tracked the leader, saved ground in the tracking flight through the turn, caught the weakening leader to her outside at the three
sixteenths, took over while racing greenly in the lane, and held. BIT O BODIE was extremely reluctant to load, settled in second last, was pushed along
three wide toward the rear on the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch, sustained her rally three wide late and just missed. MANHATTAN LEGACY settled
at the rear of the main pack, chased in the two path on the turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch, altered outside of SHE'S A BIG STAR near the
sixteenth when that one came inward in front of her, continued to rally and missed between horses. ABBMAR stumbled at the break, tracked the leading
pair three wide down the backstretch and through the turn, and proved no match for the top three in the lane. TAPPING FOR SILVER tracked the leading
pair between horses, went to a drive in upper stretch, and weakened. BULU settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, went to a drive in upper
stretch, and mustered no bid. CATCHING TIME was hustled clear, set the pace in the two path on the turn, faltered past the five sixteenths, was headed at
the three sixteenths and continued to fade inside.

Footnotes
TRIVIAL tracked just off the first flight outside foes while switching out avoiding some traffic midway through the first turn, was fanned four wide racing into
the second bend advancing on the pacesetter and continued with a steady late response to just edge that foe in time under firm left handed pressure. ARCH
FLYER, urged to the lead angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, went clear racing into upper
stretch, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly but couldn't contain that foe. CLOSE TO ME, raced between foes, then was forced out by CHOLLA entering the
first turn, was collected while angling to the inside tracking off the first flight through the backstretch, shifted out racing into upper stretch to split foes nearing
midstretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. TROPHY BRIDLE, reserved off the leaders racing four deep to the
backstretch, angled five racing into the the lane while under pressure to advance and was just outkicked for a share. CHOLLA broke out brushing at the
start, pulled her between foes making solid contact with CLOSE TO ME while forcing that rival out on the first turn, continued rank under restraint while
pulling her between foes to prompt the pacesetter to the second bend and gave way nearing the lane. KARA'S ANGEL, forwardly placed between rivals
prompting the pace, continued three deep between foes into the second bend and gave way. WILDWOOD SCAT settled last and trailed to the lane.

Footnotes
RED VENUS attended the pace two wide, encroached on the turn, took the lead in upper stretch and drove clear in the three to four path. CHILLS AND
FEVER tracked the leading pair outside of DRIVE LINE, made a three wide bid past the three eighths, loomed in range into the lane, chased RED VENUS
earnestly through the lane but proved no match. NURSE SADIE grazed the gate, settled at the rear of the main group, took closer order in the three path on
the turn, was taken six wide into upper stretch and driven, and improved position to finish best of the rest. FLAMING chased the pace while keen early, was
urged three to four wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick. DRIVE LINE tracked the leading pair inside of CHILLS AND
FEVER, raced in the pocket around the turn, was driven behind the leader into the lane, and weakened. LILL QUEEN B was hustled for pace, saved ground
through the turn, while taking pressure from RED VENUS, was headed by that foe in upper stretch and faded. BOWS N LACE reared at the start, trailed in
the three to four path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch and never gained contention.

Footnotes
HILTON MAGIC broke readily to dispute the pace between foes in the opening sixteenth, shifted to the inside dueling for command on a narrow advantage
racing into the turn, kicked clear racing into upper stretch and maintained a clear advantage under firm handling. BUSHROD was rated between foes
tracking just off the first flight, worked his way to the rail racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted outside the winner in the closing stages
while moving to close the gap and narrowly prevailed for the place honors. FOLLOW THE SIGNS, roused in the opening stages to prompt the pace inside
rivals, was eased off the leaders in the second furlong to track off the second flight, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and continued with
interest while losing the bob for second. DEMAND RANSOM, forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, was urged to challenge when presented
an opening nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN, off slowly, settled last to the turn, swung six wide racing into
the lane and gained some position while making no impact. SUPERMANS CAPE settled between foes racing to the turn and never gained contention.
CAN'T SAY NO tracked off the first flight outside rivals racing to the turn, was urged to advance splitting foes three deep racing into the lane but proved
empty in the drive. POWER CRY angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch and abruptly gave
way.

Footnotes
MY CURBY was rated off the first flight three deep through the backstretch, shifted four wide racing into upper stretch steadily gaining momentum and
continued with a sustained response to wrest the advantage from RIPE ATTACK nearing the wire under firm left handed encouragement. The latter was
urged to the lead from between foes, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin into the turn, held sway past midstretch but couldn't fend off
the winner. YOUNG CORBETT, forwardly placed four wide, then three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, continued three deep into the lane and finished
evenly between the top pair late late. TWO PAIR settled off the second flight along the inside, shifted out racing through the stretch and continued to
improve position. MR. LUV MAKER, urged to a forward placing along the inside racing just inside the pacesetter, gave way after a half. LIGHT BOUND BID
was settled out of close quarters at the start, raced off the inside to the lane and passed only tiring rivals. UNCLE NEARIS broke readily to prompt the pace
three deep between foes early, vied between foes into the turn and gave way in the drive. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF angled in tracking off the first flight and
steadily faded nearing the lane. W W RUSSIAN GOLD was a brief factor between foes in the second flight but dropped out early. MAGIC MUSKETIER
broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC JEWLER came in and bumped BIRD KEY in the opening strides, tracked the leader in the pocket, slipped between the pacesetter and the rail
into the lane, took over inside, and remained in command while kept to the task. FARCICAL settled in second last, continued at the inside of the rear flight
down the backstretch, took closer order past the five sixteenths, continued to chase willingly along the inside but proved no match for the winner. LOVERS
QUARREL raced keenly in midpack early, settled better through the first turn and continued to chase inside, was caught behind traffic in upper stretch, got
bumped midstretch when TANGO CITY came in and had to take up off heels, got back into stride, improved under a drive and got up for show. ENGLISH
settled toward the rear, raced two wide down the backstretch and around the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, and improved mildly under a drive.
AUNT DOROTHY tracked the leader two wide, continued in range between horses down the backstretch and into the far turn, bid outside the leader past
the five sixteenths, came into the lane three wide, could not match ARTISTIC JEWLER as she kicked to the lead, and flattened between horses. TANGO
CITY chased two wide just behind the tracking flight on the clubhouse turn, was keen to join outside the tracking flight into the backstretch, was pushed
along three wide through the far turn and four wide into the lane, came in midstretch and bumped LOVERS QUARREL, and weakened. BIRD KEY was
bumped by ARTISTIC JEWLER in the opening strides, settled at the rear, continued two wide in the rear flight on the backstretch, trailed in the four path on
the far turn, was driven into the lane but mustered no bid. CANTERBURY GOLD cleared to the lead, set an uncontested pace to the five sixteenths, was
swarmed near the quarter pole, and tailed off.

Footnotes
COWBOYS DREAM, unhurried along the rail tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, continued to save ground gradually drawing into striking
distance leaving the far turn, came through inside the pacesetter nearing midstretch to wrest the advantage and edged away late under firm handling.
TETSU angled inwards to track off the first flight between foes while pulling a bit against restraint in the opening half, shifted out on the far turn to split rivals
three deep nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, gained a brief advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. BEAST MODE settled
inside foes in the last flight dropping well off the leaders to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into the lane splitting foes in upper stretch, angled
five wide in the closing stages and edged a rival for a share. V MAN, urged dictating the pace along the inside on a narrow margin, maintained the
advantage into the far turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch, then gave out late while shifting outside the top pair. SYRUP tracked just
off the first flight three wide between foes into the backstretch, advanced in that path to bid for command between rivals on the far turn but proved empty in
the drive. CONSPICUOUS BOX, restless in the gate, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. DRAMA
IN DANUBE, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a contending position, continued to advance in that path to the second bend
but gave way after six furlongs. AL TAWEEL, off slowly, was settled outside foes in the last flight to the backstretch, was fanned six wide into the lane but
had no rally. YOU SAY SO, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, gave way into the far turn.

Footnotes
LIL B QUICK was rated off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter, shifted out nearing upper stretch drawing into striking distance, advanced four
wide between foes to challenge for command inside the leader and edged forward late under firm encouragement. KIPPER DOODLE switched outside the
first flight racing through the backstretch to advance four wide into the turn, swung five wide entering the lane while moving to challenge for command, then
drifted out into the path of VEGAN GOES BEST through the final furlong while failing to contain the winner. VEGAN GOES BEST tracked just outside the
second flight in the opening stages, was fanned six wide racing into the lane while advancing to challenge, lost some momentum when being carried wide in
the last furlong and finished in hand nearing the wire. DEAUVILLE MIST, bothered at the start, was righted, then angled to the inside steadily gaining
position inside foes racing into the turn, shifted four wide in upper stretch and continued to gain position between foes to the end. KALISPELL tracked just
off the first flight along the inside, shifted out to split foes racing into the lane but had no final kick. DANCE broke outwards bumping R MARIE, ducked
inwards into the path of DEAUVILLE MIST, was settled off the second flight racing to the turn and lacked a rally. AMERICAN BIZ, outpaced in early stages,
passed inside tiring rivals racing into the lane. MY WIFE IS BOSS was urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into
upper stretch. MORA VALLEY, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way in upper stretch. KLONDIKE ANNIE
was settled outside foes, then fanned into the wide lane but proved no threat. HAL'S MISCHIEF dropped out early. R MARIE, bumped at the start, was
urged three wide forcing the pace into the turn but was through after a half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF VEGAN GOES BEST LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF KIPPER DOODLE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
