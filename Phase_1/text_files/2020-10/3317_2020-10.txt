RAVEN MOON lacked room behind horses early, angled out nearing the turn, split horses, took the four path, drifted out down the stretch and edged up for
a late win. HOWIE'S ANGEL chased just behind the leader, stayed close and inched up late to hold second. KITTENS ADAIR veered in at the start, led to
very deep stretch and weakened. STREAKY chased to the turn, went in the five path, was wide in the stretch and finished evenly. BLUE ECHO angled off
the rail nearing the turn and ran evenly down the stretch. DAVIS HAT was near the lead to the turn and faded. MAC LARNED veerred in at the start and was
no threat.

DOUBLE THE LAUGH brushed a foe at the start, was off the pace early, ranged up outside on the backstretch, led on the far turn, was challenged, got clear
of that foe and gamely held in the late going. JERRID settled well behind the lead, made a quick move on the far turn in the five path and was closing late in
a good run, taking the place spot. TORAZO brushed a foe at the start, moved up to reach the flank of the winner on the far turn and evened out in the final
furlong to settle for show. VALYCOVE bobbled at the start, chased from well back and faltered in the stretch. KITCHI prompted the pace early and had a
steady fade from the far turn. SAY IT AIN'T SO showed inside speed to the far turn and backed up.

Footnotes
SACRED STORM set a good pace on the lead, was joined by a foe in upper stretch, vied briefly, got clear again and held that one at bay in the closing
yards. MUSABAQA rallied on the turn to get closer, took on the winner in upper stretch, was held back but still able to inch up nearing the wire. GO
STELLAIRE stayed back to the stretch and had late energy to take the show spot. LA COYOTA stalked behind the winner, rallied on the turn in the four path
but was outpaced by foes down the stretch. EREBUNI reared and hopped at the start, caught up to the field before the turn, came widest into the stretch
and faltered. CARINA was in range to the stretch and faltered. PROMISED FAME chased from close up to the turn and faded.

Footnotes
CARLY'S FLIGHT had a close up stalking position, made a three wide move on the far turn, ran on to take over entering the stretch and got clear. READY
SET GO tracked to the far turn, ranged up five wide, had good energy to chase the winner but was second best. TEJATE led to the turn and dropped back
but held two foes at bay in late stretch to keep the show spot. LUVYASEEYABYE raced alongside the leader, was between horses on the far turn and held
position late. NUTNBUTAROXSTAR bobbled after the start, was eager early while off the rail, stayed close to mid stretch and lost position. TREASURE
WILBURNYA was always last.
