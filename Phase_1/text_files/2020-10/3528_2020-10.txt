Footnotes
TRAVELIN GAMBLER quickly cleared the field and drew off to a long lead, was hand urged into the far turn then steadily handled down the lane. MR.
MAURICE raced well off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn two deep, then got up for
second mid-stretch. TOP HAT SCRUTINY saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn then got
up for third inside the sixteenth pole. ITSMYLUCKYKNIGHT rounded the opening turn about the four path then picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and passed rivals. EXPLOITATION settled well off the pace inside then picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but showed little more. KOPP CAT saved ground off the pace, raced at the rail on the far turn and
weakened. VILLAGE PRINCE was never a factor. GAME BREAK angled in and raced off the early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then weakened from mid-stretch.

Footnotes
SALERNO came away with the early lead then stalked toward the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at the rail then eased slightly out into the lane, dug in
for the lead the final strides, though, just lasted. B J'S BIG BOY was hustled along outside to take the lead nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the turn
at the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final strides and just lasted for second. RATLTRAP gave chase outside and
rounded the turn about the five path, then steadily closed through the lane and just missed overtaking the top two. ISLAND CADGER engaged in close early
chase but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. BRILLIANT IDEAS
chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. MINI BOLT gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished
evenly. I'MOVERTHEMOON chased the pace through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn, though, showed little more. MAKANA was not a
factor. GLOBAL INDIAN chased the pace, then weakened in the four path of the turn.

I AM THAT I AM settled off the pace in the three path the first turn and raced toward the outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
came through the far turn about the six path, took the lead past the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. NATIVE
COURAGE angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, but drifted into the
lane, gave up the lead past the eighth pole then gave way to the winner and just lasted for second. POSITIVE IMPACT saved ground well off the pace, bid
past the three eighths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, finished well and just missed second. NICALOE rounded the opening turn about the five
path then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still about the five path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
STEPHANOPOULOS saved ground off the early pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced close on the far turn but was shuffled
back off the heels of Native Courage entering the stretch and flattened stride. NOT TO EZ raced well back early on and left the first turn toward the outside,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and showed little further. RAGTIME COWBOY JOE raced in the
four path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. RIPPER MAGOO rounded the first turn in the five path,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole though faded on the far turn. R TAP stalked the pace the first turn then faded through the backstretch.

the four path then flattened out the final furlong. MACKENZIE'S STAR settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the five path and passed some rivals outside. LONGSTORYLUCY rounded the first turn in the three and

INTRACTABLE chased the pace and raced three wide on the turn and dug in through the stretch to outfinish the game try of NANCYSAIDSO, who gave
early chase toward mid track, raced four wide on the turn then outfinished in the duel through the lane. ZIRCON ZLOTY was hustled to the lead and angled
to the inside to set a pressured pace, drifted into the lane and was caught in the final yards. UNKISS ME chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn
five wide and finished evenly. RIBBONITE gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail then flattened stride later yards. WAY AHEAD OF YOU chased the
pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly, off the rail. SHEZA DANDY R F gave chase outside, rounded the turn six wide then flattened.
SILENT NOTION raced well off the pace and came through the turn four wide. SUMMER FROCK was never a factor.

TAKE TIME became restless in the gate then settled off the pace inside, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far
turn, angled out leaving the eighth pole, continued to drift and made contact with Righteous Man past the sixteenth pole, but dug in from there to get up the
final strides. FEISTY AND SASSY angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole and was steadily encouraged from
the head of the lane, but was caught flattening stride the final yards. HE'S A GOLD DIGGER settled off the early pace in the two and three paths the first
turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn about the five path, was bumped off stride inside the sixteenth pole but dug in from
there and just missed second. CASTLES TRICK rounded the first turn in the three path then settled in the back leaving the turn, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, angled five wide into the stretch and finished evenly. RIGHTEOUS MAN rated off the pace toward the inside the first turn then eased outward
into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, was bumped outward and into He's A Gold Digger
inside the sixteenth pole then steadied through later yards. WHISKEY HUMOR stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole then faded off the rail approaching the top of the lane. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the riders of Take Time and He's A Gold Digger,
lodged by the rider of Righteous Man, then disqualified Take Time to fifth place for causing interference past the sixteenth pole. The Stewards found no fault
by the rider of He's A Gold Digger.

Footnotes
SECURITY BREACH settled off the earlier pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far
turn, then dug in from the lead of the lane to get up later yards and raced clear under the wire. CREATIVE MINESHAFT stalked the early pace from the
three path, challenged into the backstretch and dueled at even terms from the seven sixteenths, took the lead toward the three eighths, raced clear from the
five sixteenths and rounded the far turn near the rail, but was caught flattening stride later yards. MERRY MERRY MOJO saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path then raced evenly down the lane. JACKY'S MAN broke a step slow and
raced well off the pace about the three path, eased outward into the backstretch and bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five
path but showed little more. JUST A LIL LUKEY settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn at the
rail, then faded. JOEY GOTCHA stalked the early pace toward the inside, started a three wide bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and weakened leaving the turn. CASTLEFINN raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. TRUE CROSSING rated the pace inside, though came under pressure into the backstretch, was met at the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the
nod to Creative Mineshaft at the three eighths then faded past the five sixteenths. SAMADI BLUE lunged at the start and rounded the first turn in the five
path, was never a factor then eased through the final quarter.
