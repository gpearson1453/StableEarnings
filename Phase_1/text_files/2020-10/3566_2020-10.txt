Footnotes
JUMPSTARTMYHEART lacked speed, swung to the four path mid way on the far turn, advanced outside horses to take the lead approaching the sixteenth
pole and was under brisk urging in the drive. BRUSHING lacked speed, raced inside horses on the far turn, found room along the inner rail in the stretch
and closed gamely. FIRTH assumed the early lead, set the pace off the rail turning for home, was challenged by POLISHED GAL in upper stretch, dueled
with that one to the eighth pole then tired. WOWWHATABRAT , inside horses turning for home, eased out in upper stretch and flattened out. POLISHED
GAL chased the pace, bid for the lead outside FIRTH in upper stretch and tired in the drive. OUR STAR , never a threat, raced in the three path between
horses on the far turn then failed to rally. MARYLAND'S MIRACLE was no factor. BEYOND FOREVER saved ground on the far turn and weakened through
the stretch. WHO U GONNA CALL , two wide between horses on the far turn, faltered.

Footnotes
ODD GAL , brushed at the break, advanced inside to command, held a clear advantage into the turn, met a pair of challenges approaching the stretch,
ceded command inside the three sixteenths, battled back to regain command heading to the sixteenth pole then edged away under a steady drive.
CALYPSO GHOST , taken to rate off the rail, picked up steam and quickly gained four wide mid turn, bid three deep into the lane, went clear under a drive
in mid stretch but failed to last. I LOVE YOU , in hand stalking towards the inside, eased out mid turn, bid between foes with a quarter to go, vied then faded
in the final furlong. ARBUTUS was sent up between runners early, stalked into the turn, was under pressure nearing the stretch and dropped back. PETES
PRIDE saved ground mid turn, failed to kick on heading towards the stretch and gave way. SILVER SIDES stalked the winner three wide, was under a ride
leaving the far turn, lacked a response and faltered.

Footnotes
MISS NONDESCRIPT drifted out at the break, corrected and settled off the inside, commenced a run after being put to solid pressure past the three
eighths, circled four wide into the lane, sustained under strong left handed encouragement and got up in the final strides. STREET LUTE rushed up between
foes soon after the break, rated back off the leaders near the five eighths and stalked three wide, came back three wide under pressure mid turn, closed in
under drive past the furlong grounds, challenged between foes in deep stretch and just missed in a gritty effort. TRIP TO FREEDOM broke sharp and
disputed the early pace under rating and to the outside of a rival, moved clear heading towards the half mile marker, continued under confident handling
around the turn, spurted back away after being put to a drive past the three sixteenths, was taken on with about sixty yards to go and wilted.
CLOSERTOTHEHEART broke inward and bumped with a rival, settled off the rail, angled further out around the turn, circled five wide advancing into the
stretch and churned on. UNREQUITED LOVE had gate speed then steadied back off the leaders nearing the five furlong pole, saved some ground into the
turn, angled out to pursue four wide into the stretch and continued with effort. HEARTFUL , off a bit slow, raced off the pace while saving ground, angled out
into the stretch, shifted back in for the final furlong and kept on with interest. FEARLESS IDEAS was outrun while off the rail. PROPER ATTIRE , bumped at
the break, was gunned up inside soon after to force the pace, chased to mid turn then faltered.

Footnotes
FIYA bobbled slightly at the break, quickly recovered and prompted the pace under rating and to the outside of GRATEFUL BRED, responded when put to
firmer asking soon into the lane, spurted clear under left handed encouragement nearing the furlong grounds then held firm while kept to task. SO STREET
rated forwardly while saving ground, shifted out leaving the three sixteenths and finished gamely to earn the place. GODLOVESASINNER , off the pace and
to the outside of a rival, raced three to four wide into the lane, angled further out and closed steadily. GRATEFUL BRED , quickly to the front, set a
pressured pace towards the rail, ceded to the winner in upper stretch, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth marker then faded. LOVE YOU MUCH stalked
outside SO STREET, was under pressure into the stretch, switched to his left lead and needed more between rivals. JOSEPH , sluggish early while off the
inside, swung well wide for the drive, had some belated action but never posed a threat. JAMMER saved ground without making an impact. STREET
COPPER saved ground, angled out soon into the stretch and faded.

with a nice rally. REASSURED lacked speed, raced between horses in the stretch and had a slight rally. DEPOSITORY , wide on the turn, was bumped
forced to the seven path by TREASURE TRADITION entering the stretch then passed tired horses. TIZ GOLDEN sprinted to the early lead, set the pace on
the turn, raced in the two path leaving the bend and weakened inside horses. LADNEEDSAHANDLER chased the pace behind horses on the turn, bore out
leaving the bend, was in the four path turning for home and weakened. WHAT THE FLASH saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch
and weakened. AIN'T DA BEER COLD stumbled leaving the starting gate, was outrun and swung to the seven path in upper stretch. SKY'S NOT FALLING

Footnotes
HELLO BEAUTIFUL broke on top, was joined from her inside and then headed by LIMITED VIEW nearing the five eighths, vied outside that one in hand,
regained command past the half mile marker, edged clear under a light hold leaving the three eighths, quickly widened after being set down soon into the
stretch, increased her advantage past the furlong grounds and was kept to stout left handed asking to the wire. QUIET IMAGINATION settled outside a rival,
moved up three wide into the lane, kept on willingly to the inside of LE WEEKEND and earned the place. LE WEEKEND , away alertly, rated in a forward
position, took closer order between rivals after a half mile, gave hard pursuit into the stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. GIFTED HEART
rated inside, was steadied off heels when advancing near the half mile marker, steadied when stalled behind a rival heading towards the quarter pole,
angled out for the drive and churned on. ARTFUL SPLATTER , taken to rate off the rail, edged up four wide into the turn, chased four wide into the stretch
then faded. LAS SETAS , four wide early, was fanned six wide when making a mild run into the stretch then failed to sustain. SHE'SMYSUNSHINE failed to
menace. LIMITED VIEW was sent up to the inside of the winner and poked a head in front after a quarter mile, disputed the issue after being headed a half
mile out, remained a forward presence stalking past the five sixteenths, shifted five wide nearing the lane and weakened. BUNTING dropped in past the five
eighths, remained inside and made a slight run into the lane, failed to continue on past the eighth pole and tired.

Footnotes
PRETTY GOOD YEAR , well back for five furlongs, began his rally on the far turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed outside horses, took the
lead near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. CANNON'S ROAR hopped slightly at the break, was well placed in the three path between horses entering the
stretch, angled in near the three sixteenths pole, gained the lead inside horses in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. NICK PAPAGIORGIO stalked the
pace, advanced in the three path to challenge for the lead leaving the far turn and gradually weakened the final furlong. MR. D'ANGELO lacked speed,
swung to the seven path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. TAXABLE GOODS , four wide the first turn, circled the far turn four
wide to loom leaving the bend then tired in the drive. SOMEKINDOFMAGICIAN lacked speed and was not a factor. BENNY HAVENS rushed up five deep to
reach contention turning for home then gave way. NO BULL ADDICTION was not a factor. TOMMY SHELBY , three wide turning for home, failed to rally.
SEVILLE BARBER chased the pace two wide and gave way. RISING PERRY set the pace along the rail for six furlongs, faltered in upper stretch and was
eased. SEVILLE ROW chased the pace, raced along the inner rail on the far turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
KARAN'S NOTION sped clear early, set a rated pace two wide, was nudged on to hold position past the five sixteenths, spurted away under a drive in mid
stretch, drifted in briefly then held firm to turn back BAPTIZE THE BOY. BAPTIZE THE BOY , reluctant to load, advanced along the rail leaving the five
eighths to prompt the pace, steadied when shuffled back near the half mile marker, recovered to stalk, came back to the inside of rivals past the furlong
grounds, steadily gained then was in a bit close nearing the wire. LEWISFIELD rated early, moved up between rivals leaving the far turn, made a four wide
run into the lane, ranged up outside rivals in mid stretch then flattened out. ONEMOREGREATTIME stalked the winner three wide, was under pressure into
the lane, chased between rivals in mid stretch and faded. HALL PASS broke a bit slowly, lagged off the pace while saving ground, eased out in mid stretch
and finished well between runners. BRILLIANT CHASE steadied when breaking a bit awkwardly, moved up to the inside of rivals leaving the far turn, angled
out approaching the quarter pole, shifted further out in the final eighth and finished with interest. SEANY P drifted in at the break, straightened and rated four
wide, moved up a bit mid turn, chased four wide into the stretch but came up empty. WHISKEY AND YOU , off the pace while saving ground, angled out
nearing the lane but lacked a bid. FOR THE MOMENT , a bit sluggish early on, moved up a bit but was hung five wide into the turn, chased while in range
past the five sixteenths then faded. LET'S PLAY NINE broke outward, straightened and raced four wide between runners, dropped back around the far turn
and failed to recover.

MONDAY MORNING QB bobbled slightly at the break, prompted the pace outside PRENDIMI, over took that one entering the far turn, opened up turning
for home, was set down in upper stretch and was kept to a drive the final furlong. HARPERS FIRST RIDE , three wide the first turn, was off the pace down

BELTWAY BOB settled well back, stumbled when picking up some momentum near the half mile marker, recovered and moved up behind rivals near the
five sixteenths, swung seven wide for the drive, closed determinedly under pressure, reeled in AIR TOKEN in deep stretch and was going away at the wire.
AIR TOKEN , away well, raced four wide into the first turn, stalked three wide, bid to engage leaving the far turn, moved clear with a quarter to go, opened
up under a drive in mid stretch but failed to contain the winner while clearly best of the rest. THREETHEHARDWAY settled outside a rival, moved up five
wide into the lane and churned on to gain the show. EARNED IT , in the clear early on, advanced four wide between rivals into the stretch, kept on with
some interest but was out kicked for the show. KAMEHAMEHA vied inside, rated off the leader soon into the backstretch, stalked into the far turn, eased out
approaching the stretch but lacked a solid finish. LUDICROUS MODE , off the pace while saving ground, angled out through the drive and had belated
action. ELEMENTARY , unhurried well off the pace, moved up leaving the three eighths, circled six wide into the stretch but came up empty from there. NO
KNOCK RAID stalked inside, eased out around the final turn, chased into the stretch and faded. BARIN lagged far back, raced five wide into the lane but
lacked a rally. MARTINI KID saved ground making a mild run into the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and gave way. GALACTIC SLAM was outrun.
BELFOUR bid three wide to command soon into the backstretch, moved clear after a half mile, widened a bit into the far turn, could not fend off a challenge
past the five sixteenths and faltered.
