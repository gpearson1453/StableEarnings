Footnotes
FOXY CARMELA chased the pace early, came three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, caught DESERT FOG late and held off IRENIE by a
whisker. IRENIE had no speed, checked behind ROYAL ALEXIS at the half mile pole, saved ground to the stretch then made a determined run inside and
just missed. DESERT FOG lugged inward shortly after breaking and compromised KENNA IS SPICY, had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the
stretch, was clear to mid stretch then tired. KENNA IS SPICY took up sharply when DESERT FOG lugged inward into her path, trailed to the turn, circled
four wide to the stretch and finished willingly. PACIFIC SILENCE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked the needed late
response. ROYAL ALEXIS was chasing the leader to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. PETE'S INFERNO also chased
the pace, bid three wide to the stretch but had no response in the final furlong. SWEET REGARDS pressed the pace to the turn, stayed close to the stretch
then got outkicked to mid stretch and gave way. The rider on KENNA IS SPICY lodged an objection against the rider on DESERT FOG for alleged
interference at the start and the stewards unanimously agreed that KENNA IS SPICY was cost a placing by DESERT FOG and disqualified that one from
third to fourth.

Footnotes
MISS INDEFATIGABLE was permitted to set pedestrian fractions to the second turn while two wide, responded when set down for the drive and held
stubbornly. ST. ANNIE'S INDY stalked the winner to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not catch up while besting the others.
LULUMARU had no speed, settled to the second turn, was three then four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. LASTING LIGHT
pressed the winner for six furlongs while three wide then got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. SHE'S SO PRETTY trailed to the second turn, had to
circle five then six wide to the stretch and did not make an impact. BLUSHING BAY settled mid pack to the half, raced four then five wide on the far turn but
got outrun to mid stretch and gave way.

RAILSPLITTER pressed the pace two wide to the second turn, moved alongside FOUR O'FIVE into the stretch, battled that one to inside the sixteenth pole
then inched away gamely. FOUR O'FIVE set the pace inside, was overtaken by the winner on the second turn but wouldn't budge, dug in determinedly to
inside the sixteenth marker then was bested. FRAVEL chased the top two to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch and was closing steadily but too
late. INFATUATE was settled for a half mile, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted out and was making up ground belatedly. WILD BOAT RIDE stalked
the pace three wide, saved ground on the second turn but gave way after six furlongs. PARADISE FOREVER trailed throughout.

Footnotes
B B KIDDO was on the pace from the outset, saved ground and edged clear to mid stretch then dug in determinedly to hold. FIERA CANELA was chasing
the leaders two wide to the stretch, responded when set down but could not catch the winner while easily second best. STAR IN THE SKY got outrun to the
turn, was two wide to the stretch then could not impact the top two. ELECTRIC ELIZABETA stalked the pace outside rivals, was four wide into the turn then
eased down the two path while being outkicked to the stretch and did not rally. SCARLET SAMBA was hustled along to contest the pace two wide to mid
turn then got outrun to the stretch and tired. FAIRY TATTOO was green while racing wide throughout and was not a factor. SALLY GAP hesitated at the
break then came out and bore in sharply, was corrected then saved ground but was also not a factor.

SURFACE never far back to the second turn, rallied three wide then swung out four deep into the stretch, responded to get the lead in mid stretch and
stubbornly held. ALWAYS IN VEGAS pressed the pace to the second turn, came two then three wide to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid
stretch and settled for the place. DROP THE MIC settled mid pack for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn then was roused in the stretch but
outfinished. RED BUNTING (IRE) had no speed, settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not make progress late and missed the
show. EARLYNTHEMORN hustled to the front, was clear on the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch then was overtaken and weakened. BREAKING
THE CODE had no speed and was never a threat.

two wide to the stretch, responded to edge away to mid stretch then could not hold. SCARRAZANO was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the
stretch and finished in a mild rally. NEW WAYS TO DREAM had no speed, was four wide to the stretch and was also gaining late. FAST TO FORTUNE had
no speed, eased in and saved ground into the turn, shifted off the rail into the stretch but could not make an impact in the drive. ALL got outsprinted early,
bumped with TURF KITTY at the half, was three wide to the stretch then did not rally. LA PANZANELLA pressed the pace three wide to the stretch but was
outkicked to mid stretch and tired. MALIBU JEWEL got outsprinted to the turn then was forced five wide to the stretch and weakened.
ITAINTEASYBEINGRAY chased the pace three wide to the stretch then gave way. WATCHFUL EYE tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then also
