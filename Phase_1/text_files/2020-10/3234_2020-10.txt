Footnotes
EUTYCHIA settled off the early pace, raced four wide wide around the first turn, moved up around the far turn, raced four wide nearing the quarter pole and
finished well in the drive to be clear under strong handling. RIVER LIBERTY set all the pace, raced just off the inside in the lane and finished second best.
SKIPPERLITTTLEGIRL was rated down the backstretch while racing in the three path, continued to raced three wide in the stretch and had no final winning
bid. EURA QUEEN stalked the pace, saved ground throughout and had no response. FOREIGN CREATION was slow early, raced five wide into the upper
stretch and never threatened. KOTTONCANDY KISSES tracked the leader while racing two deep and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
MODIFIED was bumped and forced out five wide around the first turn, stalked the leaders down the backstretch, moved up five five wide nearing the eighth
pole and finished gamely to be clear late under strong encouragement. SCAT FOR THE CAUSE stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper
stretch, dug in nearing the eighth pole but was no match for the winner late. CHINATOWN NANCY showed good speed along the inside and weakened a bit
in the drive. THORNY ROSE was off slowly, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch, was forced to take up briefly nearing the
eighth pole and had not enough late. VEILS AND VOWS was slow in the early stages, moved up four wide through the lane and had not enough. SUSAN
STRONG settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside throughout and had no response. LOYAL AND TRUE pressed the early pace and gave way in
the drive. MOONSHINE MOXY was unhurried early, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never was a factor. HOURGLASS FIGURE settled off the
early pace, raced five wide into the lane and never threatened. TRIPLE HAPPY came out around the first turn, bumped with rival, stalked down the
backstretch and tired readily the final quarter of a mile.

interest. FANNY B was hustled along early, raced along the inside and had no final winning bid. SITONYA'SSPIRIT was allowed to settle early, raced three
wide at the quarter pole and had no late response. MISS GEMMA B stalked the early leader and failed to sustain a bid. SUNNY BUNNY saved ground and

Footnotes
CANONIZE stalked the early leaders, moved up two wide nearing the quarter pole, raced three wide in the lane and finished well late to get up under all out
pressure. SWEET BAKER showed good early speed along the inside, was clear nearing the sixteenth pole but couldn't hold off the winner late to finish
second best. EUROEXIT settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and slowly closed in on the top pair. J B'S LEGACY stalked early,
moved up four wide at the quarter pole, finished along the inside late and had no final bid. SEXY SOCKS dropped back early, raced four wide through the
lane and had no late gain. PROFIT TAKER settled off the early pace, angled out to the six path through the stretch and never was a factor. BIG BLUE OKIE
was slow early, saved ground and never threatened. OKIE UNION was up close early, raced along the inside around the turn and failed to sustain a bid.
FOOT THE BILL stalked the pace and tired while racing two deep. CATCH THIS STAR stalked the early pace and faded the final quarter of a mile. BOLD
IMPACT dropped back early and failed to have a response.

five wide through the lane and finished gamely but could not pass the winner late. COWBOY RIDGE stalked early, raced four wide past the eighth pole and
kept on to the wire. COUNTRY LOVE raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough. I LIVED IT was off slowly, raced
four deep through the lane and never was a factor. UNCLE TAP raced six deep into the upper stretch and had no rally. DUHOPPER pressed early, was
getting out around the turn and tired. PAPA TANGO was up close early, raced in traffic around the far turn, was five wide into the upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WOLOWITZ vied for the early racing between foes into the turn, cut the corner and roused for more entering top stretch, held a slight advantage over
THREE TIME CHARMER with a furlong left to run, dug in gamely under right-handed pressure and refused to let rival by. THREE TIME CHARMER crossed
over from the outside to race three to four wide shortly after the start, vied for command around the turn, continued to battle on with WOLOWITZ into stretch
run, continued a solid bid but could not match with the winner in final stages. FRESH ONE hustled up three wide to challenge for the lead near the quarter
pole, continued a steady effort and drifted out wider under pressure in the lane and finished clear for a share. MEDAL MAKER raced near the rear and
hustled along the inside around the turn, saved ground turning for home, improved position along the rail but needed more to threaten. ON THE HONOR
ROLL vied for the early lead along the inside, could not match strides through the turn then steadily weakened. MALIBU MO raced in range while positioned
three deep in the early going then had no kick when called upon. CAT'S AMERICAN PIE raced off the pace and failed to move into contention. GOOSE
raced in the back in the backstretch then moved into the stretch run two to three wide and failed to gain a threatening position. EL CHIHUAS raced off the
pace and lacked a needed rally. JAGER ONTHE ROCKS raced in range two wide in early stages then failed to keep pace and faded. MY FATHER'S EYES
raced two wide in the turn and failed to make impact.

Footnotes
DRIFTING WEST stalked the top two leaders while positioned three to four wide in the backstretch, began to edge up closer nearing the quarter pole,
responded when roused for more turning for home, roused forward to race in striking distance of CARIBBEAN a furlong from home, stayed on gamely after
the leader, wrested the advantage in the final sixteenth and edged clear. CARIBBEAN (AUS) held a slim lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace
through the backstretch, edged away to clearer command entering the far turn, continued to hold off the bid from DRIFTING WEST entering top stretch, dug
in gamely under pressure but had no final kick left in reserve. ROTATION raced in tracking mode while positioned two to three wide in early stages, hustled
up along the rail in the far turn, angled out at the head of the lane and continued a steady effort for a share. CHRIS AND DAVE was allowed to settle in early
stages while rated not too far off the early leaders, hustled up to pick up the pace with three furlongs left to run, continued under steady encouragement into
stretch run but lacked the needed response for impact. WESTFEST applied pace pressure to the leader through the backstretch, could not keep pace on
the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TIZTHEBOSS settled nicely while sitting just off the top pair through the backstretch, lodged a three wide bid for the lead nearing the quarter pole, advanced
to duel for the lead upper stretch, continued to dig in gamely with a narrow advantage and held off TASMIN in final strides. TASMIN was rated not too far off
the pace in early stages, launched a three wide bid late on the far turn, roused forward into stretching distance in stretch run, continued a solid effort but
could not get by in final strides. DO YOU BILEVE bumped with rival at the start, tracked the pace to the far turn, hustled up along two wide entering upper
stretch, advanced while poised to strike in the furlong ground but lacked the needed response to reach the top pair. LOVE YA MOST was unhurried and
raced near the back of the back, hustled up for response on the far turn, steady under steady encouragement in the lane and improved position.
BATTLESHIP MARY bumped with foe at the start then steadied shortly after and dropped back, continued well off the pace, came under encouragement
nearing upper stretch and improved position without threatening. NAVAJO SCOUT pressed the pace through early going then vied for the lead late
backstretch, continued to battle for command at the furlong marker then came up tired. JOLLYVILLE raced three wide entering the backstretch, settled off
the pace, shifted out wider upper stretch and failed to move on. GRAY ZONE set a pressured pace, vied for the lead entering the far turn then had nothing
left in reserve turning for home. FINE WINE bumped with rival at the start, saved ground along the inside on the first turn and had no response when called
upon.
