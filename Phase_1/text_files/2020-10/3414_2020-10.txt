DOBBYS SOCK prompted the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead, battled the balance of the trip along the inside and wore down
rivals in a gam effort. BUBBA vied for the lead three wide, surged to gain a slight lead on the far turn, battled with the winner two wide the length of the
stretch and finished second best. LAFLEUR trailed, moved up in the five path on the far turn then leveled off. EL ANDARIEGO was in tight at the start, well
placed inside then weakened in the stretch. WARHAVOC set the early pace along the inside and was through after a half. VICTORIOUS WARRIOR close
up for a half, stopped. FINALLY went to his knees at the start and unseated his rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.

LUNA stalked the pace along the inside and got up for second. EXTRA SALSA chased the pace and finished with good courage two wide. I FLY FIRST
CLASS had a mild late rally. MORE MONIQUE bore out at the start bumping the winner, moved up three wide into the stretch then came up empty.
CHASING THE BUCK well placed, lacked the needed response. PROUD MAID MARIAN had brief speed. DREAMINOFJUSTICE trailed.

MOBIL SOLUTION stalked the pace three wide, surged two wide to make the lead midway on the far turn, widened into the stretch and lasted under right
handed urging while drifting out. VISUAL MISSION allowed to settle, closed willingly in the six path but was too late. STATESBORO hopped outward
bumping hard with PAT'S KARMA at the start, was allowed to settle then finished with good courage in the three path. PAT'S KARMA was bumped at the
start, well placed then failed to respond. ON FIRE broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead while under strong restraint, set the pace into the far turn
then weakened. DOUBLE DEEP chased the pace into the far turn then gave way. BARRY'S SWING trailed.

Footnotes
PLUS SIZE VALUE was forced into BETTER THAN PEARLS at the start, never far back, circled rapidly two wide on the far turn then widened the balance
of the trip to win as much the best under a strong hand ride. MILLIE trailed early, moved up four wide on the second turn, drifted to the six path giving up
ground then dug in late and finished clear for second. CINS BOSS broke inward, set a pressured pace until the top of the stretch then weakened. LET'S GO
LUNA under a firm hold early, improved along the inside on the far turn then leveled off. CARA LUCIA vied for the lead three wide into the second turn,
loomed boldly approaching the quarter pole then came up empty. ULTERED PERCEPTION failed to menace. BETTER THAN PEARLS was bumped at the
start, well handled while getting out, prompted the pace along the inside into the far turn then stopped.
