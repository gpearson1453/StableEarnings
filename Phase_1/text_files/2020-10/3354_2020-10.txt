Footnotes
SUPER CHARLIE broke to the outside, was challenged by CREEDS REVENGE for the lead, dug in and was up at the wire. CREEDS REVENGE showed a
good turn of early speed to challenge the winner but was outfinished to the line. PICKELJUICE was within reach but had no closing run. BUMPY GAME was
away last and failed to mount a bid.
