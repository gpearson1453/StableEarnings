Footnotes
FREE vied for the lead three wide into the turn, dropped closer to the inside when clearing for the lead just outside the three-eighths pole, slowly widened
into the lane when moving closer to the rail and extended the advantage under a strong hand drive while skimming the rail the final eighth. DISCERNMENT
was in the two path into the turn when never far back, chased the winner into the lane then was no match for that one while clearly second best.
COMPETITIVE FIRE was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path then was under a drive while moving into
the five path and never was a serious threat. GRACE D' ART vied for the early lead from between rivals into the turn then began losing ground. LUMINAIRE
vied for the early lead while along the inside into the turn, chased the winner through the turn and faded. DON'T MAKE ME BEG was done early while in the
three or four path.

Footnotes
BAYOU CAT chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid in late turn, came into the lane from the four path, was floated to the seven path late
when closing in and edged up. MAI TAI'S GEM stalked the pacesetter into the far turn, took over and near the three-eighths pole, quickly cleared in late
turn, continued on a clear advantage into the lane from the two path, was asked for more when being challenged inside the furlong pole then could not hold
the winner safe while drifting from the two to the six path while under both right and left handed urging. VICTOR'S DEAL was in the two path through the
turns, came into the lane from the two path and finished evenly while not a threat to the top two. FLATOUTJUSTICE was in the two path through the far
turn, cut the corner into the lane and had an open rail but could not gain on the top ones while finishing evenly. TWOBIRDSONESTONE raced in the two or
three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five path and moved up while not a factor. IDEA MAN was in the three path through the far turn,
came into the lane from the five path then tired after straightening. CASH FOR GOLD set the pace while near the inside into the far turn then was suddenly
done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MERRY raced in mid-pack into the far turn, bid three wide in late turn, came into the lane with momentum then edged up late. OMI TEN set
the pace while near the rail into the turn, repelled challenger into the lane, cleared then gave way grudgingly and just stayed for the place spot. GRACEFUL
CHOICE tracked the pacesetter through the turn, came off the rail and into the two path in upper stretch, shifted back to the inside when winner came off the
rail and stayed on well to be gaining at the end and just missed the place spot. NOSTALGIA was unhurried while off the inside, raced three wide through the
turn when gaining momentum, swung into the lane from the four path and was gaining to the end. R U MIZZEN ME was in the two path through the turn and
into the lane, was gaining late when not having a path very late. MACHITA raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path
when under a drive and gaining mildly. DUNWOODY pressed the pace two wide through the far turn then faded after entering the lane. MISS HATTIE was
along the inside and never was a factor. MIZZEN THE COVE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and was empty turning into the lane.

RUN LIKE REV set the pace while under pressure through the turn, kicked clear entering the lane then widened to the wire. PRECIOUS ARCH pressed the
winner through the turn while two wide, could not keep up with the top one but stayed on well to finish clear for the place spot. HER GIANT was unhurried
while off the inside, angled from the two to the four path in late turn, came into the lane from the seven path and finished well. DEAR THEODOSIA was in
the three to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up while not a threat. PRINCESS LUCKY was bumped at the
start, raced in the two path while never far back and lacked a bid. THIRST TRAP trailed the field into the lane from the two path and moved up while not a
factor. PARTY LIGHTS raced close up while in the four to the three path through the turn then tired. SHARPERTHANME was bumped at the start and
hustled up to contend into the turn then faded. SWEATY BETTY was along the inside through the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
WHITE WOLF was clear early and improved his advantage in the stretch to be ridden out for the win. ALLGRIT stalked in the five path, then gained the
place late. A LITTLE IRRADIC stalked the pace between, faded in the stretch and was found to have bled. MAN HE CAN pressed the pace in the five path
but faded in the stretch. SOUTHERN HUMOR stalked inside the faded on the turn. GET ALONG pressed the pace four wide to the stretch and gave way.
BREAKERS POINT was not a factor. TOOTHPIC was off awkwardly and bumped at the start, pressed the pace three wide but faded in the stretch.
KICKAPOO was not a factor.
