Footnotes
SPOT ON broke sharply to duel for the lead with EZ STAR MAKER while racing from the inside, disposed of that rival after going a half, quickly opened a
wide margin and drew off as the easiest of winners. B C Z MIDDLETON raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, failed to gain on the
winner in the drive but was clearly second best. STAY IN GRACE was reserved just off the dueling leaders, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to
gain in the drive. SUDDENLY AWESOME settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. CLOSE THE SHOW
LO lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive, steadied in mid-stretch and did not offer a bid after. E Z STAR MAKER
was away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

that rival and was up in the closing yards. FRENCH COAST was bumped hard at the break, rushed to vie, dueled for the lead while racing three-wide,
opened a clear margin with three furlongs to run, responded when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied and just missed. INQUISITION settled off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was up for the show. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY broke in to
bump rival, lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. BLEU MUSKET hopped at the start, raced four-wide through both
turns from just off the leaders and gradually weakened. STANLEY RYDER raced four-wide through both turns, lacked early speed and failed to rally. RI' PIN
SNAP was bumped at the break, disputed the pace from the inside for five furlongs, weakened and was eased through the lane.

quickly drew off with complete authority. MIKE OPERATOR set a pressured pace from off the rail and yielded to the winner after seven furlongs. ROUGH
AND READY was unhurried early, raced four-wide through the first turn, moved up to offer a bid nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and gave way in the
drive. GENERAL MACH FOUR was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive and failed to
gain. MISO FAST lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. SALTY MINNOW pressed the pace while racing
three-wide, weakened after going a half and was eased through the lane. PARTY FOR ONE pressed the pace while racing four-wide for three furlongs,
weakened and was eased through the lane.

MAJESTIC CAFE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO with a furlong to run,
vied with that rival and proved best. TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO dueled for the lead from the inside, responded when challenged in mid-stretch but the
winner, vied and just missed. MOSQUITO FLEET chased the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good courage.
SPARKLING LUTE lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. VROYSKY was away in good order to disputed the pace while
racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. R B EYE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SIX BLESSINGS

Footnotes
FIREBALL RED was hustled along to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged in mid-stretch, came back and proved best to be
clear late. ROUGH RIDE was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing five-wide, moved up to take a brief lead with a furlong to run but could not
match strides with the winner late. BRETT lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. FREESTONE pressed the pace
from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. UNION BROTHER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. PREMIER LEAGUE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. MAGIC MAHOGANY pressed the
pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. COLEINATOR showed brief speed, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened.

ASSETS INCLUDED bobbled at the start, set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and drew off as
handy winner. DRIZZY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but held on well to
save the place. IRISH TERRIER hopped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. IRON
ROB broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide and failed to gain in the drive. DREAMCATCHER was void of early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. REGAZZE CAT broke out, showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch
and did not offer a bid. MR BINGLEY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. INDYGO BO showed brief speed and

Footnotes
TIZASTONE dueled for the lead from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire. COOLER THAN YOU lacked early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a late bid. GOBOLDLY pressed the pace of the
winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. BARABBAS disputed the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and weakened
after going a half. GLIMMER BAY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. YEARNINGTOBEFREE lagged far back
throughout and was eased through the lane. FULL REGALIA went wrong and was pulled up before going a quarter and vanned off.
