Footnotes
CELTIC VOW stalked the dueling pacesetters, bid four wide in the stretch and gamely prevailed following a long drive. GROOVE dueled between rivals and
continued gamely to the finish. EZ ON THE EYES eased back near the far turn, was blocked inside at the quarter pole then closed well when clear.
PABLO'S DREAM lagged far behind, bid very wide in the stretch and finished strongly. ROCKFORD GIRL lacked speed and was never in contention.
DRIVER'S LICENSE was urged to a narrow lead inside then proved empty in the stretch. LISA MILA vied four wide, led briefly at the quarter pole then
stopped.

DRAMATIZED set the pace inside, repulsed repeated challenges began to edge away deep stretch then held on. HOLD MY CALL lapped on winner
throughout, fell back a bit deep stretch, came on again but just couldn't go by. QUID saved ground and gained little. COURT SKY saved ground to final turn,
moved out three wide and was no factor. REPEATED PROMISE, two wide in second flight, tired. CURLINGTON was wide and was never a factor.
HAZASPITTIN' IMAGE, bumped leaving the gate, showed little. JANE'S FACTOR was never a factor. PERFECT DAYDREAM came out and bumped foe
leaving the gate, raced wide and tired.

JUDI BLUE EYES settled off the leaders, rallied into the stretch, wore down the pacesetter and edged clear driving. FREEDOM PASSAGE vied along the
rail with a slim advantage, was collared into the stretch and continued gamely. LIKE A PRO lagged far behind then showed good late energy in the stretch.
SHOOBIEDOOBYDOO dueled outside to the stretch then gradually weakened. TERPEYE outrun early, moved inside on the turn and lacked a bid.
PERSIAN QUEEN chased three wide off the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. GRACE AND PEACE vied between rivals, moved inside, drifted very
wide on the turn retreating.

Footnotes
ABDAA moved up steadily outside, moved in slightly to split rivals near stretch, was steered out through stretch and won going away. LOADED JOE saved
ground, was steadied briefly near the quarter pole, moved out in mid stretch and gained place. JAMA DILLON saved ground just off the pace, moved out
and took the lead near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. GAUCHO set the pace just off the rail and held on well. JOE THE BOSS raced just off the rail
and failed to menace. EPIGRAMMATIST, three wide and just off the pace, tired. SPIDER BITE failed to be a serious threat. GOSLEY saved ground, ducked
in at the gap in the stretch, was straightened and failed to menace. LEYENDA AZTECA showed nothing. SOMETHING PENTO was never a threat. A claim
of foul by the rider of LOADED JOE against ABDAA for alleged interference near the quarter pole was quickly dismissed.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC AVENUE saved ground throughout, bid to the front near the quarter pole and drew away under moderate urging. CREEDIBILITY lacked speed,
angled out to secure room in the stretch and offered a late surge. BAYLEAF dueled outside and continued willingly just missing the place. IRON LILLY
chased off the pace outside and raced evenly through the stretch. ZONING hustled to the front near the inside, proved empty in the stretch. REIGNING
FIRE chased wide and was never in contention. MORISSETTE dueled wide early then began retreating on the turn. NOT IN THE MOOD dropped back at
the start and was always outrun.

Footnotes
MARNESIA BIG GIRL chased from the four path, took the lead after a half, opened a long lead entering stretch, was under pressure from both sides but had
more than enough to be clear. BIG RED SEVEN saved ground to near stretch, split foes when moving and was gaining. JUMPIN JETT, relucctant to load,
raced in the five path, lapped on winner, fell back mid stretch then made up ground late. YES MZ ADAH, bumped soundly leaving the gate, raced wide,
drifted out badly through stretch. HALLUCINATION broke slowly and was outrun for a half, split foes moving on the final turn but then quickly flattened out.
CHANCEE came out leaving the gate, raced in three path of second flight then tired. FLEUR DE FORCE stumbled badly leaving the gate, raced three wide
and was no factor. CHORITE was never a serious threat. PASTICHE, out from the rail and never far back, tired. DRIVEN BY SPEED was very wide and
stopped. PUT POSITION came in leaving the gate, set the early pace inside then stop. MAD MARY was never a serious threat.

Footnotes
AEGEAN SEA vied outside, took over midway on the turn then pulled away. eagerly while kept to her business. EXCITABLE LADY advanced on the turn
and continued gamely while no match for the winner. INFATUATING outrun early, faded on the turn then came again for the show. KIRTAN hustled to the
front inside, dueled on the turn then came up empty in the stretch. BARN QUEEN saved ground well off the leaders and rallied mildly. CLOUT CHASER
raced within striking range outside and faltered. GYPSY SALLY was soundly bumped soon after the start, moved inside and was no factor.
INCOMPARABLE chased in mid pack and gradually weakened. PERFECTA STORM trailed early and was always outrun. ELF'S TUNE urged close up
inside early then stopped abruptly.

HONORABLE SERVICE was four wide on the backstretch, raced wider into stretch under left handed pressure, his rider dropped his whip near the furlong
marker and edged away. OWIN I AM broke slowly, raced outside, was very wide on the turn and into stretch and closed well for place. REGAL QUALITY
also broke slowly, was in the three path early, eased out wider and finished well. TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) set the pace in the three path and faded late.
AWE MUN stalked the pace in the four path then weakened. DENNIS' DIAMOND saved ground just off the rail and gave way after a half. LUVINMEISEASY
failed to menace. FIRE MISSION was wide and never a serious threat. FLAT OUT FLYING saved ground and showed little. MR. ROMANCE had speed for
a half.

STEADYTILLREADY far behind early inside, angled out rallying into the stretch, surged late to move clear in the final yards. WAR TOCSIN dueled outside
in the rapid fractions and continued gamely to the finish. ROCK ON LUKE hustled to the lead inside, dueled long way and weakened slightly in a strong
showing. EMPEROR JOHN lagged far behind outside, remained wide and closed well. ARK IN THE DARK was urged close up inside to the far turn and
continued willingly. SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS raced close up four wide then began fading on the turn. SPRING EMPEROR trailed for half a mile and was
never in contention. DEFIBRILLATOR chased just off the leaders, was put to urging near the far turn but gave way.

Footnotes
PORTAL CREEK came out as the horses left the gate twenty five past scheduled post, then was steered towards the rail, shook loose leaving the turn and
pulled away fully extended. CAPITAL Q was trying to bear out leaving the chute and steadied briefly, bore out again racing on the rail, split foes in the
stretch and was just up for place. FINE ONE WON, two wide early, moved wider into stretch and was no real threat. J J LOVES BILLY was far back early
two wide, went between foes through stretch and improved position while threat to winner. EBO SPECIAL, three wide dueling for the early pace, lugged in
near mid stretch impeding BE PRESENT. CHUBOFFTHEOLDBLOCK raced very wide and wasn't a serious threat. LORDEN'S LOVE steadied in the
opening furlong, continued inside and tired. ARIMA came out leaving the gate then showed little. BE PRESENT dueled for command between foes,
steadied when bothered by EBO SPECIAL. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE broke slowly, raced just off the rail and tired. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF
CAPITAL Q AGAINST PORTAL CREEK FOR ALLEDGED INTERFERENCE SOON AFTER THE START WAS DISMISSED.
