Footnotes
FLORIST vied with a trio of rivals in the two path early, dueled through the final turn then edged away into the stretch and held under a drive. LA MER trailed
outside early, gained closer order through the final turn, rallied steadily outside but was unable to stall the winner. FAT N BITTER reserved off the
pacesetters from the three path, lacked a clear path then angled out and rallied gradually. CITY OF PEARLS vied three to four wide early, was unable to
move on with rivals and weakened. HAIDA saved ground and failed to menace. DAZZLING CHIC broke alertly then set the pace inside, took pressure
leaving the backstretch inside of FLORIST, relinquished the lead and tired.

the lane, drifted in bumping STOCKWATCHER through the stretch but could not get by. TRANG reserved off the pacesetters while four wide, drove five
wide, flattened out and just held for show. PLUM LUCKY tracked inside, lodged a rail bid and just missed out for placing. TIMELESS TALES trailed and
passed tiring. ALBERTA BOUND raced near the back of the pack and offered little. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of

Footnotes
SNEAKY SISTER vied four wide into the backstretch, responded to challenge lodged by PRINCESS ROBI, came under heavy urging nearing the three
sixteenth pole, dug in late and held off a late drive by MARYAM. MARYAM raced from the back of the pack while three wide, advanced along the rail
through the final turn, rallied gradually under encouragement and was out finished. PRINCESS ROBBI prompted the pace from the two path, moved up
alongside SNEAKY SISTER gaining a narrow lead then weakened mid stretch. LADY RORSCHACH settled in range from the five path, chased the leaders
from the three eighths, drove three wide then flattened out. NORTHERN BREEZE saved inside and failed to be a factor. SHEENA flashed some early speed
and was outrun.

HARD TO COME HOME prompted the pace while three wide, advanced in the three path, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and held on. MR.
DAZZLE pressed inside, gained a slim lead at the three eighths marker, responded to challenge from HARD TO COME HOME, kept on with pressure inside
through the drive and finished second best. PARKING PERMIT tracked four to five wide early, angled to the two path leaving the backstretch, chased inside
nearing the stretch and held off rival late for show. DENSE FOG settled inside, chased outside at the quarter pole and was out kicked for show. GEM ALTA
trailed leaving the chute, raced wide through the backstretch and closed late. BITETHEBULLETBRO sprinted clear under a snug hold, contended the pace
from between foes and retreated through the stretch. WEEKEND WIZARD never far back outside, chased wide into the lane and gave way.

BE MY MACHO MAN chased two wide, shifted out then drove four wide into the lane, gained the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving. ROBBI'S
RIVER RUN rated well off the path, swung out five wide the closed outside under encouragement and got up in time for place honors. KING KLOVER saved
ground inside through the backstretch, angled out to the two path, rallied three wide into the stretch and was caught for place. STUMPANATOR chased
outside, angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, gained closer order under coaxing and weakened in the late stages. ROMAN STEEL hustled to the
front, contended the pace from the rail, was overtaken into the stretch and yielded. WISER TIMES chased four wide, lodged an all out rail bid under heavy
urging and flattened out in stretch. MISTER MACHO MAN chased the pace from the three path and had nothing left for the drive. PRESS GANG prompted
while four wide and faltered. TOMAHAWK EXPLORER sat just off the pace while five wide and retired early.

Footnotes
SOMETHING ABOUT ME chased inside, took advantage inside at the head of the stretch and won going away. GOLD DIGGIN DARLIN lagged early,
steadied approaching the stretch, angled in then rallied steadily earning place. EYE CATCHING chased from the two path, advanced inside, shifted out then
steadied mid stretch and closed late for show. SAMURAI GIRL set a pressured pace inside, was under attacked at the quarter pole and gave way into
stretch. SWEAR VENGENCE hesitated at the start then trailed, circled the field and rallied steadily outside. I TRICKED MY RIDE chased and improved late.
RAISE A DANCER hustled outside, angled in to the three path leaving the backstretch and faded. FAIRY BARB vied three wide, was unable to sustain the
bid that was required and tired. CHICOUT D'TIGER vied between rivals, dueled outside of SAMURAI GIRL into the final turn, lacked the response when
asked, pulled up abruptly and eased. STORM STRIDE raced at the back of the pack and was not a factor. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY tracked outside, had no
response under urging, steadied and yielded.
