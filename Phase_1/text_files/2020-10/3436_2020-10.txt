FLOWN stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, drove past the leaders three wide, cleared the field and held
sway in the final stages. RAPID WATER was bothered going into the first turn, raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the stretch
and was gaining in the late stages. LET'S SKEDADDLE raced keen and out of control into the first turn, was back along the backstretch, raced along the six
path into the lane and was widest down the lane while gaining in the late stages. MRS. O'CONNELL was fractious in the gate during the pre-start, chased
the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. ALWAYZ LATE raced back early on, was in the
four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. LA BELLA ROSA pressed the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, continued to bid down the
lane but weakened late in the stretch drive. POSTNUP was bothered and steadied into the first turn. BARISTA was never a factor. MAGIC SOLUTION
stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. BECCA'S ROCKET set the pace early on, was on the inside
into the lane and caved late in the stretch run. ANN IN THE MIDDLE was bothered into the first turn. LIMONATA was a bit slow at the start and outrun.

Footnotes
ELLE Z set the pace along the inside, shook free from pressing foes passing the quarter pole, then held sway under a vigorous hand ride through the lane.
DANCE RHYTHMS settled far off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, tipped six wide passing the three sixteenths pole, then rallied outside of
foes to achieve place while running out of ground to catch the clear leader. ORIGINATOR stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader in
upper stretch, chased that foe through the lane, but was outfinished by an outer foe in the late stages for place while holding show. LADY WORTHINGTON
tracked from midpack two to three wide and between horses, shifted four to five wide in upper stretch, and produced a mild rally, but was outfinished by an
outer foe while failing to reach show. SOLD IT stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail to be outside of the loose leader passing the quarter pole, but
simultaneously failed to keep pace with that foe, then got outfinished by outer rallying foes for minor rewards in the late stages. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK
raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn before swinging to the six path turning for home, then improved past tiring foes while shifting ground
outwards through the lane. VIOLENZA raced off of the pace in the three to four path and outside of foes, then came into the lane in the five path but failed to
factor. SO GRACIOUS saved ground while trailing around the turn, and passed tired foes to no avail. INTUICAO (BRZ) pulled early on to prompt the pace
setter from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and weakened between horses passing the furlong pole. CRYSTAL LAKE
tracked from midpack along the inside early on, but steadied hard behind the tiring YES IT'S GINGER into the turn, then saved ground around that bend, but
failed to make an impact. YES IT'S GINGER lied close to the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with those foes into the turn, and
weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
SPA CITY stalked three wide, vied down the backstretch while perched outside of a pair of foes, forged an advantage from LETMENO passing the five
sixteenths pole, dug in to hold that edge as FRIAR'S ROAD made a menacing bid in midstretch, but prevailed over his inner counterpart passing the
sixteenth pole, and fended off his outer foe to the wire. FRIAR'S ROAD settled off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, inched closer
four wide around the far turn as SPA CITY edged an advantage, sustained his rally through the lane to produce a bid in midstretch under a long drive, but
was denied by his inner foe and missed on the wire. LETMENO vied two wide, dueled between foes down the backstretch, put away his inner counterpart
into the turn, but was headed by SPA CITY at the five sixteenths pole, cut the corner and dug in gamely inside of that foe in upper stretch, but yielded
passing the sixteenth pole. JOB SECURITY stalked close to the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper
stretch, and chased them thereafter. DON BOURBON stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind GLORY ROAD turning for home, shifted to the
three path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. PARADE FIELD shied aggressively after the start, shifted inwards and trailed the field while less than settled
around the first turn, and was outrun thereafter. GLORY ROAD broke through the gate pre-race, then set a pressure pace along the inside, dueled inside of
a pair of foes down the backstretch, but weakened passing the three furlong pole, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
RED KNIGHT saved ground off of the pace around the first two turns, split foes decisively into the third turn, advanced to striking range around that bend
before tipping three wide turning for home, then surged past the pace setter at the furlong pole and won going away. POSTULATION set the pace along the
inside, dug in while shifting off of the fence passing the quarter pole, wandered back inwards at the furlong pole while being surpassed by RED KNIGHT,
then shifted back out through the final furlong, and just held place between surging rivals at the wire. ZIYAD (GB) settled off of the pace in the three path
around the first two turns, then four wide down the backstretch, but was outmoved by an inner RED KNIGHT into the far turn, failed to respond to pressure
around that bend, then hung on his left lead in upper stretch causing him to lean in on HES NO LEMON, but commenced a rally thereafter while drifting in
passing the furlong pole, and sustained his grind to just miss place. NORTH DAKOTA tracked from midpack two wide, then saved ground around the far
turn before committing to the inside for a rally in upper stretch, advanced but was stymied behind POSTULATION at the furlong pole as that foe drifted back
inwards, bumped the fence due to the incident, then kept on when that foe reopened the rail, but missed place. HE'S NO LEMON raced far off of the pace
along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before shifting three to four wide while inside of ZIYAD (GB), but got herded inwards by that foe through
the lane, steadied mildly passing the sixteenth pole, and kept on. BIG AGENDA stalked along the inside, shifted off of the fence to be between horses in
upper stretch, but lacked a kick and faded. AQUAPHOBIA prompted the pace two wide, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch,
then steadied while tiring between horses at the furlong pole. EONS stalked three wide, but weakened around the third turn. SPLIT THE WICKETS raced far
off of the pace in the three to five path around the first turn, then failed to factor. MORNING STRIDE shifted to the four path around the first turn to advance
position through the stretch for the first time, then lost position four wide around the second turn, and was done early.

BUTTERED NOODLES dueled for the lead inside of CASH NOW, but kicked clear from that foe approaching the furlong pole, and widened under driving
pressure. CASH NOW dueled for the lead outside of BUTTERED NOODLES, but proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong pole, and was
second best. CLASSIFIED INFO was bumped at the start by an outer foe, chased the pace two wide and between horses, then improved inside of a tiring
foe to achieve show at the wire. IRISH SPIRIT bumped an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace three to four wide around the turn, advanced for
forge show in upper stretch, but flattened out passing the furlong pole, and got nailed by an inner foe for show. MAJOR ATTRACTION stalked three wide,
but failed to keep pace with the leaders while being outmoved by IRISH SPIRIT passing the quarter pole. STREET CLASS raced forwardly placed along the
