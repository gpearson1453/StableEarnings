Footnotes
COOLER SCHEDULE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and held under steady
pressure. MULTITUDE tracked the pace well back, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the
place. HIGH CLASS PLAYER well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch, then was no match for that one, weakened and held the show. JOSEPHINE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on
that path into the lane, made a steady gain and missed the show. ZANGARVA allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid
three wide into the lane, angled out for clear racing room and flattened out. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM rated close up and outside, gained a striking position
three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened. GRACELET was no factor. MISS UNDERSTANDING stalked the pace
on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, then had no rally.

Footnotes
FIRST IN SHOW set the pace well off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then came again in the late going and edged up in the final
strides. WATCH THE DIP well placed and off the rail, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch,
gained a short lead, then was outfinished. LATE ACT JONES mid pack, held position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the
needed late kick. GRAY'S IMAGE mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the lane, angled around a tiring
rival and got up for a share. I PROWL ALONE well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and
evened out. MAMMOTH allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out and had a mild gain. WAR
OF THE NORTH ran evenly. FREEMORE improved position. HILLBILLY RACER vied for the early lead on the inside, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and faded the final furlong. ABANDONED was never involved.

Footnotes
VINCENT VAN GOGO allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the lane, made a steady gain, drew off
and was kept to the task. CHANNEL STUFFER rated inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside, angled out, then could not match the
winners stride late and held the place. SIR LUDLOW steadied through the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane,
weakened late and held the show. THE DRAKE mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, evened out while
gaining a share. STUNNING BABY ran evenly. BIJEMINI SLEW never far back, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into
the lane and weakened in the drive. MOTATAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final
furlong. LIGHTNING JACK bumped at the start, was no factor. UNCONQUERED SPIRIT was never involved.

BLICHTON rated close up and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain, edged ahead and
held. HOORAY FOR HARVEY well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and
lacked the needed late kick. CAPTAIN MAD JACK allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and edged up
for the show. HE'S SO ZAZZY allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and missed
the show. VALMONT stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane and
flattened out. FUTILE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out and ran evenly in the stretch.

Footnotes
GYPSY WIND mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain, edged up and held. TROIS
PONTS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the place. WEST BURKE
well placed and inside, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain, edged in front, then
weakened late and held the show. RISE TO POWER 'stalked the pace on the outside, edged ahead on the two path through the second turn, stayed on
when challenged in the lane, then weakened late and held a share. COUPLE OF NIKKIS well placed and outside, held position three wide through the
second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened late. SOLO TRY passed tiring rivals. BLESS THE RAINS allowed to settle, moved up while
angling out through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. CASCABELL QUEEN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed
on when challenged into the second turn, then faded late. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL allowed to settle, looped two and three wide through the second turn, bid
four wide into the lane and faded. BLAZE OF JOY mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded.
