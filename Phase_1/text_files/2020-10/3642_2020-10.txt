finished under a determined drive. SUIGU STAR showed brief speed then settled in mid pack, closed on the far turn, was well placed upper stretch and
finished all out to the end. IN SEARCH OF settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide through the far turn then rallied gamely between foes. GRAND

Footnotes
HUNG JURY raced in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, gained the lead finished under a hand ride. PINK GELATO
was off slowly and settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn, rallied gamely and was best of the rest. AFLEET EDDIE was also off slowly
and far back early, closed from the rail and two-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and finished gamely. MAAKWA stalked the pace, raced
three-wide on the turn, moved to the rail a 16th out and finished gamely. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ forced the early pace, dueled on the turn, was outkicked
at the top of the stretch and gave way. JOCULARITY broke outward, stalked the pace, came four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a
late response. GIZMO ROGERS stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. HE'S A TOPPER set a
pressured pace, dueled on the turn, was headed upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MO NATION threw his head at the start and trailed the field three wide around the first turn, circled up from midway on the backstretch through the far turn
while three to five wide, fanned out into the nine path turning for home and lugged in without changing leads in upper stretch, driving by nearing the
sixteenth pole, changing to his correct lead and held safe late, although his lead was diminishing. DENMARK was near the rear, closed inside the winner
three wide into the far turn, angled out from three wide into the stretch and found his best stride late to nail the place award, closing hard. MY LADIES' MAN
stalked two wide around the first turn, was in behind the front runners two to three wide at the quarter pole, had dead aim on the pace survivor in upper
stretch and attained a brief lead at the eighth pole but was immediately tackled by the winner and headed, losing a tght photo for place as well late. ICE
BLUE chased the leaders inside, dropped back around the far turn but re-rallied in the final furlong in the two path to garner a minor award. A I INITIATIVE
broke slow from his outside post and was well back, closed up the rail all the way but had some traffic in upper and mid stretch, getting clear for the final
sixteenth and came with a burst late, gobbling up ground in the final seventy yards. CAPTURE THE RIDE sat in mid pack and moved in behind the leaders
while in the two path turning for home, shifting in to the rail in mid stretch, levelling off in the final stages. CAUSE FOR ALARM took over the lead early on
the backstretch, was dueled by a rival until getting clear turning for home but was collared by another foe at the eighth pole, tiring from that point. BREAD
CRUMBS sat in mid pack three to four wide around the first turn, advanced four wide on the far turn and was pinched back when drifting out as the winner
went by turning for home, still inching up but lost his path at the sixteenth pole, dropping back after that. WINSROY began slowly, turned left behind the field
to get over to the rail, moved up gradually to catch the pack turning for home, had some traffic in upper stretch but could only close mildly when room
appeared. SILENT EMPIRE led along the inside early, taken back to rail chase the pace duo, re-entered the fray with a rail run turning for home but could
not sustain his bid, steadying at the sixteenth pole when a rival cut in front of him. KEEP YOUR WORD sat in mid pack and two to three wide, came into
range three wide between rivals at the quarter pole and was still in contention in upper stretch but had nothing left for the final furlong. COUNTRYSIDE
DRIVE settled in mid pack, began to drop back midway on the far turn and steadied when in tight in the stretch. HUNGARY was three to four wide in mid
pack around the first turn, came four wide to loom up at the quarter pole but his rally stalled down the lane. D MAGICIAN was four to three wide around the
first turn stalking the leaders, came up to press the leader down the backstretch and around the far turn, then retreated down the stretch.

Footnotes
CARL G forced the pace, bid upper stretch, drew away and finished under a hand ride. G PRINCE OF SILVER set a pressured pace, was headed near the
turn, stalked from the rail, chased two-wide into the stretch and rallied gamely. FRAT PARTY stalked the pace, bid mid backstretch, dueled, led into the turn,
was under pressure and was headed upper stretch and chased to the end. GIVE ME AN EYE was off slowly, closed to mid pack, was hustled two and
three-wide on the turn and finished all out. MANNY, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely through the stretch. RANGE
OF MOTION settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely between foes. MAZINAW LEGEND stalked early, was hustled
three-wide late turn but failed to menace. SECRET ROI forced the pace, chased from mid pack along the rail on the turn then finished evenly. PRINCE
MARTHEUS, away slowly and off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch but did not threaten. I HAVE HOPE raced
in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch. BARTMAN settled in mid pack, rode the rail and two-wide on the turn
but flattened out in the final furlong. I'VE PAID MY DUES, in range early, dropped back late turn and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SHANGASSAH was three wide and off the pace around the first turn, swept up five wide around the far turn and drove by at the eighth pole, holding safe
late under a vigorous drive. SELF INFLICTED sat along the rail behind the pace setters, came off the inside to pass that pair inside the eighth pole but was
no match for the winner despite that one's wide journey. GIANT CRITIC settled in mid pack, advanced to loom four wide around the far turn, had dead aim
on the front runners in upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS sat along the inside while off the pace, moved up in the two
path in behind rivals as they bunched up turning for home, awaited room in traffic in upper stretch and was inching up late although clear running room was
unavailable. JEGOS FIRE broke with his head in the air and trailed to the far turn, shifted out from the rail to the five path at the sixteenth pole and was
closing with good energy late. SOCIETY JOE off the pace and in the two path around the first turn, advanced three to four wide in behind a wall nearing the
stretch but could only run evenly down the lane without threatening. CONQUER HIM was three to two wide stalking around the first turn, bid three wide late
on the far turn and was losing steam when in tight at the eighth pole, levelling off from there. NORTH BATTLEFORD had good speed early to lead around
the first turn, setting a solid pace and battled with a rival around the far turn, staying game with that one to the eighth pole, retreating to the wire. WINGS OF
VICTORY was off the pace and trailed into the stretch, angling off the rail to pass a few tired foes late. SPANISH MAJOR stalked and pressed a rival
through solid fractions, tiring at the eighth pole and falling back. SUNDANCE HIT settled in mid pack three wide on the first turn, was stacked up five wide
late on the backstretch when advancing on the leaders and fell back in the four path on the far turn.

Footnotes
GEA bumped with GIZMO'S PRINCESS leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, closed 3w late turn, chased into the stretch, gained steadily and was up late
under a drive. SHE'S A TRUE FOX led into the first turn, set a reserved pace, widened through the far turn but was caught in deep stretch but gamely held
place. ALTERNATIVE VIEW stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. TOTALLY PERFECT raced
in mid pack, was on the rail throughout and rallied full out but hung late. ANITA GRIGIO broke slowly and settled off the pace, raced three-wide through the
first turn, was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. MUSKOKA LADY bumped with GIZMO'S PRINCESS leaving the gate, settled in
mid pack and rode the rail through both turns then finished evenly. TWICK settled off the pace, raced three-wide on the first turn, closed three to five-wide
on the final turn then was game in the stretch but failed to menace. GIZMO'S PRINCESS bumped with rivals from both sides at the break, raced in mid turn,
came two and three-wide through the final turn but never reached contention. NAKED ILLUSION raced in mid pack and used the fourth path on both turns
then flattened out in the stretch. GET OFF MY TAIL broke slowly, raced in mid pack while three-wide on the initial turn and four-wide on the far turn then
flattened out in the stretch. KLASSY DELIGHT showed speed but was no match for SHE'S A TRUE FOX, stalked that one on the backstretch, dropped back
suddenly apparently pinched back between rivals on the turn and lacked a further response. IVYLEA trailed the field and lacked a rally.
