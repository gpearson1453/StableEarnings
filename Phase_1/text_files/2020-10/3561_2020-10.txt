Footnotes
VIVA FOREVER was reluctant to load, settled near the rear, improved through the far turn in the three path, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, was
taken four wide in upper stretch, rallied, and caught DARLIN ROSIE with a sixteenth of a mile to go. DARLIN ROSIE tracked the leading pair inside, was
pushed along into the second turn and improved inside, was taken two wide into the stretch, led at the three sixteenths, could not hold VIVA FOREVER off
past the sixteenth but kept on for a clear second. THAT LUVIN FEELING cleared to the lead into the clubhouse turn, set the pace until being headed at the
three sixteenths, was no match for the top two from there but kept on for third. CHAINMAIL settled at the inside of the rear pair, chased in the two to three
path on the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and improved position mildly. NOCTURNAL MISSION tracked outside the pacesetter, continued in
range two wide on the far turn, was driven three wide in upper stretch and weakened. GO YEOWOMEN settled two wide in the rear pair, pulled into the
backstretch but was kept under a hold, raced near the rear in the six path on the far turn, was driven in upper stretch but had no response. DOUBLE BEE
STING floated three wide into the first turn, chased two wide, was pushed along two wide into the far turn, weakened in the five path around the bend and
faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MAGNITUDE TEN tracked off the second flight between foes unhurried to the backstretch, shifted three deep racing into the far turn while being prompted
to advance, switched outside a rival to advance four wide through the lane, took over leaving midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. COCOA
PEACH, caught four wide racing into the first turn to track off the second flight, conceded some position outside foes on the backstretch, angled to the rail
racing into upper stretch gathering late momentum, then shifted out to split foes in the closing stages to prevail for the place honors. VICE GRIP angled in
sharply while being urged to prompt the pace into the first turn, conceded the lead to track just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, steadily advanced on
the leader to challenge for command racing into upper stretch, struck the front midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. BLAZING RUBY, bumped at
the start, was righted to track off the pacesetter along the inside racing into the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out three wide in upper
stretch while being urged to challenge but lacked the needed late kick. SOPHIA'S DAWN, crowded at the start, settled between foes in the last flight racing
to the backstretch, angled out five wide nearing the lane and made some belated progress. LYNNE T ducked outwards at the start bumping BLASING
RUBY, was quickly righted, then urged along the rail to gain the advantage racing into the first turn, held sway on a clear margin to the far turn, briefly
resisted a rival's challenge but gave out midstretch. MISS GAVEL angled to the rail racing into the first turn tracking off the second flight, saved ground
throughout but lacked a closing response. SOUTHERN ATTACK settled between foes in the last flight and failed to menace thereafter. NO PASSING
ZONE, caught in the five path racing into the first turn, failed to menace. KARMA REIGNS shifted out three, then four wide tracking just off the leaders to the
backstretch but was through after a half.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNERIE settled midpack inside early, was pushed along while saving ground through the turn, got taken five wide into upper stretch, rallied under
a drive, and took the lead past the sixteenth. KIANA'S LOVE tracked the leading trio early while racing well off the inside, bid four wide past the seven
sixteenths, kept on in upper stretch, took the lead two wide at the furlong mark, but was headed past the sixteenth. PARA VIVIR was sent for speed, set a
pressured pace, went to a drive in upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. HELEN MAE'S SONG tracked the leading trio just inside of KIANA'S
LOVE early while racing well off the rail, chased in the two to three path on the turn, altered four wide in upper stretch after a hole closed, and lacked the
needed late kick. PROBABLY GRACE pressed the pace between horses early, continued to press two wide on the turn, and was no match from the three
sixteenths. KENAI COOL settled in second last, raced in the four path on the turn, and lacked the needed rally. DEVIL'S ROSE was slow into stride, settled
in last, was urged in the three path on the turn, but lacked the needed rally. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL attended the pace three wide and stopped at the five
sixteenths. PER RULING 204099 FROM THE HAWTHORN RACING OFFICE CHAMPAGNERIE WAS DQD FOR A POSTIVE TEST.

Footnotes
RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH angled to the rail in early stages tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight, steadied out of tight quarters racing past the
seven sixteenths marker, recovered to advance inside foes into the stretch, briefly awaited an opening, then was urged through tight quarters midstretch
forcing out AWESOME INDRA making repeated contact with that foe but edged forward in time under firm encouragement. JOLIE RULER ducked inwards
at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to a clear advantage along the rail in the opening stages, set the pace into the turn, grudgingly resisted past
midstretch but couldn't contain her rival. AWESOME INDRA, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, was urged to
close the gap racing into upper stretch, was bumped soundly then forced out leaving the furlong marker but continued under stout pressure to prevail for a
share. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR angled inwards while being rated just off the second flight racing into the turn, saved ground through the bend, shifted out
leaving midstretch while being urged to advance between rivals but was outkicked for a share. FIFTHATNARRAGANSET tracked off the second flight
outside foes racing to the turn, angled out four wide into upper stretch but had no rally. GUEST IN MY HEART settled outside a rival in the last flight racing
to the bend, shifted five wide entering the lane but proved no threat. TIZALADYBUG was taken in hand just after the start, then shifted out racing widest to
the stretch while proving no factor. OOPSY DAISY, urged three wide pursuing the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the turn, gave way in
upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF AWESOME INDRA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RAGGEDY DOLL
PEACH ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE
STRETCH RUN THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED RAGGEDLY DOLY PEACH, PLACING HER THIRD.

Footnotes
BEEALEA settled in second last, was pushed along in the three path on the turn and took closer order from the three eighths, was driven into the lane and
taken near the center of the track, rallied, and got up in time. SAND WALKER broke slightly outward and bumped HAVE A NOTION in the opening strides,
tracked the leading pair early, advanced to stalk outside of VALIANT VINNY on the turn, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, rallied three wide, was
bumped by VALIANT VINNY past the sixteenth, nonetheless forged past him, but was caught by the winner. VALIANT VINNY was sent, set a pressured
pace early, continued on the lead while saving ground through the turn, was driven in upper stretch, continued on a diminishing lead, came out and bumped
SAND WALKER past the sixteenth mark, and flattened late. MOHAWK LEONARD was asked for early speed and briefly disputed the pace inside of
VALIANT VINNY, settled back to track the leading trio inside on the turn, improved under a drive inside in upper stretch, but was outkicked. HAVE A
NOTION bumped with SAND WALKER in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair outside of that foe early, was urged to track closer to the leading pair
three wide on the turn, began to lose ground from the three eighths and came up empty under a drive in the lane. HE'S SO WILD settled at the rear, lost
ground in the four path on the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ANDREWS BOOGIE, off a step slowly, quickly recovered some position to track off the first flight between foes racing to the bend, steadily gained on the
first flight angling four wide racing into upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and was driven clear. AND HE'S LOOSE broke readily to gain
terms with the first flight, attended the pace three deep under rating racing to the bend, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but
proved no match for the winner while prevailing for the place honors. END ZONE, urged inside foes prompting the pace from the outset into the turn, dueled
for command into upper stretch but couldn't match the top pair late while just lasting for a share. WILL YA WIN SUM, reserved outside foes in early stages,
gained position between foes racing into the turn, angled five wide racing through upper stretch and just missed for a share. HUEY ATTACK, urged between
foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, dueled to upper stretch and gave way. STOSH tracked the leaders along the rail from just out
of striking distance racing into the turn, shifted out entering the stretch while being urged to advance but had no late response while racing in some close
quarters. RECKLESSNESS settled outside foes in early stages, raced wide to the stretch and proved no threat. PRUDENT HERO retreated early. HE'S
THUNDER, off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WARRIORS GEM tracked just off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch steadily advancing on the
leaders and wrested a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. ROAD GAME tracked just off the first flight inside the eventual winner racing ino the
turn, shifted off the inside racing into upper stretch, switched out of tight quarters in the closing stages to bid just inside the winner but proved only second
best. DEANO, off slowly while appearing to brush the gate, angled to the rail early, saved ground on the turn, shifted out three deep entering the lane, then
shifted five wide in the closing stages but continued willingly to prevail for a share. ENZOEXPRESS, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset,
dueled past midstretch and gave out late. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS, urged prompting a rival's pace racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue
leaving the turn to midstretch but emptied out late. HEISFANCY, slow to gather stride, angled inside rivals racing into the turn, advanced along the rail
nearing upper stretch to bid inside foes but was taken in hand in the final sixteenth when lacking a path from which to challenge. TRES GENERACIONES
settled last racing to the turn, swung six wide racing into upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. STRIKING HEIR tracked off the second flight six wide
racing to the turn, continued four wide on the bend and gave way nearing the lane. HARLEQUIN was a brief factor between foes off the second flight but
faded early. Z U SOON made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes on the backstretch but emptied out early. TIZ TOO MUCH, caught five
wide between foes tracking off the second flight in the opening quarter, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
SHWEET PERSUASION was restless in the gate, was placed on the lead, set the pace while taking pressure from FRANK THE MAYOR to his outside,
saved ground while continuing to dictate terms on the far turn, opened up when asked in upper stretch and always held safe. RIVER CACTUS tracked the
leading pair inside of OFF THE MEDS, continued at the inside of the tracking flight through the far turn, proved no match for the winner in the lane but
chased on a clear second best. EXEMPLAR settled in second last, edged closer to the main pack down the backstretch, chased in the five path on the far
turn, rallied five wide in the lane and proved best of the rest. OFF THE MEDS was lightly bumped in the opening strides by IWILLPERSEVERE after that
one was bumped by FRANK THE MAYOR, tracked the leading pair two wide, continued in range three wide around the far turn, was taken to the inside past
the three sixteenths, kept on under urging but was outkicked. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT was void of speed, trailed in the four path on the far turn, was taken
six wide in upper stretch, and offered a mild outside rally. PICKFORD chased inside of IWILLPERSEVERE, improved between horses past the half mile
mark, was driven into the lane between horses, and was outfinished three wide. IWILLPERSEVERE was bumped by FRANK THE MAYOR in the opening
strides, chased two wide early, was pushed along for a four wide bid on the far turn, came into the lane four wide, and emptied out midstretch. FRANK THE
MAYOR stumbled out of the gate, came out and bumped IWILLPERSEVERE in the opening strides, prompted the pace outside of SHWEET
PERSUASION, began to lose ground from the three eighths and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CLUB SODA broke slowly, was hustled outside foes while shifting inwards to gain terms with the second flight racing into the turn, continued with a
sustained response advancing on the leader four wide into upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker, shifted inwards under pressure
but held a safe margin to the end under pressure. SUNNY'S STORM, off slowly, was settled off the second flight in early stages, was prompted to advance
while angling out five wide nearing the lane and continued with a steady late response to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. R H
SMOAKEM, reserved last racing to the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch and was going well late to gain a share. ROMEO O ROMEO tracked off the
first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out to bid between foes midstretch but was outkicked. MINISTER'S GLORY settled between foes
racing to the turn, then improved position between foes four and five wide late. FOUR LEFT FEET, off slowly, angled to the inside racing into the turn,
advanced along the rail racing into the stretch, but was taken up losing momentum when caught in close quarters late. OUTRUN THE POSSE settled inside
foes racing to the turn, shifted out through the stretch to race six wide in the closing stages but passed only tiring foes. KNOCKYOURBLOCKOFF tracked
the leaders inside foes in second flight racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing lane. GREY MASK stalked just off the first flight racing to the turn,
shifted three wide entering the lane to lodge a bid but lacked the needed late kick. DOM THE BOMB, urged along the inside disputing a rival's pace into the
turn, gave way leaving midstretch. UNCLE PAPPY proved no factor. I AM TOO WILD was urged forcing a rival's pace racing into the into turn, gave way
abruptly midstretch and was taken up in traffic while dropping out last.
