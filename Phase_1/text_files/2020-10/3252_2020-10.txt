Footnotes
FOLDOVER vied for the early lead, took over to set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside of HE WILL in
the final furlong and prevailed determinedly. HE WILL raced three wide early, settled off the pace, bid three wide entering the far turn, rallied outside into the
lane, dug in gamely outside of FOLDOVER in the final sixteenth but could not get by that rival. MACAGONE pulled in the early stages, then stalked the
pace, raced inside on the far turn, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. BARREL OF STOUT raced off the pace inside, came three wide into the lane
and gained mildly. PROMISE ILLGETYOU trailed the field, came two wide into the lane and closed belatedly outside. TANGLED WEB pressed the pace,
then chased two wide on the turn and tired. ZITMAN raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. OUT OF LINE raced
three wide early, settled off the pace and did not factor. MAYRHOFEN raced off the pace inside and faded.

TALKING dueled outside for the lead, briefly shook free, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely between rivals and was outkicked. ENOUGH LOVE raced off
the pace inside, went four wide past the quarter pole and rallied mildly outside. ANDREA'S WORRY drifted out early interfering with BRIDGE TO
BROOKLYN, then dueled inside and tired. WILDCAT MERRY raced off the pace and did not factor. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL was bumped and steadied after

Footnotes
DANTASTIC tracked inside, advanced inside on the turn, rallied on the rail passing the quarter pole and drew clear under urging. COOL STUFF stalked the
pacesetter, moved up on the turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dug in gamely in the stretch drive but second best. ROCKIN WITH LUCKY stalked
outside a rival, moved up three wide on the turn, four wide past the quarter pole and rallied mildly for third. P J'S EGO set the pace racing with a clear early
lead, dueled between rivals passing the quarter pole and tired. SINGLEBERYLBOURBON was outrun early, raced near the inside into the stretch and
bested the others. BLUE EYED ITALIAN was off a bit slow and outrun. ALICE HELEN was outrun. The half mile and five furlong fractional times are from
GMAX.
