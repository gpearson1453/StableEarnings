STAR OF NIGHT stalked the earlier pace from the three path, challenged toward the three eighths pole and drew to even terms at the quarter, took the
advantage two deep approaching the top of the lane, drew clear mid-stretch and was drawing away the final sixteenth. COACH RUBE angled to the inside
to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was met into the far turn, was caught at the rail nearing the top of the stretch,
dropped back a sixteenth away and settled for second best. BOUNDTOBEBAD settled off the pace in the two and three paths and left the turn toward the
outside, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. NAVY SWORD raced just off the
early pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, though flattened stride
leaving the turn. ANGLE OF ATTACK stalked the early pace inside then eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the
three path and showed little more. CAMPANIA settled back about the three path the first turn and showed little response down the backstretch.

Footnotes
THAT KENNEY KID bobbled leaving the gate then settled close in the three and four paths, took aim leaving the first turn and picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, drifted into the lane but dug in through the stretch to get up the final yards.
SHUTUPN'KISSME moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn, was
steadily encouraged leaving the turn but ceded the final yards. THELADYISTRUE rated close off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. JUBA TRAIN saved ground close to the pace past the five
eighths pole then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
BOUNDTOBEOK raced in the five path the first turn and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths,
ran five wide on the far turn and showed little more. TEST ME I DARE U raced well back from early contention off the rail then eased out into the
backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and could only improve her position. LOCK DOWN TIME rated
off the pace and off the rail then eased outward into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, though, weakened in the three path of the far
turn. MADY ROSE raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace outside into the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole but faded
off the rail on the far turn. LONG LEGS LOUISE raced off the pace in the four and five paths the first turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. HERETODAYGONMANANA was not a factor.

kept in hand through the lane. RUSH TO THE CASTLE stalked from the two and three paths and drew close toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase
approaching the three eighths while the deficit steadily increased. TRIPLE BAD settled off the pace inside the opening turn, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, but showed little in the lane. ELLIE'S LIL MAN rated close inside the first turn then gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and weakened. SILVER CASTLE raced off the pace and off the rail the first turn
then showed little response through the backstretch. PARTY LIFE settled off the pace about the four path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed
little response.

BRIDGING THE GAP became fractious in the gate and was bumped at the break, but took over to rate the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the
five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, widened to deep stretch, then taken in hand the final yards. LADY STORM stalked from the two and
three paths then picked up the chase leaving the five sixteenths pole, though, couldn't gain on the winner and settled for second best. SHERWOOD LADY
broke out to make contact with Lady Madison and settled close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then
weakened inside the sixteenth pole. GRACE ELIZABETH raced off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and passed some rivals. SEE YA MANANA saved ground off the pace the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole and improved to the middle of the far turn, but drifted into the lane and flattened stride. SKYLAR'S TRICK raced off the pace in the four path the first
turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LADY MADISON was bumped outward and into Bridging The Gap leaving the gate and promptly
pinched back, then never factored. LIKE ME OR NOT settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and gave way after a half mile.

AWSOME FAITH raced well back off the rail then bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily progressed in the five path of the far turn and dug in from the
head of the lane to get up the final yards. BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail
on the far turn, angled out past the eighth pole and while outfinished for the win, dug in to take second. NORTH ATLANTIC settled close inside then started
a three wide bid between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, took a slim lead at the eighth pole
and dug in gamely to the wire. HERO'S MAN rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure from the three eighths pole and contested the edge nearest the
rail on the far turn, gave up the nod at the eighth pole but continued on gamely to deep stretch. STEP OUT DANCING raced well back from early contention
then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the six path of the far turn and finished well, widest.
RUNNIN'TOLUVYA settled close off the rail then started a four wide bid at the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead four wide on the far turn but
flattened stride inside the eighth pole. CASTLE BOUND settled back off the rail early on then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn and showed little more. OPERA NITE raced with the pace two deep then challenged approaching the seven sixteenths pole, remained a close factor
through the backstretch but faded past the five sixteenths. CAPTAIN CHARITABLE was through early.

Footnotes
FANCY CONCHO rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and held the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in
under a stout left hand stretch drive, drifted outward through the final sixteenth, though held on well. HYPOTHESIS stalked the pace off the rail then
challenged toward the three eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane but was carried out through the final
sixteenth and steadied off the outside flank of Fancy Concho nearing the wire. CHIEF RANDEL stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and drifted to the six path on the far turn, closed the gap to late stretch then steadied off the outside flank of Hypothesis the final yards. STOWE
ANGEL saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
CUBIC SOUND raced well off the pace about the four path the first turn and left the turn outside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn four wide and passed some rivals in the stretch. J J WEDGIT MAN saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the first turn, eased to
the three path through the turn though showed little further. MYWALKTOFREEDOM rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths then raced outside
into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn still about the three path and showed little more. TAKE TIME steadied
into the first turn and raced well back. OCASIONALY CLASSY showed little response through the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail, was eased in
the stretch then unsaddled shortly after the wire and walked off appearing sore. After the Stewards reviewed a claim of foul, lodged by the rider of
Hypothesis against the rider of Fancy Concho, as well as a claim of foul lodged by the rider of Chief Randel against the riders of both Fancy Concho and
Hypothesis, the Stewards decided no change was necessary.
