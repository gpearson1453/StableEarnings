Footnotes
DEVILS COMMAND had an early position outside of rivals then stalked the pacesetters leaving the backstretch, gained an advantage at the head of the
stretch and won driving. MARACOCA'S DREAM vied inside, dueled inside of DARE TO GO through the far turn, inched away from that one then lacked the
rally needed through the drive. COMMISSION MAN lagged early and rallied belatedly for show. DARE TO GO vied between rivals early, contested the lead
into the far turn, was unable to move on with rival and faded through drive. REMARKABLE ELI chased three wide and was done early. BLACK WOLF
outrun throughout.

pressure through the turn and was out kicked for place. FROST CANYON chased the pacesetters, angled to the rail at the three sixteenth pole and missed.

Footnotes
OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND vied inside, dueled through the final turn inside of ORANGE THEORY, gained a slim lead into the stretch and drove clear.
ORANGE THEORY contended the early pace, rallied into the stretch outside of OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND and flattened. COLLAR ME FIRST showed early
outside speed, raced three wide into the far turn and went evenly through the stretch. WEALLDOIT sent for speed from the four path and failed to threaten
in drive. MOVILLE chased from the rail and was unable to improve position into the stretch. SALTY LITTLE DOG hustled away, saved ground through the
turn and lacked a response when asked. FOREVER JIMMY lagged and passed tiring late. GUARANTEEDDELIVERY lacked early speed, chased five wide
turning for home and wilted. CHILLIN WITH CHIP outrun throughout.

saved ground mid pack and passed tiring. TRANSPLANT vied between rivals early, was unable to move on with foes after the five sixteenth marker and
faded through the stretch. BIONIC BIRD attended the pace while four wide, dropped back leaving the backstretch and gave way inside. TALKIN' BULL
stumbled and failed to recover ground.

Footnotes
SOLARITY was hustled to make the early pace inside, gained the lead into the far turn, drew clear into the stretch and was kept under intermittent urging.
SARAHS ELEGANCE tracked while five wide, went in pursuit of the leader with two and a half furlongs remaining but was no match for winner. BLUES
ROAR saved ground from just off the rail, lost ground through the final turn, lodged a rail bid then shifted out and rider lost whip at the sixteenth and held.
PENNY A POINT raced in the back of the pack, advanced quickly outside and closed gradually. EVERYTHING'S QUIET stalked four wide and lacked a
closing response. MORE MO FOR ME offered little. LIA'S ON TUNE set a pressured pace from between foes, was overtaken and retired early.

Footnotes
VICTORY SHADOW broke quickly to gain command, drew away through the final turn, ran clear through the stretch under urging. MOE'SANNIE settled
inside, chased the eventual winner into the stretch but was no match. QUEEN'S PARK sat in striking position while three to four wide, came under coaxing
approaching the quarter pole, rallied gradually under heavy urging and got by late for show. SKY DESTINY settled four to five wide and rallied belatedly
inside. PEPPERMINT sat just off the pace from the five path, chased three wide through the far turn and weakened late stretch. HEREVERYWISH lodged a
rail bid into the stretch and flattened. RUNNINFORFUN saved ground along the rail, shifted out into the lane and passed tiring late. HOLY HANNA tracked
inside early, chased four wide at the top of the lane and gave way. SPIN A TALE never far back while four wide, shifted outside leaving the backstretch and
had no response when called upon. PARIS IN PLAY chased outside and was not a factor. LITTLE NEW YORK was never involved.

Footnotes
POWER OF INTENTION rated just off the pace inside, asked to quicken at the five sixteenth then had to wait briefly, found running room into the lane
gaining the lead and just held under a late drive. KICKEN WEST G. allowed to settle early, gained quickly inside with two furlongs remaining, rallied steadily
through the stretch and just missed. SMILEY sat in striking position while three wide, came under coaxing through the far turn, rallied three wide into the
stretch and held show. OUR MONEY CAT tracked inside, chased through the far turn, swung out at the three sixteenth and closed late. BAKKEN THE U S
S R contested the early pace, was overtaken at the quarter pole and yielded. TRIPLE LIVE chased outside then was coaxed leaving the backstretch, came
five wide entering the lane and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. WISER TIMES raced in second flight, chased under urging and wilted. GUNN WITH
THE WIND failed to menace. CAPTAIN JOHN lacked a serious bid. BARLEY BOY was not a factor. SMALL TOWN DUDE drifted out into the opening turn
and was never involved.
