Footnotes
HIGHWAY BOUND kept control after breaking on top, cut over towards the inside, eventually settling at a slight distance from off the rail, was rated along,
edged away during the run around the bend, went approximately three wide into the lane, kicked away to his largest advantage during the ensuing furlong,
squandered some of it afterwards by drifting out in the final furlong in addition to being asked but not fully extended. NEPOTISM strongly ridden over the
course of the opening panel to get going, departed the backstretch from the three path, fanned out a couple of paths wider entering the stretch, chipped
away at the deficit en route to narrowly winning place honors. JAILBREAKER stalked HIGHWAY BOUND two to three wide, angled four wide stepping into
the lane, battled NEPOTISM for second, came up the vanquished one. THRUSTER off the inside throughout, raced three to four wide on the turn, altered
into path two during the early stages of the stretch run, got outfinished. MAGNIFICENT CHROME four wide on the turn, was as wide being ridden into the
stretch, lacked the necessary response. DIGITAL FUTURE out with his initial step, shouldered its next stall neighbor before getting corrected, chased the
pace from path two on the turn, moved out into path five for the drive, gave way.

Footnotes
DUBAI BOBBY broke out at the start bumping BEACH FRONT, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, swung five wide into
upper stretch, rallied tipping out as the top pair floated out nearing the eighth pole, took over command at that station and edged clear under urging before
being geared down in the late stages. DARING DISGUISE broke out at the start under coaxing brushing TIERGAN, raced four wide in aim of the front,
tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to prompt the leader from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, got leaned on by
UNPRECEDENTED and carried out two path from upper stretch to the eighth pole, then ran on to chase the winner home along clear of the rest and second
best. UNPRECEDENTED broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand from the three path down the backstretch, tucked inside
through the turn coming under increasing pressure from the aforementioned foe to the outside and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response,
spun three wide for home under threat, drifted out leaning on DARING DISGUISE from upper stretch to the eighth pole carrying that rival out two paths and
was displaced from the front at the eighth pole, then weakened through to the finish. BEACH FRONT bumped at the start by DUBAI BOBBY who broke
outwards, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to eight
wide into upper stretch and weakened. PRICING EXERCISE coaxed from the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to
three wide through the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. TIERGAN got brushed at the start by DARING DISGUISE who broke
outwards, raced eight paths off the rail down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung seven wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. HARD COUNT chased five wide until tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
LUCKY SITKA broke in line with the second place finisher, remained hitched up to that opponent sparring from the outside, towards path three on the
backstretch and then from path two afterwards, got cued up spinning onto the head of the stretch, battled onward with vigour, getting the job done in the
final strides. WELL KEPT SECRET engaged to the inside of the top one seemingly from the get-go, got guided over to the inside route as their tussle spilled
onto the turn, was turned loose heading home, saw LUCKY SITKA inch up, yielded reluctantly in deep stretch. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN took up the chase
from path turn, under a ride on the bend, stepped into the stretch, mustered up a mild response securing the show. SIMPLE SUGAR three wide onto the
turn, was in path four exiting it, having been called upon for more a sixteenth up the road, had no punch. TO THE TUNE along the outside throughout,
travelled three to four wide on the turn, fanned out into path five for the drive, made no impact. KRUBERA quickly set up in the pocket, faltered. MADAME
ROSE steadied after coming in at the start, was rank for a few jumps afterwards, ventured onward saving ground, wound up trailing at all times.

GRAY DESTINY bumped after the start by FROSTED BOURBON who came outwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and took over command straightened away, then edged clear under a drive to
prevail. CARA'S DREAMER three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, assumed command near the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, swung four
then three wide into upper stretch straightened away and was displaced by the aforementioned foe from command, dug in running on to chase the winner
home well clear of the rest and along second best. EMMA AND I four then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, improved position to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. MENDHAM four then three wide in
pursuit from near the rear of the field, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. FROSTED
BOURBON hustled from the start, came outwards slightly bumping GRAY DESTINY after the start, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then
four wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. THEATRICAL DANCER got
away half a beat slow and was slow into stride growing quickly detached at the tail of the field, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before
tucking to the two path into the turn advancing into the main body of the field to the inside of MENDHAM, came under coaxing three furlongs from home,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ROSIES SURPRISE four to five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased through the final furlong. ADRIATIC ROSE chased five to six wide under a ride from the three-eighths,
cornered five wide for home, tired and was eased through the stretch. TEN PLAGUES showed the way in hand three to four paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, yielded the front nearing the five-sixteenths, went four wide for home backing away, faltered and was
eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
DEEP SEA quickly set up along the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, was put to a drive cutting the corner into the lane with clear sailing for the asking on
the rail corridor, crept up menacingly, emerged at the conclusion of the furlong grounds as one of a swarm of equines on near even terms with each other,
forged to the front a sixteenth later, then dug in well to preserve the decision. VICAR'S LEGEND took up the chase from the four path, got sent out into six
path stepping into the stretch, rallied past several stubborn foes in the last eighth to procure the place. ORPHEUS (ARG) settled into the three path by the
end of the backstretch, swung into action by swinging five wide into the lane, gradually advanced towards the ones to catch, wasn't able to cement itself to
the top, but stayed on for the show. JUSTIN FRONT off the inside, raced three to four wide on the turn, was more the latter at the commencement of the
stretch run, fought its way to the front end coming up to the eighth pole, desperately clung to the advantage during the next sixteenth, weakened after
yielding to the top one. HARDCORE FOLKLORE pursued the front runners from path two, was still in it heading home, was in the thick of the fight for the
advantage before flattening out leaving the eighth pole. ETHAN HUNT remained forwardly placed after out-breaking the competition, argued for command
from the inside matched up with WUSHU WARRIOR until the end of the bend, shifted over into the two path stepping onto the head of the stretch, gave in to
extreme pressure deep into the furlong grounds, then steadily backed away. WUSHU WARRIOR sparred for control from path two, challenged in earnest
turning into the stretch three wide, kept up the pursuit for a while longer before giving way. OUR HONOR parked out five wide on the turn, was parked out
six to seven wide making his way down the lane, never made its presence after being practically the widest of all throughout. PROFESSOR SNAPE four to
five wide entering the turn, displayed only brief speed.

Footnotes
WASP tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, tipped out four wide through the turn advancing given some rein to work with to overhaul the
leader nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down through the final sixteenth to
prevail comfortably on the wire. LUCKY GIRL chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tipping out to the five path through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the place honors. PORTOFINA pressed the pace of
CALIDAD from the outside in the three path, took over command just inside seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got
overhauled nearing the quarter pole by the top one and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened to the finish while well clear for the show
honors. BELLA DOMENICA a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased along the inside until tipped out to the four path nearing the nine-sixteenths,
chased five to six wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths offering up a mild bid at the five-sixteenths, swung seven wide into upper
stretch and tired. CALIDAD established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from PORTOFINA to the outside, yielded
the front just inside the seven-sixteenths, faded through the turn and went five wide into upper stretch and folded. TABULA RASA bobbled at the break,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MY SWEET WIFE remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, got called upon for more crossing the midway
point on the turn, cut the corner into lane, gradually made its way towards the three path, narrowed in on the leader, took hold for a jump after an errant
SWEET KISSES trespassed into her path with approximately a sixteenth to go, saw the nemesis get quickly put back on a truer course and resumed its
rally, wore down the second place finisher at the wire. SWEET KISSES was confidently ridden sparring three wide for control until the end of the bend,
settled in at the top of the lane before being switched over to stronger handling, came out gradually between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, pilot
applying left side stick work at the time, had the rider take corrective measures, dug in as the winner whittled away at the deficit, saw that one steal the
decision in the last jump. BIG BENNYS TRIBUTE took up the chase from the three path on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, got
steered farther to the outside springing from the eighth pole, kicked into her best, finishing with good energy securing the show. FIFTYSHAYS OFGREEN
three wide onto the turn, was sent out four wide exiting it, got caught late for show. LOVELY LA LA guided over to the rail in short order after making light
contact with MADAM MACLEAN right after the start, paused in hand approaching the quarter pole, turned into the lane with sufficient room with which to
launch a rally, mustered up a mild rally after getting cued up. JASMINESQUE off the inside early, was sighted at a slight distance from off the rail on the
turn, swung out three wide entering the stretch, lacked a solid closing punch. SUGGESTIVE HONOR (ARG) chased the pace four wide on the turn, angled
into path five for the drive, gave way. BAY JEWEL strung out four to five wide on the turn, had no rally. MADAM MACLEAN brushed at the start, disputed
the pace from path two until upper stretch and gave way. SOLITARY GEM fell back after appearing to take a bad step coming up to the conclusion of the
backstretch, proceeded along three wide protected on the turn, ventured out into path six for entrance into the stretch, went down it kept to a protective hold.

JUMP FOR JOY coaxed from the gate, pressed the pace four then three wide in closest aim of the leader to the outside of a pair, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took over command and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish kept to task. GLASS
CEILING got away to an awkward beginning lunging to the near side, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home and just got up for the place
honors on the wire. DOVEY LOVEY chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper
stretch, kicked on belatedly to just miss for the place honors at the finish. SIRENIC coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through
swift splits under some pressure from a pair to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front and took the inside route into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. EXCESS CAPACITY chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under a ride
five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. BLUNT FORCE chased three to four wide under
a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. FLAT AWESOME JENNY coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
NO DEAL coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace three then two wide between foes coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, began to get shaken off
near the quarter pole and went three wide at the head of the stretch, then tired in the drive.

COST BASIS prompted the pace from off the inside, was well held sparring for the top two wide on the turn, was called upon spinning onto the head of the
stretch, out-dueled FOOLISH GHOST by the beginning of the last sixteenth and kicked clear. FOOLISH GHOST away forwardly placed, argued for
command with the winner from along the inside, got turned loose for the drive, saw the top one slowly but surely take charge, then got shaken off in the last
sixteenth. THE SICARII cut over to the rail, rode it until the end of the bend, angled three wide into the lane, went on to secure the show. WILD
MEDAGLIAD'ORO underwent a two wide pursuit, stepped into the stretch, lacked the needed response. EDGE OF FIRE pocketed, abandoned the
premises by swinging about four wide into the lane, weakened. SPEIGHTFUL KITTEN two wide onto the turn, went five wide exiting it, folded.
SUPERFECTO hung out four wide on the turn, had no rally. CHOWDA two wide on the turn, was sent out three wide into the lane, never got involved. AL
BROWN took up the chase two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
KINGFISH four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn and advanced through the latter portion of the
bend under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the final furlong and was
up in the last jumps to the finish to prevail. TERCERO broke in at the start solidly bumping JUDGE ALEXANDER into HARD D S C and then came in again
to bump that rival solidly once more into HARD D S C, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside safely in front
facing no pressure through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in growing leg weary late and was nailed on the wire. BIELEFELD chased three to four wide from mid pack coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors over a wire at the end. TOP OF THE MINT four then
three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick but was just bested at the
end for the show honors. JUDGE ALEXANDER got bumped solidly at the start by TERCERO and in turn bumped HARD D S C, then got bumped solidly
once more by TERCERO and again bumped that rival and was away last, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid showing courage to cut the field in half. OPEN LENGTHS five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and tired. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU forwardly placed three then two wide, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired. BEING ME chased just off the inside forwardly placed, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths
forcing STARSHIP EMPIRE to steady in behind, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. HARD D S C
got bumped twice at the start by JUDGE ALEXANDER due to pressure from TERCERO, who broke inwards, chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. STARSHIP EMPIRE
broke in at the start and was corrected, crossed inside to chase along the rail, got steadied in behind BEING ME at the nine-sixteenths as that rival tucked to
the rail in front, came under coaxing near the midway point on the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch and faltered.
