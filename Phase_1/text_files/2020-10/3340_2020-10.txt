Footnotes
VIKING QUEEN was allowed to settle early, advanced four wide coming off the far turn, rallied steadily and overhauled SPIN CLASS from outside in time.
SPIN CLASS vied inside BEAUTY GENIUS, edged away approaching the eighth-pole, and could not contain the winner in the final yards. BEAUTY GENIUS
contested the pace outside SPIN CLASS to the stretch, and salvaged the show. PEDESTAL raced three wide early, saved ground advancing into the
stretch, and was one-paced on the rail through the last eighth of a mile. SERENADE A KITTEN was up with the leaders inside first time through the stretch,
got out and had to be steadied back entering the first turn, was roused for a response inside after a half-mile, and came up empty. CASH UP FRONT raced
four wide on the first turn, moved in to the two-path on the far turn, and faded in the drive. C'EST PARTI was never prominent. MERMAID'S TEAR stayed in
range three wide to the far turn, and tired. IRON ON FIRE was bumped into WHAT A KNOCKOUT by PATRONUS at the start, and was outrun inside.
PATRONUS broke in bumping IRON ON FIRE, steadied keyed up and hard to handle going to the first turn, took up sharply inside midway on that opening
bend, and never reached contention. WHAT A KNOCKOUT was bumped by IRON ON FIRE at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
EXCALIBUR was reserved inside just off the early leaders, moved out three or four wide getting his cue near the quarter-pole, caught IMPERIAL
GREATNESS from outside near the eighth-pole, and drove clear. IMPERIAL GREATNESS set a pressured pace slightly off the rail, could not hold off
EXCALIBUR through the furlongs grounds, drifted out and stayed clear of the rest. SKYLINE VIEW pressed IMPERIAL GREATNESS from outside,
weakened into the stretch, and ran on best of the others. SWEET GIANT entered the first turn in the five-path, moved in and cut the corner turning for home,
and lacked a solid response on the rail. CONSILIUM bumped with LOVEDISC at the start, and was not a factor. SIGNIFIED bumped with HIGHWAY FLYER
at the start, was put to a drive into the far turn, and tired. HIGHWAY FLYER bumped with SIGNIFIED at the start, raced three wide and was through after a
half-mile. LOVEDISC bumped with CONSILIUM at the start, was outrun inside, and jogged in.

Footnotes
LITTLE BIT GOOD saved ground in easy striking range for six furlongs, got through on the rail to reach the front inside JOSEFA and SENSE A MILLION a
furlong out, and kicked clear under good handling. JOSEFA went along reserved in midpack between horses early, loomed three wide with a quarter-mile
remaining, could not match strides with the winner leaving the eighth-pole, and held the place. CACTUS KITTEN saved ground outrun early, came four wide
off the far turn, and rallied belatedly outside. SENSE A MILLION set the pace toward the inside to the stretch, and weakened between horses through the
furlong grounds. MI KARLITA was outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses. WILD ABOUT THIS prompted the pace two wide, lodged a mild bid on the
far turn, but gave way into the lane. LONESOME PALM raced two wide, and faded approaching the stretch. BIZ MAKER was always outrun. ALL THIS
JAZZ was finished early. FRERET was done early. TENNESSEE COTTON moved up outside rivals along the backstretch, but could not sustain the rally.
LEMON WATER was five wide early, dropped back on the far turn, and was eased up through the stretch.

AVUNCULAR sped to the front with an alert getaway, rated along toward the inside clear into the turn, shook off a challenge from MY ASHLEIGH after a
half-mile, and stayed in command under pressure. RASPBERRY BALLET lagged far back for a half, found her best stride turning for home inside, and
rallied gamely along the rail to get up for second. MY ASHLEIGH chased outside AVUNCULAR to the turn, challenged near the five-sixteenths pole, could
not get by, and weakened through the late stages yielding the place. FEARLESS GIRL stayed in range toward the inside to the lane, and lacked a solid
closing bid in the two-path. SHEDANCESFORFATE raced two wide, and had no rally. MADDOX gave chase three wide for a half, and tired. TWIRLING
STAR raced four wide, and faltered into the stretch.

CHOOSE JOY went up inside MIDTOWN ROSE to grab the lead after the start, edged away from that one after a half-mile, stayed on her left lead and held
on doing her utmost. R PREROGATIVE was a step slow at the start, recovered to a forward early position inside, moved out three wide approaching the
stretch, finished with good courage and was gradually gaining outside the winner. MIDTOWN ROSE broke sharply, pressed CHOOSE JOY from outside,
could not keep pace into the stretch, and did enough to stay clear for the show. SAMMIE SUNSHINE raced four then three wide around the turn, and could
not make up ground through the lane. SONAR moved inside around the turn, and faded steadily after a half-mile. BARGAINAIRE trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE vied for the early lead inside SOLDOLLIE and HENRY'S WORLD, eased back heading to the turn, came out to the two-path with
a rebid near the furlong marker, dueled inside KANTHAROS' IMAGE through the last sixteenth of a mile and got the head bob. KANTHAROS' IMAGE saved
ground early, moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, battled on even terms outside HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE through deep stretch and just missed.
ALLEGEDLY PERFECT stayed in range early, came four wide off the turn, rallied mildly and did not have quite enough. SUBLIME APPEAL became
fractious unseating the rider behind the gate, lagged well back for three furlongs, and rallied belatedly outside to pick up the last major share. HENRY'S
WORLD contested the early pace outside, cleared to the lead and moved inside entering the turn, stayed on past the eighth-pole, but gave way late.
SOLDOLLIE bumped with FREE FLAY at the start, argued the pace between horses up the backstretch, and faded through the drive. HONOLULU
EXPRESS saved ground and failed to make an impact. WEEKEND DREAMER raced two wide, and tired through the lane. SASSY BUT SMART was outrun
four wide. R MAN JOE was no factor. FREE FLAY bumped with SOLDOLLIE and steadied back at the start, and was always far back.

Footnotes
KAREN'S COVE stayed close inside early, moved out to the four-path approaching the stretch, stayed on his left lead rallying to reach the leaders from
outside past the eighth-pole, and edged clear late. FRENCH QUARTER pressed STAR JUANCHO from outside, challenged in earnest after a half-mile,
steadied behind that rival in deep stretch, moved out and got up for second. STAR JUANCHO sprinted clear early, showed the way in the two-path to the
stretch, and drifted out weakening in the final furlong. CHASE RUNNER raced two wide around the turn, and could not gain through the stretch inside.
PAPACHO was no factor inside. DROP KICK was crowded by SPA JAZZ just after the start, and was outrun four wide. OX TROT was always outrun. SPA
JAZZ came in just after the start bothering DROP KICK, and was finished early three wide.
