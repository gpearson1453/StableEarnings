Footnotes
FADED LOVE tracked leader along the inside on the backstretch, moved to the two path while making a bid at the three sixteenths pole, entered turn in the
three path, and wore down leader in the stretch to win in a drive. ROBBERYINPROGRESS cleared field along the inside, entered turn still clear and along
the inside, entered stretch in the two path and met bid early in the stretch, gamely tried to maintain lead but no match late. CHROMES LIL SIS chased
leader along the outside on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, but took majority of the turn three wide, lost ground on leaders into the stretch and briefly
headed by rival along the rail but gamely kept on and edged rival for third. SOLAR GRACE stalked leaders off the rail in the two path, entered turn along the
inside and into the stretch along the rail. kept to task in the stretch and just edged for 3rd. DERBY LADY settled two wide on the backside well off the pace,
entered turn two wide and lacked bid in the stretch. FOG LIFTER off slow and bumped by outside rival at the start, settled well of the pace inside on the
backstretch, lacked needed response in the stretch and proved to not be a factor. MY BELLA GRAY broke in and bumped rival at the start, lacked any
speed and quickly fell way back of the pace, and lacked any impact at any point of the race and eased in to the finish.
