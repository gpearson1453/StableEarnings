Footnotes
REMARKABLE ELI broke well, sat in striking position while three wide into the opening turn, came under coaxing approaching the quarter pole, rallied
between rivals into the stretch and won the nod. LITE MY FIRE vied from the three path, led through the turn, rallied determinedly inside of REMARKABLE
ELI, dug in late and was out nodded. SHADY BIZ saved inside, asked to quicken leaving the final turn, was set down for a drive while three wide then
loomed boldly outside, flattened and was vanned off afterwards. FROST CANYON chased four wide early, swung four to five wide into the lane and lacked
the kick needed. PADDYSDAYCHARM sat just off the pace inside, lost ground in the final turn then lodged at bid into the stretch and failed to threaten.
LEGS ARE DIAMOND never far back and lacked a bid. COWBOY CREEK outrun throughout.

Footnotes
PRINCESS ROBBI took closer order leaving the backstretch, rallied steadily inside and edged away under steady handling. TROOPER JENNY saved
ground while showing the way, took pressure inside of VICTORY SHADOW, disposed of rival entering the lane and was run down. VICTORY SHADOW
moved up alongside TROOPER JENNY to contest the early pace, dueled leaving the backstretch but was unable to move on with the fore mentioned and
held off a late challenge for show honors. SNEAKY SISTER sat in striking distance of the early pacesetters, rallied belatedly and missed. SAY IT'S NOT SO
offered little. NORTHERN BREEZE was never involved and was eased.

SHEPARD contested the pace inside of SIR MIEZIE, was unable to sustain the pace entering the lane and finished second best. BIG AND FLASHY broke
out leaving the gate, chased the pacesetters through the far turn, was gained late but was never a threat. EVIL TERROR chased from the three path and
failed to menace. TOP DEMON chased four wide and retired early.

Footnotes
SLEW'S BAK secured a rail position early then was allowed to settled off the pace, shifted out to the three path near the quarter pole, seized command and
drew off under a drive. RYANWATER hurried away then emerge the leader entering the backstretch, responded to looming threat in the far turn, was quickly
overtaken and held on place. HOLY MUCHACHO raced three to four wide leaving the opening turn, found running room inside entering the lane and missed
out. ACE OF DIAMONDS fractious in gate then lagged early while three wide, chased wide into the lane gaining closer order and produce a late rally but
was unable to improve position through the stretch drive. BACK ALLEY CAT unhurried while racing five wide, gained closer order under encouragement and
bid belatedly. LONESOME CAT sat just off the pace from the three path, went in pursuit of the leader near the three eighths pole and faded. BIG AL'S
VISION settled and failed to produce a bid. MISSY'S PADRAIG fractious in gate, tracked outside from the three path, drifted inward leaving the final turn
and gave way inside.

FROBISHER BAY broke well then was allowed settle early, advanced outside leaving the backstretch, closed outside and edged away late. WEEKEND
WIZARD settled well off the pace while four to five wide, gained closed order through the final turn, drove four wide then gained the lead and was rundown
late. GEM ALTA raced at the back of the pack from the two path, angled out to the five path leaving the backstretch, circled into the lane then rallied
gradually to earn show. SERENGETI CAT stumbled away then chased, took closer order through the far turn then was all out through the stretch and was
caught in the final yards. FINALLY GOTTCHA prompted the pace outside of BITETHEBULLECTBRO, inherited the lead just after the three eighths pole and
came up empty for the drive. JOVIAL DESTINY chased inside then lost ground leaving the backstretch, lodged a mild rail bid and tired.
BITETHEBULLETBRO stumbled leaving then was sent for speed, dueled inside of FINALLY GOTTCHA leaving the backstretch and was unable to move on
with rival and faltered.

Footnotes
GRANDMA JO was taken back early, saved ground while five wide, drove four to five wide then closed down the center of the track and got by late. COUNT
ON IT attended the pace while four wide, inherited the lead near the five sixteenth pole, responded to challenge from GRANDMA JO and led until deep
stretch. ALBERTA MOON unhurried early then raced wide through the backstretch, took closer order nearing the three eighths, came four wide into the lane
and finished best of the rest. BOUND TO BE SMART settled in range while five wide, came under coaxing into the final turn and lacked a closing response.
LIGHT FAST FEET pressed while three wide, chased through the far turn and flattened out. AWESOME GIGI set a pressured pace inside, was unable to
sustain the bid that was needed with three furlongs remaining and tired. PLUM BLUE never reached contention. GABBY sat just off the pace between rivals,
dropped back leaving the backstretch and stopped.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE GOLD raced five wide in the opening turn, settled mid pack through the backstretch, took closer order then swung out at the top of the lane,
closed steadily and nipped the leader at the wire. BOOKIE went four wide through the opening turn then tracked inside, angled out to the three path then
overtook the lead and was nipped in the final strides. DOMENICO unhurried early, trailed leaving the backstretch then advanced quickly through the final
turn, circled the field and rallied belatedly. PATRICK saved inside, chased into the lane and rallied mildly through stretch. RUN JEANNE RUN settled off the
early pace while four wide, chased three wide into the far turn and passed tiring. POWER OF INTENTION sat just off the pace in the two path under a snug
hold, launched a bid from the quarter pole and had little left in reserve for the drive. ALL MIGHTY BO chased four to five wide into the final turn and failed to
menace. VISION QUEST showed the way into the backstretch, was overtaken near the quarter pole and gave way inside. STREET RULER hustled four to
five wide into the opening turn, chased the pacesetters and retired early. K K GOLD last away then stumbled after the break and never reach contention.
