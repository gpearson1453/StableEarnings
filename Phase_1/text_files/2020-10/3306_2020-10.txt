Footnotes
CANDY EMPIRE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid past the five sixteenths pole, gained the advantage by the quarter pole, then slowly
edged clear past the eighth pole, then was kept to pressure to prove best. DOWNDELANE was well rated early on the inside, then had to ease out five wide
approaching the quarter pole for racing room, then rallied well to be slowly gaining on winner late. SALTED REVENGE tracked the early pace and made a
four wide bid on the second turn, then drifted in leaving the furlong grounds, while flattening out. PRINCESS LENNY was five wide into the first turn while
trailing, remained five wide on the backstretch, then moved over to be three wide by the quarter pole while starting to launch a mild move, then came into
the stretch five wide to offer a belated rally. MYSTICLY DELICIOUS pressed the pace two wide then weakened after five and half furlongs. QUITE A
MOONGLOW set a pressured pace on the inside then gave way. QUEEN CHARMAINE was allowed to settle while four wide then stopped. Per Stewards,
due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds,

Footnotes
HITTHEFLOORRUNNING was allowed to settle early while four wide, made a four wide move on the turn to draw into contention, drew off smartly in the
stretch to prove much the best under mild left handed encouragement. BIG BLUE EMU chased the early pace and made a mild bid three wide past the
quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. NATTY NORA was away alertly but drifted out a few strides after causing
VALSHEBA to clip heels, then went on to set the pace while clear on the inside, then faltered in the stretch, bested rest. BERTIE THE BEAUTY chased the
early pace on the inside but was empty. VALSHEBA clipped heels and stumbled badly shortly after the start, then was on the inside past the three eighths
pole, eased out three wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally. BLU VIXEN was not a threat while four wide. HANDFUL OF HEROES was not a factor.
The stewards posted the Inquiry sign on the tote board into the running leaving the gate, after reviewing the replays they disqualified NATTY NORA from
third and placed her fifth for interference leaving the gate. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds,

KANFU vied for the early lead three wide into the first turn, then went on to set the pace on the backstretch crossing over to the rail, drew off entering the
stretch and was kept to a drive to prove much the best. LADY JENNEVIERE tracked the pace early and was two wide on the backstretch, then made a mild
bid on the inside by the quarter pole to be in contention but could not go with the winner while being second best. BELLA BELLE was well placed early and
made a three wide bid around the quarter pole, but flattened out in the stretch while saving the show award. I LIKEM was allowed to settle and was four
wide down the backstretch, then came into the stretch four wide to offer a belated rally. STYLISH KITTEN was reserved early on the inside, swung out five
wide in the stretch to have a mild late rally. STRELLA'S WAR had no rally while on the inside. TAKE CHARGE CACKY stumbled at the start, was outrun
and then came five wide into the drive but offered no rally. DISCREET KITTY vied for the early lead on the inside then gave way. TWELVE MONARCHS
failed to menace. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE was four wide into the first turn, then was five wide on the backstretch and was in striking position to the three
eighths pole then tired. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds,

BOYFRIEND MATERIAL was well placed early on the inside, eased out four wide leaving the quarter pole to make a bid, went on even terms leaving the
eighth pole, then slowly edged clear late to prove best, driving. HIDDEN RULER crossed over to the rail and dueled for the lead on the inside, then made a
bid on the turn, could not hold off the winner late while staying on for the place gamely. FIRERY TALE was taken back early and moved over to the inside,
then advanced on the turn to move into contention, angled out in the stretch for racing room, then was gaining late but was in traffic. BYBEE chased the
early pace four wide, then was five wide by the quarter pole, then offered a mild late rally. JALEN JOURNEY dueled for the early lead then pressed the pace
three wide on the turn but hung in the stretch. BETTER WATCH OUT was reserved early and three wide but failed to menace. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN was

KRUNCH stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, quickly assumed command entering the stretch then drew off smartly
to prove much the best under vigorous hand urging and a couple of whip reminders. PIEDI BIANCHI was allowed to settle while four wide, then made a five
wide past the quarter pole to move into contention, but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. EVER WONDER was sent up the
inside to set the pace while clear then was headed by the quarter pole, weakened in the stretch while staying on to best the rest. UNBRIDLED CLASS
chased the early pace four wide, then was three wide past the three sixteenths pole but was empty. FIREBALL BABY chased the early pace two wide then
faded. OBSOLETE was outrun early on the inside, swung out five wide for the drive but offered no rally. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters

eighth pole, forced way through and drew clear late to prove best, driving. THE BEAUTY'S TALE was well rated early while three wide, then eased out six
wide by the three eighths pole to move around tiring horses, made a four wide bid entering the stretch then went on even terms for the lead pass the eighth
pole, then gained a short advantage but was outfinished by the winner late. WONDRSHEGOTTHUNDR was rated along the inside, then made a bold three
wide bid leaving the second turn, then was on even terms for the lead past the furlong marker but flattened out late. MAGICAL PEAPOD vied for the early
lead then went on to set the pace on the inside and was clear on the second turn, lost whip approaching the eighth pole, then had to check and take up by
the eighth pole, weakened. WELLINGTON WONDER was allowed to settle early, then was inside by the quarter pole but lacked the needed stretch bid.
PRETTY ASSETS passed the tiring rivals. BEENTHEREDONETHAT was allowed to settle early, made a five wide move on the second turn but was empty
in the drive. BLACK NOVA failed to menace. MIRACLES TAKE TIME had a five wide trip while no threat. BLONDE MOMENT pressed the early pace three
wide and in between rivals then tired. SISTER GEMA was five wide into the first turn while vying for the lead then tired. NOTHINGBUTFLOWERS was four
wide into the first turn, pressed the pace from between rivals then stopped. There was a jockeys objection and a stewards inquiry into the running in the
stretch, after reviewing the tapes TIMELESS ROSE was disqualified from first to fourth. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an

DOUBLE TUFF vied for the early lead in between rivals, then made a bid to duel for the lead on the turn, then when roused past the three sixteenths pole,
drew off to prove much the best. JOVA vied for the early lead on the inside, then was rated back, eased out five wide leaving the quarter pole to make a bid,
rallied well to get the place while no threat to the winner. WHOLELOTACHOCOLATE vied for the early lead four wide, then dueled for the lead three wide
with the winner, faded in the drive losing the place award late. FLATTER HYMN chased the early pace and came into the stretch four wide but lacked the
needed stretch bid. OPERATION STEVIE was void of early speed on the inside, angled out in the stretch to have a belated rally. MUSIC TO MY EARS vied
for the early lead five wide then weakened. YOU GO BOY vied for the early lead in between rivals then weakened. TWO LAST WORDS failed to menace.
FLOWERPECKER chased the early pace then tired. LITTLE KANSAS bobbled slightly at the start, not a threat. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all
