Footnotes
RB LARA disputed the pace on the outside, drew off on the turn, responded well under the whip in the stretch and proved much the best under steady
urging. CREAMOFTHECREAM MHF was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and narrowly
got up for the place. RB GAME OVER bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, moved up under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn
and proved no match for the winner then just lost the place. WMA HOPE bumped hard with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the back, swung six
wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KD DERBY GIRL moved in while urged along, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path
and failed to rally. DJUDJU SEQ bumped hard with rivals on both sides at the start, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor. RB DJUSTA
BLASTT chased the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four wide on the turn and tired. RISKY VAZ was ridden along well off the pace and
failed to respond. RB WHISTLIN DIXIE chased the pace, dropped back near the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn and faltered. BIG PURITY broke
out at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of the winner, dropped back on the turn and capitulated. MY CHARADE broke out and bumped hard with a
rival, raced at the rear, rounded the turn in the two path and was no factor. WISECRACKER MHF broke in then bumped with a rival and was last away,
moved up under urging, dropped back while saving ground on the turn and retreated. FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE AND FINAL TIME WAS
