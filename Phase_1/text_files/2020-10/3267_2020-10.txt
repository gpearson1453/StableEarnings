Footnotes
MAGI, in touch between foes in the opening stages, shifted three deep on the backstretch tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance and made
a steady advance to edge CRANKSHAFT in time under firm handling. The latter angled inwards while being urged to a clear advantage along the inside
racing into the bend, set the pace past midstretch but was collared nearing the wire. STOSH settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders, swung five
wide racing into the lane and made some belated progress. MAJOR BIZKIT tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, split foes just off the inside in late
stages and continued with an even effort. IDAHO TORNADO, reserved early while angling to the inside, continued evenly. WELLFIELD, held up off rivals
just after the break, angled inside while settling in the last flight and failed to menace. FREAKIN JOE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight,
faded in the drive, then was vanned off after the race. TSALI, urged to a forward placing along the rail, was used up early. FINISH MARGINS WERE
PROVIDED BY EQUIBASE.

Footnotes
BEAR TRAPPE, in touch between rivals in the first flight racing to the first turn, was eased off the leaders in the second furlong to track those rivals under
light rating, shifted three wide on the far turn advancing on the leaders, wrested the advantage racing into upper stretch and drove clear.
WORKINGFORALIVING, urged to dispute the pace while angling to the inside prompting the pace, lost some ground to the leaders nearing the lane, shifted
out racing through the stretch and continued willingly while only second best. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted out
four wide on the far turn and continued in that path to gain some position. BEHIND ENEMY LINES, off slowly, was settled inside early, swung out five wide
nearing upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. DIAMOND DAVE tracked off the first flight outside foes and steadily faded into the far turn. SEBA'S
DANCER, urged three deep prompting the pace into the first turn, pressed the issue outside a rival, then between foes into the far turn and gave way.
TABADDOL proved no threat.

Footnotes
UPHAM angled inwards to track off the first flight between rivals into the backstretch, split foes racing into upper stretch to challenge for command and went
clear under some right handed pressure. AGAVE KID broke sharply, was urged along the rail setting the pace on a narrow margin, briefly resisted the
winner but came up second best. HIGH SPIRITS tracked off the first flight along the inside, saved ground to the lane and edged a rival for a share. SEMI
CHARMED DAY tracked off the second flight while shifting outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced four wide on the far turn to upper stretch
gaining striking distance but had no final kick. DRIVER DAN, caught three, then four wide racing to the backstretch tracking the leaders in second flight,
continued three deep between foes into the far turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly. FOGGY ALBION, reserved off the
second flight while angling inside, continued evenly. A SHEEN CAT was settled outside foes to the backstretch and passed some tiring rivals. PHARAOH'S
KITTEN settled last to the backstretch and never menaced. MIDNIGHT LEWIS settled near the inside, switched out entering the far turn and was fanned six
wide into the lane while no threat. FAST ONE switched outside the leader early prompting the pace, pressed the issue to the far turn and gave way.
RECKLESSNESS, caught five wide racing through the first turn, dropped out early. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN flashed brief pace between foes but emptied
out early.

Footnotes
LAWLESSNESS was settled off the second flight racing three deep between foes through the backstretch, swung out to the five path entering upper stretch
gathering momentum and produced a solid late response to wear down the leader and go clear in time under pressure. COMMANDEER settled along the
rail dropping well off the leaders to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, then found his best stride in belated effort to advance inside foes wresting the
place honors in time. TIGHTROPE sprinted clear of the field while angling over, held sway on a clear margin past midstretch but failed to sustain that
momentum. WISE KHOZAN switched out avoiding traffic to track the leader outside foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, continued three
deep into the lane, then ducked in late making some contact with THAT KHENNY while continuing to gain some position. THAT KENNY swerved out just
after the start bumping HAVE A NOTION, was righted to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight to the turn, then was bumped in late stages while
fading. MKAR THE FAST, caught in close quarters just after the start, angled inside tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight and faded into the
stretch. TWO COOKIE RULE settled off the second flight four wide through the backstretch, continued wide to the lane and offered no rally. HAVE A
NOTION, bumped just after the start start, dropped back early. LEGSLIKEBAE proved no factor.

Footnotes
SISTER RULER broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and edged forward midstretch under firm
right handed pressure. WHITE LIES was settled well off the leaders while angling to the inside, gradually drew into contention saving ground on the turn,
shifted out midstretch to split foes three deep and continued with a steady effort to gain the place honors. PALAGO, bumped at the start, was held up
collecting her stride, settled outside rivals in the last flight racing to the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position to
the end. GET NONE gained terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival between foes racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue outside the
eventual winner to upper stretch and gave way. PRANCIPANTS, in touch with the first flight four wide attending the pace racing to the turn, faded into upper
stretch. LOVINHERWASEASY, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace racing to the turn, gave way into the lane. TAP'S LULLABY ducked out
at the start bumping PALAGO, was settled in the last flight between foes and never menaced thereafter. RACETOTHEFINISH WAS SCRATCHED AT THE
GATE ON THE ADVICE OF THE STATE VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
SERTOMAN broke inwards bumping GALAHAD KID at the start, was collected to gain a forward placing three deep stalking just off the first flight to the
backstretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge in that path racing into upper stretch and prevailed under firm handling in a long drive. HINTON was
urged to the lead outside a rival racing into the first turn, angled to the rail racing into the backstretch once gaining a clear advantage, dueled for command
inside a rival into the far turn, dispatched that foe then grudgingly resisted the winner racing through the stretch but proved only second best. SIRCORRI,
urged along the inside prompting the pace in the opening stages, switched outside a rival while continuing to prompt the pace racing into the backstretch,
pressed the issue through the far turn to upper stretch but weakened late. RICH E Z tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn and
continued evenly into the stretch. ALPHA BOY exchanged bumps with JOLLY GHAALY at the start, was rated off the second flight near the inside in the
opening half, angled out three wide racing into the far turn and continued in that path gaining position in an even effort. PISTOL BOX settled along the rail,
saved ground throughout but never gained contention. SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was
shuffled avoiding some traffic racing into upper stretch and proved no threat. GALAHAD KID, bumped at the start, settled outside foes in the last flight racing
to the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. JOLLY GHAALY exchanged bumps at the start, was righted to track the leaders outside a rival in second
flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded nearing the lane. Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
FULL OF GRACE was rated off the first flight while angling to the rail racing through the backstretch, saved ground on the bend, then came through inside
the leader to challenge for command midstretch and went clear late under brisk handling. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR was rated dropping off the leaders while
angling to the rail in the opening stages, conceded some position into the turn, shifted off the inside racing through upper stretch and split foes late to prevail
for the place honors. SHE'S DIVINE was urged along the rail disputing the pace inside foes into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage between
calls shifting off the rail in upper stretch, briefly resisted the winner but weakened late. TIZ SUSAN ANN, urged between foes pressing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, weakened in late stages. GHAALEB'S MAGIC, in touch with the leaders three wide between foes in the opening stages, lost some
ground to the leaders leaving the turn, then angled four wide late while finishing evenly. SCARLET POSITION, forwardly placed four wide racing through the
backstretch, faded early. POINT STREAK hopped at the start, was settled last and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
MY FOUROONE KPLAN broke sharply, sprinted well clear of the field along the rail racing into the turn, held sway on a safe margin past midstretch and just
held EDISTO ISLAND at the wire under brisk right handed pressure. The latter was rated off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, angled
out four wide racing through the stretch and found her best stride late to just miss. HAL'S MISCHIEF, forwardly placed three deep between foes tracking the
pacesetter as part of the second flight, shifted inwards racing into the lane and continued with interest to prevail for a share. LADY EXPRESS settled off the
second flight racing four wide through the backstretch, angled six wide entering the lane and was making mild progress late. WOOD NOT MIND broke out
bumping at the start, was steadied out of close quarters, then settled last racing to the turn, shifted off the inside in upper stretch and split foes near the
inside in the closing stages to display some belated interest. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN settled off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, continued in
close quarters into the lane, then shifted five wide in the final stages while gaining some position. FIRST HOOSIER angled to the inside tracking the
pacesetter as part of the second flight racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. AMERICAN HOLIDAY tracked the leader four wide, then three deep
in second flight racing into the turn and faded into the stretch. TRYST CAT, held up avoiding close quarters in the opening stages, angled out five wide
racing into the turn while making some brief progress but came up empty in upper stretch. CAROL'S A CASE tracked the leader between foes in second
flight and retreated early.
