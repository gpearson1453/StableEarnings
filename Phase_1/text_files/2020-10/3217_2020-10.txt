Footnotes
SHOMETHESISTERS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, then made a steady gain and drew off the
final furlong under mild urging. SNOWY MORNING set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, came again in mid stretch, then was
no match for the winner the final furlong and held the place safe. MOMS LOVE tracked the pace, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four
wide into the lane and edged up for the show. ISLAND BETTY well placed and inside, gained a striking position through the turn, came through inside the
leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. ZIDIKAI well placed and outside, moved up three and four
wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT ZIP stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off late. WAPITI WAY never far back,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and edged up for the place. SAVE THE DRAMA tracked the pace, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out. BRAHMS BREEZE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on
when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. DEEP THINKER (IRE) broke a step slowly from the gate, saved ground through the
turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. NO CHOICE well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the
turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in the drive. GREELY IS BACK ran evenly. WILD WINTER improved position. STONE HEART mid pack,
looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, angled out and faded. LOVE SICK KITTEN steadily lost ground. PERPETRATOR was no
factor.

PLIANTLEA mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and drove clear. UNWANTED INPUT bore out through the first turn, shook clear through the second turn, drew off in the lane, then was no
match for the winner and held the place. SINISE allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, angled
out, made a steady gain and edged up for the show. INDIAN HEART allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide
into the lane, lugged in and missed the show. AUNT MARY allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and
weakened in the drive. TINDER DATE well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, angled in and bid on the two path, then
drifted in and faded in the lane. DELAWARE DESTINY set the pace pulling, faded through the second turn, then drifted out in the lane and was outrun.
JOYFUL PRAISE well placed and outside, faded into the second turn and lost contact.

Footnotes
KING ECLIPTICAL well placed and inside, moved up to gain a short lead through the turn, shook clear in the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task.
VALENTINE BUG well placed and outside, angled in to save ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
edged up for the place. CHARLIE CHARLIE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then
weakened late and held the show. SWEET N SILVER allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and
edged up for a share. GILGIMESH well placed and between, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, angled out, weakened and finished on equal terms with PURE SPRING. PURE SPRING well placed and three wide, lost some ground through the
turn, bid four wide into the lane, weakened the final furlong and finished on equal terms with GILGIMESH. I'M JUST LAUGHING passed tiring rivals. BEST
BUD was never involved. WHATDOISTANDFOR was a brief factor, outside. FOLTYNEWICZ set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged through
the turn, then had no rally.
