Footnotes
SWASHBUCKLE away in good order, secured the pocket slot, rated professionally tracking the pacesetter, was forced to idle along for a furlong beginning
from the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, lacking suitable options, got cued up after settling onto the top of the lane, espied a usable seam towards
path two in the furlong grounds, got eagerly maneuvered into it, was coming out slightly as DEVIOUS MO was at the same time coming in a bit, resulting in
solid contact between them a short distance from the sixteenth marker, recovered in short order and surged to the top a few jumps later, edged away.
VODKA LEMONADE cut over to the rail with the advantage, was put to the mildest of hand encouragement showing the way, tailed by DEVIOUS MO from
the outside, saw RUSE add himself to the pace scene by the half mile pole, successfully fended them off, went into the stretch and was switched over to
stronger handling, proved powerless once the winner was clear enough to launch his rally, surrendering inside the sixteenth pole, kept going well enough
long enough to save second. RUSE three wide on the clubhouse end, was still in the same path joining up with the front runners after the half had been
rattled, had the pilot hold something in reserve pressing the issue as the outermost of a trio during the run around turn two, was turned loose after the third
fraction had been finalized, brushed with DEVIOUS MO with approximately a sixteenth go, inched its way towards the second place finisher, missed the
place. DEVIOUS MO prompted the pace from the two path, going about the task from between rivals prior to the half mile pole, got set down for the drive
home, temporarily drifted into the three path during the opening phases of the stretch run, inadvertently opening up room for the eventual winner, was
inching to the rail as the top one was inching to the middle of the strip when the twosome bumped soundly a short distance from the sixteenth pole, bumped
much lighter with RUSE afterwards, never regained any real interest. HE'S A LUCKY DEVIL strung out three wide on the first turn, was one path wider on
the subsequent one and in upper stretch, made no headway. HUMPDAY broke a length the tardiest, was three wide on the first turn and in path four racing
on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, gained mildlly. ARROWHEART brushed at the start, saved ground for the opening six furlongs, slipped out
and was maneuvered into path four between the five-sixteenths marker and upper stretch, made no impact. COTTON three wide on both turns, came up
empty. BOHEMIAN RUBY took the inside route, got roused springing from the five-sixteenths marker, cut the corner and faltered. BE YOURSELF the last
one on the track was also the first one to leave the post parade and its pony, got pinched after lunging at the start, chased the pace two wide, came into the
stretch and failed to fire. MAMBONICK two wide in midpack, was put to a drive after three-quarters had been completed, gave way. MAGIC GRITS
underwent a two wide journey, commenced the stretch one path wider, had no response. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on SWASHBUCKLE and
DEVIOUS MO in the stretch, in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the trainer of the latter against the rider of the former alleging interference, the result
was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
BROOKLYN STRONG got guided into the three path on the backstretch, joined up with the front runners as the half was being completed, contended as the
widest of three from the top of the bend until its end, flashed interest as six furlongs was being reeled, settled in upper stretch and was given his cue,
whittled away at the deficit, wore down EAGLE ORB with a sixteenth to go and kicked clear. EAGLE ORB grabbed the advantage shortly after the field had
been sent off and running, cleared to the rail early on the backstretch, was being pressed by a pair of opponents from the outside on the turn, arrived at the
quarter pole and got called upon for more, left the eighth pole locked in an one on tussle with the top one, relinquished after putting up a fight for the next
sixteenth, stayed on well to salvage the place. BREADMAN forwardly placed three wide, scooted by LET'S WORKOUT and tucked into the two path at the
half mile pole, vied from between rivals from that station until midstretch before weakening into the show slot. HOLD THE SALSA pursued the pace from the
two path, came under a ride by the five-sixteenths pole, went into the stretch and was outfinished. MASKED MARAUDER three wide onto the turn, was sent
out into path four exiting it, lacked the necessary response. LET'S WORKOUT alternated between the inside route and the two path, stepped into the stretch
and gave way. BOSS BEAR taken hold after coming in at the start, darted into the two path, swung out four wide into the lane, never made his presence felt.

Footnotes
MYHARTBLONGSTODADY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way under rating along the inside through sensible splits settled into
a comfortable rhythm, remained patiently handled facing no pressure and was set down spinning just off the inside at the quarter pole, got guided out with
three-sixteenths to go to the five or six path to a lesser used portion of the course and kicked clear holding well to the finish to prevail. WAR CANOE saved
ground at the tail of the compact field, remained patiently handled until let out spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive splitting rivals
threading a seam a sixteenth from home, forcing SHORT POUR to be steadied out in tight and offered up a mild bid to just secure the place honors in the
final jumps while never threatening the winner. NIKO'S DREAM raced forwardly placed four then three wide under rating, got set down spinning three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the finish but was outfinished in the final strides. WEGETSDAMUNNYS tracked the pace along the
inside under rating until put to urging five-sixteenths from home, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under a drive keeping on to the wire but was
outfinished. PECATONICA three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, tipped four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the very late stages. SHORT POUR raced forwardly placed under a firm hold just off the inside in closest aim
of the leader, remained patiently handled until roused cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes and had WAR
CANOE split a narrow seam between her and NIKO'S DREAM a sixteenth out and was forced to pause and steady when weakening in tight between foes
at that station.

Footnotes
BIG TIME LADY got set up in the pocket, was well rated keeping an eye on the front runners, angled towards path two for entrance into the stretch, drafted
behind A LIFE THAT'S GOOD for a few strides before diving back on the inside route and onto a clear rail corridor at the three-sixteenths marker, gradually
worked her way to the ones to catch, slipped by a trio of opponents to her outside with approximately a sixteenth remaining and edged away. U SHOULD B
DANCING off the inside, briefly tucked into the two path at the top of the turn before swinging back into path three soon afterwards, was one path wider yet
challenging in earnest heading home, vied with vigour as the outermost of a threesome, saw the winner poke a head down in front in the general area of the
sixteenth pole, battled onward with good courage to garner the place. B C BELLE took up the chase from the two path, between rivals on the turn, fanned
out five wide from upper to midstretch, had a good finish down the center of the course, came up shy for second. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE away a bit
awkwardly after losing her footing springing from the gate, travelled three wide on the turn, got sent out into path six during the first half of the stretch run,
gained well. SASSY MELISSA rushed up into midpack, was then patiently ridden tracking the front runners, came under a ride prior to cutting the corner into
the lane, shifted to the outside until about three wide in midstretch, rallied mildly. A LIFE THAT'S GOOD cut over to the rail after having quickly established
control, was rated showing the way, accompanied by an equallty-rated CAUMSETT from the outside, came under intensified pressure late on the bend, was
asked for more in response, moved out towards path two stepping onto the top of the lane, gave in to extreme pressure during the ensuing furlong and
weakened. CAUMSETT prompted the pace from path two, rated until quarter pole, was turned loose turning into the stretch, vied from between foes until
around the sixteenth pole before backing away. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS hung out four wide on the turn, had no rally. NO PAYNE two wide in pursuit of the
pace, never made her presence felt. PRETTY CLEVER raced in the two path on the turn, got sent out six wide once in the turn, never got involved.
QUASHANA saved ground until the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, had no offering.

Footnotes
LUCKY MOVE three wide in pursuit from the tail of the field down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths and advancing on the front through the latter portion of the bend, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under an off sided stick and came
in to brush with MAKINGCENTS just after taking command near the eighth pole, then inched away under a drive to the finish. MRS. ORB five paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, ran on to
secure the place honors. MAKINGCENTS broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, and then broke through the gate a second time and
was taken back around and reloaded once more, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and
advanced to pressure through the latter portion of the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in heads apart for command and took a narrow and brief
lead at the three-sixteenths, got headed by the eventual winner and brushed by that rival nearing the eighth pole, then weakened in the very late stages
while knocking heads with RATAJKOWSKI to the finish and got the bob on the wire for the show honors. RATAJKOWSKI hustled from the gate, showed the
way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn and remained patiently handled as rivals began to apply pressure from the outside, came
under urging near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home clinging to the lead, got headed at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive weakening
in the late going while dueling to the finish with the aforementioned foe but lost the nod on the wire for the show honors. SINGULAR SENSATION coaxed
from the gate, led early on before being displaced from command by MAKINGCENTS just prior to RATAJKOWSKI taking over, chased four paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and offered no response. FOREVER CHANGED tossed her head at the start and got away last conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling
into stride, chased along the inside and was placed to coaxing five-sixteenths out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CRITICAL VALUE
chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, tipped out six wide for home and was
unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
TRIBECCA retained the advantage after narrowly out-breaking the competition, got set up from just off the rail, showed the way lightly hand urged and with
ARTHUR'S HOPE in attendance two to three wide, was leaving the three-sixteenths pole when finally asked for his best, responded and steadily drew clear.
BIG ENGINE darted over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, continued on it from the top of the turn to its end, cut the corner, proved
no match en route to procuring the place. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC put to a brisk hand ride out of the gate, had to settle for a spot in midpack, pursued the
front runners from path two on the turn, got called upon as the half was being rattled off, angled four wide into the lane, straightened away and was along for
the show. ARTHUR'S HOPE sparred with the winner two to three wide, was more the latter spinning into the lane, kept pace a little while longer before
backing away. DUGOUT hung out three to four wide on the turn, the widest of all, got sent out into path six from upper to midstretch, venturing onward as
the widest of all, tired. MORNING BREEZ stepped onto the turn from the three path, got steered over into the five path exiting it, was never a menace.

furlongs to run and tucked three wide shaking away safely in front before making his way to the two path with nine-sixteenths remaining, remained patiently
handled through the far turn until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and edged
clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish kept busy to the end. THERAPIST settled unhurried just off the inside near the rear of
the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun along the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on willingly to close the gap
on the aforementioned foe while along clear for the place honors. CROSS BORDER three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DOT MATRIX coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in pursuit from just off
the pace, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SANCTUARY CITY two to three wide
at the tail of the field, remained patiently handled until let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. RINALDI led early on and was

steadily shaken off tracking that rival in closest aim two then three wide down the backstretch, remained two to three wide through the far turn and came

Footnotes
COLLEGEVILLE GIRL darted over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, brought up the back of the pack one-paced, began to get taken
to the outside as the half was being completed, got sent out wider and wider for clearance until in the neighborhood of path seven with a furlong to go,
kicked into her best shortly afterwards, overhauled a pair of opponents to her inside in the final strides to prove best. PRAIRIE FIRE loped along in the two
path during the opening phases, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, gained ground on the ones to catch in a steadfast manner, saw
TIMELY TRADITION shift a bit wider in deep stretch after some left side pressure, mustered up a solid burst of speed along the freshly-created open three
path corridor to snatch away second. TIMELY TRADITION took up residence in the three path after the start, departed the backstretch and went on to
contest the pace as the outermost of a threesome, was still at it when turned loose in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, emerged a sixteenth down
the road as the clear leader, dug in with good determination as fresh challengers advanced towards her, crossed over into path four in deep stretch after left
side stick work, saw COLLEGEVILLE GIRL move by a few strides later, and then PRAIRIE FIRE steal away the place. OFFICER HUTCHY rated in the
pocket, finished off the last stages of the run around the bend lightly hand urged, angled four wide into the stretch, failed to make headway. ESPRESSO
SHOT took up the chase four wide on the turn fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, rallied mildly. FAIR REGIS kept watch on the front runners
two wide in midpack, swung five wide into the lane, had ho offering during the ensuing furlong then ventured onward not being asked for her best.
BERTRANDA sparred for command from path two in between foes from the top of the turn until midstretch, gave way. SPIN A YARN went over to the rail
with the advantage, felt pressure from a pair of foes from her outside after stepping onto the turn, was roused for the drive, gave in midstretch and faltered.
NEWLY MINTED saved ground to no avail. MY ROXY GIRL parked out four wide, was through after going a half.

Footnotes
MR. BUFF coaxed from the gate, advanced just after the start to tussle with SEA FOAM to his outside before taking over the front with seven and a half
furlongs to run, steadily shook away to a safe lead in hand along the inside settling into a comfortable rhythm through moderate splits, remained patiently
handled while given a notch to work with nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away and edged clear
under a drive drifting out slightly before being straightened away inside the sixteenth marker and was kept to task. BANKIT settled just off the inside near the
rear of the field, tucked inside five furlongs from home, remained patiently handled along the rail through the far turn until placed to coaxing nearing the
quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest for the place
honors. SEA FOAM coaxed from the gate, showed the way early on before being engaged by MR. BUFF to the inside and briefly tussled with that rival
before conceding command seven and a half furlongs from home, tracked that foe in closest aim three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive weakening in the late stages while knocking heads with FUNNY GUY to the finish and
bested that rival to secure the show honors. FUNNY GUY bobbled at the break, chased along the inside early on before tipping to track the front from the
two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going while dueling to the finish with the
aforementioned foe and was bested on the wire for the show honors. WINSTON'S CHANCE four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came
under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. CHESTERTOWN broke out at the start and was corrected,
settled unhurried two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and
was unable to make an impact. EVALUATOR three to four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing nearing the three-eighths, faded
through the latter portion of the turn, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, tired and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
STEELERSFANFORLIFE nudged to the outside while being bumped at the start, sneaked into the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch,
kept watch on the front runners within striking distance, angled three wide into the lane, straightened away having attained good racing clearance and
launched his rally, narrowed in on the ones to catch, split rivals in midstretch to grab away the advantage, then edged clear. BAD GUY off a bit slowly,
departed the backstretch from the two path, tipped into path three for entrance into the stretch, idled along behind a plethora of rivals from upper stretch to
around the sixteenth pole, altered over to the rail at that station, gaining running room, responded when given his to rally for the place. ON THE COUCH
broke open the gate, was well-behaved and well-held and didn't run off, proceeded to come away without apparent mishap, got guided over to the rail
nearing the half mile pole, tracked the pace from midpack, swung all the way into path six from upper to midstretch, finished with some willingness down the
center of the course to earn the show. BIG WONDER moved into the three path, was the outermost of three vying for command for much of the contest,
was making his way through the furlong grounds when asked for more, left the eighth pole, clinging to a narrow advantage but with a host in hot pursuit,
yielded to the top one a little beyond the furlong marker, held on reasonably well for the last major check. THREE OUTLAWS took up the chase from the
two path, angled five wide into the lane, put in a bid for the next furlong then flattened out. JO'S BOLD CAT two to three wide on the turn, was four to five
wide rallying mildly down the stretch. ADVANCED STRATEGY underwent a three wide journey, lacked the needed response. IMPAZIBLE ODDS pursued
the pace three wide on the turn, was moved out into path seven in the stretch, made no impact,. UNCLE GEORGE sluggish after striking the left side of the
gate, cut over to the rail, failed to menace off the ground-saving journey that followed. SMITE bumped from both sides at the start, went on to dispute the
pace two wide from between rivals for a majority of the trip leading up the quarter pole, folded. FALSE ALARM out sharply, bumped with its next stall
neighbor, assumed a forward position, argued for the top from along the rail, matched up with a pair of foes to the outside and while pulling a bit on the left,
got overhauled leaving the five-sixteenths pole and faltered. GENERALONAMISSION two wide onto the turn, got sent four wide exiting it, backed away.
