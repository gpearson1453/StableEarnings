Footnotes
DILETTANTE maintained a short lead into the turn, continued under pressure through the turn while racing near the inside, shook clear into the lane, was
joined by the runner-up just inside the eighth pole, appeared to be on almost even terms inside the sixteenth pole then dug in gamely to stay. LIBERTARIAN
chased the pace three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four path with momentum, moved to near even terms with the winner in deep
stretch but could not finish the deal while well clear for the place spot. TALE OF FAME settled off the pace into the turn, chased the top ones through the
turn while in the two path, swung into the four path for the drive and finished evenly. ELZABE'S ON BOARD pressed the winner two wide through late turn
then weakened. TWIN FARMS raced on the inside through the turn and tired through the final eighth.

Footnotes
SUDDEN SHIFT pressed the pace while two wide into the far turn, asked for more approaching the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared into the lane
widened under a drive, continued under alternating left and right handed urging to near the sixteenth pole then geared down from there. ROYAL ICING
settled back off the pace near the five-eighths pole, raced in the two path through the turn while chasing the pacesetters, asked for more into the lane then
could only gain the place spot while well back of the top one. HENRY RULES set the pace while under pressure into the far turn, could not go with the
winner entering the lane and was no match for the place rival. BOOK OF ROMEO was never a menace while racing near the rail through the turn. ALIAS
REX was along the inside through the turn, came off the rail into the lane and moved up while never a threat. HE'S NAUGHTY was in the two path through
the turns and never was a factor. UNCLE ROY chased the pace from the two or three path and was empty turning into the lane. FORSBERG was far back
entering the far turn, continued to lost ground mid-stretch and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
PREPARE FOR GLORY chased the pace from the two path through the turn, came into the lane with a clear run, was on near even terms with an eighth to
go, dueled with the runner-up through the final furlong and just inched up. SENT FOR HIS GLORY was in the three or four path through the turn, bid into the
lane while four wide, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, dueled with the winner the final eighth and could not hold sway while clearly second best.
ALTERNATE NIGHTS was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the show spot while not a
threat to the top two. FOREVER A CHAMP stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three or four path then
weakened. JINGLE was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. AIR TEMPLE hustled early to establish a position early, continued near the
rail through the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and had nothing to give. TRUCKIN' ON set the pace while along the inside through the turn and into the
lane then gave way.

Footnotes
HIGHER AUTHORITY was never far back while in the two path, bid two wide in late turn, gained the lead into the lane, cleared outside the eighth pole then
was kept to the task to hold. MINE OWN STAR was well back while saving ground, was asked for more near the three-eighths pole, gained momentum into
the lane and finished willingly while along the inside. DEVIL'S RULE chased the pace from the three path, bid into the lane from the five path, moved closest
to the winner outside the eighth pole then flattened late. TAPAGE was along the inside through the turns, angled into the five path for the drive and never
was a serious threat while evenly through the lane. STILTS pressed the pace from the three path down the backstretch, took over entering the far turn, set
the pace through the turn while being put under pressure then gave way entering the lane. MAJESTIC JOHN'S was in the two path through the turns and
tired. THE HUMONGOUS ONE was in the three path through the far turn and was empty turning into the lane. SUMMER BEACH set the pace then vied for
the lead down the backstretch and suddenly was done entering the far turn.

Footnotes
LUNA FORTIS hesitated and hit the gate, stalked in the three path, angled inside at the quarter pole, rallied and was clear late under steady urging.
KIMBERLEY DREAM stalked in the four path, rallied la the but couldn't gate to the winner. THE BEAUTY'S TALE stalked in the three path, bid inside at the
three-eighths pole and faltered late. NATIVE LION pressed outside of the winner, bid at the three-eighths pole, vied through the stretch but faltered late.
APPEALING WAY was not a factor. LADY JENNEVIERE was clear early in the two path, then gave way after a half mile.
