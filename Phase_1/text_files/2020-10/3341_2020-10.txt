Footnotes
HOT PEPPER SUZIE prompted the pacesetter through the backstretch while just inside that rival, conceded some position on the turn while switching
outside that foe, continued with a steady bid to wrest command leaving the furlong marker under right handed pressure and was taken in hand once the
issue was decided. SHE'S HONORABLE, urged to the lead a bit off the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin, shook clear racing into the turn, resisted
the winner's challenge past midstretch but proved only second best. CLASSOFSIXTYNINE was carried out by MARY'S A JEM while breaking crossing into
the path of UNBURNT, tracked off the first flight three deep racing into the turn, shifted four wide nearing upper stretch and improved position to the end.
UNBURNT hopped, then was knocked back at the start, settled between foes, split rivals just off the inside nearing upper stretch and continued evenly along
the inside late. RENOVATION tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and faded entering the stretch. APRIL'S GEM, bumped at
the start, was settled widest on the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals. TALLY UP tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter and
came up empty racing into the turn. MARY'S A JEM broke outwards bumping rivals, was settled between foes in the last flight and failed to menace
thereafter. PROMISES KEPT, urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the turn, gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
WINDY CITY GIRL angled to the inside tracking off the second flight under light reserve to the backstretch, shifted out on the far turn, split foes nearing
upper stretch to bid three deep entering the lane, shifted inwards once gaining the advantage and maintained a clear advantage under firm encouragement.
U. S. CURRENCY sped to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, pulled a bit against restraint dictating the pace on a narrow advantage,
dueled for command inside foes into the lane and continued grudgingly between foes late to prevail for the place honors. HERECITYKITTY tracked just off
the pacesetter along the inside in the opening half, briefly awaited an opening racing into upper stretch, altered course racing through the lane while finding
a seam along the inside late and was just outkicked for second. MELISSANI, reserved while angling inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance shifting off the inside leaving the far turn, angled four wide midstretch and was just outfinished for a share. SEVEN SEVENTEEN settled last along
the inside to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, angled out racing into the lane and altered five wide in the closing stages avoiding some
traffic late. SENSE OF SELF, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn to upper stretch and gave way
late. BIG LUCK settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. SUMMER EXPRESS settled outside foes in the last
flight racing to the backstretch and faded early. GOLDEN TAP tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch
and emptied out in late stages.

TRIPLE SCOUT, forwardly placed three deep between foes tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, shifted in on the turn while making steady
progress to challenge the leader racing into the lane, gained a narrow advantage midstretch and just held WINNING QUALITY to the end under firm left
handed pressure. The latter tracked the pacesetter four wide in the opening quarter, steadily gained on the leaders three wide racing into upper stretch,
moved to terms with the winner late but was just outkicked. FOGGY FLIGHT broke sharply, angled nearer to the inside setting the pace on a clear margin
racing into the turn, briefly resisted the winner's bid but weakened in late stages. DUSTY MILLER tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the
turn, angled four wide entering the lane and continued evenly late. PROMISES FOREVER broke a bit awkwardly, was righted to track just off the pacesetter
along the inside racing into the turn but faded in late stages. LOUIE P was settled last along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out nearing the lane but
failed to menace.

Footnotes
HENRYS GIRL, forwardly placed four wide in the opening stages, stalked just off the first flight in that path racing to the turn, commenced a steady advance
nearing upper stretch to bid for command racing into the lane, shifted inwards once gaining the advantage and maintained a safe margin to the end under
firm handling. MUWAAN MAT, firmly rated off the second flight while angling to the inside leaving the backstretch, shifted three deep racing into upper
stretch to bid for command just outside the winner and continued willingly to close the gap. LAURA ATTACK, urged inside rivals disputing the pace through
the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command to upper stretch and weakened late. EQUALLY EVEN, bumped at the start, settled last along the inside in
the opening quarter, saved ground on the turn and continued with interest inside foes to gain some position. STOLEN GLANCE was settled near the inside
racing through the backstretch, swung out six wide in upper stretch but made no impression. COLUMBIA CLIPPER angled inside tracking off the second
flight and faded into the stretch. SUNDANCE CHICK, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper
stretch. SWAMP WITCH HADDY tracked off the first flight racing five wide to the turn and lacked a closing response. AFFIRMANCE broke outwards
bumping EQUALLY EVEN, was righted to press the pace three wide into the turn and was through after a half.

Footnotes
GOOD MONGOLIA, urged to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and grudgingly held CHLOBEE through
the stretch to the end under some left handed pressure and firm hand urging. The latter, forwardly placed along the inside, switched outside the winner
racing into the first turn attending that rival's pace under light rating, pressed the issue leaving the far turn into upper stretch challenging for command but
was just outkicked. NORTHERN ALLIANCE stalked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted
out three wide leaving midstretch and continued willingly to gain terms with the top pair nearing the wire. KINGSBURY DREAM settled outside foes in the
last flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild gain late. GLORY RIDE
brushed the gate at the start, was reserved while angling inside, saved ground to the far turn, then shifted just off the inside in the closing stages to gain
some position. TINDERELLA tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, shifted three deep nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid but proved
empty late. SAGE'S EPIPHANY settled between foes in the last flight, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch and passed inside some tiring rivals.
ANTALYA tracked off the second flight three wide between foes to the backstretch, was shuffled, then steadied out of close quarters racing past the three
furlong marker, angled five wide racing into the stretch and offered no rally. SAPPHIRE JUBILEE worked her way to the inside early dropping well off the
second flight, shifted out racing into upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. LIL BIT TIPSEY was rated off the second flight inside rivals racing to the far
turn but lacked a closing response. PEPPERMINT ICE tracked off the second flight along the inside, then between foes racing to the second bend but faded
early. BANG tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch and retreated early.

RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH, bumped at the start by POLLY WAR CRY, shied outwards crossing in front of APPLE VALLEY while making solid contact with
DIAMOND STELLAR, was quickly righted to press the issue outside a rival, then between foes through the turn, shifted out racing into the stretch while
continuing in an extended skirmish with WAR COLORS but responded to brisk handling to go clear late. WAR COLORS, carried out avoiding close quarters
at the start, tracked just off the leaders five wide, then four wide through the backstretch, advanced three deep racing into the bend to press the issue into
upper stretch, was floated out entering the lane, couldn't match the winner in the closing stages but continued with interest to hold a rival for the place
honors. RONAN, in touch with the leaders nearest the inside in the opening sixteenth, was settled off the first flight along the inside racing into the bend,
shifted out to split foes racing into upper stretch, angled to the rail in the closing stages and just missed for second. POLLY WAR CRY broke outwards
bumping the eventual winner, was righted to dispute the pace while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, dueled for command into the turn,
was taken up while appearing to drift out racing past the quarter mile marker and had no further response. CESSO switched off the inside to track off the
first flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted out avoiding POLLY WAR CRY to race four wide into upper stretch and had no rally. DIAMOND
STELLAR, bumped by the eventual winner at the start, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the turn and steadily faded into the lane. APPLE
VALLEY, shut off at the start, was settled last while angling to the inside, saved ground throughout but proved no threat. MIA MONEY WAS A LATE

Footnotes
HONEST TO GOODNESS was rated just off the first flight along the inside, steadily advanced to striking distance nearing upper stretch, switched outside
the leader racing into upper stretch, continued in a prolonged drive to late stages while striking the front between calls but finished on even terms with
BETWITHBOTHHANDS at the wire. The latter broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside, dispatched some rivals nearing upper
stretch, shifted out racing through the lane grudgingly resisting and finished on even terms to share the win. AND WON settled near the inside racing to the
first turn, angled out five wide racing into the lane and found his best stride late to close the gap. BATTLE CREEK settled outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, angled off the inside to split foes racing through the stretch and continued with interest to gain position. WAR
CHEST tracked off the second flight racing to the backstretch, split foes three wide racing into the lane and continued with interest to gain some position. A
P IS LOOSE tracked off the first flight outside foes, lodged a brief, three wide bid on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. PRINCE ARLO tracked off
the second flight along the inside and faded into the stretch. CUESTION DE TIEMPO, urged prompting a rival's pace between foes racing to the far turn,
gave way nearing the lane. P H FACTOR, urged to a forward placing three wide racing to the backstretch, gave way racing through the far turn.

Footnotes
OIL MONEY came out in the opening strides and bumped GITA'S LAD, briefly disputed the pace outside of RED HOT DEVIL, edged clear past the five
eighths, set the pace on the turn, was pushed along into the stretch, maintained the lead, turned back IMPRESSED in the final sixteenth under a hand ride.
IMPRESSED settled midpack, chased the leading trio in the three path on the turn, was driven inside of RED HOT DEVIL in upper stretch, loomed inside of
OIL MONEY past midstretch, but proved no match in the final sixteenth. GITA'S LAD was bumped by OIL MONEY in the opening strides, chased the
leading pair, offered a three wide bid into the turn, continued in range three wide around the bend, was driven three wide into the lane, and chased on
evenly. ARCHIEMYBOY settled in second last, continued in second last in the two to three path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch, but lacked the
needed kick. RED HOT DEVIL disputed the pace inside of OIL MONEY in the opening furlong, tracked the pace after that foe edged away past the five
eighths, switched two wide near the half, was pushed along between horses on the turn, proved no match for the pacesetter under a drive in the lane and
weakened. BULLDOG OF BERGEN settled at the rear, trailed in the three to four path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch, and offered no response.
