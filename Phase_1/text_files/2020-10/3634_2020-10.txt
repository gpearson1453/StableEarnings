CHEERLEADER BARB broke slowly, raced well back two wide for a half-mile, and rallied mildly. BEAUTY GENIUS bumped with YOU NEVER CALL at the
start, prompted the pace outside APPOINTED to the stretch, and weakened. BROADWAY DIVA bumped with SUPERIOR DRAMA at the start, shifted out
bumping REALLYGOODTIMES into the first turn, steadied later on the same bend, moved out widest for the drive and failed to menace. CASH UP FRONT
was forwardly placed three wide to the head of the stretch, and tired. PEDESTAL became rank checking, steadying and getting out into the first turn, and
was empty when roused. SUPERIOR DRAMA bumped with BROADWAY DIVA at the start, and tired inside. REALLYGOODTIMES got bumped by
BROADWAY DIVA into the first turn, raced wide and tired. IRON ON FIRE lagged far behind for a half-mile, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
MIGHTY FAST set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and widened under a drive. OLD MAIN raced off the pace four wide, advanced four
deep around the far turn and was along for the place. IMPERIAL GREATNESS pressed the winner two wide to upper stretch, weakened and held third.
VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ raced three wide in midpack around the first turn, went two wide between rivals around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper
stretch and lacked the needed rally. MAJORITY RULES was perched three wide in range, came under the whip nearing the far turn and had no response.
PACHANGA PATROL played no factor while racing three wide. SKYLINE VIEW broke through the starting gate while always in the hand of the assistant
starter then was outrun while racing two and three wide. CASTILLETE chased the pace from the rail and retreated around the far turn.

Footnotes
SASSY BUT SMART prompted the pace outside CHURCHILLS VICTORY, took over after six furlongs, moved clear into the stretch, and had enough to hold
on. TIL THE END saved ground outrun early, began getting in gear approaching the stretch, shifted out and finished strongly. DOMINATE THEMOMENT
saved ground in easy striking range early, was guided out three wide with aim at the leaders turning for home, and got outkicked. MONY was no threat from
the two-path. CHURCHILLS VICTORY set the pace inside, yielded to the winner nearing the quarter-pole, and tired. TOTONO was no factor while four wide
most of the way. EL PILLO tired three wide after six furlongs.

TO A T prompted the pace three wide, seized command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. PLAYERA stalked the pace from the rail,
continued on the left lead in the lane and finished willingly inside of rivals. UNCAPTURED HEART set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole,
battled on between rivals in the final furlong but was outfinished. TAYLER'S CHROME went evenly while racing four wide. TERRY'S DREAM failed to
menace while racing five wide. PINE LEAF played no factor while racing two and three wide. DOITTOGETHER was outrun inside. FLYING BLACK steadily
faded while racing four and five wide.

Footnotes
THE GREAT KATH set a pressured early pace inside, shook off DISTINCTLY BLUE into the stretch, and remained clear under pressure. DISTINCTLY
BLUE pressed THE GREAT KATH from outside to the stretch, stayed on her left lead and held the place. WAR STAR bumped with TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT at
the start, raced close up inside to the lane, and was one-paced on the rail through the late stages. DADDY'S JOY raced two to three wide, and was no
threat through an even effort. MO ME MO MY bumped with MAJESTIC MAIARA at the start. was outrun two wide for three-eighths of a mile, and improved
past tired horses. GOT GLEE settled in striking range early, but lacked the needed closing response three wide. BRAMBLE BERRY saved ground to no
avail. MAJESTIC MAIARA bumped with MO ME MO MY at the start, and was outrun inside. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT took the worst of a bump with WAR
STAR and was slowest to begin, raced three to four wide and was never prominent.

ABILENE TRAIL stalked the pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, seized command in upper stretch, dueled inside of foes through the lane and
prevailed. COZY CAFE was sluggish at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, bumped SHEDANCESFORFATE entering the turn, angled three
wide nearing the three-eighths pole, made a quick bid around the turn, reached near even terms in upper stretch, battled through the lane outside of foes
and just missed. GOODBYE GABY pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, vied between the top two finishers in the lane
and yielded in deep stretch. RASPBERRY BALLET raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide nearing the lane, made some progress in upper stretch
then flattened out. SHEDANCESFORFATE chased the pace two wide, was bumped entering the turn, raced three wide around most of the bend, angled
wider turning for home and came up empty. SASSY CAT set the pace in the two path and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
SANCOCHO (MEX) vied for command inside RED FOG early, edged away turning for home, and stayed in command under a drive. TONS OF GOLD broke
slowly, saved ground to the far turn, shifted out three wide near the quarter-pole, could not menace the winner and was up late for the place. RED FOG
broke alertly despite bobbling slightly, went up outside SANCOCHO to contest the pace leaving the first turn, battled head and head to the end of the far
turn, could not match strides after straightening away for the drive, and was worn down for second. WICKED TEMPTATIONS stayed close near the
three-path for six furlongs, and gave way into the stretch. ST JOE VIPER raced three to four wide around the first turn, and tired before reaching the stretch.
SHANGHAI MOON broke slowly, stayed close to the far turn, moved inside and faded steadily.

Footnotes
SUPER EDGAR pressed the pace three wide, seized command near the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. EL SOLITARIO stalked the pace inside,
angled three wide nearing the lane and finished willingly to gain the place. SWEET GIANT raced off the pace along the rail and was along for the show.
PUERTO VARAS was reluctant to load, broke sharply, set the pace in the two path under pressure from the winner and tired in the final furlong. KING
ANDRES failed to menace while racing two and three wide. NOBLE NEBRASKAN chased the pace three wide and faded after a half. SMARTY J AND B
played no factor while racing two wide early and saving ground around the far turn. ULTRACONFIDENT was outrun while racing four wide.
