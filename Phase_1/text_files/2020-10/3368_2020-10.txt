Footnotes
OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN forwardly placed, responded on the far turn and edged clear in the stretch. PISTOL PACKIN MAN bumped at the start, was
reserved, commenced a bid on the far turn and rallied while five wide in the stretch. LITE SWITCH outpaced early, advanced on the far turn and finished
well while four wide in the stretch. READY OR NOT unruly behind the starting gate, gained the early lead, was headed on the far turn and gave way.
BEACHHEAD chased while four wide and lacked a rally. FOURDANGSHORE failed to threaten. BLAME IT ON JR saved ground and offered no response
when asked. FLAT OUT FREED was always outrun. GERDY'S BOY showed little.
