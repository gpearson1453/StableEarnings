Footnotes
I'M A DANCIN WHO was forwardly positioned heading up the backstretch, steadied from between rivals four wide entering the turn, continued to stalk in
behind, drove past late. DONNA WHO moved up inside rivals after the opening quarter to force the issue, dictated terms into the turn racing just off the rail
and inside rivals, lugged out in mid-stretch, was outkicked but saved the place. QUE PASA was bumped into a rival at the start, advanced inside up the
backstretch following encouragement, switched outside DONNA WHO in upper stretch, ran on but just missed second. FLAXY LADY chased mid-pack,
went in the three path through the turn, shifted in a bit in upper stretch and gained steadily inside. SHESA GOLDIGGER attended the pace from outside
after breaking outwardly just a bit, was four to five wide through the turn and still in contention, was brushed and steadied in upper stretch and could not kick
on. SPECIAL CAT set the early tempo, vied three wide and between rivals on the turn, came out and brushed a rival in upper stretch and weakened.
DELETERIOUS chased from mid-pack off the inside going in the five to six path on the turn, failed to rally. STORM SHAKER bumped the outer rival at the
start, steadied early as that foe shifted nearer the rail, was toward the rear on or just off the rail on the turn, failed to rally. A KISS FOR MOM was bumped at
the break, raced wide and in about the six path on the turn, came up empty. GO AUTUMN GO was well back and off the rail in the two to four path through
the turn, made no bids. SHOWTIME MAGIC soon dropped back to trail racing off the inside going in the five path on the turn, was tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
COUNT THEM AGAIN edged away heading up the backstretch to dictate terms on a clear lead, put to a drive in upper stretch and held sway.
MINDOFMYOWN tracked the leaders, steadied on heels while keen heading into the turn, continued two to three wide on the turn, found room between
runners in upper stretch and moved through to capture the place. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY settled off the leaders, came out a bit going in the two to three path
on the turn, shifted further to be seven wide by mid-stretch and rallied to gain show honors. PINK SKY chased from outside into the turn going five wide on
that bend, kept on evenly in the lane. SHUG'S BEST chased the pacesetter, went three wide on the turn, weakened some in the stretch. FLIGHT SONG
chased the leaders from inside, saved ground on the turn but was outkicked in the lane. OROGRANDE steadied slightly soon after the start as a rival moved
in front, went four to six wide on the turn, showed late interest. LET IT ROLL raced outside three to four wide on the turn and was not a factor. SEXY BIKINI
MODEL was well back in the two to three path on the turn and never a factor. TIME IS PRECIOUS chased briefly four wide, gave way after three-eighths
and faded. SHUGS CHARLIE failed to threaten racing inside on or just off the rail.

Footnotes
QUINCY EXPRESS chased in behind the leaders, tapped on brakes just slightly near the three-eighths, went three then four wide on the turn, got up late.
COMPETITIVE IDEA pressed from outside, went three then two wide on the turn taking command, was clear into mid-stretch but caught late.
CLAVICHORD was toward the rear early, steadily advanced outside foes five wide on the turn and continued to gain mildly in the stretch. HOLLYWOOD
HENRY vied between runners up the backstretch and into the turn, moved in a bit on that bend, had no late kick. MR PAYTIENCE moved forward inside to
contest the issue up front, dropped back on the turn, came out in upper stretch while continuing to weaken. NUMEROLOGIST exchanged a brush at the
break, shifted in, saved ground on the turn but failed to threaten. INDY MOON dropped far back in the early going, went four to five wide on the turn and
improved position in the stretch. TIVAN exchanged a brush at the break, raced mostly two to three wide on the turn and was empty in the lane. LAUNCH
LIGHT DREAM chased briefly while four wide into the turn, dropped back and faded.

early pace, went five wide, was no match and finished second best. NO PASA NADA stalked the early pace, from between rivals and was along for third.
KNUCKLE BALL was unhurried early, went seven wide and offered no rally. JET N G was taken back early from between rivals and never fired. MISTER
KOWEN raced in mid pack, went four wide and was empty. E J'S GOLD chased the early pace from the inside and faded. PULPITS FOX was never a
factor. MR. MOOCH pressed the early pace from off the rail and gave way.

Footnotes
SHIO was in just a bit tight at the break, tracked in behind the leaders off the inside, went four then five wide on the turn, struck the lead in upper- to
mid-stretch, drifted in a bit at that juncture brushing HUNTER ROCKS lightly then moved clear. HUNTER ROCKS tracked outside a foe in behind the
leading pair, went two then three wide on the turn, came out four wide leaving that bend, was brushed lightly in mid-stretch and second best.
CONFIDENTIALLY WHO vied inside a rival but off the rail in the two to three path, had no extra in the drive. NIGHT AT THE OPERA vied outside the
aforementioned going three to four wide and lacked the needed late kick. ZOMBIE ALAN shifted in early, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn and
ran on mildly. IMGOINOUTTONIGHT was outside rivals five to six wide on the turn, a couple paths wider into upper stretch and failed to menace. SMART
SPREE chased four to five wide, edged closer to strike a narrow brief lead at the head of the stretch then promptly gave way and faded. TOM T WHO raced
toward the rear, went four deep on the turn and came out six to seven wide turning for home, was never a threat. CONQUEST CROWN ME chased from
inside, came out leaving the turn and was empty for the drive. Following an objection by the rider of HUNTER ROCKS against SHIO alleging interference no
action was taken.
