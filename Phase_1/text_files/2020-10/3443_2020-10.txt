FLY AWAY rounded the opening turn in the three path and stalked to the three eighths, took the lead three deep and held well under steady handling.
CAPA BELLA rated well off the pace while three wide, drove four wide into closer contention, gained outside and got up for place. KENTUCKY ROLL rated
a slim lead from the two path then came under pressure at the three eighths pole and lacked the closing response needed. KISS ME CAPE sat in easy
striking position inside, lodged a bid at the five sixteenth and faded gradually inside. *TIMER MALFUNCTION- No fractional times due to a timer
malfunction.

KENSINGTON MARKET angled inside to rate a slim lead, took pressure through the far turn, responded to urging into the stretch and drew away. DOLLY
DAGGER saved ground along the rail, loomed boldly nearing the three sixteenth but was unable to stall the winner and improved to position in the final
furlong. NOTICE sat just off the pace while four wide, moved up closer prompting action at the five sixteenth and flattened out through stretch. LADY
RORSCHACH raced near the back of the pack and lacked a serious bid. THRILLOFTHECHASE fanned three wide through the opening turn, sat in striking
range outside and retired early. PHINALYWYN never reached contention.

HIDDEN GRACE took command quickly, responded willingly to looming threat from PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE, widened under one tap of the crop in upper
stretch and was kept to task. NU LEGACY trailed the field, gained closer order entering the lane then lodged a rail bid for place but was no match for winner.
PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE sat in striking position, could not keep pace with the eventual winner and have little left in reserve for the drive. GEM OF
INCEPTION broke alertly outside and tracked through the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the stretch and flattened out. IRISH LUNA unable to keep
pace with the field. MUSIC AT WORK rated off the pace inside, was asked to quicken through the final turn and wilted.

CASH REWARD stalked the pacesetters, drove four wide into the final turn then drifted in approaching the stretch, overtook the lead and drove clear under
steady handling. WATER WAGON went four wide leaving the opening turn, saved ground through the backstretch then was under coaxing along the rail,
lacked running room inside with a furlong remaining, swung out three wide and finished gamely. PLUM LUCKY prompted the pace from the three path,
moved up alongside ZUCCHINI to challenge the lead near the three eighths pole, had no response under heavy steady urging and held on for show.
COURTLY PLEASURE settled off the early and rallied belatedly. SMALL VICTORIES chased three wide and rallied four wide late. ZUCCHINI set a pressed
pace from just off the rail, took pressured through the far turn inside of PLUM LUCKY and gave way late stretch. NEVERADOUBT chased outside and
lacked a rally.

RAISE A DANCER set the pace in the two path and drove off under a drive. SHARP CONTRAST fractious in the gate, lost whip before the break, sat just off
the pace while three to four wide, was no match for RAISE A DANCER in the lane and finished second best. ASTARTOBE away well then chased three
wide leaving the backstretch and was unable to improve position through drive. HEY HEY RUN AWAY sat in range from the two path and raced evenly
through stretch. ROADSIDE KISSES trailed and passed tiring. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY chased throughout.

STRIDERS RING vied three wide for the early lead, saved ground through the far turn and held. BACKSTREET BOBBY settled mid pack, chased four to
five wide into the lane, was gaining late but was unable to stall the winner. CHASKA hustled inside, was impeded in the far turn then checked hard inside
and rallied belatedly. RACING RIVER chased outside, was bumped repeatedly then cut off by rider less horse leaving the backstretch, steadied through the
far turn and finished evenly. DEEP EXPLORER shifted out early to avoid loose horse, trailed through the final turn and bid late stretch. BE MY MACHO
MAN chased the leaders three wide, was impeded from between foes into the turn and faded. EXCITATIONS saved to no avail along the rail. HARD TO
COME HOME stumbled badly leaving the gate, losing the rider, did not finish and walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry
into the start of the race involving HARD TO COME HOME but made no change after review. HARD TO COME HOME stumbled losing rider. *TIMER- rider
less horse tripped timer for fractional times for the half, five eighths and finish. Race was hand-timed.

Footnotes
SOMETHING ABOUT ME contested the early pace from the two path, drew clear into the lane and widened under intermittent reminders. CARRAMIAMINE
vied inside, prompted the pace through the backstretch, chased in closest pursuit but was no match for the winner. BONITA RAPIDS reserved off the
pacesetters, gained closer order under encouragement and rallied inside for show. BABYLON WILL FALL raced in close quarters entering the opening turn,
settled in the three path, rallied three wide and improved late stretch. LA MER trailed entering the opening turn, chased four to five wide into the lane, drifted
in at the three sixteenth pole and flattened. STORM STRIDE raced four wide through the first turn, settled in striking range from the three path and had no
response when called upon. EYE CATCHING chased in second flight while four wide, bid three wide nearing three eighths marker and had nothing left in
reserve for the drive. HAIDA failed to threaten. MISS HESI raced wide into the opening turn and never reached contention. LYLA LORRAINE chased the
pacesetters through the backstretch and tired early.

Footnotes
ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER chased four wide, moved up closer racing three wide into the far turn, overtook the leader and held under a drive. DJANGO
UNREINED chased five wide through the backstretch, angled towards the rail leaving the backstretch, swung out into the lane, gained steadily outside but
was unable to stall the winner. POCKET DIAL hurried away, chased the early pacesetters from just off the rail, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and was no
real threat to the top two finishers. BIG ROCKET MAN tracked the pacesetters five wide, waited briefly at the head of the lane in traffic then lacked running
room, shifted out and rallied belatedly. YORKTOWN dueled inside under a strong hold, pressured the leader through the far turn and was unable to sustain
the bid that was needed in the stretch. DITES MOI allowed to settle outside early, went three wide into leaving the backstretch and offered a mild bid. POOR
RUBEN lagged early along the rail, gained closer contention at the quarter pole under coaxing and gave way. AWESOME HIT offered little. GAME READY
chased the pace while wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide into the far turn and tired with a furlong remaining. BLAZING CHANNING showed
little. MOON JUICE dueled for the early lead, was hounded through the far turn then reached the quarter pole and stopped. WHERE'S THE REWARD last
away and was always outrun. *MOON JUICE was reported by the Official Veterinarian as having bled.
