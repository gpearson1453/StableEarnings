EREBUNI showed speed, was challenged on the turn and easily cleared away from that foe at the top of the stretch under mostly hand urging. HOLY
DIVER raced off the rail from well off of the pace and had late run to garner second. PROMISED FAME chased off the flank of the winner, headed that one
on the turn but was easily put away and gave up the place spot late. QUEEN OF CORONA was always back and widest in the stretch.

GREAT SKY led easy into the first turn, was not asked until upper stretch, responded and drew away. DREAMMEISTER was unhurried in third to the turn,
ranged up close to the winner, was no match but came up second best. THE ACCUSER lightly prompted the winner from second to the stretch, faded late
but managed to hold third. LAFLOWMYLAXBRO was an unhurried last, never close but inherited fourth late. NATIVE CHIEFTAIN had an awkward start,
was within range to the far turn and made a steady fade.

Footnotes
CLAN CARA had an awkward start and void of speed to the half, began a run to the quarter pole and blew past tiring ones to go well clear in the final furlong
as tons the best today. BRILLIANT JOURNEY dueled to the half, took over in the stretch while outkicked in the final sixteenth while lugging in. JACK BE
NIMBLE dueled to the half, led at quarter pole but faltered badly through the drive. WITH IT WALTER improved a bit in the stretch while no real threat.
HAPPY DASH raced evenly while never a real menace. COLLECTTHEMONEY never a threat. DATS BODE outrun. FIFTY ONE NINETY stayed close for
three quarters but gave way readily. FRANK THE TANK once again lost best chance at the start while far back.

was a game second. DEANOS CAPE tracked from off the rail, was no match for the top pair and best of the rest. GRAN ROJO chased the duelers on the
turn but faded late. SONIC BURN came widest into the stretch and improved position late. EARLY ARRIVAL was mid pack and faltered down the stretch.
FILIMONS QUEST was bothered at the start and lost lengths, managed to get within range from off the rail but was empty after a quarter.
