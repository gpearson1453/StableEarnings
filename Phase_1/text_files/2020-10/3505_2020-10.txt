Footnotes
LUSCIOUS LOLA quickly took control inside, widened on the turn, drifted out through the stretch but lasted in a steady drive. OUR DIXIE BLUE stumbled at
the start, was in tight between rivals into the far turn, was blocked from the quarter pole into the stretch, angled out to secure room and closed well too late.
JAMIE'S WANDERLUST ,made a menacing wide bid on the turn then continued willingly to the finish. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS raced close up in the two path
then inside and made a gradual gain. RISQUE'S JEWEL was urged close up four wide to the quarter pole and tired. PALOMA GRIS broke a step slowly,
chased outside and lacked a rally. CONNOISSEUR balked at loading, broke very slowly, rushed up inside, was in tight into the far turn and stopped.

Footnotes
EL FENOMENO took the lead at once, set the pace in three path, lugged in nearing furlong marker and impeded SPUD then was under confident handling
the final yards. SPUD broke slowly, saved ground, was bothered badly near mid stretch and gamely held place. ERIN GO BRAUGH saved ground to
stretch, eased out through stretch but was too late. COMFORTABLY COOL, racing well off the rail, tired. FIELD OFFICER broke slowly and then never
threatened. SMART PROSPECT was wide and not a serious factor. JUST EXPLODED saved ground and dropped back steadily. HEALTHCARE HEROES
raced very wide and was no factor. POP POP'S BOY, two wide and just off the pace, stopped. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF
FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SPUD, EL FENOMENO WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
BABY BOSS vied inside in a rapid duel, repelled that challenge, was collared again from the outside at the quarter pole but dug in and gamely held the
advantage. NOT LEAVING broke slowly, advanced inside, made a strong bid outside on the turn, loomed a danger but could not get by the winner. J J
LOVES BILLY saved ground early then closed well without threatening. DOUBLE THE BET trailed early, chased wide and finished willingly. THE CIRCLE
GAME moved wide on the turn, bid five wide into the stretch rallying. CARRIZO pursued the dueling pacesetters, was asked for run on the turn but faded.
SHE'S PRIMO earned a narrow lead outside, dueled to midway on the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
MISQUILLO saved ground throughout and took the lead in deep stretch. GRANDFIRE set the pace inside, drifted out slightly through stretch and was no
match late. LT. COLUMBO, very wide early, rallied outsider winner on the final turn, moved out very wide into stretch and lacked a rally. JAMA DILLON was
carried out racing into the first turn, remained wide, loomed near stretch but then faded. READY REWARD prompted the pace two wide then tired. FACTUM
LOVE STYLE raced wide and never threatened. RISING LIGHT was well placed between rivals, dropped back steadily. BETTER TAPIT showed nothing.
MR. PEREZ steadied in tight entering first turn, stalked then stopped. The mile fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
YOUR PAL vied outside, moved clear on the turn then widened under moderate pressure while drifting out through the stretch. ENOUGH LOVE raced in
traffic near the inside on the turn then closed well too late. MRS. PHELPS hustled close up outside, bid on the turn, raced on the rail in the stretch and
faltered. DRIVER'S LICENSE saved ground and continued well while no threat. ANGEL RAPHAEL raced very wide throughout and lacked a rally. LADY
MISTRESS chased close up inside then began faltering on the turn. EZ ON THE EYES raced wide off the pace and weakened steadily. TWEETY KITTEN
dropped far behind and was never a factor. HIGH MATH hustled close up inside then gave way on the turn. PABLO'S DREAM stumbled badly unseating
her rider at the start.

Footnotes
PATEGORY ONE saved ground early, went between rivals on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and won going away. SCORPION DYNASTY set the
pace in the three path, remained clear mid stretch but was no match late. CITIZEN WEST was jostled leaving the gate and clipped heels soon after, rallied
wide on the far turn, came in a bit soon after and had his heels clipped, after all his problems, he was no threat to top two. PRINCE CHAMP ducked out at
the start, was outrun to stretch, went very wide and passed faders. MAGIC MULE came out leaving the gate, raced just off rail and just off the pace then
tired. CANTSTOPRUNNING was between rivals in second flight then tired. TONY FROM OCALA, forced out leaving the gate then never threatened.
LYNARD, four wide and just off pace, clipped heels on the far turn and stumbled. CHASING DREAMS came in leaving the gate, raced two wide and tired.

Footnotes
MIGHTY MARK lagged far behind, advanced wide and drew clear through the final eighth while kept to his business. MAGIC WIZARD settled inside, made
a menacing move into the final turn, led but was outfinished. SHILOH LANE settled at the back of the pack, advanced wide and was up for the show late.
BEST START vied briefly inside, pulled away into the final turn and proved empty in the stretch. COMMISSIONER DAVE broke slowest, raced far back then
passed fading rivals. BOWLED OVER chased within striking range then faded on the final turn. ONTHEWINGSOFLOU saved ground just off the leaders
and gave way. DRINK MORE BOURBON forced the pace early, eased back on the first turn and lacked a response. EPIGRAMMATIST earned a narrow
advantage early then stopped after half a mile. ODDS ARE stopped abruptly and returned bleeding from the nostrils.

Footnotes
IRISH CORK saved ground racing behind top flight, eased out to secure racing room entering the stretch but then was quickly steered back to the rail and
took the lead in deep stretch. STAY HYDRATED, broke sharply as the field left the gate twenty seven minutes past post time, set the pace in the three path,
drifted out a bit in early stretch and was outfinished. SCREEN SAVER, two wide dueling for command, also drifted slightly entering stretch and held well.
PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was jostled breaking slowly, raced just off rail, angle out through stretch, bumped JW'S THIRD MISCHIE then finished evenly. JW'S
THIRD MISCHIE, well placed between foes, was bumped in mid stretch and faded. BABY BULL, three wide in second flight, faded. DEMOCRATIC never
threatened. ARRECIFE, two wide, was never a serious threat.

Footnotes
QUICK TEMPO took control at once, began widening on the turn then increased his advantage while under wraps late in an impressive outing.
MAYTHEHORSEBWITHU stumbled badly at the start, rushed up outside and continued willingly. CLASSY AMERICAN chased inside, awaited room on the
turn then closed well when clear in the stretch. PENSAMIENTO lagged far behind, circled his field advancing and went six wide in the stretch. FEARLESS
FLY forced the pace along the inside then came up empty through the stretch. NUTSIE faded on the turn then came again passing fading rivals. FRANK N
DUCKY stumbled badly at the break, rushed outside and stopped in the stretch. SAPONARA lacked speed and gave way readily.

Footnotes
PRINTER was outrun early saving ground, moved to the outside, took the overland route on the turn, took the lead and drew off under mild handling. SIGHT
LINE set the pace along the rail, was no match for winner but gamely held place. AMERICAN ROMA rallied between foes on the final turn, eased out
through stretch but lacked a strong kick. MANTLE raced wide and passed tiring foes. MIAMI TIGER saved ground just off the pace then tired. MARRIAGE
FEVER was never a serious threat racing in the five path. KID MAC COOL dueled for command two wide before tiring. DOOLEY broke slowly then raced
very wide. SUNRISE SATURDAY bobbled leaving the gate, dueled between foes then gave way. TRILOGY, three wide and just off the early pace, had
nothing left. BANKER'S ISLAND raced wide and showed little.
