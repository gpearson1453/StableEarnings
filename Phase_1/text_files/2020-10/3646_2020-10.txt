Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN off a bit slow to begin, settled off the inside, entered the stretch three wide, rallied under left then right-handed urging and drew clear
late. INVICTATATUS set the pace inside to the stretch, roused at the top of the lane, held HOOP DREAM at bay but could not match the winner in deep
stretch. HOOP DREAM stalked three wide to the stretch, bid outside the leader at the eighth pole and lacked the needed late kick. ARMOUR PLATE up
close between early, dropped back off the top pair into the first turn, pulled from between rivals around the bend, settled outside a rival on the backstretch,
steered to the inside, moved a bit off the rail in the lane and finished evenly. ALVAARO forwardly placed outside the leader, chased two wide into the stretch
and weakened in the drive. JACK SPROUT steadied off heels around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and failed to rally. MR RIGHT NOW
off a bit slow to begin, saved ground then came out into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
TIME TO TESTIFY vied for the lead outside of GAMBINI, pressed foe into the far turn then challenged again at the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear leaving
the bend and widened through the final furlong. MALIBU PRINCE went four wide around the first turn, tracked widest up the backstretch while outside a pair
of rivals, entered the far turn five wide then angled into the three path, made no impact on the winner in the late stages but bested the rest. MONGOL ALTAI
stalked outside a rival, traveled four wide then moved down into the two path around the far turn and failed to respond. DERBY WAR settled off the pace,
asked at the three-eighths pole, drifted out on the far turn then further out in the lane and weakened. GAMBINI stumbled leaving the gate but recovered
quickly to vie for the lead from inside, held a short lead into the far turn then lost command past the five-sixteenths pole, chased the winner along the inside
into the stretch and gave way. AFLEETING LIFE stumbled badly at the start, trailed throughout along the inside and never threatened.

Footnotes
TREVOR T stalked from inside, lacked room approaching the quarter pole, angled three wide leaving the bend, rallied from outside and outclosed COOL
YOUR JETS in the late stages. COOL YOUR JETS tucked inside early, moved a bit off the rail then angled back to the fence around the far turn, tipped out
in the lane, rallied between rivals in the final furlong and finished a game second. ONE FAST BRO pressed the pace outside the leader, headed rival at the
seven-sixteenths marker, gained command around the far turn, moved clear in upper stretch, met bids from the outside and stayed on well through the final
furlong and yielded grudgingly. MAMBA COOL stalked the pace off the rail, came off the far turn three wide and lacked a bid. LUVLUV raced off the rail,
came four wide into the stretch and never rallied. SQUARE ROOT had early speed from along the inside, set the pace with company to the outside, headed
by rival at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought back through the far turn then weakened. ULTIMATE MYSTERY trailed the field early, raced three wide around
the second bend then angled out at the top of the lane and proved no menace.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN SCOTTY broke out and bumped rival, sped to the front, inched away around the turn, urged left-handed in the lane and held gamely. HORSE
GREEDY bumped leaving the gate, raced off the rail while in range, took aim three wide entering the stretch, closed in alongside the leader late and kept
gaining to the wire. LIONITE bumped leaving the gate, chased off the rail then came off the turn four wide, summoned a late bid and closed the gap on the
top pair. SWEET RIVER BAINES broke out a bit and was quickly corrected, stalked near the inside, entered the turn in the two path then angled to the rail,
cut the corner into the lane and went evenly through the final furlong. TOBACCO ROAD lacked early speed, moved to the inside, angled out leaving the turn
and was never a factor. WHATWASITHINKING bumped at the start, positioned up close early outside the leader, raced two to three wide around the turn
and faded.

Footnotes
ANNANGEL (IRE) off slow to begin then sped to the front from inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch, remained inside to the lane, roused in upper
stretch and held well. BEGUILED chased the speed from inside to the stretch, in range through the drive but failed to the needed late kick to threaten the
winner but stayed on well for the place. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) broke out, unhurried in the early stages while outside a rival, swung out into the stretch
and rallied for the show. OVER ATTRACTED traveled two wide then settled along the inside, angled out in the stretch and finished well. FROSE chased off
the inside, three wide leaving the far turn, raced within striking distance in the final furlong but could not find more. LOUD LOUD MUSIC stalked in the two
path and flattened out in the late stages. LADY NOGUEZ chased from inside, steadied off heels at the five-sixteenths pole, angled out into the three path on
the turn and never threatened. GO BIG BLUE NATION entered the far turn two wide, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and had little left for the
drive.

NEVER BE ENOUGH (GB) traveled two wide on the first turn, went three wide around the far turn, five wide in upper stretch, closed widest and proved best
late. COLONIAL CREED chased three wide then four wide at the top of the lane, rallied and gained the place. CORDIALITY showed early speed then
dropped back to stalk the lone leader, bid alongside that rival at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, yielded to the top pair and held the show. ELLIE
ARROWAY stalked from inside, moved out into the two path around the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, bid between foes in the lane but did not
have enough late. SHE'S OUR CHARM away quickly and took command early, set the pace from inside, headed by rival at the quarter pole, fought back
from inside, overtaken in upper stretch and kept on through the final furlong. MUCHLY (GB) settled off the pace, raced along the rail then moved out into the
two path on the far turn, angled back to the inside in upper stretch and summoned a mild response. PROUD EMMA tracked three wide through both turns
and never threatened.

Footnotes
MISTER BOLD hopped at the start, allowed to settle off the pace, closed in around the turn while angling out into the stretch, overhauled the top pair and
inched away. UNCLE BOOGIE off a bit slow to begin, chased along the inside, two wide into the turn, angled out and bid three deep into the stretch and got
outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. SWIFT AS I AM bumped with inside rival then shifted out at the start, stalked off the inside, bid between foes
leaving the turn, took over at the three-sixteenths pole and yielded late. WEDDING GROOM pressed the pace up the backstretch, was in tight and checked
into the turn, remained inside around the bend, lacked room late on the turn and upper stretch, tipped out and gained a minor award. C'MON JENNA
chased four wide around the turn, angled in at the three-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. LUCKY ROCKET away quickly from the outside, set a pressured
pace, cleared foe early into the turn and traveled a bit off the rail to the stretch and faded.

PETRUCHIO away quickly from the gate then dropped into a stalking position, bid outside the top pair and gained command nearing the eighth pole, moved
clear soon after and drew away in deep stretch. GOT CURLY went three wide around the first turn, chased off the rail to the stretch, angled out and closed
well but could not make an impact on the winner. ONCOMING raced off the pace, traveled three wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and edged
rivals for the show. DRIVEHAPPY pulled early entering the the first turn, raced between rivals then angled to the inside, moved out into the two path on the
second turn, put in a mild late bid and missed the show. K P AIM HIGH forwardly placed outside the leader, challenged at the three-eighths pole, dueled
around the turn, vied between rivals in the stretch and flattened in the late stages. MOUNT PELLIAR unhurried in the early going, steered to the inside,
angled in late and lacked a rally. AIRMAN off slow to begin, angled to the inside early then moved out into the two path around the clubhouse turn, went
three wide into the far turn, moved into the two path then back into the three path entering the stretch, came at the top of the lane and never threatened.
HELIOCHROME sped to the front and angled to the rail, challenged into the far turn, dueled with rival around the far turn then vied along the inside, could
not keep pace inside the furlong ground, steadied when MOUNT PELLAR angled in late and faded. CAPPER traveled near the back of the pace outside a
rival, angled in on the second turn and proved no menace. IVORY SKY off slow to begin, stalked the pace next to the fence, dropped back into the far turn,
drifted out then inward then back out again in the stretch and tired.
