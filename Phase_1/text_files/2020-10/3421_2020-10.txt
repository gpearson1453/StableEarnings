Footnotes
PREMIER STAR raced close up on the inside, came through on the rail past the half mile marker to contest the pace, took charge on the turn, responded
when roused in upper stretch and pulled away under urging. JOHNNY RITT dueled outside for the lead, raced three wide on the turn, dug in gamely in the
stretch drive and held on late to earn the place spot. MERU was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, angled off the rail at
the top of the lane, then rallied near the inside. HE'S SMOKIN NOW raced off the pace outside a rival, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane
and rallied mildly to best the others. GANDY DANCING chased between rivals, bid four wide nearing the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened.
NEWSTOME chased outside, bid five wide nearing the turn, came five wide into the lane and tired. AS SEEN ON TV dueled inside of JOHNNY RITT for the
early lead, then dueled between rivals and gave way in the stretch.
