Footnotes
THIN WHITE DUKE Well placed along the two path into the turn, appeared to be blocked nearing the quarter pole, waited, angled out, responded late and
under the whip bested OUR MAN MIKE for the win. OUR MAN MIKE Broke slow, four wide into the turn, gained on that path to challenge four across at the
top of the lane, battled in the lane with the lead and was caught late. IT'S GRAVY Vied for the lead from between on the turn, battled in the lane and
weakened late. BOURBON BROWN Vied for the lead three across, between three deep at the top of the lane and faded. SILVERADO TRAIL Broke slow,
ducked in after that, rushed out to contest the lead along the rail to the lane and gave way. BLURT Broke well, appeared to be climbing up the backstretch,
four wide into the turn and tired.
