Footnotes
NO CACHA NA (CHI) chased inside of SCARLET POSITION early, settled back second last past the five eighths, took closer order in the four path on the
turn, was taken four wide into the lane and driven in upper stretch, took the lead approaching the furlong pole and drove clear. POINT STREAK tracked
inside the pacesetter early, raced in the pocket on the turn, came through inside of PAPA'S ISLA DOLL into the lane, and chased on while no match for the
winner. SCARLET POSITION hopped at the break, chased two wide early, bid into the turn and tracked the pace two wide around the bend, came three
wide into the lane, and was outfinished in the final furlong. IMA LITTLE KITTEN settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path on the turn, and had no
response under a drive in the lane. PAPA'S ISLA DOLL set the pace while taking some early pressure, led in the two path on the turn, was confronted in
upper stretch and driven between horses, but lost the lead approaching midstretch and weakened. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE RACE IS
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CARAMEL ANGEL broke readily, angled inwards to dictate the pace racing a bit off the rail on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, repelled several
challengers leaving the far turn and held gamely to the end under energetic handling. POCKET PLAYER angled to the rail tracking off the first flight racing
into the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch to advance inside the pacesetter and continued willingly to the end while just failing to gain even terms.
VIOLATOR, pulled his way to a forward placing three deep racing on terms with the pacesetter into the backstretch, moved to challenge for command
between foes in that path nearing upper stretch but proved no match for the top pair. CLOUD TO GROUND tracked off the first flight outside foes to the
backstretch, gained on the leaders racing four deep into the far turn but lacked the needed closing kick. WILL YA WIN SUM settled off the second flight
racing a bit off the rail and continued evenly between foes into the lane. MISTER CHARMING hopped at the start breaking a bit slowly, split foes on the first
turn to gain position with the pacesetter after the opening quarter, prompted that rival between foes to the second bend and gave way early. DARK WOOD
(IRE), caught five wide racing into the first turn, settled outside rivals on the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. LOST KINGDOM, reserved along
the inside, then between foes racing into the backstretch, offered no rally. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
JOLINA was off sharply, set the pace down the backstretch while taking mild pressure from PRINCESS STELLA, continued to dictate terms in the two path
in the turn, opened up when asked into the lane, veered out under a left handed crop midstretch but still won well clear. PERFECTIONTODETAIL chased
between horses early, continued midpack in the the two to three path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, responded with a rally, and got up late
for the place. CAT ATTACK chased midpack early, tracked the leading pair three wide on the turn, pursued the pacesetter under a drive in the lane while no
match, and lost the place in the final sixteenth. ROSSENARRA settled in second last, was pushed along in the two to three path on the turn, rallied between
horses into the lane, but proved no match in the final furlong. SHE'S MY RIDE trailed near the center of the track early, raced in the four path on the turn,
was driven inside of horses in the lane, passed tiring foes but ultimately proved no threat. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) stumbled in the opening strides,
prompted the early pace outside of PRINCESS STELLA, tracked two wide on the turn, and came up empty at the quarter. STEPPIN ON OUT chased three
wide early, continued midpack in the four path on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane and came up empty. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION,
THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GITA'S LAD sprinted clear of the field while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable advantage to the far turn and
maintained a safe margin to the end under firm encouragement. FRONTANA, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, advanced
in tandem with a rival to bid between foes nearing upper stretch but couldn't gain terms with the winner while prevailing for the place honors. DAZZLING
TRUTHS tracked the leaders under rating racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest
while outkicked for second. HONEST TO GOODNESS tracked the leaders three deep from just out of striking distance, advanced three deep on the far turn
to lodge a brief bid but flattened out in upper stretch. FULL OF RUN, off a step slowly, trailed throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LONG STATION chased three wide early, advanced to track the leading trio alone into the turn, rallied in upper stretch, led four wide near the furlong mark,
and proved best two wide. LITTLE BALTAR settled at the rear early, bid between horses near the half, improved in the two path on the turn, split horses in
upper stretch, forced through another pair near the furlong mark, and was narrowly outfinished inside of LONG STATION. OFFLEE FUN settled two wide in
the rear flight, was urged in the three path on the turn, rallied two to three wide in the lane but was no match for the top two. COUNTRY COOL chased four
wide, raced in the four to five path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, kept on mildly but was outfinished for the show. HIGH HERO set a pressured
pace down the backstretch, continued to lead in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, was headed near the furlong mark and weakened.
LEE'S LUCK pressed the pace three wide early, tracked three wide around the turn and into the lane, was bumped between horses near the furlong pole,
and weakened. FLIT N TIME raced at the inside of the chasing line early, saved ground near the rear around the turn, and made no rally. KYZAN chased
between horses early, was hard to handle approaching the half and began to lose position, dropped to the rear, trailed near the middle of the racetrack on
the turn, and had no response when driven in the lane. TIO CHUY pressed the pace between horses, began to weaken past the three eighths, came into
the lane at the inside of the chasing line, and continued to tail off. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
READTHECLIFFNOTES pulled his way to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend, was
roused racing into the lane to extend the margin and finished in hand once the issue was decided. BIG MONEY MACHINE was guided to the inside nearing
the first turn to track off the first flight, saved ground into the second bend, shifted outside the winner racing into upper stretch while being prompted to
advance but proved only second best. HALF OF MANHATTAN, gained terms with the pacesetter prompting the pace between foes racing to the far turn and
weakened racing into the stretch. DRAGUNOV angled to the rail in early stages dropping well off the leaders, shifted a bit off the inside racing into the far
turn gaining position between foes, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly late. SKYCRAFT hopped at the start while breaking a bit
slowly, was settled last racing well off the inside to the backstretch, swung six wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress.
SCATTERED CASH tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the first turn, shifted out four wide after a half while being prompted to terms with the
leaders but steadily faded leaving the midway point of the far turn. HIGH ON SUGAR settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and
never mounted a serious challenge. GIACALLURE settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside nearing the lane gaining
some position but emptied out midstretch. TUFF ATTACK, in touch with the first flight three deep attending the pace in the opening half, faded between foes
racing through the far turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LAVERNS LASS, urged to join the pace four wide racing into the first turn, gained the advantage while shifting to the inside nearing the backstretch, dictated
the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail racing into the far turn, then held safe the challenges of several rivals to gamely prevail under firm handling.
VICTIM, urged between foes, then along the inside prompting the pace into the backstretch, saved ground tracking just off the leader into the lane, angled
nearest the rail in the closing stages and edged a rival for the place honors. GREATEST GAL, urged three deep between foes prompting the pace into the
first turn, tracked just outside the winner through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn to midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. KURINGAI
tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then shifted out four wide in the closing stages while finishing with
interest to close the gap. DON'T HOLD QUEENS settled well off the leaders near the inside in the opening half, shifted out to split foes three wide racing
through the far turn, then angled five wide in the closing stages gaining position to the end. LITTLE CHICK broke slowly, settled last to the backstretch, then
swung out six wide racing into the lane while passing some tiring foes. REJOICE AN BE GLAD tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn
but lacked a closing bid. NO TIME TO PLAY tracked the leaders three deep in second flight to the backstretch and emptied out racing through the far turn.
HERO ALEXANDRA settled into stride racing off the inside to the backstretch and proved no threat. HAVE THE FACTS, rank in the post parade, briefly
prompted the pace inside foes racing into the first turn but faded early. ENCHILADA tracked off the second flight near the inside racing to the first turn,
shifted four wide midway through the backstretch and quickly emptied out. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
