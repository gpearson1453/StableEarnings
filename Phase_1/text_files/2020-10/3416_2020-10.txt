Footnotes
NANA'S SHOES settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, seized command leaving the five-sixteenths pole,
quickly drew off under a drive and widened under minimal urging in the final furlong. WOWWHATABRAT set the pace in the two path, could not keep pace
with the winner from the five-sixteenths pole but stayed on well to be clearly second best. FLOATING BY raced off the pace three and four wide, lacked a
serious rally and bested the rest. LADY BREANNA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. DR. ANN was in tight at the start, prompted the pace
three wide and faded. STAKES ON A PLANE had early speed two wide, was pulled up in the stretch and vanned off.

Footnotes
MARKETABILITY prompted the pace five down the backstretch, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, cleared and angled in nearing the five-sixteenths
marker, extended the lead in upper stretch and held on to a diminishing margin under steady left-handed urging. VEGAS WEEKEND disputed the pace
three wide between rivals, could not match strides with the winner around the turn, stayed on willingly through the lane to narrow much of the gap and hold
off another rival for the place. TAP DANCE FEVER was off slow, lagged outside early then made a sustained four wide run to just miss second. HOPE HAS
A NAME was unruly pre-race, raced off the pace two wide and had a mild rally. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY had early speed four wide between rivals and
faded around the turn. TRIPLE DIGIT vied two wide between rivals down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. CHITU'S
BEAUTY had brief speed inside. MONKEY ON MY BACK was outrun inside.

Footnotes
PERSISTO settled off the pace three wide, angled out early on the backstretch, cruised up four wide, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole and
drew off under a drive. LUCKY FIND prompted the pace two wide, bid between foes midway around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner but
held well to be clearly second best. DANCE AND DANCE stalked the pace three wide, bid between foes midway around the far turn, could not keep pace
with the winner and settled for the show. PAT'S NO FOOL never threatened while racing three wide. FAIRY WISH saved ground to no avail.
ATHENASWAY failed to menace while racing two wide. I DARE U played no factor while racing three and four wide. FINE ONE WON set the pace along
the rail and tired around the far turn. GLOBAL AMBITION was outrun inside.

off the pace three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, moved into a clear second still in the three path around the far turn, rallied outside and
narrowed the gap late. YES SIR COLONEL was bumped on both sides at the start, raced well back three wide and four wide and was along for the show.
MCCAIN came out and bumped SUPER DANCER at the start, saved ground off the pace around the first turn, advanced inside down the backstretch then
faded around the far turn. WYE MUMBO chased the winner two wide and was through after a half. CHAIN BREAKER had brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
BOOTLEGGER (FR) raced in range four wide around both turns, closed steadily and was up in deep stretch. EMPTY NESTR stalked the pace two wide, bid
three wide into the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths marker, vied outside of the pacesetter to midstretch, put away that foe leaving the
eighth pole but could not withstand the winner late. EXPECT DRAMA set the pace in the two path, fought on inside of EMPTY NESTR past the eighth pole
but was outfinished late. ELEMENTARY raced in range inside of the winner around the turns and was one-paced in the lane. LINDA'S NEKIA was rank at
the start, lagged far back two and three wide, swung to the extreme outside in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SOUTHERN CAL saved ground and failed
to menace. FINE SPIRIT was outrun while racing three wide. BEACOS DISCO PANTS played no factor while racing two wide. CAMPARI was outrun inside.
TRAPPER'S DELIGHT stalked the pace two and three wide and tired around the far turn.
