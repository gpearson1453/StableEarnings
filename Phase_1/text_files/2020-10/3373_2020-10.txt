Footnotes
FORTUNE'S FOOL established the top in short order, showed the way on an open lead, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, got called upon for
more at the three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear in the final furlong. ALLURED strung out four wide on the turn, flashed some interest as the half was being
completed, got roused taking the same path for entrance into the lane, proved no match leaving the eighth pole. COBBLE HILL cut over the rail well before
arriving at the conclusion of the backstretch, was under a ride tipping into the two path at the top of the lane, had no offering. MISSION WRAPITUP pursued
the pace three wide on the turn, fanned out into path five from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response. TITAN'S WILL stalked the winner from
path two, was one wider after stepping onto the head of the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
CHROME DIXIE coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of SONIC SPEED from the get go through swift splits, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set
down for the drive, dug in continuing to knock heads through to the finish and prevailed in game fashion on the wire. SONIC SPEED hustled from the start,
dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in dueling
through the length of the stretch gamely fighting on to the end but was ultimately staved off. MARTINEZ brushed at the start by TANNERS NECK LANE who
was bumped by SCOTTY breaking inwards, chased just off the inside from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to kick on belatedly and secure the show honors. BREW PUB coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from just
off the duel, got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TANNERS NECK LANE got
bumped at the start by SCOTTY who broke inwards and in turn brushed MARTINEZ, chased three then two wide coaxed along from the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK chased along the inside in range of the duel up front, got let out angled
three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MINDFREAK four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to
run, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SCOTTY broke in at the start bumping TANNERS NECK LANE into MARTINEZ, chased just off
the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SHE THROWS HEAT away well, made light contact with MS BOOMBASTIC stepping off the homestretch, pursued the pace three wide, swung towards
path four entering the stretch, forged her way past several rivals to the front end deep into the furlong grounds, continued onward with good energy and
kicked clear. BASELINE DRIVE reserved two wide on the clubhouse bend, rode the rail on the subsequent one, angled approximately three wide into the
stretch, made a little headway on the ones to catch, altered course into path in the vicinity of the sixteenth marker, settled into her best, rallying with solid
late foot to get up for the place. WICKED HAPPY broke forwardly placed, went on to secure the pocket slot, was kept on hold tracking the front runners
within striking distance, came up into some traffic during the last few jumps prior to the quarter pole, turned into the lane two wide with clear sailing along its
new path readily available, availed of the opportunity and burst through, arrived at the eighth pole hitched up to the top one, saw that one shake free, then
flattened out slightly in the final stages to lose out on second. CHEROKEE SONG unhurried while taking the two path, was between rivals on the second
bend, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, made no headway in the final furlong. KARLEY O leaned inward as the field was sent on its way,
shouldering the left side of the starting gate, cut over to the inside, fought the rider by pulling hard on the bit the remainder of the trip leading up to the crown
of the first turn, was more professional slipping into the two path midway on the backstretch, was still in it entering the far turn, got moved out four wide for
the drive, mustered up a mild response. MS BOOMBASTIC brushed with the winner spinning three wide onto the first turn, tucked into the two path soon
afterwards, prompted the pace under a rating hold, poked a head in front in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, got asked heading home with heavy
pressure only a short distance behind, gave in to it a sixteenth later and faltered. JAZZY LADY strung out three wide on each bend, got sent out six wide
during the first half of the stretch run, lacked the necessary response. MISCHIEF REIGNS vied for control from along the inside to the five-sixteenths marker
before giving way.

Footnotes
STAY HOME MAMA along the outside throughout, raced three to four wide in pursuit of the front runners, was more the former entering the stretch, fought
her way to the front end by the eighth pole, then edged away. KHALI MAGIC sparred for the top two to three wide, went into the lane, saw the winner take
over by midstretch, held late for the place. STORMI CAT LADY made it over to the rail by the turn, tracked the pace near the rear, got driven hard six wide
from upper to midlane, narrowed in, fell short of snagging away second. NEBO took up the chase four wide on the turn, was about as wide entering the
stretch, made no headway. BUSTIN BAY broke sharply, retained the advantage, moved over to the inside, was spaced at a slight distance from off the rail
cutting the pace, pressed by the second place finisher from the outside, was put to a drive for the drive, got reeled in at the furlong grounds, backed away.
VIVE LA LIBERTY firmly rated two wide until the five-sixteenths marker, commenced the stretch slightly wider, came up empty. ADIRONDACK QUEEN
hung out four wide on the turn, fanned out seven wide once in the stretch, never made her presence felt. CAPTIVATING CARA saved ground for the
opening half, tipped out into path two for the drive, gave way. EMPLOYEES ONLY two wide onto the turn, was three wide exiting it, trailed.

Footnotes
PRICE TALK just off the pace tracking from the two path, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge nearing the eighth pole, came in slightly inside that station to the two path to keep LA HARA hemmed in behind the leader in a heady move of
race riding, seized command just inside the sixteenth pole and inched away to the finish to prevail. BRAY tracked the pace along the inside from near the
rear, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, closed well to just get up for the place honors in the last jump.
YES AND YES ranged up shortly after the start to establish the front crossing to show the way along the inside, remained in hand down the backstretch
settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits, came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got let taking the inside route into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive safe to the eighth pole, came under threat inside that station, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker, then got nailed on the wire
for the place honors. LA HARA (IRE) got bumped after the start by LOMU, tracked the pace along the inside under rating, remained patiently handled until
roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, was in behind YES AND YES unable to tip out as GLAD ROCK ran alongside nearing the eighth pole, then had
to remain behind that rival as PRICE TALK rallied outside just as GLAD ROCK backed away and was forced to steady off the heels of YES AND YES a
sixteenth from home, tipped out to the two path in behind the eventual winner inside that station re-engaged to a drive and kept on to be along for the last
major share. GLAD ROCK (GER) broke in at the start bumping LOMU, tracked just off the inside pulling on the bit a bit keen early on under restraint before
settling better midway down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, came under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in and weakened in the final furlong. STANFORD (IRE) brushed the near side stall at the start getting away last,
tracked the pace along the inside until tipped to the two path through the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and
offered no response. LOMU bumped at the start by GLAD ROCK who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung
four to five wide for home and offered no response.

behind some traffic from late on the bend until the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, angled to the outside, eventually attaining optimal racing clearance
in path four in midstretch, took off in earnest after the ones to catch, struck the front end, rallying with good energy, in the final seventy yards and edged
away. AFTER FIVE pursued the pace from path two after coming out slightly and brushing the winner at the start, fanned out six wide from upper to
midlane, becoming the widest of all, had a good finish down the center of the course to garner the place. MOMOS grabbed the advantage, got guided over
to the inside route, showed the way, with GYPSY KING in accompaniment one path farther off the rail, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when
called upon for more, emerged a sixteenth down the road, clutching the lead by a slim margin but with several others bearing down menacingly from the
outside, relinquished reluctantly with slightly less than a sixteenth to go, ventured onward with enough willingness to salvage the show. COUNTY FINAL
took up residence in midpack travelling on the backstretch, sat within range of the front runners racing in the two path on the turn, got cued up moving to the
outside as the second split was about to be posted, straightened away in path three, clawed his way into contention, displayed some run to the end, but
came up short today. GYPSY KING one of the quickest out of the gate, remained forwardly placed, sparred for command from path two, got set down
heading onto the top of the stretch, kept up its quest for another furlong before weakening. TRADE DEAL stalked the pace during the initial stages from off
the inside, dove into the pocket approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, was patiently ridden keeping an eye on the front runners, went towards path
two stepping onto the top of the lane, began a desperate search for a clear seam while inching its way to the outside, espied one fleetingly available in the
neighborhood of path four in midstretch only to have to check, lacking the time to get maneuvered into it, continued to idle along the remainder of the
journey home, having never been fully in the clear. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) three wide onto the turn, got steered into the five path exiting it, had no response.

SPEAKER'S CORNER bumped at the start by ORIGINAL due to pressure from MILES D breaking inwards, chased five then four wide from mid pack, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up
in the final jumps to prevail. CADDO RIVER broke in mid pack and came under coaxing to advance and challenge for command shortly after the start,
dueled from the four path with CHASING FAME to his outside, tucked to the inside in the midst of being shaken off by his former pace rival and chased
along the inside through the turn, tipped out to the two path just past the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, swung four then three wide straightened away
into upper stretch taking over command, edged clear to the eighth pole under a drive, dug in under growing late threat and was caught in the final strides to
the wire. GREATEST HONOUR chased inside briefly before tipping out to the three path, chased three wide coming under a ride at the three-eighths,
angled out eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. MILES D broke in at the start bumping ORIGINAL into
SPEAKER'S CORNER, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. CHASING FAME coaxed from the gate, dueled five to six paths off the inside
with CADDO RIVER to his inside, shook off that rival at the nine-sixteenths and tucked to the two path through the turn, came under light coaxing nearing
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home and yielded command straightening away, then weakened in the drive. BOURBONIC strode greenly down
the backstretch while coaxed along four paths off the inside and facing kickback, came under off sided taps and then a near side stick near the
nine-sixteenths and tucked to the inside through the turn, continued coaxed along through the bend, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact while getting some education under his belt. RYE RUNNER shied in at the start filling the space left vacated by the breaking inwards MILES D, raced
forwardly placed six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide for home and tired. ORIGINAL fractious in the gate prior to the start, got bumped at the break by MILES D breaking inwards and in turn bumped
SPEAKER'S CORNER, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn and got placed to coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

ROYAL APPROVAL off a half beat the fastest, remained prominently placed, was well held prompting UNION GABLES towards the path two, challenged in
earnest in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, from path three, fought her way past a stubborn foe with approximately a sixteenth go, then kept to the
task at hand, kicked clear. UNION GABLES grabbed command shortly after the field had been released, cut over to the inside, showed the way, tailed by
the winner out in the two path, got called upon for more right around the five-sixteenths pole, saw the confidently-ridden ROYAL APPROVAL whittle away at
the deficit nonetheless, shifted onto path two stepping onto the top of the lane, then drifted three wide between midlane and the sixteenth pole, got headed,
stayed on well to save second. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) brought up the back of the pack during the opening phases, got maneuvered onto the rail at the top of
the turn, stayed put until its end, angled three wide into the stretch, closed in, altered course back to the rail coming up to the sixteenth pole, maintained her
momentum rallying for the show. AMALFI PRINCESS settled into midpack after the start, departed the backstretch from the two path, tipped into the third
one nearing the five-sixteenths pole, went four wide into the lane, mustered up a mild rally. FABRICATE pinched at the start, saved ground for nearly a half,
got spotted into the two path at the top of the lane, made no impact. ROSSA VELOCE taken hold after lunging out at the start, tracked the front runners from
the pocket, cut the corner into the stretch, backed away. NIENTE chased the pace from path two, angled four wide for the drive home, was in the process of
holding her ground suffering an apparent injury to the right front in midstretch, was expertly eased and pulled up, then after being examined by one of the
trackside veterinarians, got vanned off. Following a General Stewards' Inquiry, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared offcial.

Footnotes
TURN OF EVENTS forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader tracking from the two path, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch taking over
command at the quarter pole, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and just held on by a head. MORE LIKE IT two
to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and just missed at
the end by a bob of the head. TRAFFIC PATTERN two to three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. ROYAL SUSPECT just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride
at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to just secure the last major share over a pair at the finish. MR.
VINCENT tracked the pace in range of the leader along the inside, tipped three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home,
angled four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. K. K. ICHIKAWA three then two wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along at
the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. WILD BANKER got steadied when bumped between foes
and pinched back just after the start as rivals on both sides jostled for position, chased two to three wide from near the rear, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SCOTTY BROWN established the front and showed the way in hand along the
inside, came under coaxing under challenge nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from command and weakened
through to the finish. KID CHOCOLATE chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, continued three wide for home and made no impact. RIVER
KNIGHT chased along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. GENTLEMAN
JOE chased along the inside from the tail of the field, went seven wide into upper stretch, was eased through to the finish and trailed throughout.
