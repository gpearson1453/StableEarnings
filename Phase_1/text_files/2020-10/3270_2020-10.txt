LAPCOS BONUS bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came out into upper stretch, rallied
into the final furlong and closed fast to win going away. WMA NORTH WIND chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, took the lead nearing the
three-sixteenths then kicked clear in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while well clear for the place. WMA FIREBALL disputed the
pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired while able to hold the show. WMA FLINTSTONE
brushed with a foe early, was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
VOLATILIS MHF bumped with a rival at the start, raced well back in the field, went two to three wide on the turn, swung out five then six wide into upper
stretch and failed to threaten. FLYINGJ GIDEON was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path and came up empty. ROYAL JOLIE chased
the pace, raced inside on the turn and also came up empty. WMA OLE went three to four wide on the turn and was no factor. VAZS DESTINY SV was
urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HAFFIRS SIMONE disputed the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied inside on the turn and faded. BIG CHARLIE was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back and was no factor.
