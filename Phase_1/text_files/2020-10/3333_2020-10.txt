Footnotes
MAIDEN BEAUTY retained the advantage after breaking on top, got guided over to the rail shortly after stepping onto the backstretch, set the splits with the
pilot holding something in reserve, came up to the three-sixteenths marker and was given her cue, drew out to a comfortable lead before getting geared
down in the final seventy yards. BOSSY BRIDE at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from path four, got set
down at the five-sixteenths marker, spun into the lane, out-fought a pair of opponents to her left to win the place. AWESOME ALANA took up the chase from
the three path, found herself between foes beginning from the five-sixteenths marker and would remain so from that juncture onward, vied well, but fell short
of snagging second. FLAT AWESOME JENNY rode the rail until midpoint on the turn, got roused slipping into the two path approaching the five-sixteenths
marker, stepped into the lane, weakened late to finish out of the money. TEAM WIN lost its footing springing from the starting gate, was in path two in
pursuit of the front runners, got put to a drive at the half mile pole, was sent out six wide from upper to midlane, lacked the needed response. DARIA'S
ANGEL stalked the winner from path two, got called upon late on the bend, gave way.

under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive and wore down the leader to take command in the final strides
and prevail on the wire. SOUTHERNER bobbled at the start and came under coaxing to show the way in hand three paths off the inside under some
pressure from KICKIN' KIRBY to the inside, was able to gain clearance and tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under pressure from a pair to the
outside through the turn getting placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, inched clear under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the last jumps to the finish. TRI SAINT LORENZO seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure
the show honors. PIER FORTY coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked briefly three to four wide before tipping
out five wide near the three-eighths to move around the backing away WILD CAT WEST, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung five wide
into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. MR. FIDGET broke out at the start bumping ANZIO BEACH, chased four wide until tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. KICKIN' KIRBY
pressed the pace from the two path along the inside of the leader down the backstretch, got shaken off a bit and had that rival tucked inside and advanced
outside that foe to press once more from the midway point on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
shaken off and tired. LORENZEN chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
WILD CAT WEST five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, dropped back and went five to six wide into upper stretch, faltered

JUNE ANN (IRE) responded to a light hand ride to establish the top, sailed along from just off the rail setting the splits, with BUYER'S REMORSE in
attendance out in the two path, settled in at the head of the stretch and was switched over to stronger handling, kicked clear, kept busy to the end. ZERENIA
took up position in midpack after stumbling at the start, got rated along travelling along in the two path for nearly a half, moved closer to the inside route after
turning into the stretch, proved no match garnering the place. RAPIDO GATTA pursued the pace three wide on the turn, was slightly nearer the rail during
the drive, closed in to be along for the show. BUYER'S REMORSE prompted the winner from the two path until the head of the stretch before giving way.
BASTET strung out three to four wide on the turn, was more the former spinning into the lane, lacked the needed response. ROMA CARPE sighted two
wide on the turn, made no impact,. BALLERINA SHOWGIRL (GB) trekked over to the rail after the field had been released, rode if for the opening half, got
spotted into path two at the top of lane, had no offering.

Footnotes
MALATHAAT three wide in aim of the front among a tightly packed compact field, advanced to take command tucked to the two path just inside the half mile
pole, tucked near the inside near the three-eighths, came under challenge and got placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths before being briefly headed for
command inside that station nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home cornering sharply and taking back the front straightened away,
inched away under a drive to prevail. CARAMEL SWIRL just off the inside early on, tipped out to chase four to five paths off the inside from near the rear in
the early going, tucked three wide through the turn advancing to issue a challenge and poke a head in front just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch put to a drive and was headed for the front straightened away, dug in under a drive chasing the winner home well clear of the
rest to be along second best. ORBS BABY GIRL chased along the inside until tipped out to the two path near the three-eighths placed to coaxing
maneuvering around WELL KEPT SECRET, angled out four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair and was along for the show honors.
READY SEEKER coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside before tipping out four wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. AUNT NAUGHTY four wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked three then two
wide put to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. WELL KEPT SECRET showed brief speed to show the way
lightly coaxed in the two path, got displaced from the front just inside the half mile pole and tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and was placed briefly in
tight off of MALATHAAT near the three-eighths as that rival tucked in front, came under urging at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JACK THE CAT away in good order, was mostly two wide and between rivals on the clubhouse bend, out-hoofed CORAGECONTENDER to work out a tuck
along the rail early on the backstretch, rode it until the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marked, tipped back into the two path and got set down as
three-quarters was being completed, swung out four wide into the lane and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, closed in relentlessly, out-fought a pair
of opponents in the final stages to prove best. QUIET OUT EAST forwardly placed three wide on each turn, flashed interest late on the second bend, was
under a drive spinning four wide into the stretch, straightened away and chopped away at the deficit, continued to do so springing from the eighth pole, was
vying with willingness between rivals in deep stretch only to have the top one snatch away the verdict. SANCTUARY CITY unhurried two wide during the
initial stages, travelled three wide on the far turn, angled five wide into the lane with good momentum, had a good finish down the center of the course, fell
short of second. DANFUSI established the top in short order after brushing with SIMPLY, went over to the rail, was rated along on a loosely-contested, felt
an uptick in pressure after six furlongs had been rattled off, settled in upper stretch and had the rider go to work, offered resistance before being reeled in
inside the sixteenth pole. CORAGESCONTENDER moved over to the inside route, saved ground until the quarter pole, fanned out towards path five for the
drive, narrowed in en route for a minor slice of the pot. MARKET BUBBLE chased the pace from the two path, waited in some traffic approaching the quarter
pole, slid closer to the rail, made no headway. MR. KRINGLE tracked the leader while loosely pocketed, bumped with ANCIENT TIMES as they turned into
the lane abreast of each other, had no offering and backed away. SIMPLY took the inside route after making light contact with DANFUSI at the start, was in
path two by the top of the second bend, shifted out one path wider for the drive, never made his presence felt. ANCIENT TIMES off the inside throughout,
stalked the pace mostly from path two, was in a bit tight bumping with MR. KRINGLE as they turned into lane as a team, lost interest after the incident and
fell back to last.

VINCERO hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from SUMMER BOURBON to the outside, remained
patiently handled as the field got busy behind through the turn, got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fending off the
challenge of the runner up and held well to prevail, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off. SUMMER BOURBON coaxed from
the gate, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four then three wide straightened away into upper stretch, ran
on to chase the winner home securing the place honors clear of the rest. DURKIN'S CALL six paths off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked four wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ETHAN HUNT two to three wide in

the late stages. VICAR'S LEGEND five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from near the rear, tucked three wide through the turn advancing
to mid pack and coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide at the head of the stretch, improved position to the finish. REAL DAN

chased five then four wide down the backstretch advancing to be once more in contact with the rear of the pack into the turn, came under coaxing four wide
at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. TALE OF MIST bumped at the start by the outwards breaking REAL
DAN, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. FINANCIAL FREEDOM

Footnotes
GOOD OLD BOY two wide on the first turn, was towards path three on the subsequent one, entered the stretch, gained in a steadfast manner on the leader,
struck the front with approximately a sixteenth to go, then held well late to preserve the decision. JO'S BOLD CAT pinched at the start, loped along at or
near the two path for three-quarters, got ridden about four wide into the lane, altered course back into path two in midstretch, kicked into his best, missed.
JIMMY JAZZ hung out three to four wide for over six furlongs, angled into path five for the drive home, rallied well to earn the show. OPERATIVE underwent
a two wide pursuit, got sent out into path six in the stretch, had a good finish down the center of the course to be along for the last major check.
MICROSECOND took up the chase from path three until midway on the second bend, shifted one path closer to the rail and went on to prompt STANHOPE,
challenged in earnest as they stepped onto the head of the stretch, wasn't up to the task at hand and backed away. STANHOPE raced three wide on the
first turn, went into path two shortly after entering the backstretch, sat reserved prompting the pacesetter, moved when ready coming up to the three-eighths
pole, wrested away at the advantage and slid over to the rail, showed the way attended by MICROSECOND from the outside, got put to the test by that
opponent at the top of the lane, gave in to heavy pressure in the general area of the sixteenth pole, and backed away. FREEDOM AND WHISKY chased the
pace from the two path, in between foes on the far turn, stepped into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. POINT HIM OUT saved ground until the
quarter pole, wandered out in the direction of the seven path down the lane, made no impact. FLY FLY AWAY kept watch on the pace from the pocket,
slipped into path two to go by the former pacesetter near the three-eighths pole, came under a ride a sixteenth later, came up empty. KAMPAI vied for
control from the inside until midway on the far turn, faltered.

Footnotes
FORZA DI ORO off to a hesitant beginning breaking about half a length slow, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch near the rear of the field
early on before advancing to be just off the pace nine-sixteenths from home, tucked to the two path through the turn, tipped out placed to coaxing near the
five-sixteenths forcing FIRST LINE to steady on behind briefly, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to loom outside the leader nearing the eighth pole,
took over narrow command just inside that station, dug in gamely knocking heads with that foe and prevailed by a neck at the end. ADARE four then three
wide in aim latched on to the to pair to the outside, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch seizing command
straightened away, dug in under threat to the outside, got headed just inside the eighth pole, fought on game inside to the finish but was ultimately bested at
the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. WILL SING FOR WINE traded a bump at the start when breaking outwards as FED FUNDS broke
inwards, chased just off the inside from near the rear, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under a ride three furlongs from home, swung four wide
into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. DUDLEY SQUARE brushed the off side stall at the start, prompted the pace three then
two wide from between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over brief and narrow command near the quarter pole, swung three wide for
home and yielded the front, then weakened in the stretch. HEIRLOOM KITTEN coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under
pressure from the aforementioned foe and to a lesser extent ADARE three deep, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths and came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. FIRST LINE coaxed from the gate,
chased five paths off the inside between foes from just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths,
then got forced to steady and was paused near the five-sixteenths as FORZA DI ORO tipped out in front, angled five wide into upper stretch following that
rival and tired in the drive. MISCHIEF AFOOT six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. FED FUNDS traded a bump at the start with WILL SING FOR WINE when breaking
inwards as that rival broke outwards, chased three wide coaxed along from midway on the turn, went six to seven wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ORGLANDES (FR) loped along while taking the inside route, slipped outward and into the two path as three-quarters was being completed, waited behind
others biding her time, swung into action by swinging three wide into the stretch, powered by CAP DE CREUS to take charge in midstretch, shook free. CAP
DE CREUS rated along in range taking the two path, flashed interest entering the second turn three wide, kept pace with the leader, stepped onto the head
of the stretch, had already assumed command when called upon for more deep into the furlong grounds, proved no match when pounced upon by the
winner soon afterwards, stayed on for the place. SORRENTINA LEMON stalked the pace from the two path, was set down for the drive home, got
outfinished. BRAMBLE QUEEN rode the rail until the conclusion of the backstretch, was worked into path four from the top of the second turn to the
five-sixteenths pole, was still in it heading home, failed to fire appreciably when called upon. OUT OF TROUBLE set the pace from along the inside route,
got displaced by BACCHANALIA coming up to the half mile pole, tracked the leader without benefit of much cover, tipped towards the two path entering the
stretch, lacked any further response. BACCHANALIA away without apparent mishap, appeared keen travelling three wide on the clubhouse turn,
middle-moved its way into a forward position and eventually into the lead by the half mile pole, tucked into the two path at that station, showed the way,
shadowed by the second place finisher from the outside, got roused at the quarter pole, was overhauled by a confidently-ridden CAP DE CREUS shortly

Footnotes
OUR TROUBADOUR five paths off the inside in pursuit from mid pack down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final furlong to collar the top pair in the final jumps
and score. WHAT'S TO BLAME coaxed from the gate, chased four wide from just off the pace down the backstretch, tucked inside into the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out with about three-sixteenths to go, ran on threatening through the final
furlong and was up for the place honors in the very last jump to the wire. CRACK SHOT coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide
through swift splits, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged away to the eighth pole under a drive, dug in under threat from a pair and
was caught in the last jumps, then got nailed on the wire for the place honors and was forced to settle for the show. RED MULE five then four wide in pursuit
from just off the pace, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. NO MORE MIRACLES four then
three wide in pursuit from near the rear, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SPITBALL
coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under encouragement midway on the turn,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outfinished. HARD COUNT six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked four wide through the turn coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. ADIOS
AMIGOS six paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and
was outkicked. AWESOME AMMO chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from three
furlongs out, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. COOLBOY forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch, tucked two to
three wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages.
QUINTARELLI broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got coaxed along just past the midway
point on the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. HALSTAAT seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch,
went five wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and tired.
