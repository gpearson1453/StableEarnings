Footnotes
CASSIE BELLE pressed the pace between rivals, vied two wide between around the turn and into the stretch, battled outside of SPANISH CHANNEL down
the stretch and prevailed under a drive. SPANISH CHANNEL set the pace inside a pair of rivals, vied along the rail through the turn and into the stretch,
dueled with CASSIE BELLE through the lane and fought gamely to the wire. ENVY stalked the top trio along the rail to the stretch, angled out to the three
path in the lane and gained ground in the final sixteenth. ELGOFRANCO up close outside a pair early, vied three deep around the turn and into the stretch
but proved no match in the late stages. VERRY BOSSY chased the speed while steered to the inside, moved out four wide leaving the turn and failed to
threaten. SHEZ OUR ARCH shuffled back soon after the start, trailed near the inside to the turn, angled four to five wide exiting the turn, angled back to the
inside in the stretch and proved no menace. FOREVER FREE stalked outside a rival, went two then three wide on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
LITTLE MISS ELLIE steadied early when bothered from the outside, stalked outside of rival then two wide into the stretch, rallied outside CAPITAL HEAT
and drove clear in the final sixteenth. CAPITAL HEAT sped clear from inside, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, widened a bit more around
the turn, held a diminishing lead approaching the eighth pole, overtaken inside the sixteenth pole and held the place. JAN JAN CAN stalked in the two path
through the turn and finished willingly for the show honors. RICKIE NINE TOE'S tracked off the inside, angled in on the turn and weakened. ADRIENNE'S
PROGENY crowded between rivals early, trailed the field to the turn, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SHE'S OUR CHARM controlled the pace along the fence, showed the way from inside to the stretch, responded to right-handed urging and held well.
QUICK (GB) raced off the pace outside a rival, steered out into the stretch, raced widest in the lane and closed well to earn the place honors. HEATHERS
GREY stalked from along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out and got edged for the place. GYPSY SPIRIT (GB) settled outside a rival then
two wide, came off the far turn three wide and failed to respond to asking. TAPWATER stalked the leader along the fence then moved out into the two path,
raced in range entering the stretch but weakened in the late stages. OUT OF BALANCE saved ground throughout, angled out in the drive but had little left.

Footnotes
BOLD ENDEAVOR set the pace under pressure to the outside, coaxed at the three-eighths pole, responded well and held SECRET TOUCH at bay to the
wire. SECRET TOUCH pressed from outside, challenged around the far turn and down the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick to get by.
CONQUEST COBRA stalked the pace from inside under restraint to the five-eighths marker, chased along the fence through the turn and into the drive,
made no impact on the top pair but gained the show. TRUTH SEEKER off a bit slow to begin, traveled along the inside then moved out on the turn, raced
four wide to the far turn, stayed in that path through the bend and got edged for the show. JUSTIN'S QUEST raced off the rail then outside the top pair, lost
ground around the far turn and weakened in the lane. DEBT MONGER off a bit slow at the start, tracked off the inside, two wide through the second turn
and weakened.

PYRON stumbled at the start, raced off the pace from inside, saved ground into the stretch, angled out in the lane, closed fast and reeled in the top pair then
drew clear late. KNEEDEEPINSNOW asked early and chased outside the leader, applied pressure around the turn, challenged in the lane, finished well but
was outkicked by the winner. GRINNING TIGER sped clear and angled in, held a short lead over KNEEDEEPINSNOW through the turn and into the stretch,
held command to the sixteenth pole then yielded late. CALIFORNIA STREET off a bit slow to begin, went four wide through the turn and improved position.
CHAMPAGNEONME chased outside a rival then three to four wide around the turn and failed to respond. SURFING STAR traveled mid-pack early on, took
the turn three wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
NEW HEAT set the pace with company to the outside, inched away on the backstretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole and held off the late rally from
ROSE'S CRYSTAL in the final strides. ROSE'S CRYSTAL settled a bit off the rail then went between foes at the half-mile marker, angled four wide into the
stretch, rallied but was too late. ROCKIE CAUSEWAY raced four wide then angled in on the first turn, stalked two wide into the far turn, moved out into the
three path, finished well but could not match the top pair. KEEP DANCING threw head and was off slow to begin, saved ground into the lane, angled off the
rail and passed tired foes. CHEERFUL CHARM pressed the pace from the outside then chased the leader in the two path to the far turn, stayed a bit off the
rail into the drive and faded. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR stumbled leaving the gate, tracked off the rail then outside a pair at the halfway point, shifted out
entering the far turn, went three wide around the bend and weakened. KETCHUP in a bit tight and steadied along the inside early, stalked near the fence to
the stretch and tired.
