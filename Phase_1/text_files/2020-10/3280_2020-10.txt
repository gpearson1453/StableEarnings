Footnotes
CELESTIAL CHEETAH stalked the pace five wide around the first turn, bid four deep nearing the quarter pole, took the lead turning for home, battled
outside the runner-up to midstretch then powered clear in the final furlong. LAOBANONAPRAYER stalked the pace just inside of the winner while racing
four wide between foes around the first turn and three wide between rounding the far turn, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole, battled on
inside of the winner to midstretch, angled out when that foe cleared leaving the eighth pole and was no match late. OUR BELLA NICOLE raced off the pace
three wide around both turns and was along late for the show. POTION prompted the pace in the three path between rivals, took the lead near the
five-sixteenths pole but weakened in the lane. TRIPLE DIGIT never threatened while racing two wide. SPRITZ played no factor while racing two wide.
SINGLE MOM set the pace in the two path and gave way nearing the five-sixteenths marker. MINDING MILLIE was strung out six wide around the first turn,
continued well wide around the far turn and was outrun. SYSTEMATIC was in tight at the start, became very rank soon after, rushed up inside around the
first turn and was through after a half.

Footnotes
LADY MISTRESS pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead inside of the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. RELEASE ME set the pace
in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. STYLISH NINETYNINE raced off the pace three wide and rallied belatedly for the
show. RUBY'S RUSH came in and bumped at the start, raced three wide in midpack and was one-paced in the lane. EXTRAVAGANT MISS tracked the top
two wide while racing in the clear in the four path and lacked a closing bid. LWF DRIVE BYE GAL came out and bumped at the start, raced two wide and
never threatened. WEE ARCH was outrun while racing two wide. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE steadily faded inside. WAKA WAKA was pinched at the start,
raced five wide and made little impact.

LOVELY BROWN settled off the pace along the inside, split rivals leaving the quarter pole, quickly burst clear and widened under a drive. MAGICGIRL
saved ground off the pace and rallied for the place. MISS SOONER GIRL raced well back two and three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. KELCIE'S MANDATE dropped back early, raced three wide around the first turn, made a strong wide move down the backstretch, bid three wide
into the far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, could not match strides with the winner, lugged in in midstretch and weakened. DYNAMIC MISS failed
to menace while racing three wide. SMART RED never threatened while racing two wide. SO WHO'S BACK saved ground to no avail. TROPICAL FROSTY
set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. LITTLE MS BROADWAY had early speed four wide, steadied getting out around the first turn and
made little further impact. TARALLUCCI pressed the pace two wide and tired around the far turn. OCEAN DELIGHT had brief speed three wide. AGAVE
QUEEN chased five wide and was through early.

RUNAWAY LUTE stalked the pace from the rail, cut the corner into the lane, seized command in upper stretch, battled inside of rivals through the lane and
dug in to prevail. EGO MAN stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms nearing the quarter pole, battled between rivals through the lane and just
missed a game effort. ANNAMATED MOON was in tight early, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, moved quickly into contention
but could not get past the top two. HAUNTEDBYTHEMUSIC stalked the pace four wide, battled five wide through the lane and was outfinished. BOURBON
STREET set the pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. WONDER IN trailed outside.

Footnotes
FERNWOOD DRIVE set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE chased the winner three wide between rivals and
stayed on to maintain the place. NO FLY ZONE chased the pace three wide between rivals, angled in nearing the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the
needed rally. MISTER MISTER saved ground and never threatened. PURRS AGAIN failed to menace while racing two wide. TRAVELIN GAMBLER chased
the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. FOREFRONT veered out at the start, trailed outside and had the rider lose the whip near the quarter
pole.
