gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch faded. HARMONY HALL was in touch early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

ENHANCED FINANCE stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best.
PENNIESFROMABOVE tracked the leaders from the inside, had a bid from between foes on the turn and vied through the stretch but was no match for the
winner. PRINCESSA FIONA was unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and was up for show. SASSY SECRET was in range and raced evenly on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. SNOW SCENE was in touch and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. MAXIMA ONLY was hustled early, set the pace but was headed on the turn and had nothing left.

DOT'S VISION showed speed from the inside, had a slim lead on the far turn, took command through the stretch and was much the best. PERLARANA
tracked the leaders from the inside, had a good position on the far turn and was up for place. UNCLE GRUMPY was in range and raced evenly on the far
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. KILKENNY PROSPECT showed speed from the outside and forced the pace on the far
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch weakened. ONE POUND STERLING was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the far turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch flattened out. HIGH SOCIETY was off the pace, showed little and had no impact. LEO THE RABBIT was in touch and
saved ground on the far turn but had no rally.

VICTORIAN MOON was unhurried early, gained ground on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch drew clear. HASN'T HIT ME YET
showed speed, had a slim lead on the turn but with the lead in mid stretch failed to hold. MOLLYTARA was off the pace, moved up on the turn and gained
gradually through the stretch. TACKLE THE NORTH was up close and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out.
STARDUST KITTEN was off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but failed to fire. FLATOUTONAMISSION was hustled from the outside and dueled on
the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. MYSTERY DAY was well back, bumped a rival on the turn and lost his iron. DOWN
WITH BROWN was hustled from the inside, pulled up on the turn and was vanned off.

MY MARC ANDRE stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and with the lead at the top of the stretch drew off. CHILLING SECRET was in touch
and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. SOFIA'S SLUGGER showed speed and set the
pace, had the lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch gave way. ICE CHALLENGE broke poorly and had a mild gain on the far
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch evened out. LOQUACIOUS had no speed and was roused on the far turn but had no response. BREAD
CRUMBS was in mid pack early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. COBILOCO was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. FRONT NINE was in range, hustled along on the turn and from the seven path at the
top of the stretch was up for show. UNYIELDING was off the pace, saved ground on the turn and was the best of the rest. BUTLER'S PICK stalked the early
leader and forced the pace on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. EVER SO D'WILD set the pace and had a slim lead
on the turn but gave way. MOCAL was up close early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

MAKE NO MISTAKE was up close, had the lead on the far turn and with a clear lead in mid stretch held sway. CAPOEIRA was unhurried early, in tight on
the far turn and rallied late. TALE OF PERFECT LA was in mid pack and roused on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more.
CEE'S OVERTURE forced the early pace and dueled on the far turn but had nothing left. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) was well back, saved ground on the far
turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. SILENT CHARITY was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but was no real threat. LEON AZUL had no
speed and was hustled along on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. IT'SNICETOBENICE was off the pace and had a
mild gain on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. GIOVANNA PONTI was in range and had a good position on the
far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. OUR PETUNIA set the pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.

Footnotes
SHAMRUCKUS set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. NO QUESTION was in touch, a
factor on the far turn and had a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch while all out. SECRETARIATS HONOR was unhurried early, moved up on the
far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. COURT REPORTER was in range and roused on the far turn but from the three
path at the top of the stretch needed more. SHOW ME THE PRIZE stalked the early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but had nothing left.
BLONDILIKESTODANCE was well back and saved ground on the far turn but was never a threat. MEET YOU AT HOME was in mid pack but chased on the
far turn and failed to fire. I MISS YOU had no speed and showed little while outrun. CONQUEST RAPIDUNO was off the pace, lost ground on the far turn
and was empty. MUNCH AND CRUNCH lost the rider on the first turn.
