Footnotes
PLAY CHICKEN broke well and stalked inside then moved outside the leader, bid midway through the turn, led at the quarter pole, cleared
DISCRETIONARY DAY inside the furlong grounds then held over a rallying WARRENS CANDY MAN in the final strides. WARRENS CANDY MAN stalked
outside a rival then off the rail, chased two wide into the stretch, rallied and was gaining to the wire. DISCRETIONARY DAY had early speed and made a
clear lead before angling to the inside, set the pace to the far turn then fought with the winner around the turn and into the stretch, weakened in the final
furlong and held the show. BLUE STAR shuffled back between rivals early, raced three wide into the first turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch, drifted out in
the lane and kept on for a minor award. BIG STORY bumped and steadied early, pulled from inside on the first turn, chased along the rail to the stretch,
came off the fence and lacked a bid. J C EXPRESS came in and bumped rival early, settled in the early going, raced two wide then saved ground into the
stretch and was never a factor. STARS OF BLUEGRASS steadied early inside, checked off heels near the three-quarter pole, chased from inside then two
wide, angled in upper stretch and never threatened.

CAL'S GEM stalked the pace outside, bid four wide around the turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear and held well under hand safely late.
STARSHIP CHEWBACCA bumped leaving the gate, pressed from inside, in a bit tight and steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, remained inside through
the turn and proved second best. ME MACHO forwardly placed three deep early, chased off the rail then drifted out a bit into the drive and stayed on for a
clear third. CRANKIN tossed head and came away a bit slow but recovered quickly to move up to take control, set a pressured pace off the rail, cleared
briefly before being challenged again on the turn, lost command nearing the quarter pole and gave way. PAUL L broke in and bumped rival at the start,
chased between then two wide into the turn, angled in around the bend and faded. BULLET TIMES dropped back early, raced off the rail to the stretch and
was outrun.

SHANGHAI TRUFFLES stalked the top pair along the inside, angled out on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, bid three deep in stretch, cleared and
inched away. SOLITAIRE raced off the pace near the rail, angled out around the second turn and entered the stretch four wide, chased through the lane
then summoned a late bid and earned the place. SABINOS PRIDE pressed the pace from outside, bid between foes in upper stretch, lacked the needed
late punch but saved the show. LAVENDER (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, went three then two wide around the first turn, traveled off the rail to the far
turn then angled to the rail around that bend, rallied up the inside in the lane and missed the show. SOOTHING set the pace with a rival to the outside,
carried a short lead to the stretch, resisted through the drive then yielded late. MESO allowed to settle in the early going, entered the stretch three wide and
came up empty.

SEPTEMBER SECRET stalked behind the top pair along the inside, moved out into the two path on the turn then further out upper stretch, roused in the
drive and wore down rival in the final furlong to prove best. DANCING DANA pressed the pace from outside, headed rival at the three-eighths pole, gained
command then moved clear past the quarter pole, responded when challenged by the winner and yielded grudgingly while clearly second best. EXCHANGE
VOWS stalked three deep early, outside a rival on the turn and three wide into the stretch, made no impact on the top pair and held the show.
RIGHTEOUSLY chased between rivals up the backstretch, lost ground on the turn then swung out into the stretch and weakened. MUCHA WOMAN set the
pace under pressure and angled to the inside, headed at the three-eighths pole, was trying to get out on the turn as the rider corrected with the left-reign,
then faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
Y NOT SIZZLE stalked the pace along the inside to the stretch, tipped out and collared leader past the eighth pole, took command then inched away.
DANCEFORMUNNY stalked from the inside, lacked room near the quarter pole, remained inside then angled out near the sixteenth pole and edged rival for
second. A THOUSAND DREAMS set the pace inside, inched away from outside rival, saved ground into the lane, challenged from the outside and led to the
eighth pole, lost command shortly after and got edged for the place. SUNRISER unhurried in the early stages, raced off the rail then angled four to five wide
into the stretch and closed well. INVINCIBELLA (GB) chased from between rivals then two wide around the far turn, bothered by inside rival and checked at
the quarter pole, then failed to rally in the final furlong. LISTEN TO BLUE settled off the inside, raced three then four wide into the stretch and improved
position. MARIAH GIRL (ARG) prompted the pace from outside, lost contact with the leader and chased two wide to the stretch and weakened. MISS
BENNET traveled near the back of the pace along the inside, saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor. BELLA FIGURA (IRE) stalked three
wide to the lane and faded.

Footnotes
HAPI HAPI tracked off the rail, bid three deep past the five-sixteenths pole, gained the lead leaving the bend, kicked clear at the eighth pole and geared
down near the wire. STREET BEHAVIOR stalked off the inside, bid between rivals around the far turn, fought with HAPI HAPI in the drive but was outkicked
in the final furlong. MEADWAY stumbled leaving the gate, raced near the fence in range of the pacesetter, tipped out into the two path on the second turn,
finished with a mild rally and earned the show honors. SUMMER FUN set the pace a bit off the rail, challenged by a pair of rivals approaching the quarter
pole, could not offer much resistance from inside and weakened. VEGAS MOON raced five wide into the first turn then angled down into the two path,
traveled outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PAPA'S HONEY forwardly placed early, asked once left-handed at the halfway
point, lost ground around the far turn and tired in the lane. GONE AWOL off slow from the outside to begin, angled in entering the first turn, dropped back
into the far turn, eased around the bend and coasted in just passing the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
FACTORIAL away quickly at the start, vied outside COLT FICTION for the lead early, cleared that rival into the turn, angled to the rail, urged right-handed in
the drive and remained clear. COLT FICTION showed early speed and vied with FACTORIAL up the backstretch, steadied briefly into the turn, chased two
wide into the stretch and held the place. KRIS' WILD KAT chased between rivals early, raced two then three wide into the stretch and finished willingly
alongside COLT FICTION through the final furlong. GREGDAR stalked from inside, steadied off the heels of COLT FICTION into the turn, stayed inside to
the stretch and finished evenly. GO TIME settled off the pace, went two wide into the turn moved to the rail around the bend and never rallied.
ANTITHETICAL chased three deep, two to three wide into the stretch and weakened. STRIKE IT LUCKY settled off the rail, took the turn three wide and
proved no menace. COMBAT ZONE stumbled badly at the start, trailed the field early, angled out in the lane and was never a factor. GOLDEN IMAGE
tracked the speed off the rail, angled in on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
TETON VALLEY sped clear early, inched away around the turn, lost the whip as the rider tried to switch hands past the eighth pole but still held under hand
urging. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER stalked outside the leader, raced outside a rival then three wide into the stretch, chased through the lane then found late
response and was gaining to the wire. MOVING FAST stalked outside a rival, traveled two around the turn, moved out in the lane and outfinished ALPINE
THUNDER for the show. ALPINE THUNDER stumbled leaving the gate, moved up to chase from the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the lane then angled
out in upper stretch and lost the show. CARELESS KITTEN raced off the rail up the backstretch, took the turn three wide and was never a factor. MY CHILD
SBUD in range early, entered the turn four wide, angled down into the two path around the bend, then tired in the stretch. CLUB CAL off slow to begin,
chased five wide into the turn, angled in some and came three to four wide into the stretch and faded.

WARREN'S SHOWTIME settled off the pace outside a rival or two wide, raced off the rail up the backstretch, entered the far turn in the two path then
angled out around the bend, came four wide into the stretch, rallied late and edged a pair of rivals under right-handed urging and strong handling. GOING
TO VEGAS settled in the early going, came three wide into the stretch, rallied through the lane and fought between rivals late but was outclosed by the
winner. NASTY stalked the leader early, closed in nearing the far turn, bid outside around the bend, gained the upper hand into the stretch, cleared that rival
past the eighth pole but got outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch. GUITTY (FR) off slow to begin, raced along the inside then two wide into the far turn,
angled out around the bend and exited five wide, finished well but was not able to make an impact on the top trio. CROUGHAVOUKE (IRE) unhurried in the
beginning, traveled two wide then angled to the rail, moved out into the two path once more on the far turn, asked in the lane but failed to find more. QUIET
SECRETARY set the pace from inside, challenged around the far turn, lost command into the lane and gave way. MIND OUT off slow to begin, tracked the
pace from inside, saved ground into the stretch and weakened.

SAVING SOPHIE stalked from inside, saved ground through the turn, steered out in the drive and reeled in the runner-up. SAVE THE STORY sped clear
early, widened up the backstretch, held a diminished but comfortable lead into the stretch, urged right then left-handed in the lane and could not hold off the
winner. PRINCESS TALE traveled two wide into the turn, moved to the rail around the bend, angled out at the top of the lane and finished well for a clear
third. MAGICAL SMILE stalked in the two path and weakened while holding on for minor award. WITH A WHISPER off a bit slow to begin, hustled early,
chased well off the inside, went five wide into the turn then angled down into the three path and never responded to urging. NICOLE GRACE tossed head
and came away slowly from the inside, steered out early, went four wide through the turn and improved position. MISS MOZART bumped by outside rival at
the start, settled off the pace, took the turn three wide and failed to rally. BAILATINO traveled at the back of the pack, raced two wide then moved to the rail
around the bend, tipped back out into the two path leaving the turn and never made an impact. DADDYTELLSASTORY broke in and bumped rival at the
start, chased four wide into the turn, angled into the two path and was never a factor. MIRA LOMA MADAM trailed the field widest up the backstretch, went
four wide around the turn and failed to threaten.
