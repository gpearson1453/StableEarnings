Footnotes
BURNIN RING O FIRE took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was steadily
handled in the lane to hold on well. THE CREEP was hustled with the pace through the front stretch then stalked the first turn, challenged approaching the
three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but couldn't improve in the lane. BLIMEY LIMEY settled off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the
three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail then ran evenly to mid-stretch before flattening stride. CHARITABLE HERO saved ground well off the
pace then bid, to no avail, leaving the three eighths pole. ORILEYS TYPHOON settled off the early pace in the four path, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT IDEAS saved ground off the early pace then started a bid into the backstretch, circled rivals in the five path of the far turn, dug in at the head of
the lane and dueled through the final yards to take the edge. WINTER IS HERE angled in to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the five
sixteenths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn, was caught in the final yards but held on for
second. I'MOVERTHEMOON stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, challenged from the five sixteenths and
continued close to the finish. DEPUTY BEE raced in the three path the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three
eighths, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. BRO LATTE rounded the first turn in the four path and entered the
backstretch outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn four wide then flattened stride. DEPUTY JAMES stalked the pace inside,
picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. MASTER YOO settled off the pace in the three and four paths
the first turn then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, but showed little response.

TRIPLE BAD came away a step slow then stalked three wide the first turn, started an outside bid past the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the
far turn and dug in from the head of the lane to take over the final strides. OPERA NITE angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure from the
seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, dug in determinedly to best the game effort of ELLIE'S LIL MAN but was
nipped from the win the final strides, while the latter of whom stalked the early pace off the rail then challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at a
close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. WILLIAM AND MARY settled back off the rail the first turn then eased out
entering the backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole and raced three wide on the far turn, then eased out in the upper stretch and flattened
stride. FEAR THE TURTLE saved ground just off the early pace, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn then
weakened. STEP OUT DANCING came away a step slow and raced well back. OWEN'S WAY rounded the opening turn off the rail, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
MOON ME AGAIN was hustled inside to take the lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled with the advantage nearest the rail on the turn then dug in
under steady encouragement to hold on well. ASHARA pressured the pace three wide and raced close off the rail rounding the turn, angled inside the
winner in the upper stretch but couldn't improve significantly. WHOA BLACK BETTY gave chase and rounded the turn in the four path, eased out in the
upper stretch, got up for third mid-stretch and finished well. COLETTE'S SPIRIT chased the pace and rounded the turn off the rail then finished evenly.
ADDY'S LOVE engaged in close early chase, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little more. TIDAL FIELD chased the pace, rounded the turn at the rail
then weakened. DISCREET ENERGY gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path. MONGOLIAN ANGEL raced well back and rounded the
turn off the rail.

YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY stalked off the rail then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn, came inside the drifting
pace-setter in the upper stretch, took over from that one mid-stretch and raced clear the final sixteenth. JUBA DID IT rated the pace inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch, was caught mid-stretch and relented the final
sixteenth. JUST GETS BETTER stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced three
wide on the far turn and dueled for third. SHUTUPN'KISSME stumbled at the break and raced off the pace in the two and three paths, started a bid
approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. THELADYISTRUE raced off the pace inside the
first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. BERNIE THE GAMBLER stalked the early pace in the four path but dropped back through the
opening turn and showed little response down the backstretch.

Footnotes
LOVELY LADY LEXI settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far
turn, drew clear in the upper stretch and was steadily handled to widen. PEACEFUL CHILD angled in to stalk the pace two deep then took the lead leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, raced clear passing the three eighths and rounded the far turn just off the rail, but drifted and was caught in the upper stretch and
had to settle for second. WEDDING DAY KITTEN raced well back saving early ground then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail, eased to the five path leaving the turn and close for third inside the sixteenth pole. BIRD TRAFFIC settled well off the pace in the three path the first turn
then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still in the three path, eased to the outside entering the stretch and passed rivals. TWO IN THE
BUSH saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride inside the eighth pole. POWER
FORWARD rated just off the early pace toward the inside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four
path, then weakened. BOOM BOOM GONE was never a factor. SHE GIVES ME FITS took the lead two deep at the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the
pace, was caught past the seven sixteenths, dropped back nearing the three eighths, rounded the far turn at the rail then gave way.

Footnotes
BAYOU BOUGIE took the lead leaving the chute and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, dueled clear past the quarter pole and was steadily
handled to widen. TUITION PLAN pressured the pace and raced close through the turn but couldn't improve on the winner. DEVELIN' ROSE gave chase
and raced in the three path of the turn then dueled through later yards and was just up for third. HEDGE BURNER pressured the pace through the
backstretch, but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn then flattened stride. CITY PRINCESS chased the pace outside,
rounded the turn in the five path and showed little more. QUEEN OF ANYTHING chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the seven path and
showed little more. IRMA GIRL broke awkwardly and gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and had little left. ELLIE BEAR gave
distant chase and rounded the turn in the four and five paths. SWISS THUNDER pressured the early pace off the rail then weakened at the rail rounding the
turn.
