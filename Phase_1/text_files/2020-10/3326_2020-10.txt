Footnotes
D'ARK FLATTER pressed the pacesetter from the three path through late turn, bid into the lane while still in the three path, asked for more when
straightening, edged up under a hand drive and cleared very late. EL BOHEMIO set the pace while along the inside, maintained a short advantage into the
lane, dueled with the winner while near the inside through the lane then yielded late while well clear of the others. RUH ROH RAGGY was unhurried while
along the inside through the turn, continued along the rail into the lane and moved up for the minor share. G AS IN GEORGE chased the pace while in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane with aim on the top ones then lacked a bid. RUSTPROOF pressed the pace while in the two path through
late turn then had little to offer through the lane. TOTALLY brushed the gate at the start and angled out, raced in the four path through the turn, came into
the lane from the five path and tired. R SOARING LIGHT showed early speed while in the three path into the lane then steadily faded from mid-turn. Per
Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
TRUCKIN' ON set the pace while under early pressure, cleared in late turn and into the lane, continued with a clear lead while under intermittent left-handed
urging and held sway along the inside. SHOTGUN JUSTICE chased the pace from the three path through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the winner
when straightening in the lane, asked for more through the lane and could not gain on the top one while clearly second best. HIGHEST PRAISE raced in the
three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and slowly gained through the final eighth to be up for the show spot. WEBER pressed the
pace two wide into the turn, lost contact with the leader in mid-turn, continued in the two path into the lane and weakened to lose the show spot. BENNETT
bumped at the start then was never a serious threat while racing in the two path through the turn and into the lane. SOUPEDUP STORM CAT stepped in at
the start and bumped rival solidly then was outrun while saving ground. TALK FAST chased the pace while saving ground through the turn and into the lane
then faded. SPIN THE BOW was done early while in the two or three path. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional
three pounds.

Footnotes
MY MAN BECKETT vied for the early lead then settled back into the turn, got through when asked near the five-sixteenths, cleared into the lane then drew
away while drifting out a couple paths through the final sixteenth. ALWAYSBEHUMBLE vied for the early lead with the eventual winner, raced in the two
path through the turn, was passed along the inside approaching the quarter pole, continued in the three or four path into the lane, was no match for the
winner and kept on to be clear for the place spot. CONRAD IN CHARGE chased the pacesetters through the turn while in the three path through the turn
then lacked a bid while coming into the lane from the five path. JUSTICE IN VEGAS raced near the inside through the turn, came off the rail and into the two
path for the drive and just missed the show spot while not a serious threat. CORBIN was never a factor while in the two path. OUR BALDY B raced near the
rail into the lane and tired. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
SUGAR AND SASS settled off the pace and along the inside through the turn, slowly angled off the rail and into the four or five path while having aim on the
leader, caught that one nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drove past. SHOW ME THE BEST set the pace from the two path through the turn and into
the lane, continued clear with an eighth to go then could not hole the winner safe while finishing clear for the place spot. MO CLARE'S stepped out at the
start and brushed with another, raced in the three path through the turn when towards the back, came into the lane from off the rail and moved up while not
a serious threat. EGALITE was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from along the inside and gained belatedly. SOFT N LOVELY chased
the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then weakened. RED BOTTOM REBEL raced in the four path through the turn, came into the
lane from the five path and was never a threat. NIVA was never a factor while in the two path. MYSTIC WARRIOR was in pursuit on the top spot through the
turn and into the lane then faded. TOURIST LIKE ME was bumped at the start and was never in it.Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will
carry an additional three pounds.

ONLY REWARD'S chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane while still in the two path, gained the lead outside the eighth pole
then extended to the wire. TWO CARROT RANSOM was in the two path through the turn, was further off the inside into the lane then was in a drive to gain
the place spot while not a threat to the top one. WANNA HAVE FUN was along the inside through the turn and missed the place spot late. LUCKY FEVER
quickly sprinted clear while well off the inside down the backstretch, was put under tight restraint while entering the turn from the three or four path,
continued in the four path while remaining under a hold and appearing to fight the restraint, came into the lane from the five path, was put under right
handed urging when straightening then continued under a drive while drifting to the eight or nine path late. ITSALLABOUTYOULOU was never a factor while
in the two path.Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.
