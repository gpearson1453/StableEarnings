Footnotes
HERE'S HANNAH broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to force the issue three wide in the
run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn while in pursuit of NORTHERN GRAYSTAR, and closed determinedly in the drive, while
drifting out under vigorous left handed urging to be up in time. NORTHERN GRAYSTAR away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail through the
lane the first time, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to
fend off the late surge of HERE'S HANNAH to get nipped in the final strides. WARRIOR'S PROMISE settled off the dueling leaders while saving ground at
the rail through the stretch the first time, continued to bide her time behind the battling pacesetters in the run down the backstretch, rallied from along the
inside through the final turn, and finished evenly late while unable to threaten the top pair.

Footnotes
GOTTCHA COWBOY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside
and through the final turn, and was all out to fend off PASSING NOTES in the final strides to prevail. PASSING NOTES stalked the leader from the back of a
compact field while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive while
laying in late to just miss. REPRIMAND pressed the pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn,
and finished one out from the rail in the drive. KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away well and stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to hold on for a share. BOWCHICKAWOWWOW away alertly and
stalked the leader from between rivals entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid while finishing
three wide in the drive. MACHINE pressed the pacesetter three wide entering the backstretch, dropped back in the run to the final turn, raced three wide
through the turn, and failed to respond when called upon.

entering the lane and quickly pulled clear. MUSTACHIO broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, forced
the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, but battled gamely to hold the place. FREE

rallied three out from the rail through the final turn, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for a share. SQUARE DANCER settled off the
early pace while racing two wide through the lane the first time, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and improved his position late while
finishing one out from the rail in deep stretch. WISE MARKET away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a

FOOT SOLDIER away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail entering the final
turn, opened a clear advantage through the turn, and was never threatened late. BLUEPRINT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the final
strides. FINDING WAYS pressed the pace three wide entering the first turn, before assuming a tracking trip entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. WE'RE IN COMMAND away well and stalked the leaders into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive in an even effort.
PREDESTINED trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a late
impact. ACCEPT NO OTHER settled off the early pace while racing three wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but
failed to mount a late bid. ATLIN BAY broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

THE ALL BUTTON away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the second
turn, held a clear advantage in the run to the final turn, and was never seriously threatened over the final furlong while being ridden out late. TRUPON
ONLINE broke sharply and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the lane the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch
and through the final turn, and closed from along the rail in the drive to hold on for the place. BETATHANABOYFRIEND stalked the leader through the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to just miss the
place. CRAZY PROPHET settled off the early pace while racing two wide through the stretch the first time, rallied three wide through the final turn, but
needed more late while finishing two out from the rail in the drive. RED BUFFALO away well and settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail
through the stretch the first time, raced into a stalking trip in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside through the final turn, but needed more in the
late stages. WILLING TO TRAVEL unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to menace.
