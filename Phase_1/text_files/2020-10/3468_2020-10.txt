Footnotes
FIRST CLASSS was taken up after the start while pinched back badly between horses, raced well off the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed with a rush to win going away. RB LARA showed good speed and set the
pace, vied from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the lead in upper stretch, fought on well with CALIFORNIA SAND into the final sixteenth and bested
that foe for second while no match for the winner late. CALIFORNIA SAND JS showed speed on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead
in upper stretch, battled with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and just missed the place while no match for the winner but was well clear for the show.
AA RICH MOTHER bumped with a rival at the start, angled in while urged along towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. RB
GAME OVER was unruly behind the gate, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, steadied while lugging in badly in upper stretch,
continued to drift in into the final furlong and had nothing left. LAPCOS BONUS bumped with a foe at the start, showed good speed, dropped back near the
seven-sixteenths, went two to three wide early on the turn then floated five wide later on that bend and came up empty. UPTOWN GEORGIE showed early
speed, dropped back near the half-mile pole, moved from the inside to the three path on the turn and capitulated. WMA SAND FLEE showed early speed
then dropped back near the half-mile pole, moved into the two path on the turn, was off heels briefly while dropping back into the stretch, shifted out
significantly in the final furlong and lacked the needed response. CROWNN THESS broke out bumped with a rival at the start then stumbled and dropped
back quickly, raced well off the pace under urging, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SAND CANYON JS bumped lightly with a foe at the
start, showed early speed, chased inside on the turn and retreated. WMA NORTH WIND raced well back on the outside, went five wide for most of the turn,
dropped to the two path near the quarter-pole and was no factor.
