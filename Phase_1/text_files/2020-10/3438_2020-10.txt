Footnotes
SOUPER COHIBA well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, shook clear, then
drew off and was kept to the task. VERY REPLACEABLE allowed to settle, moved up while angling out through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane,
made a steady gain and edged up for the place. WHISTLE PLAYER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch, then could not gain in the late going and held the show. FIFTY PLUS allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the second turn, bid five
wide into the lane and edged up for a share. TIZ WAY TO GOLD allowed to settle, angled out while moving up through the second turn, fanned widest into
the stretch and evened out. GRAN HOMBRE mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened
the final furlong. IRISH MAIL ran evenly. SIR SWAYSALOT stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid
outside the leader into the lane and weakened in the drive. EMBRACE THE GRIND showed little. AFTER THE MONEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after
the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then steadied inside and faded. BRYAN NOT BRIAN allowed to settle, looped three and four wide
through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no rally.
