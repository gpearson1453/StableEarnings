POST TO POST raced in mid pack along the rail throughout, closed on the far turn, stole the lead at the top of the stretch and drove clear then held under
steady handling. CLAIRESSENCE was bothered by I LOOK INCREDIBLE at the start, settled off the pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn and
finished under a determined drive. LA PAQUITA got away slowly, stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the far turn, challenged mid turn, was outkicked by
the winner and chased through the stretch. SILENT CHARITY settled off the pace, rode the rail throughout, was hustled on the far turn, angled out in the
stretch and rallied gamely. CAROLINA GRACE raced in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then finished gamely through the
stretch. I LOOK INCREDIBLE broke inward and was steadied, raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn but evened out in deep stretch. A
LITTLE VOODOO led quickly, set a reserved pace, was engaged midway through the far turn, gave way at the top of the stretch and faded after a brief
chase. WHAT'S IN A KISS (IRE) settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide from two-wide and the rail on the far turn but never reached contention.

Footnotes
DUE NORTH rushed up inside the early leader to dispute the front, shook off all challengers by late on the turn and had a clear advantage turning for home,
maintaining her margin in the final sixteenth. REDHAIR N FRECKLES was slow early, gradually moved into contention while always four wide, loomed up
turning for home and drove at the leader but could not get closer than a few lengths back, a clear second best while hanging a tad late. QUEEN LICIA
stumbled to her knees and was bumped at the start falling back to last, quickly recovered to commence a long two to four wide rally on the turn, still wide
down the lane and closing fast for the show spot, her start costing her dearly. SHISHKA was between rivals early before dropping back into the turn, came
out to rally three to five wide on the turn and was in behind the eventual place finisher turning for home but her bid could not be sustained, levelling off in the
final sixteenth. DON'T SMILE LILAH moved up outside the early duelers to make it three in a line up front by the quarter pole, stayed in the hunt until the
final furlong when fading from the scene. MAHONE BAY hustled along the rail early to chase the front runners, rallying mildly down the lane without
threatening. CITY FASHION was in the mix early up front before dropping back late backstretch and falling further behind around the turn, only able to pass
a few stragglers late with a mild run. EXQUISE was quick to the lead, the winner coming up her inside to duel her into submission by the quarter pole,
dropping back down the lane. SOLITUDE IS BLISS was in mid pack chasing, no response forthcoming when asked for run midway on the turn. AVENTURA
TRAVIESA bumped with a stumbling rival at the start, trailing by a wide margin throughout, and walked off.

REAL COAL settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, closed into the stretch, angled out then rallied gamely and was up late under a hand ride. EVER
SO D'WILD forced the pace, had the lead near the turn, moved clear, held rivals safe through the stretch until caught by a late runner near the wire. BIG
MISTAKE stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. SPARKLE SAMMY, away slowly, settled off the
pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but failed to threaten. MIZZONA forced the pace late backstretch, stalked on the turn, rallied gamely but hung late.
TWIRLING WIND was away slowly and off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn then finished evenly. FRESH PRINCESS was also off slowly,
settled in range, was hustled four-wide on the turn but evened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
AMALFI COAST sat a perfect pocket trip along the rail in behind the three pace challengers, got a dream run up the inside when the rail opened up as the
leaders drifted out and tired, sprinted clear at the eighth pole and widened to the wire. SOUPER ESCAPE was three to four wide chasing the pace trio on
the turn, loomed dangerously turning for home but the perfect trip winner was long gone, only able to drive by the tiring pace survivor inside the seventy yard
pole for second. PAINTING was between rivals in behind the pace setters around the turn, had to wait for traffic to clear until a sixteenth out and closed best
of the rest to make it interesting for the second spot late. VICTORY KINGDOM (AUS) was three wide stalking and pressing the pace while under a hold, put
away her pace pals but the winner was already in front by the time that happened, then tired late and lost a few more positions in the final seventy yards.
MAGIC SPELL trailed the field two to four wide on the turn and tipped out into the six path down the lane, closing mildly to pass a few tired foes late in the
stretch. O'KEEFFE was on the engine being stalked and pressed by two rivals, led marginally until upper stretch when tiring and drifting off the rail,
retreating from that point to the wire. SUMMER SUNDAY pressed the front between rivals, began to leak oil as they turned for home and retreated down the
stretch.
