Footnotes
MRS. DANVERS away in good order, rated well stalking INVALUABLE from the two path, inched up towards that foe after departing the backstretch,
loomed boldly prior to spinning into the stretch, got given her cue in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, went at it directly abreast of the nemesis the
entire length of stretch, with the pair trading off bumps and leans with each other, proved at the end that neither jockey nor mount could be intimidated and
gamely got the job done. INVALUABLE broke on top and established the front end in short order, cut over to the rail approaching the conclusion of the
backstretch, was held in reserve leading the way, with an equally well held MRS. DANVERS in accompaniment in the two path, was the first of them to have
its rider commit to a drive, this happening at the quarter pole, started to go at it eye to eye with the top one shortly afterwards, saw a series of contact
between them occur at intervals from the three-sixteenths pole onward, dug in determination but got nailed in the shadow of the wire. SAY MOI saved
ground for the opening three-quarters, angled three wide into the stretch, proved no match. MRS. S strung out four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch
one path farther off the rail, got outfinished for third. SO DARN HOT pursued the pace from path three on the turn, got put to a drive at the five-sixteenths
marker, tipped into the four path stepping onto the top of the lane, backed away.

Footnotes
HONEY PANTS coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, drew
clear under a drive to prevail. SO ENCHANTING along the inside early on, grew a bit rank under restraint off the heels of the aforementioned foe until tipped
out to the two path nudging MIDNIGHT CHOIR three wide, tracked just off the inside patiently handled in close aim of the leader, got set down spinning just
off the inside for home, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. MISS BRAZIL four to five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show
honors. MIDNIGHT CHOIR lunged slightly at the break, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. COWORTH PARK coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. MUN LUV five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn and came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and tired. MAGICAL CHARM broke in at the start bumping PEACE
NICKER, chased three then two wide from near the rear, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, tired and was reported to have
bled. PEACE NICKER bumped at the start by MAGICAL CHARM who broke inwards, chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path through
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

MONEY RIDE off a half beat slow after taking an initial awkward step, steadily advanced towards the front runners on the backstretch, was in path three
joining up with them as the first fraction was being finalized, contended for the top as the outermost of a trio as the field made its way on the turn, got called
upon for more settling onto the top of the lane, emerged with the advantage with approximately a sixteenth to go and edged away. SIENA MAGIC the
quickest out of the starting gate, retained the lead, got moved over to the rail, left the half mile pole as one of three front runners vying for control, got set
down as the half was being completed, relinquished in the vicinity of the sixteenth marker, narrowly held the place. FED FUNDS tracked the pace
loosely-pocketed, swung out four wide into the lane, gained ground steadfastly, fell short of snagging away second. WICKSTERS DREAM set up in the two
path, fought for the top from between rivals from the top of the turn until the sixteenth late before weakening late. CAVARADOSSI took up the chase two to
three wide on the turn, fanned out into path four from upper to midstretch, lacked the necessary response. AMERICAN RULE never made his presence felt
while undergoing a ground-saving journey. SOUTHERN BRIDGE raced towards the back of the pack stationed in the two path, was about as wide entering
the turn, had no offering.

Footnotes
BAY STORM sat in range from path two, tipped to the outside heading for the top of the lane, was given her cue a sixteenth later, closed in, poking a head
down in front by the beginning of the final furlong, steadily kicked clear. O'GOTTEN GIRL remained forwardly placed after narrowly breaking on top,
prompted the pace from the two path, responded when let out a notch coming up to the half mile pole, turned into the lane, struck the front end, albeit
fleetingly and only by a slim margin, saw the winner take away the lead at the eighth pole, ventured onward with good energy to preserve the place. THIRD
DRAFT unhurried racing on the backstretch, stepped onto the turn from path two, saw the pilot begin to lightly hand urge the mount, flashed interest nearing
the five-sixteenths marker, angled four wide into the lane, took off with good energy springing from the furlong marker, got headed for second. EVVIE JETS
chased the pace three wide on the turn, got maneuvered into path five early in the stretch, made little headway in the last eighth. MILESTONE PAYMENT
(IRE) gained the advantage shortly after the field had been sent off and running, moved over to the rail, fended off a pair of opponents to her outside from
the top of the bend until its end, didn't offer up much resistance when challenged, yielded, then steadily weakened. NYTHINGZPAZIBLE pinched at the
start, pursued the pace from the two path on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, never made her presence felt. BABA corrected
after breaking to the outside, kept watch from the pocket, left the five-sixteenths marker under a brisk hand ride, cut the corner, tired. MY TOMMY LEE
remained along the rail, rode it to the quarter pole, failed to fire when tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch and backed away. ACTUALLY saved
ground for the opening half, got steered out four wide spinning into the lane, had no rally.

coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied splitting foes near the three-sixteenths threading a seam as MACHO BOY

AMERICAN STAR six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. QUINTARELLI coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the

MY AMANJENA to his outside and DIANNESIMPAZIBLE threading a seam to his inside at the three-sixteenths as MACHO BOY drifted out weakening
forcing the pressure, got pinched out between foes at the eighth pole and never recovered. FOTIS brushed at the start by VITESSE who broke outwards,
chased five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. I SAW IT ALL vied from the three path between
foes, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took narrow and brief command before being headed by MACHO

Footnotes
GIGGLE FACTORY three wide on both turns, got set down to a hard drive as three-quarters was being completed, turned into the lane accompanied by the
second place finisher, closed the gap in unison with that opponent, reached even terms with KITTEN'S ROMANCE by the sixteenth marker, vied with vigour
between foes thereafter, gamely got the job done. CHEROKEE SONG three wide on the clubhouse bend, took up the chase from path four on the
subsequent one, was called upon for more spinning into the lane, narrowed in on the one to catch teamed up with the eventual winner, saw a three-way
tussle get sparked off with approximately a sixteenth go, fought on with determination, got denied. WICKED HAPPY took up the chase two to three wide
until the quarter pole, shifted out towards path four for the drive, gained steadily down the center of the course to be along for the show. KITTEN'S
ROMANCE cut over to the inside with advantage, vied with FLY FIGHT WIN for control, although able to do so with a lane of separation between them, had
that opponent back off after the first fraction had been finalized, showed the way afterwards rated on an open lead, was coming up to the three-sixteenths
marker when finally turned loose, saw its lead steadily dwindle down, got pounced upon by the top twosome beginning from around the sixteenth pole,
yielded to their combined assault and weakened. HARD WON strung out four wide early, chased the pace from path three on turn two, got steered back into
path four for the stretch run, rallied mildlly. RAPIDO GATTA tracked the pace from the pocket, was under a ride cutting the corner into the stretch,
weakened. STARRY HOPE three wide on the first turn, sat reserved in path two afterwards, went three wide into the lane, lacked the needed response.
SPRING TO SUMMER cut over to the rail midway on the backstretch, went on to save ground to no avail. ROMA CARPE saved ground until the quarter
pole, angled four wide into the lane, had no offering. DUSTINTHEWIND checked while appearing unsettled on the first turn, rode the rail for over six
furlongs, got spotted in the four path at the head of the stretch, never made its presence felt. FLY FIGHT WIN vied for the top three wide while keen during
the opening phases, was taken back to assume a stalking role on the backstretch, got guided over to the rail by the half mile pole, was steadied running out
of run at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LAST JUDGMENT inside briefly after the start tipped out to chase two then three wide from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out eight wide into upper stretch, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth and was up at the wire to score.
PETE'S PLAY CALL coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn advancing to
pressure the leader nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, dug in under threat and
was nailed in the very last jump to the finish. CHATEAU hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and drifted out nearing the sixteenth pole before being collared at that station, then
weakened in the late stages to the finish. MAD MUNNYS chased along the inside down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. HIGH VELOCITY hustled from the start, chased along the
inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MO GOTCHA chased three to four wide
under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. CUCINA three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and was outrun.

TAPIT TODAY sat forwardly placed three wide for over three-quarters, settled in upper stretch and was turned loose, whittled away the deficit, enough so as
to begin the final furlong on near even terms with MITCHELL ROAD, slowly ground her way past a resolute foe to the front end, before kicking comfortably
clear in the final seventy yards. MITCHELL ROAD established the top in short order, got rated showing the way, attended by SWEET BYE AND BYE out in
the two path, continued along on the same set up for the first six furlongs, made it into the stretch and was switched to stronger handling, saw the top one
chip away at the margin, put up a fight but got bested by TAPIT TODAY in the last eighth. SHE'S GOT YOU (GB) sluggish at the start, was at or near the
two path in pursuit of the front runners during the initial stages, was gradually maneuvered into path four travelling on the far turn, fanned out into path six,
becoming the widest of all, from upper to midstretch, mustered up a good kick to earn the show award. FEEL GLORIOUS (GB) saved ground to the quarter
pole, angled five wide entering the stretch, rallied mildly. CALL ME LOVE (GB) kept an eye on the pacesetter from the pocket, rider applying a snug grip
early, briefly awaited options coming up to the end of the second bend, got moved out into path two early in the stretch run, came up empty. ALTEA (FR)
took the inside route, swung out four wide entering the stretch, got outfinished. SWEET BYE AND BYE prompted the pace from path two until the
three-sixteenths pole, folded. STORY TIME along the outside throughout, chased the pace from path two until the end of the backstretch, departed it from
path three, got steered into path five for the drive, gave way.

SILKY BLUE shied out at the start filling the space left vacant by the outwards breaking HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH and was corrected, chased just off the
inside from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out for a seam and
nudged TRADEABLE into PURE BODE forcing TRADEABLE to pause in tight between foes, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking
command near the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish in hand in the final jumps to the wire. FRESCO tracked the pace along the inside from
mid pack, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied into contention nearing the eighth pole and was forced to steady in behind the pair of
ALPHADORA and VIOLENT POINT just inside the eighth pole before able to alter out re-engaged by the rider, then offered up a mild kick to just secure the
place honors in the final strides to the finish. KINKY SOX shied in at the start filling the space left open by the inwards breaking TRADEABLE and bumped
that foe between rivals, chased three to four wide from near the rear early on, advanced through the turn to mid pack coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied into prominence a furlong out, ran on to the finish getting just nabbed for the place honors while
safe for the show. PURE BODE got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, got brushed nearing the eighth pole by TRADEABLE when SILKY BLUE tightened
the seam to her inside, then offered up a mild bid kicking on belatedly for the last major share. TRADEABLE broke in at the start bumping PURE BODE in
tandem with HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH, then got bumped by KINKY SOX who shied in from the outside, chased three wide from mid pack coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, raced between foes and had SILKY BLUE tip out with three-sixteenths to run
and was forced to pause and steady when brushing PURE BODE in tight now between those rivals, gained clearance a furlong out roused once more and
improved position to the finish. VIOLENT POINT broke out at the start bumping DATA ANALYTICS, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader,
got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads before seizing command nearing the eighth pole, came
under threat inside that station, got collared near the sixteenth marker and weakened in the late stages. DATA ANALYTICS got bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe who broke outwards, raced three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under urging at the three-eighths, continued three wide
into upper stretch and weakened. ALPHADORA established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under
pressure near the quarter pole, got roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads with VIOLENT POINT and was
displaced from command nearing the eighth pole, kept on inside that station briefly before weakening through to the finish. DRAGONESS two to three wide
in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. HIGH
SCHOOL CRUSH broke out at the start bumping PURE BODE in concert with TRADEABLE, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. MAGICAL ROMANCE just off the inside near the rear of the field,
remained on hold until set down angled four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MONIFICENT chased along the inside under coaxing from
three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home and tired.
