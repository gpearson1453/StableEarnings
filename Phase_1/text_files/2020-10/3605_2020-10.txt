WHAT GOES ON TOUR set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane then drew off down the lane under a steady drive. MAGIC SOLUTION bobbled at
the start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. CARRY ON was a bit slow at the start and
trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. LOOKIN AT SWEETIE raced up close early on, was shuffled
back along the turn, off the rail into the lane, came again and improved position late. LADY DOMINANCE tracked the pace early, was on the inside into the
lane and faded down the lane. LONGDRINKOFWATER pressed the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and empty in the stretch drive.
SHENANDOAH FLASH was through after a half. POST CODE ENVY was done early. PER RULING FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION,
CARRY ON WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
SHASHASHAKEMEUP tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, put away the early
pace setter approaching the furlong pole, then lasted from COLTONATOR's late charge. COLTONATOR saved ground off of the pace, advanced inside of
UNCORK THE BOTTLE turning for home to be right behind the leaders in upper stretch, but lacked room to split those foes approaching the furlong pole,
switched outside of them passing that marker, then produced a late rally, but ran out of ground. HIGH PROOF was washed out pre-race, cleared off down
the backstretch, held that margin around the turn, but was headed by the eventual winner in upper stretch, and yielded through the final furlong. UNCORK
THE BOTTLE chased the loose leader from the two path, but was outkicked by an inner and an outer foe in upper stretch. STAY HAPPY raced off of the
pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. SNOW MAN trailed the field in the two path around the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
LAKER MAMBA hit the gate at the start, recovered to inside stalking position early on, saved ground close to the pace, tipped outside of the leader passing
the quarter pole, blew past that foe at the three sixteenths pole, and widened under driving pressure thereafter. INCITATUS set the pace along the inside,
but was headed by the eventual winner at the three sixteenths pole, quickly proved no match, and stayed on to be a clear second best. BIG POWER RED
saved ground in midpack, advanced inside of foes turning for home, forged show while shifting to the three path passing the quarter pole, and held that
position to the wire without making headway. GHOSTLIGHTER raced far off of the pace two wide and between horses around the far turn, but was held up
behind traffic turning for home, tipped inwards in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor reward. MR. PETERKIN tracked from midpack four wide, then
three to four wide around the far turn, but failed to menace. AMERICAN PATROL dwelt at the start, trailed the field around both turns, shifted from the three
path to the seven path through upper stretch, but failed to make an impact. REPO ROCKS was off slowly and shied from an inner foe, raced far off of the
pace in the two path into the first turn, then in the four path around the far turn before swinging to the six path turning for home, but failed to factor. MR.
BRUTUS raced off of the pace two wide, but was done early. LOUMO prompted the pace two wide, then between horses around the far turn, but weakened
turning for home. MAJESTIC SUMMER lied forwardly placed three wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MOTOWN MUSIC tracked the leading group from midpack, shifted five wide turning for home, then rallied outside of foes through the final furlong under a
long drive, and just got up at the wire. LAKE NIMROD broke inwards at the start, rushed through the early stages to an inside stalking position, tracked from
the pocket around the turn, tipped three wide passing the quarter pole and commenced a grinding rally, bid for the lead at the sixteenth pole, forged a
narrow advantage approaching the wire, but was nailed by an oncharging outer foe. LONG TERM THINKING chased the loose leader two wide, inched
closer into the turn to bid for the lead at the three furlong pole, drew away from his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, built a clear advantage, but
was tested by LAKE NIMROD passing the furlong pole, led to the sixteenth pole, but was bested by that foe and another rival approaching the wire. NILES
CHANNEL saved ground far off of the pace, and sustained a rail rally through the lane. DECISION MAKER was off slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide
around the turn, tipped to the five path through midstretch, and chased the leaders home while making mild progress. NIGHT CANDY was off slowly, then
got outrun before passing tired foes through the lane. CHASING ANNA tugged clear early on, but was headed passing the three furlong pole, weakened
passing the quarter pole, and stopped through the lane. SCHOCHOH lied forwardly placed in the four to three path around the turn, but got floated back to
four wide passing the quarter pole, then weakened in midstretch, and stopped.

Footnotes
WAR LIKE GODDESS trailed the field while shifting down to the two path around the first turn, then saved ground around the second and third turns,
advanced inside of foes turning for home, then produced a swift blitz along the rail in upper stretch, drew clear approaching the furlong pole, and was ridden
out to the wire. THREE FLAMINGOS vied three to two wide around the first turn, forged an advantage down the stretch for the first time, vied inside of a foe
around the third turn, but kicked clear of that rival passing the quarter pole, but proved no match for an inner surging foe approaching the furlong pole, and
proved second best while well clear of show. COILEAN BAWN set the pace along the inside around the first turn, took back to stalk coming through the
stretch for the first time, rated and loomed from the pocket into the third turn, but tipped three wide passing the quarter pole, got outkicked by an inner
surging foe in the process, then stayed on for a minor reward. TRISH THE DISH lied forwardly placed two to three wide, but was outkicked while getting
floated four wide passing the quarter pole, and chased through the lane while holding fourth. STAND TALL tracked from midpack in the three to four path
around each turn, but failed to menace. SURSUM CORDA saved ground far off of the pace, swung to the six path turning for home, but failed to factor.
QUIET DIGNITY stalked along the inside around the first turn, but got rank passing the furlong pole for the first time, progressed to be two wide and
between horses into the second turn, but waited behind traffic turning for home, tipped inwards in upper stretch, and failed to make an impact.
SHIMMERING (IRE) prompted the pace two wide, vied into and around the third turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. BRUNELLA raced off of the
pace two to three wide around the turns, and failed to factor. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY raced off of the pace in the three to two paths around the turns, and
never got involved.

Footnotes
SUBDUED tracked from midpack, split horses two wide into the turn, then produced a three wide bid for the lead while between horses at the quarter pole,
kicked clear from those rivals in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. DRINK was pinched back at the start, tracked from midpack in the four
path, produced a five wide bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was no match for an inner bidding foe in upper stretch. ALLEN took bumps between
horses at the start, stalked along the inside around the turn, produced a rail bid passing the quarter pole, but chased outer foes through the lane. LEA
RIDGE raced far off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the five path turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share. I PROWL ALONE held a clear
margin in the two path around the turn, but weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. WICKED WEDNESDAY stalked two to three wide, bid for
the lead four wide and between horses turning for home, but flattened out in upper stretch. HEY RAY took bumps between horses at the start, trailed along
the inside early on, and was outrun. BLAZED UP raced far off of the pace two wide, but was done early, and showed little.
