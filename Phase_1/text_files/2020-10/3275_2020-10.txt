Footnotes
JAMMING EDDY shifted in and bumped rival at the start, dropped back into a stalking position, angled in nearing the turn, saved ground into the lane,
angled outside the leader and wore down foe in the final sixteenth. THANKS MR. EIDSON sped clear to set the pace, moved to the inside and saved
ground into the stretch, led clear to the furlong marker, finished gamely in the late stages but could not hold off the winner. DUPLICITY had early speed from
outside then chased off the rail, went two wide into the turn then angled to the rail, could not find the needed late kick but stayed on to secure the show.
VANTASTIC tracked between foes into the lane, tipped out and never rallied. GOALIE bumped from the outside at the start, raced three wide or three deep
through the turn, angled out in the stretch and failed to threaten. GINOBILI off a bit slow and shuffled back in the beginning, settled off the pace, raced three
then two wide around the turn and weakened. CALL YOU TOMORROW saved ground into the drive and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FOXBOROUGH stalked the pace from inside, moved off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, bid outside the top pair and edged FREERUNNING
nearing the wire. FREERUNNING away quickly from the gate and took control early, angled to the rail around the first turn, lost command early on the
backstretch then regained the advantage at the nine-sixteenths marker, met the bid from BROKEN FINGER leaving the backtretch, held a narrow lead
through the turn then kicked clear at the top of the lane, led through the drive and was caught nearing the wire. BROKEN FINGER brushed with outside rival
leaving the gate, raced in range of the pace early, bid outside FREERUNNING near the seven-sixteenths pole, challenged around the turn and into the
stretch, lost contact at the top of the lane and flattened in deep stretch. SWTSWNGNGBILLYNAV unhurried in the early stages, raced along the inside then
moved a bit off the rail leaving the second turn, moved further off the rail in the lane and kept on for a minor award. HOLY PALACE went four wide into the
first turn, moved in a bit then back out entering the backstretch, moved up to take over then lost command at the nine-sixteenths pole, steered in
approaching the far turn then lugged out around the bend and had little left. DEPUTY GARY off a bit slow and brushed in the beginning, raced two wide then
off the rail, entered the stretch, two to three wide and and tired.

bit slow and bobbled leaving the gate, went three then two wide around the first turn, tracked in the two path and outside a rival into the far turn, angled four
wide into the stretch, put in a late bid but rallied too late. TAKE HER TEMP up close early outside the leader, chased three wide into the stretch and got
edged for second. WARREN'S MEMORABLE tucked inside on the first turn then steadied off heels around the bend, tracked along the inside the moved out
into the three path on the far turn, drifted inward in the lane and finished evenly for a minor award. CLUBHOUSE SAINT settled a bit off the rail then moved
out entering the backstretch, went four wide through the far turn and into the stretch and proved no menace. LEMON ICE stalked off the rail, four then three
wide around the far turn and faded. BEST LADY chased the pace from off the inside, dropped back on the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn
and was through early.

Footnotes
EBEKO (IRE) raced three wide in range of the lone leader, got fanned four wide into the stretch, bid four deep in the drive and nailed foe at the wire.
TARANTINO traveled along the inside then chased in the two path, went three wide wide into the lane, bid three deep and took a short lead in the final
sixteenth but got nailed on the line. COTOPAXI (IRE) pulled early a bit off the inside, moved to the rail entering the first turn, pulled once more at the
five-eighths pole, remained inside then moved out into the two path around the far turn, bid between runners in the lane, took over with a furlong to go but
was outkicked by the top pair. CAISSON settled early, traveled two wide then a bit further off the rail on the backstretch, moved back into the two path
nearing the far turn, looked to rally but lacked room behind runners at the eighth pole, gained a clear path and finished well. BIG FISH traveled three wide
into the first turn, stayed off the rail then came four wide into the stretch, steered out six wide in upper stretch and flattened out. INGEST set the pace and
angled to the rail, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, overtaken with a furlong to go and folded in the final furlong. DENNIS CELERY traveled
four deep into the first turn, dropped back off the pace, raced outside a rival and two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
EKKLESIA dueled outside of DREAMS OF VALOR, held a short lead around the far turn the lost command at the quarter pole, vied two wide then along the
rail into the stretch, came back inside and proved best. NOLO CONTESTO up close early outside the top pair, bid three deep around the far turn then vied
between, held a short lead into the stretch and finished gamely between runners to the wire. STRONGCONSTITUTION traveled four then three wide around
the first turn, tracked off the inside, bid four wide around the far turn, vied three deep entering the stretch, took over in upper stretch but flattened in deep
stretch. DREAMS OF VALOR dueled for the lead from inside, lost contact with rivals approaching the quarter pole, came off the rail in upper stretch and
kept on to the wire. MONGOLIAN LEGEND entered the first turn five then moved in a path, trailed the field off the inside, raced four then three wide around
the second turn and was never a factor.

rival. PETRUCHIO bothered into the first turn, raced in range of the pacesetter, bid outside on the second turn, headed rival at the quarter pole, led in the
lane, fought with the winner through the late stages and yielded grudingly. HELIOCHROME shifted out entering the first turn, angled to the inside and set
the pace, responded when challenged around the far turn, fought back inside then weakened but held the show. K P AIM HIGH bumped leaving the gate,
drifted out into the first turn, traveled a bit off the rail from off the pace, went three wide into the stretch and showed a mild response. MOUNT PELLIAR
stumbled badly, unhurried and moved to the inside, saved ground into the lane then angled out and improved position. ZOFFA bumped with rival at the
start, chased from inside to the stretch and weakened. TODAY MATTERS floated out into the first turn then angled inside a rival, settled off the pace, saved
ground into the drive and never rallied. FLACTEM LEGACY stalked off the inside, went two wide into the stretch and came up empty.

CANADIAN PRIDE vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals then dueled with HOLDEN THE LUTE into and around the turn and into the stretch, shook free in
the lane and drew away under some right-handed urging and steady handling late. KEYSTONE FIELD had early speed and vied between rivals, dropped
back to chase the top pair three wide around the turn, drifted to the inside in the stretch and proved second best. HOLDEN THE LUTE vied three deep then
dueled outside of CANADIAN PRIDE, lost contact with the winner in upper stretch and weakened to third. DEFENSE WINS chased from along the rail to the
stretch and never produced a bid. MONGOLIAN KINGDOM chased off the rail, raced four then three wide around the turn and weakened. NOREN pulled
early then chased outside a rival, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane and also weakened. AUGUST INDY off slow to begin, lugged out early and trailed the
field, angled in nearing the turn, went two wide into the stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
MADONE unhurried in the early going, swung five to six wide into the stretch, rallied to the front near the furlong grounds and held off the runner-up.
TETRAGONAL (IRE) settled along the inside, angled four wide into the stretch and moved out widest at the top of the lane, rallied outside the winner but
was too late. PIZZAZZ stalked near the rail, moved into the two path around the second turn, angled in at the top of the lane and finished well for the show.
CLOSING REMARKS tracked two wide, went three wide into the lane, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole and missed the show. CANOODLING traveled
three wide around the first turn, remained off the rail into the stretch, bid in the drive and flattened in the late stages. MAXIM STRIDER up close early
outside the leader, pulled up alongside on the backstretch before losing contact with the pacesetter, closed in collared rival around the far turn, took over
approaching the quarter pole, overtaken in the lane and proved no match late. CONSTERNATION (IRE) reserved early on and moved to the inside, saved
ground then tipped out in upper stretch and had little left for the drive. NIMBOSTRATUS (FR) raced off the rail in range, exited the far turn three to four wide
and faded. REIGN OF FIRE had good early speed from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, lost command nearing the quarter pole, was in a bit tight at
the top of the lane, gave way and was eased across the wire.

the pace, went five wide into the stretch and proved second best. FOUND MY BALL chased six deep up the backstretch, four wide into the lane and bested
the rest. ALPINE THUNDER chased three deep early, bumped with rival twice past the half-mile marker, went three wide on the turn and kept on for a minor
award. MOVING FAST bumped from the outside at the start, in a bit tight and checked early, went three to four wide into the stretch and improved position.
DISCRETIONARY DAY chased near the inside, saved ground into the stretch and faltered in the lane. CARELESS KITTEN raced along the inside, steadied
behind rival nearing the quarter pole, angled into the two path and passed tired rivals. CHIEF JACKSON chased five deep early, exited the bend three wide
and weakened. CROSSWORD broke in and bumped rival at the start, forwardly placed between foes, angled in some and entered the stretch a bit off the

Footnotes
CITY RAGE stalked a bit off the rail, ranged up alongside the leader into the stretch, took command shortly after, moved clear past the eighth pole and held
safely in the closing moments. ANTITHETICAL settled early along the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, three wide upper stretch, finished well
and was gaining to the wire. HOOP DREAM stalked the pace near the fence, raced two wide in the stretch, finished willingly between rivals in deep stretch
and gained the show. ALVAARO set the pace and moved to the rail, pressured around the far turn and into the drive, lost command in upper stretch and
edged for the show honors late. BUD KNIGHT raced two wide then angled in on the first turn, stayed inside then angled out at the quarter pole, traveled two
wide into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and gained some ground through the final furlong. JACK SPROUT traveled mid-pack early, raced two
wide and outside a rival on the turn, forced out at the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TROMADOR unhurried through the
early stages, went two wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SHOW BUSINESS checked into the first turn, raced off the rail in range, went three wide
into the stretch and failed to respond when called upon. GENERAL MATHIS trailed the field in the early going, moved out on the far turn then swung seven
wide leaving the bend, lugged inward in upper stretch and was never a factor. PALACE PRINCE raced three wide to the stretch and also was a non factor.
SEVERIN traveled three wide around the first turn, tracked off the rail, forced out at the quarter pole and entered the lane five wide, checked at the top of the
lane and faded.
