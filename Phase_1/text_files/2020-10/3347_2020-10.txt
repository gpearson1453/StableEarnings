MONDAY CONFESSION settled well, advanced on the turn and finished well under steady pressure. ONOMATOPOEIA outrun early, commenced his bid
on the turn and closed ground in the stretch. I'M RIVER led early, was headed on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. KING DEUCE vied between rivals
and was worn down in the stretch. ELUSIVE BLUEBOY never menaced. PREACHER TIME had a wide trip and did not factor. DAAHERS BULLY retreated.
SHO POKE showed little.
