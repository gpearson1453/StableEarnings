Footnotes
WICKED SLIDER stalked the dueling pacesetters into the far turn, tipped three wide to bid into the lane, quickly gained the lead, widened to the sixteenth
pole and was kept to the task. TWISTED MIRACLE chased the two rival duel into the far turn, bid into the lane from the three path, took aim on the top one
but had too much work to do while finishing second best. DEVIL'S CROSS vied for the led while along the inside, was no match for the top two while angling
off the rail near the eighth pole to gain the show spot. D'ARK FLATTER vied for the lead two wide through the turn then gave way entering the lane.
JOHNSTOWN JOHNNY along the inside and was never a factor. CORBIN never made an impact while in the two path through the turns. E Z MAN BAND
was done on the far turn while in the three path. One mile time was omitted due to timer malfunction.

be clear at the wire. WALK ME HOME vied for the lead down the backstretch and through the turn, continued on near even grounds inside the eighth pole,
drifted out two or three paths nearing the sixteenth pole, gained the lead late and was passed by the closing winner very late. DEMETER vied for the lead
two wide and in the three path, continued on near even terms inside the eighth pole then could not keep up with the runner-up late. INCESSANT was in the
four to the three path through the first turn, continued off the inside into the far turn, was three wide in mid-turn when still chasing the pace then tired. RUN
WITH GRACE was in the four path through the first, raced near the inside through the far turn then moved up past tiring rivals. LATE FOR TAPS chased the

Footnotes
ADDISON was unrushed while in the two path down the backstretch, began gaining momentum into the far turn while moving through the two path,
continued with good energy into the lane, swung into the stretch from the five path, caught the leader outside the eighth pole then drove past.
UNUNDERSTANDABLE set the pace while in the two path through the turn and into the lane, stayed with the winner briefly after turning into the lane then
could not keep up while keeping on for the place spot. LADY LAURA chased the pace while along the inside through the turn and into the lane and could
only save the show spot. TURNSTONE was in the three path through the turn and finished evenly. INVETERATE chased the pace from the three path into
the far turn then tired and passed exhausted ones late. FOREVERNOA chased the pace from the four path into the turn, was asked for more near the
three-eighths pole and was empty soon after. I CAME TO PRAISE was done near the three-eighths pole while in the two path.

Footnotes
DOUBLE WHOPPER cleared for the lead before the first call, raced in the two path while widening into the lane, was under steady urging in the last seventy
yards to maintain the diminishing advantage. DREAM PRINCESS was in the five path through the turn, came into the lane from the six or seven path and
gained energy late to be closing in. KHOZYS CROWN was four wide through the turn when moving closest to the winner, continued to chase that one into
the lane while in mid-track then could not manage the needed response while just lasting for the show spot. FACTUAL was unhurried while in the two path
through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and finished well to miss the show spot. JERSEY LILLIE chased the pace along the inside through
the the turn then faded through the lane. PERFECT DIVA was in the three or four path through the turn then passed tired ones. THIEF OF HEARTS was in
the four path through the turn and tired. MOON LOVIN was empty into the lane while saving ground. SWEET GINGER ran off about a quarter of a mild
before loading, chased the pacesetter into the turn while in the three path and was empty entering the lane. MOMMY BERTA was in the two path through
the turn and was never in it while angling off the inside near the eighth pole. MINER'S GEM bobbled at the start, raced far back into the lane then was eased
to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
APRIL'S NO FOOL stalked in the four path, rallied at the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch while kept to task. HITTHEFLOORRUNNING was unrushed
early, bid inside at the quarter pole and gained the place late. STRONG ILLUSION stalked inside, bid at the quarter pole, was three wide in the stretch, then
faded. WILADENE stalked inside, bid on the far turn, then faltered in the stretch. FIRST SQUADRON pressed in the three path, then faded in the stretch.
SECRET SADIE raced outside, then faded in the stetch. FORBIDDEN FRUIT bid in the five path at the three-eighths pole and then faltered in the drive.
BREWSKY was not a factor. AZIPASS was clear early, couldn't last, then was pulled up in the stretch.
