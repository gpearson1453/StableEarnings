SOUPER CATCH bumped with CHARGING LION leaving the gate, pressed two wide outside the early leader, took over early on the final turn, drew out
soon after and widened under urging. GENERAL BELLAMY settled inside, came out into the two path while moving on the final turn then flattened out in the
lane. CHARGING LION bumped with the winner leaving the gate, was unhurried early, began a run along the rail into the far turn, came out two wide
between horses for room approaching the lane then weakened. SUPER VISION wasn't far back outside early, offered a mild three wide bid on the final turn
then had nothing left for the drive. WE B JAMMIN took command at once, made the pace along the rail to the far turn then stopped in the lane. THE BEST
CANDY was outrun. CREATIVE GENIUS was caught wide around both turns and stopped.

HIS ROYAL MAJESTY lagged early, rallied to the front in midstretch and drew out late. TACTICAL PLAN jumped puddles through the opening sixteenth,
was rated on a clear lead in the two path into the final furlong then gave way. MR. SKITTLES chased inside, came out into the three path nearing the stretch
and lacked the needed closing response. ARCH YOU READY came outside on the first turn, stopped and was eased up late. BATTLE READY chased the
pace early, stopped and was eased up through the lane.
