SOUTHERN WARLORD sat off the pace while five wide, fanned five wide entering the lane, rallied steadily outside and drove clear. HERE COMES
BARNEY dueled inside of TOMAHAWK EXPLORER to the quarter pole, was out finished through the stretch and held place. GOTTCHA COWBOY broke
outward leaving, raced five wide into the opening turn, angled towards the rail at the three eighths, lacked running room inside and was along for show.
MISTER MACHO MAN reserved off the pacesetters, fanned four wide at the quarter pole and passed tiring rival late. TOMAHAWK EXPLORER vied outside
then dueled outside of HERE COMES BARNEY to the quarter pole, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and weakened through stretch. DEVILS
COMMAND brushed leaving, stalked the pacesetters from along the rail and lacked bid.

drive. MISS MCFAD raced at the back of the pack while four wide, advanced outside in the final turn, was gaining on the leader late stretch and but was
unable to stall the winner. FLORIST sat just off the pace under a snug hold entering the backstretch, pressed the pace inside and raced evenly through the
stretch. FAT N BITTER led the field into the backstretch, contended the pace from between rivals and was done early.

MARYAM raced at the back of pack while three wide, angled out to the three path leaving the final turn, shifted quickly towards the inside rail mid stretch
and inched up. NOTICE tracked the pacesetters along the rail, was set down to a drive at the three sixteenth and was out finished. BONNIE TRADER sat off
the pace in the four path, chased the leaders through the final turn, loomed boldly early stretch and missed. ASTARTOBE contested the early pace inside of
CELTIC GOLD, gained a slim advantage near the five sixteenth marker and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. CELTIC GOLD sent for outside speed,
dueled outside of ASTARTOBE to the three eighths and yielded. SHEENA broke alertly then was allowed to settle off the speed duel through the
backstretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
THIN LINE raced wide entering the backstretch, contested the pace while five wide then drew away through the far turn then drew off under urging.
NEVERADOUBT raced three wide leaving the chute, uncoiled a rail bid into the lane but was in vain as he was no match for the winner and finished clearly
second best. COURTLY PLEASURE vied inside of MR. IRRELEVANT into the backstretch, chased in closest pursuit through the far turn and flattened out.
DOC ROSS chased from the back of the pack, raced four wide out of the final turn failed to threaten in drive. AZTEC KEY trailed the field, shifted towards
the rail mid stretch and rallied belatedly. KIWITAHI sat in range through the backstretch, angled out to the four path entering the far turn, rallied three wide
and yielded. MR. IRRELEVANT vied outside for the early lead and tired early.

Footnotes
PEPPERMINT was quickest to the turn to set the pace, repelled a bid at the five sixteenth pole from HOLY HANNA, was under steady pressure through the
stretch and held sway. MOE'SANNIE saved ground off the pace, angled out three wide into the far turn, was roused at the top of the lane, was gaining
outside late stretch and missed. HEREVERYWISH unhurried early, gained closer order in the far turn then encountered traffic approaching the stretch,
rallied through stretch and lacked running room late. PARIS IN PLAY raced five wide through the backstretch and bid evenly through stretch. SPIN A TALE
went three wide into the opening turn, trailed through the backstretch and bid belatedly. HOLY HANNA sat in striking position, moved up alongside
PEPPERMINT at the three eighths pole to contest the lead, was unable to get by and faltered. TIGERINYOURTANK never far back and lacked a kick.

Footnotes
GUNN WITH THE WIND raced four wide into the opening turn, rated well off the pace in the four path, angled out under urging near the three sixteenth pole
and won driving. TRIPLE LIVE contended the early pace, responded to challenge from KICKEN WEST G. matched strides with rival through the stretch
under heavy urging and inched up for place. KICKEN WEST G. vied outside into the opening turn, contested the early pace outside of TRIPLE LIVE, dueled
through the far turn, battled determinedly then lugged in through the stretch and was edged out late. WISER TIMES raced three wide leaving the opening
turn, sat in range two wide, encountered traffic along the rail then rallied belatedly. HARRY'S HAMMER tracked four wide through the backstretch, brushed
inside rival into the far turn, drove four wide under urging and was out kicked. OUR MONEY CAT tracked the pacesetters from the three path, was brushed
leaving the backstretch, was under coaxing into the turn between rivals and flattened out in stretch. DJANGO UNREINED raced five wide early, drifted in
leaving the backstretch and lacked a closing response when asked. HUERFANO G. lacked early speed and showed a mild interest late. FORMAL TUX
lagged early, chased hard through the final turn and passed tiring foes late. BAKKEN THE U S S R drifted out into the opening turn under restraint, lacked
running room in the backstretch under a strong hold and tired. SMILEY saved ground inside, chased inside and gave way in stretch.
