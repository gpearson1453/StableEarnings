Footnotes
SOULMATE settled early, lacked room while trying to rally two wide between horses around the final turn, closed between foes through the lane and was up
late. TACHYON dwelt at the break, left several lengths behind the field, lagged early, circled into the stretch and gained to the end while far out into the
course. BOAT'S A ROCKIN opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed inside, brushed the rail entering the far turn, remained clear into midstretch
and gave way late. ALFRED wasn't far back early, improved position along the rail into the far turn and lacked a further response. NOBLE AUTHORITY was
caught wide around both turns and lacked a rally. CHATEAU DE VIZILLE stayed inside and failed to menace. THE JEWEL FACTOR had early position
between horses, raced three wide around the final turn then tired. LEFTY COMMING was outrun after a slow break. SAGE CANYON led the early chase,
moved to vie outside the early leader nearing the far turn, stopped between horses on the final turn and was eased up through the lane.

FAIRY DUST broke slowly, lagged early, circled into the stretch and edged clear through the final yards. CREATIVE ALIBI was urged closer in the four path
on the turn, briefly loomed a threat inside the winner in deep stretch but couldn't keep up through the final yards. COURTING JENNY dueled early, took over
in the two path on the turn, held a clear lead into the final sixteenth and gave way late. ROSES FROM HEAVEN was reluctant to load, stayed inside and
lacked a closing. LIL SURVIVOR raced two wide and tired. CABBAGE PATCH made the early pace two wide, stopped after a half and was eased up late.

CRAZY IDEA settled two wide between horses, stayed out from the rail around the final turn, took over from the outside approaching the final furlong, and
moved clear under urging before a mile. LONG TOM ran out into the first turn, moved before a half to press outside the early leader, took command two
wide on the far turn then weakened in the drive. GREAT BEND stalked in the three path outside the early leaders and weakened. RON DON SCORESE
opened a clear lead soon after the break, angled to the inside, remained prominent to the stretch then tired. FOURTEEN CARROT dwelt at the break,
wasn't far back inside to the far turn, stopped and was eased up through the lane. START CASHIN fell over before being loaded, was reluctant to load,
reared up in the gate at the break, advanced outside on the backstretch, stopped in the lane and was eased up.

SEEKING THE THRONE was bumped leaving the gate, settled early, rallied the three path around the final turn, closed a gap from the outside in the final
yards and was along in time. TRIBAL PRINCESS moved to a short lead from the inside just before a half, edged clear nearing the stretch, remained clear
into late stretch but couldn't last. BELL THE CAT was fractious in the gate, moved to vie outside before a half, remained prominent to the stretch then tired.
NOBLE FLIGHT ducked out into the winner leaving the gate then wasn't a factor. C C'S FREEDOM wasn't far back outside early, raced wide around the
final turn then stopped. STICK UP stayed out from the rail while making the pace for about a half, stopped after five furlongs and was eased up.
