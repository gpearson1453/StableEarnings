Footnotes
MY MISS MARILYN broke outwards bumping CAROLINA BEAST, was quickly righted, then urged to gain the lead a bit off the rail, held sway on a clear
margin to upper stretch, drifted out in late stages but maintained a safe margin to the end under brisk handling. LADY OF LAHTI, settled in hand out of
striking distance early, angled to the six path in upper stretch and was making steady progress late. CAROLINA BEAST, bumped at the start, quickly
recovered to track just off the pacesetter outside foes, shifted three wide racing into the lane and was outkicked by the top pair. TANGO'S KITTY, urged to a
forward placing inside foes just off the pacesetter, was urged to bid into the lane and weakened late. AMAZING ANNIE, crowded at the start, settled along
the inside and never gained contention. GODSGIFT ducked in at the start, angled to the rail while coming under pressure early pursuing the leaders to the
turn but gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
GIVIN UP NONE ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to stalk just off the first flight three deep racing to the turn, advanced readily to take over racing
into upper stretch and made the balance of the pace under firm encouragement. D' YANK tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn,
angled out nearing upper stretch and proved best of the others. MISTER CHARMING tracked off the second flight near the inside in the opening quarter,
switched out nearing the lane and continued with interest to gain some position. PRUDENT HERO settled in the last flight along the inside, angled off the
rail racing into upper stretch and passed between tiring rivals. TAP'S BIG SHOT, off a step slowly, was urged between foes to gain terms with the leader
prompting the pace into the turn and gave way in upper stretch. DAWN'S ROAD hopped at the start, settled last to the turn and failed to menace. BOLD
ATTACK, urged to dispute the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch. BEE ATTACK angled to the
inside tracking just off the first flight for three furlongs but faded early.

MY BOSS LADY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing through the backstretch, was pulling against restraint and steadied slightly leaving the
midway point of the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to gain the advantage and hold sway to the end
under mild urging. ZARELLA was settled last, angled out entering the lane gaining position, shifted inside foes racing through the stretch and edged the
place honors late. FORTY PIECES, urged to dispute the pace along the rail, dueled into the lane and gave way. RUBY ROUND HERE, in touch with the
leaders three wide attending the pace, pressed the issue into the turn to gain a brief advantage nearing upper stretch but gave way in the drive. ONE BY
ONE, urged prompting a rival's pace, pressed between foes through the turn and gave way into the lane.

LUCKY AT JUSTICE settled into stride a bit off the inside dropping well off the first flight racing through the backstretch, gradually gathered momentum
while angling out four wide entering the lane, then continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and go clear late under firm handling.
DEVIL'S ROSE settled last racing through the backstretch while angling inwards, shifted outside foes entering the stretch and found her best stride late to
prove best of the others. VEGAN GOES BEST, urged three deep between foes prompting the pace, edged clear racing into upper stretch but was collared
in late stages. BRECHIN'S COMMAND tracked just off the first flight four wide between foes in early stages, was prompted to challenge three deep nearing
upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. KIPPER DOODLE, forwardly placed along the rail, prompted the pace into the lane and faded late. MORA
VALLEY vied for command between foes into the turn and gave way after a half. LEISHLANICK tracked off the first flight five wide racing to the turn and
faded early. CONSTANCIA, caught six wide in early stages, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
WAKE UP JOE broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a comfortable margin racing into the turn, was prompted to turn back challengers
racing into upper stretch and kicked clear late under pressure. HIGH HERO tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening quarter, was urged
to bid for command between foes nearing the lane but proved only second best. ELUSIVE FORCE, forwardly placed along the rail, tracked just off the
pacesetter inside foes to turn, lost some position nearing upper stretch but continued with a steady effort nearest the rail to prevail for a share late. ROSKI
tracked off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly to late stages. TIO CHUY tracked off the second flight three deep in the
opening stages, advanced in that path to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out. KYZAN switched outside foes early settling off the
second flight, was fanned four wide racing into the lane and lacked a rally. DANCIN NICKY proved no factor.

Footnotes
FLEETWAY was rated stalking just off the leaders in the opening half, advanced to contention three deep on the far turn, moved to challenge for command
in upper stretch, then continued with a steady late response in a protracted drive to prevail under firm encouragement. NORCO worked his way to the inside
tracking the leaders from out of striking distance leading the second flight on a narrow margin into the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted
out entering the lane to bid for command between foes leaving midstretch but was just outfinished. SCATTERED CASH tracked the leaders inside foes in
second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out entering the lane to gain position between foes late and continued willingly three deep to close the gap on
the top pair. LEMON BLITZ tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide nearing upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick. TENSPEED sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, held
sway into upper stretch but gave out late. DRAGUNOV settled off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper
stretch gaining some position but had no final kick. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged
to prompt the leader between foes racing into the far turn and gave out abruptly racing into upper stretch. RED CORVETTE settled outside foes in the last
flight in the opening stages, advanced five wide leaving the far turn while being prompted to advance but had no late response. MAGIC MUSKETIER
shuffled back at the start, was settled between foes in the last flight early and failed to menace. MIDNIGHT JOKER was always outrun.

CITALI, bumped at the start, then caught in close quarters, was settled last racing to the backstretch, shifted outside foes nearing the far turn, commenced a
steady, four wide advance to gain terms with the leaders in upper stretch, shifted inwards under pressure but edged forward under strong handling nearing
the wire. PENALTY SHOT, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, took over after a half, dictated terms on a narrow margin
through the far turn, angled inside in upper stretch and grudgingly resisted the winner to late stages but proved only second best. YOU SPLIT TENS tracked
the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted three wide racing into the far turn to prompt the leader to upper stretch but proved, no match for the top
pair late. FORT RIDGE, bumped, then caught in close quarters at the start, tracked off the second flight to the backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch
and angled five wide late to gain some position while proving no threat. SHELL FIRE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and
came up empty nearing the far turn. JUSTENUFFTUFF broke out bumping the eventual winner, was righted to track the leaders inside foes in second flight
and emptied out nearing the far turn. CALEB'S HEIR, urged to the lead along the rail racing into the first turn, continued under pressure prompting the

Footnotes
TABIA stalked just off the first flight four wide in the opening quarter, commenced a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch, then wrested the
advantage and went clear late under firm handling. TRAPPE VALLEY switched outside the leaders early while gaining terms with the first flight, attended the
pace three wide racing into the turn, took over when given his cue nearing the lane but proved no match when confronted by the winner. MAY WE ALL
broke inwards bumping GORGEOUS GEORGE, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing into the turn and continued with interest to
improve his placing late. SHMILY worked his way to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the turn, shifted out in the lane and continued evenly.
YOU'RE KILLIN ME broke outwards bumping CROCE D'ORO, angled to the inside tracking off the second flight and continued evenly shifting out in the
lane. ED'S ROCKET angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes through the turn and
gave way into the lane. POWER CRY, urged along the rail pressing the pace, dueled for command through the turn and gave way into the lane. CROCE
D'ORO, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, settled well off the leaders, then drifted out six wide into the lane. GORGEOUS GEORGE,
bumped soundly, then knocked back at the start, raced wide to the lane and proved no threat.

Footnotes
TANNAH'BLU, carried out avoiding some traffic at the start, settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance
five wide on the far turn into upper stretch and came under strong handling in the last furlong to just edge GREATEST GAL in time. The latter, forwardly
placed along the rail, switched outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch while moving to prompt that rival's pace, wrested the advantage on the far
turn, went clear into the lane and just missed. KURINGAI settled off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, advanced to contention four wide
between foes through the far turn to upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. NO TIME TO PLAY broke outwards bumping REJOICE AN BE GLAD
while forcing that rival into the path of the eventual winner, was collected, then urged four wide into the first turn to gain a position just off the leaders, was
urged to challenge three deep racing into the far turn, shifted inwards under pressure racing through the lane and faded late. LION LOVE tracked off the first
flight between foes racing to the far turn and continued evenly into the lane. REJOICE AN BE GLAD, bumped at the start, was caught five wide racing into
the first turn, settled outside foes off the second flight, angled five wide racing into the lane and gained some position while making no impact. VICTIM
tracked the leaders inside foes as part of the second flight to the far turn and faded into the lane. REAL DE JALPA settled between foes and never gained
contention. JUKEBOX MONEY tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and came up empty entering the far turn. EADS BRIDGE,
urged to the lead while angling to the rail racing into the first turn, dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn and gave way abruptly into the lane. MY
IDOL was steadied along the inside racing through the first turn and trailed the field into the stretch. Race was hand timed.
