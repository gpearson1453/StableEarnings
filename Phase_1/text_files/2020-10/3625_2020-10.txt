Footnotes
TAMBORA accelerated to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, angled to the four path turning for home and was under brisk urging in the drive.
AMERICANO lacked speed, raced along the inner rail around the turn and through the stretch and rallied. GREELEY'S BANKER prompted the pace outside
the winner, was carried to the five path in upper stretch and weakened. KEEPING THE PEACE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, was fanned
to the six path in upper stretch and weakened. TICKER TAPE PARADE , four deep on the turn, dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
TARGE dueled to the inside of MISCHIEFS MODEL while under nice rating, raced two wide into the lane, was roused clear nearing the furlong grounds
then held firm while ridden out. MISCHIEFS MODEL dueled three wide outside the winner, drifted in while racing on hear left lead past mid stretch, switched
over to her right lead in the final few strides and managed to save the place. MISS LESLIE , off a bit slow when leaning inward, corrected and moved up in
hand and to the outside of a rival, stalked the dueling leaders leaving the three eighths, was put to pressure soon after, pursued four wide into the lane and
kept on with effort. MCLUCY broke a step slow, recovered and flashed speed to reach contention, stalked while saving ground, failed to kick on past the five
sixteenths and retreated. MAYFIELD OF DREAMS failed to keep pace and dropped back mid turn.

TAPIT'S GIRL was nudged clear early then set a rated pace in about the two path, came under coaxing holding command past the five sixteenths, dropped
in a bit for the drive, widened in mid stretch then was fully extended to prevail. SALAMINA , four wide stalking the winner, shifted five wide under a ride
entering the lane, straightened away to close steadily but just fell short. DARE TO PROMISE hopped slightly at the break, angled in early then commenced
a run heading to the half mile marker, angled out advancing past the five sixteenths, had aim on the winner into the lane then churned on from there.
ALWAYSINMOTION stalked three wide, dropped in a bit around the turn, pursued into the lane then came up empty. FAST FASHION drifted out at the
break, dropped well off the early pace and never picked it up. MY WAY OR ELSE , five wide with early pursuit, failed to kick on when ridden mid turn and
retreated.

OUR BELLA NICOLE , swung to the four path leaving the turn, had a mild rally. MOMENTITA stalked the pace three wide on the turn, gained the lead
approaching the quarter pole and gave way. HEY BABE lacked speed, swung to the five path entering the stretch and passed tired foes. AIR FORCE PINK
hugged the inner rail around the turn and failed to rally. JUNGLE BRIDE saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and gave way.
CHELSEA WALL chased the pace while racing two wide and faltered. GREAT CAUSE ,sent to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave
way. BELLA BETTINA , four wide on the turn, stopped and was eased.

Footnotes
CAUSE HE'S WESTERN pulled his way to command leaving the chute, was well rated setting the pace off the inside, met the bid from BRUTUS nearing the
lane, dueled to the inside of that one while under strong handling past the three sixteenths, shook clear a furlong out then was fully extended to prevail.
MOONLIGHT SHADOW , unhurried early while off the inside, circled five to six wide into the lane, closed outside rivals and just missed. DIVINE
INTERVENTIO settled off the rail, edged up in the clear leaving the far turn, progressed five wide to take aim into the stretch, gave hard pursuit past the
furlong grounds and kept on with effort. BRUTUS prompted the pace to the outside of the winner, drew alongside while four wide into the lane, dueled on
even terms past the three sixteenths then faded very late. ALWAYS FORGIVEN spotted the field a few lengths when hesitating at the break, gained quickly
towards the rail heading to the three quarter pole, tracked mid turn, was under pressure chasing past the quarter pole but cam up empty late.
STARINTHEMAKING stalked between foes, raced three wide into the lane and weakened. LINDA'S NEKIA saved ground mid turn while failing to pose a
threat.

Footnotes
EGO MAN prompted the pace outside SHACKLED, challenged that one near the five sixteenths pole, sprinted clear approaching the eighth pole and was
kept under a drive. SHACKLED sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, angled outside near the eighth pole and gamely closed the gap late.
ANNAMATED MOON raced in the two path between horses on the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and lacked the needed late effort. ROCK
THE COMET lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and passed tired horses. RAILMASTER , three wide on
the turn, chased the pace and weakened through the stretch. BOONDOGGLE , a forward factor along the inner rail, angled out for the drive, gave way and
returned bleeding.

Footnotes
CONGRESS HALL tracked three wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, dueled and gained a slim lead in mid stretch, kept on under solid handling
and held sway. SUNDAY IN L B C stalked three to four wide, bid three deep after a half mile, vied outside rivals leaving the furlong pole and stayed on well.
DON'TBAGGAGECHECK was sent clear soon after the break, set the pace two wide, dug in when confronted past the five sixteenths, battled past the
sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. TOMA lacked speed, circled five to six wide into the lane and closed too late outside rivals. ADABEL settled off
the inside, raced four to five wide into the stretch and rallied between runners. DOGWOOD QUEEN saved ground, moved up some past while angling in
upper stretch but lacked the needed finish. GYPSY GIRL , a bit rank leaving the gate, chased three wide and gave way. PRINCESS ANNE was outrun.
TRELLIS broke a step slow, hustled up inside, pursued to mid turn, faltered and was eased late.
