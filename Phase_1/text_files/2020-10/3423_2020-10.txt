behind, raced very wide into the stretch rallying. ROSIE SUMMER saved ground off the pace and continued willingly. BELLA LUCIA broke sluggishly and
raced far back throughout. PLAY BY PLAY was urged within striking range inside but gave way readily. RAT A TAT TAT raced off the pace and stopped

HIBACHI set the pace inside then remained clear under to the finish under steady handling. SHOOGER RAY TOO fanned five wide on the first turn,
remained wide closed well in the stretch. RONIN WARRIOR stalked his entry mate inside, loomed a threat and continued willingly. SPACEMAN lagged far
behind, advanced inside then split rivals rallying in the final furlong. COURT SKY prompted the winner outside to the stretch and weakened slightly.
SAMBAM dropped far back inside and offered only a mild rally. DRUMMOND lacked speed in the two path and was never in contention. STARLING
PRINCE was urged close up for half a mile and gave way.

HEROIC OFFICER set pace in the four path, shook loose to open a long lead in mid stretch and was fully extended to the wire while not being seriously
challenged. FOUR SEASONS GIRL, boxed in on the backstretch, rallied between stretch and was drawing away from the others. TIZ A SHARPIE, bumped
leaving the gate, raced outside then moved between foes and failed threaten. MADELYN'S DANCER steadied on the backstretch, swung out on turn then
tired. TWO GRACES, between rivals chasing, was left with rail and tired. TAYLOR'S BELLE was wide and never a serious threat. OUR CLAIRE BEAR
broke slowly then showed nothing. AAMAAL came out and bumped foe leaving the gate, saved ground chasing and was finished early.

EXPURGATED took the lead at once after a lengthy gate load, set the pace in four path, shook loose leaving the turn and won with speed to spare. LAZY
MICHELLE ducked in at the start hitting the left side of the gate, recovered and was sent up while saving ground, challenged on the turn but then was no
match. PERFECTA STORM also broke to the left hitting the side of the gate, saved ground and failed to threaten. VELOZES, two wide in second flight,
stopped. PRINCESS LINO, very fractious in the gate, showed little. GET HER READYEDDIE broke slowly then trailed.

FIX ME A SANDWICH controlled the pace under rating, widened in the stretch and remained safe while kept to his task. POWERFUL VENEZUELA pursued
the winner outside and continued gamely to the finish. DIAMOND SETTER chased outside, bid wide in the stretch and closed willingly. DIG CHARLIE DIG
raced four wide down the backstretch and began fading on the turn. FAST RUNNER lacked speed outside then passed rivals without threatening. THREE
PHASE dropped back outside early, moved to the inside on the turn and was always outrun. MANOLETE saved ground close up to the stretch and gave
way. STADIUM was bumped about soon after the start then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TERRY'S CHARM broke slowly and was outrun racing two wide, moved to the rail on the final turn, was being ridden confidently through deep stretch and
was along in time. EVEN THUNDER raced wide and just off the pace, drifted out under left handed pressure stretch, stuck his nose in front deep stretch but
was nailed on the wire. ASPHALT PAVING set the pace in the three path, also drifted out under left handed stick through the stretch and weakened late in a
nice effort. BOB'S MY UNCLE raced wide while unhurried and was too late. GAULTIER (FR), in the four path while just off the pace, tried to bear out on the
far turn then tired. AWE MUN, between foes early, steadied when run up on heels entering the backstretch, moved to the outside through stretch and tired.
TACTICAL PURSUIT (IRE) saved ground just off the pace then gave way. DON CAMILLO ducked in breaking slowly, was far back and lost contact. A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF AWE MUN AGAINST EVEN THUNDER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN WAS QUICKLY
DISMISSED.

CINNABUNNY quickly moved clear under rating, drew off when asked into the stretch then was under wraps through the final sixteenth. TARA'S TALENT
saved ground throughout and finished willingly while no match for the winner. SHEMAKESMEHAPPY pursued the winner three wide then flattened out
through the stretch. MONACO PRINCESS trailed to the stretch then rallied mildly just missing the show. DECOUPAGE pressed the winner briefly in the two
path and faltered. DOCTORSOFMISCHIEF raced four wide in the second flight and stopped in the stretch.

was coming back late. GEEBERT saved ground early, angled out near quarter pole and was too late. STRONG BREEZE, three wide and just off the pace,
drifted wider and tired. SMART ROYAL T broke slowly, saved ground and failed to menace. THE GREAT SAMURAI, four wide in second flight, tired.
