Footnotes
ZAMFIR bobbled slightly a couple strides out but was hustled right to the front, shook off pursuers in the two-path around the turn, moved to the rail in the
stretch and stayed well clear under a drive. ENSIGN PARKER pressed the pace outside from the start, got shaken off approaching the stretch, stayed on
his left lead and ran on best of the others. TODAYSTHEDAY saved ground throughout, and was up for the show while never a threat for anything more.
JUMP BACK JACK was no threat two wide. ROYAL BIZ hesitated at the start spotting the field two lengths or so, and was outrun three wide. HOOKED A
GOODWIN was outrun four wide. ARTISTA pressed the early pace between horses, and gave way into the turn.

Footnotes
TONS OF GOLD went along covered up behind the leaders to the far turn, shifted out to the four-path to challenge leaving the quarter-pole, wrested
command through mid stretch and drove clear. CAN'T HAVE ENOUGH moved in from the four-path early on the first turn, came back out three wide for the
drive, and finished gamely outside SHARETHEBLAME to get the place. SHARETHEBLAME broke slowly, cut the corner making a run into the stretch,
loomed a threat along the rail a furlong out, but was outfinished. DIAMONDS ENJOY sprinted clear early a bit off the rail, repelled a bid from WICKED CITI
coming to the quarter-pole, then gave way between horses in upper stretch. NEW YORK STYLE raced three to four wide throughout, and faded in the lane.
WICKED CITI prompted the pace outside DIAMONDS ENJOY, reached near-even terms after six furlongs, but had nothing left into the stretch.

Footnotes
YES I AM FREE sprinted clear early in the two-path, repelled a mild bid from SARASOTA COUNTY after three furlongs, and stayed in command under
pressure. SARASOTA COUNTY chased outside the winner into the turn, lodged a brief challenge near the quarter-pole, could not make a serious
impression and ran on second best. FULLY LOADED raced four wide around the turn, and could not gain in the stretch. LAHINCH lost his footing and came
out awkwardly behind the field, and was outrun inside. TENCH broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and came away alertly to press the early
pace, skimmed the rail striding very awkwardly into the turn, and faded steadily.

Footnotes
ROUGH ENTRY broke to the lead, set a brisk pace pulling away from REACTION TIME into the turn, and widened steadily under a drive. THE BEAST
GOES ON settled in the middle of the field early, shifted out four wide into the lane, and was along for the place outside rivals. NIMBLE BEAST advanced
two then three wide after a half-mile, pursued the winner into the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. LORD MELBOURNE chased three
wide to the stretch, moved in through the furlong grounds, and steadied off NIMBLE BEAST on the rail nearing the wire. ADEEB broke slowly and was
outrun early, and passed tired horses. TRINNI JOHN raced three to four wide, and was never prominent. TINKER'S PAL was outrun three wide. REACTION
TIME pressed the winner from inside early, and faltered through the drive. COURAGE DE LION dropped far back after a half-mile, pulled up in distress and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
THRANDUIL grabbed the lead at the start, set a pressured pace for a half-mile in the two-path, edged away into the stretch and was driving to stay clear.
SOCIAL EQUALITY was outrun early, took closer order around the turn two wide, moved inside for the drive and finished willingly. ANOTHER DUKE was
ridden along through the turn three then four wide, stayed on his left lead and was outfinished for second between rivals. MOONLITE STRIKE lunged inward
coming out about three lengths behind the field, put in a run four then five wide around the turn, but flattened out in the lane. BAILEY pursued THRANDUIL
from outside for just over a half-mile, and gave way. THE GREAT OZ broke inward, gave chase inside early, and faded on the turn. ANDRES EDUARDO
was finished early three wide.

Footnotes
YAKO tracked from easy striking inside for six furlongs, eased outside NAPA RULES to challenge turning for home, and edged away after a long drive.
NAPA RULES took control early, rated along through a manageable pace inside, dug in when challenged at the top of the stretch, and yielded grudgingly.
VALLEY DATE saved ground outrun early, moved closer three wide after six furlongs, stayed on her left lead and finished one-paced outside the top two.
COLONELS DAUGHTER saved ground and lacked the needed response. BLOSSOM BOW prompted the pace outside NAPA RULES to the far turn, and
gave way approaching the stretch. PERT was difficult to load, refused, and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE
THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
SWAGGY GEORGE got bumped between OSPREY and GEGE CONQUEST and steadied shortly after the start, tracked under a hold behind the leaders
inside, attempted unsuccessfully to get through inside HEAVENLY BLESSING turning for home, altered course off the rail approaching the eighth-pole,
responded to heavy pressure and was up outside in the final yards. HEAVENLY BLESSING got bumped by EXCHANGE DAY at the start, set the pace
slightly off the inside, moved to the rail closing the hole as SWAGGY GEORGE loomed in upper stretch, was clear with a sixteenth remaining but could not
hang on. EXCHANGE DAY broke out into the hind end of HEAVENLY BLESSING, raced three wide to the stretch, battled outside SAVATIANO late and got
the show. SAVATIANO stumbled at the start, saved ground throughout, and lacked a solid closing response. OSPREY bumped with SWAGGY GEORGE a
few strides from the gate, chased outside HEAVENLY BLESSING to the top of the stretch, and tired. GEGE CONQUEST bumped with SWAGGY GEORGE
soon after the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
GUACO advanced three wide pressing BOMOSEEN from outside into the turn, poked a head in front a quarter-mile out, and drew off through the final
furlong under pressure. BOMOSEEN set the pace in the two-path, yielded to the winner in upper stretch, drifted out some but stayed clear of the remainder.
ELBRUS was a step slow to begin, raced two wide, lacked a rally and was well clear of the others. ULTRACONFIDENT leapt at the break coming out
behind the field, saved ground most of the way, and went by faders. FAKE I D chased three wide early, and tired after a half-mile. SMARTY J AND B raced
two to three wide, and was finished early. WOLFPUB was outsprinted early, moved up mildly after a half-mile, but could not sustain the rally and dropped far
back. EXPRESS BOY raced three to four wide around the turn, and dropped far back through the lane.
