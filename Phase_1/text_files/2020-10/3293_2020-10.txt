TACKLE THE NORTH showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with a clear lead through the stretch was kept to task. MS SUEDOO was
in touch and had a good position on the turn but from the four path through the stretch was no match for the winner. BOSCOBEL was up close and a factor
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MISS LESTER MURPHY was away alertly and roused from between foes on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no rally. NORDIC PEARL was hustled early but chased on the turn and had nothing left. AVENTURA
TRAVIESA was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch came up empty.

SUCCESSFUL SAINT stumbled after the start, was a factor on the far turn and from the four path through the stretch drew off. TROPICAL JOY showed
speed from the inside and had a slim lead on the far turn but was outfinished. DR RUTHLESS was away alertly and dueled from between foes on the far
turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was all out. GOODBYEGUINNESSBOK was unhurried early, trailed the field on the far turn and was not
a factor. J. C. INDY was up close early but lost ground on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

but from the five path through the stretch needed more. DEPUTY OF EGBERT stalked the early leader and raced evenly on the turn but faded through the

Footnotes
SEAL TEAM TWO showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held sway. GET MY GIST
stalked the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. I IDOLIZE YOU was unhurried early, was roused
on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for show. GROUNDHOG DAY was in range and raced evenly on the turn but had no late
kick. SLEEK IDEA was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no rally. SOPHISTICATION was in touch
but lost ground on the turn and was not a factor. OBLIVIOUSLY was off slow and showed nothing while outrun.

Footnotes
ANTHECROWDGOESWILD was away alertly, a factor on the turn and from the six path through the stretch was up in time. ROSIEJEWEL DANCER set a
pressured pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was caught late. TRULY HONOURED was off the pace,
gained ground on the turn and finished well. PACHAMAMA forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from four path at the top of the stretch had nothing
left. SHAMRUCKUS had no speed, saved ground on the turn and finished evenly. HUSH BUFFY was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and was
never in contention. WRITTEN was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch flattened out.

KLASSY DELIGHT was up close, took command on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. MARVEL was off the
pace, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. SEXY NEXY was unhurried early and hustled
along on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. LEGAL IN CANADA stalked the early leaders, raced evenly on the far turn
and was the best of the rest. SMART N QUICK tracked the leaders from the inside and was roused on the far turn but had no response. GABBY'S
BALLERINA was in mid pack early but trailed on the far turn and was not a factor. GOLDEN G G was hustled early but lost ground on the far turn, was
outdistanced and walked off. HURRICANE DIRECTOR lost her rider on the first turn.

AWESOME MINER was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and with the lead at the top of the stretch was much the best. JACK BEANSTALK showed
speed from the inside, had a slim lead on the turn and was second best in a good effort. TIME TO DANCE was in range and had a good position on the turn
but had no late kick. COBILOCO was unhurried early, trailed the field on the turn and had no impact. SEA ANNA DREAM was up close early but chased on
the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
FAFA FOOEY stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. AMNESTY showed
speed, had the lead on the turn and vied from the four path through the stretch but was outgunned. UNCLE GRUMPY was in mid pack, moved up on the
turn and from the six path through the stretch just missed. MAJESTIC FEVER was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but needed more.
CONQUEST ELIMINATR was in range and had a mild gain on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch evened out. TINKER RING had no
speed and saved ground on the turn but had no rally.
