RICK'S SURPRISE settled inside, angled out on the final turn while rallying, closed outside through the lane and was along in time. WARLEGGAN led the
early chase, quickly ran clear from the outside nearing the quarter pole, remained clear into late stretch but couldn't last. CLINIC wasn't far back in the two
path around the first turn then outlasted tired ones while no threat. MAJESTIC WOODY broke sharply for a clear lead, made the pace along the rail for just
over three-quarters then stopped. DRIVEN BY THUNDER stopped. ZANDAR stumbled leaving the gate and was finished after a half.

A T M AWESOME opened a clear lead soon after the break, stayed out from the rail around the turn and was under steady whip through the lane.
SHOWER THE PEOPLE was fractious in the gate as the doors opened, broke in the air a few lengths behind the field, made a strong run in the three path
on the turn then couldn't gain through the lane while bearing out under left hand whip. START A FIRE was slow early, made a three wide run around the
turn, swung wide into the stretch then gained late between horses. MOUSETRAP stayed inside and gained mildly through the lane. FOLES hesitated in the
gate at the break, broke in the air several lengths behind the field and never caught up. THE JEWEL FACTOR chased briefly and was eased up through the
stretch.

OCTORARO ORPHIE was slow early, rallied wide into the stretch, reached the front inside the final sixteenth and held. GOLDFORTHENEWYEAR was
slow early, raced outside the winner around the turn and into the stretch but couldn't get by. DREAMING OF LOVE dueled two wide from the outset, moved
clear in early stretch, bore out sharply under left hand whip in midstretch, impeded OBROTHER ITSYLVIA and folded. Following an objection by Flores,
DREAMING OF LOVE was disqualified and placed fourth. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA stayed inside around the turn, came out entering the stretch while rallying
then was steadied when shut off in midstretch. FLASHINTHENIGHT dueled along the rail to the stretch then tired.

break, left about four lengths behind the field, improved position in the three path around the final turn and gained mildly through the lane. THE GREAT
CASBY wasn't far back two wide around the first turn, remained close to the far turn then weakened. SALSA'S RETURN tired inside. CARISSIMO stopped

BALI was rated along the rail, moved to the front entering the stretch and drew out under urging through the final furlong. SANSA lagged along the rail into
the stretch, angled out between rivals and finished willingly. CELTIC RING raced three wide around the turn, failed to gain through the lane and held the
show in spite of the rider standing up before the wire. RISQUE'S TREASURE made a three wide run to the front early on the turn, drew out then weakened
in the lane. SIX PACK GAL dueled two wide into the turn then tired. ARCTICA stopped.
