INVINCIBLE stalked the pace two wide early, was caught four wide on the second turn and was outfinished. THE REF broke out and bumped solidly with
CALL ME SOUL, recovered to set all of the pace to the deep stretch and weakened. CAROLINA ISLAND was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three
wide but lacked a solid finish. CALL ME SOUL was bumped hard by THE REF at the start and steadied to fall back and raced unhurried, closed steadily in
the final quarter. Following a stewards inquiry, THE REF was disqualified and placed last.

AUTISMS WORLD stalked the pace from the outset from off the rai, rallied to the lead in the stretch, lugged in but held. EL BORRACHO was unhurried
early from off the rail, came three wide to the stretch and rallied without being a serious factor. LIL AWECIM set the pace into the stretch and weakned.
ALLEYCAT trailed throughout.

MY SUNSHINE set the pace from the inside, was well rated and had plenty in reserve. MAGIC MOSCO tracked the pace two then three wide but could not
gain on the winner. NORTHERN QUEST settled, came three wide on the second turn and finished in a mild rally. MATSON unhurried early, offered a
menacing bid three wide on the second turn then flattened out. CURRY NATION showed little. HAWK'S RISING flashed speed to the second turn and
retired.

READY FOR A FIGHT pressed the pace from the inside, responded in the stretch and won driving. ABUSIVE GARY stalked the leaders three wide and
finished steadily. PAPAPIFAS set a pressured pace from the outside and was outfinished in the lane. FLICFLAC lacked early and closed too late.
DETANGLER lugged out on the turn and into the stretch and bumped EMERALD MAGIC. TRIBAL WAR CHANT tracked the leaders three wide to the
stretch and weakened. EMERALD MAGIC lacked good early but was squeezed off at the three sixteenths and lost all chance. Following a stewards inquiry
DETANGLER was disqualified and placed last.
