Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN broke in and bumped at the start, settled early off the inside, moved out into the five path exiting the far turn, rallied to the front past the
eighth pole and held the runner-up at bay. TREVOR T threw head racing greenly early, traveled near the back of the field from inside, saved ground into the
stretch, tipped out in the drive but lacked room near the eighth pole, angled out further and closed late but could not get by. MAMBA COOL stalked a bit off
the rail then closed in alongside the leader at the seven-sixteenths, headed rival at the three-eighths pole, dueled around the turn and took command in
upper stretch but yielded in the late stages. LUVLUV bumped both sides at the start, went four wide into the first turn then angled in around that bend,
tracked between runners then came three wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. ULTIMATE MYSTERY raced at the back of the field outside a rival, entered
the stretch three wide, drifted to the inside and never rallied. RIVER NORTH sped clear and set the pace inside, challenged nearing the far turn and fought
back from inside then gave way. CHIPPER stalked in the two path then moved out into the backstretch, chased four wide into the lane and weakened. WITH
DUE CAUSE broke out and bumped rival at the start, went three wide into the first turn then angled to the rail, saved ground while dropping back on the far
turn and had little left in the drive.

Footnotes
PUBILIUS SYRUS asked early into the first turn, raced off the pace through the early stages, outside a runner near the half-mile point, between foes at the
quarter pole, went three wide into the stretch, rallied four wide and won going away. BITTER RING HOME stalked the pace off the rail, bid three deep at the
quarter pole, lost whip in upper stretch and edged IMPRESSION for the place. IMPRESSION set the pace under pressure from the outside, vied inside from
the quarter pole to the eighth pole and got edged for second. BLAME IT ON KITTY tracked off the rail then angled to the rail, went inside of a rival near the
half-mile marker, saved ground into the lane and never rallied. AUTUMN DAY pressed the pace from outside, bid between at the quarter pole but weakened
in the drive. VODKA TWIST raced four wide while in range, stayed in that path to the stretch and also weakened.

Footnotes
MAMA'S KID up close early outside a pair of rivals, bid four wide around the turn, battled with BOUNTY OF GOLD in the lane, drifted out under left-handed
urging and dug in late for the upset. BOUNTY OF GOLD set the pace in the two path with company to the outside, vied with a pair of rivals around the turn
and into the stretch, battled with MAMA'S KID through the final furlong and went gamely to the wire. JUST GRACE shuffled back at the start, forwardly
placed widest up the backstretch, went five wide around the turn and was along for the show. SENORADIABLO chased the speed three then four wide
around the turn and got outkicked for the show. SYBIL'S KITTY pressed the pace early, bid between around the turn, could not keep pace in the drive but
kept on through the lane. GIVE ME A HINT broke in and was hard to ride at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground into the lane and had
little left.

Footnotes
AFTER MIDNIGHT broke in and bumped rival at the start, showed good early speed and took command, showed the way inside and saved ground into the
stretch, inched away in the lane and remained clear to the wire. WARRENS CANDY GIRL stalked the leader outside a rival, raced two wide then moved out
into the three path on the second turn, finished willingly but could not threaten the winner in deep stretch. BIG STRETCH stalked a bit off the inside, chased
two wide into the stretch and finished evenly. MISS EVER READY bumped leaving the gate, traveled near the back of the field then advanced up the
backstretch, angled to the rail on the final turn, moved a bit off the inside in the lane and showed a mild rally to earn a minor award. SIDEWAYS SUANCES
stalked from inside to the stretch and flattened. BIG ANDY raced mid-pack outside a rival then two wide, traveled three wide in the lane and failed to rally.
ST HELENA angled in on the first turn, traveled mid-pack in the early going, remained inside to the stretch and failed to rally. STEINWAY pinballed and
stumbled at the start, trailed the field early, saved ground to the lane and never threatened. RENEGADE PRINCESS broke a bit awkward at the start, pulled
early nearing the first turn, raced along the inside the moved out on the backstretch, went two wide around the far turn, tired in the lane, bled following the
race and walked off.

Footnotes
HANDSOME CAT chased outside a rival then between foes on the turn, entered the stretch two wide then rallied outside the top pair to get up late.
PRINCIPE CARLO up close behind the leader to the outside, bid alongside around the turn, challenged through the lane and fought between late but was
outkicked. FRATELLI sped clear to set the pace, dueled with PRINCIPE CARLO around the turn and into the stretch, fought backed gamely from inside and
yielded grudgingly. OFFSHORE AFFAIR tracked the pacesetter from the far outside, went four wide into the first turn then angled into the three path around
the bend, drifted inward in upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. QUICK FINISH chased from along the inside to the stretch and lacked the needed
response. AGAMEMNON brushed with rival in the beginning, tracked outside a rival, angled four wide leaving the turn and proved no menace. PREACHING
TRAINER brushed with outside rival at the start then steadied between foes early, raced off the rail then steadied again near the seven-sixteenths pole,
went three wide into the stretch and made no impact. RINSE AND REPEAT chased along the inside, lost ground around the turn, came out into the stretch
and weakened.

Footnotes
COMRADERY (IRE) unhurried in the early stages, raced near the inside then moved off the rail, advanced three wide up the backstretch, rallied four to five
wide around the far turn, dueled with FRASARD through the final furlong and nailed that rival on the line. FRASARD (GB) settled near the inside, angled
three wide around the far turn, took a short lead then dueled with COMRADERY to the wire and lost the photo. WAR PATH set the pace inside, inched away
on the second turn, overtaken into the stretch and stayed on to hold the show. JUROR stalked the pace along the inside, tipped out into the lane, steadied
off the heels of FRASARD in upper stretch and kept on through the final furlong. MY INDY forwardly placed early while a bit off the inside, in tight and
checked entering the stretch and weakened in the lane. K P D DAY stalked outside a rival, raced in tight quarters and steadied on the far turn, angled in and
entered the stretch two wide and weakened. HUGE BIGLY stumbled a bit leaving the gate, raced off the pace while outside a rival, bumped with inside rival
at the seven-sixteenths pole, steadied at the quarter pole and had little left for the drive. OCULUS tucked inside on the first turn, bumped with HUGE BIGLY
at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TIZHOTNDUSTY stalked a bit off the rail, entered the stretch two wide, rallied inside the top pair and proved best late. HOWBEIT up close early outside the
leader, closed in around the turn and gained command at the quarter pole, fought with DRIPPIN SAUCE in upper stretch and held that foe at bay but could
not contain the winner from inside. DRIPPIN SAUCE bumped leaving the gate, chased off the rail, bid three to four wide around the turn but lacked the
needed late punch. SELF TAUGHT trailed the field early off the inside, angled out on the turn and came five wide into the stretch and bested the rest.
PROMISE NOTHING saved ground into the lane, came out a bit and improved position. HIDDEN PROMISE raced off the pace near the inside then moved
into the two path, angled out upper stretch and lacked further response. LEPRINO broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, dropped back early,
traveled three wide into the lane and never rallied. GO TIME went four wide into the stretch and came up empty. ANNIE'S BOY sped to the front and angled
to the inside, steadied briefly at the quarter pole and faded.

Footnotes
INDY JONES chased the speed early then went for the front and dueled with BABY GRONK for command, cleared that rival into the stretch and inched
away then held safely in the closing moments. KING PARKER tracked outside a rival, three to four wide into the stretch, floated out in the lane and closed
late to earn the place. BEDROCK traveled off the pace, entered the lane two wide, angled out upper stretch and was edged for the place honors.

for the lead inside a rival, lost contact with the winner into the drive, angled out in the lane and flattened. BIG CHEDDAR tracked off the rail early, raced four
wide into the stretch then got floated out in the lane and also flattened. NEXT FLIGHT trailed the field early, raced off the inside then four wide into the
stretch and never threatened. CONVEX away quickly from the far outside then dropped back into a stalking position, chased four to five on the turn then
angled into the three path and failed to rally. SURFSIDE SUNSET tracked the pace from inside, moved out on the turn and exited the bend four wide and
was never a factor. SORRISO showed early speed then chased the top pair three wide into the turn, entered the stretch four to five wide and tired.
