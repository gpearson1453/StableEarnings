Footnotes
LOST A LEGEND set a clear pace in the two path, widened in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. BARNEGAT LIGHT stalked the winner two and
three wide, could not threaten that foe but stayed on well enough to hold clear for the place. CONRAD THE RED was in tight at the start, advanced outside
down the backstretch, raced four wide around most of the turn, angled in to the two path nearing the quarter pole and had a mild rally to gain the show.
HIGH YIELD KITTEN chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. GOLOVKIN prompted the pace three wide and faded after a half. BUENISIMO failed
to menace while racing two wide. ESPERANTO was outrun while racing two wide. SETTE STELLE played no factor while racing three wide. RAULITO had
brief speed four wide.

Footnotes
CHARGE IT ALL advanced after a half-mile while shifting out four wide, set sail after SHINY EMPIRE after straightening away for the drive, and wore that
rival down from outside in the final strides. SHINY EMPIRE bumped solidly with MISS MAKAELA at the start, sprinted up to take command, rated along in
the two-path clear to deep stretch, but could not hang on. MISS MIKAELA bumped hard with SHINY EMPIRE at the start, pursued the latter from outside to
the stretch, and faded. LOVE IN HER EYES saved ground chasing the leaders to the stretch, and tired. PRETTY RACHEL showed early speed outside, and
retreated on the turn. TOO BLESSED was a step slow to begin, and was finished early. SECRET SARAH dropped far back before going a half-mile.

Footnotes
SMALL FORTUNE dueled inside of two rivals to upper stretch, raced in the two path in the lane and drew clear under mild urging. FRENCHMEN STREET
steadied off DAD'S YANKEE'S heels just after the start, saved ground behind the duel and finished willingly inside to gain the place. DAD'S YANKEES
dueled between horses through the opening three-eighths, drifted out under left-handed urging in the lane and was outfinished. MONEY COME vied three
wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. NACHO PAPA chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. GETTININTOMISCHIEF saved
ground well back, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. KYLE chased the pace two wide between foes around the turn and came up empty in
the drive. A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF FRENCHMEN STREET AGAINST THE WINNER WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SPEARGUN broke alertly, set the pace removed from the inside, and responded to pressure to stay clear. THINKABOUTIT broke outward bothering
SADIO, lagged well back for three furlongs, came five wide into the stretch, and rallied belatedly outside to get up for second. LITTLE DUDE pursued
SPEARGUN from outside, could not keep pace turning for home, and was overhauled for the runner-up spot. KHOZANDO raced two wide to the stretch,
and failed to seriously menace. DIVERT hit the left side of the gate at the start, raced four wide and was not a factor. SADIO was pushed out by
THINKABOUTIT at the start, and was outrun inside. SHOOTING became fractious and unseated the rider behind the gate, came away without incident, and
showed little. OUR STUIE was a step slow at the start, showed early speed inside, and tired approaching the stretch. The first quarter-mile of this race was
hand timed.

Footnotes
SEA TRIDENT was hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, drifted out under left-handed urging in upper stretch,
straightened out soon after and widened under right-handed pressure. CHILL HAZE tracked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, was
no match for the winner but outfinished a foe for the place. I KICKN pressed the pace outside of the winner down the backstretch, could not keep pace in the
two path around the turn and held for the show. MOON MAN WALKING failed to menace while racing four wide. FACTOR MAN dropped far back early and
was always outrun in the two path. GINO TIME bobbled at the break, had some speed in the two path but faded around the turn. ZAMIT was outrun inside.

R PREROGATIVE pursued SWIRLING CANDY from outside, took over in upper stretch, and drew off hand urged and shown the whip. SWIRLING CANDY
set the pace well off the rail, could not hold off the winner through upper stretch, and ran on best of the others. MIDTOWN ROSE broke a length slow,
moved in from the three-path around the turn, and finished with good courage on the rail to get up for third. THE AURELIA FACTOR was in tight along the
rail early, advanced mildly into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. BIBIANA was no factor two then three wide around the turn. HEIR BALL raced three
to four wide, and tired after three furlongs. STORMY NELLY raced four to five wide around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID set the pace two wide, drew clear near the half-mile pole, widened in hand while still in the two path around the far turn and drew off under a
hand drive in the lane. LONG GRAY LINE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, could not keep pace
with the winner but outfinished a foe for the place. DEXTER ROAD stalked the pace inside for a half, angled out nearing the far turn, chased the winner two
wide under a drive around the bend and was outfinished for second. INSPIRATO (MEX) settled off the pace while saving ground early, went two wide
around the far turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. TIP SHEET failed to menace while racing two wide. EARTHQUAKE had speed four wide around the
first turn and steadily faded outside after the opening quarter. INVASORS WIND was outrun while racing two wide. MR WRENCH IT pressed the winner
three wide and was done after a half. DONE ACTING played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
SOLDOLLIE grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, showed the way two or three paths off the rail, shook off a bid from KILLA DEE coming off the turn,
and was kept to pressure. KILLA DEE pressed SOLDOLLIE from outside, challenged with a quarter-mile remaining, could not match strides into the lane
and was clear of the rest. REAGAN'S HEART saved ground outrun early, stayed inside for the drive and was up for the show. HERO TIGER broke a step
slow, raced three to four wide around the turn, and was edged for the show. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA was always outrun. ARCHIVERO was hustled along
inside early, and tired. SOLITARY JACK faded around the turn two to three wide.
