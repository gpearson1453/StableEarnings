Footnotes
KAYDA was unhurried for a half mile, bid two wide on the second turn, rallied to the front in mid stretch and was clear driving. CHARLIE'S A. T. M. had no
speed, trailed to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then was no threat to the winner while besting the others. SWEET HUSSAR tracked the
pace early, dropped back to last on the second turn, swung three wide to the stretch then showed some interest in the final furlong. BRITE TAN broke slow
but was hurried to stalk the pace three wide, engage for the lead on the second turn but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. ENDLESS STORY
had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. GOLDEN GODDESS pressed the leader to the second turn, dueled two wide
to the stretch but tired through the drive. ARRIVEDERCI AMORE hustled to the front, led to the second turn then gave out.

Footnotes
HOMEGROWN rated in the 'catbird seat' for a half mile, rallied three wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch but came on late to wear down
AUTISM SAVANT and win going away despite not switching leads. AUTISM SAVANT set all the pace for six furlongs, responded to remain clear to mid
stretch then was tiring and could not stall the winner while easily second best. YNOT TONY was settled to the half, raced three wide on the second turn but
was not a threat to the top two. AUTISM SIBLINGS had no speed, raced two then three wide to the stretch and was also not a factor. VIBRAINUM had no
speed and was always outrun. THE SHYSTER trailed to the stretch while four wide and did not reach contention. GREY POINT pressed the pace to the
second turn then stopped.

CALIFORNIA COMET was outrun to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and pushed away late. DREAMING ABOUT YOU had
no speed, was two wide on the turn, shifted out into the stretch then finished steadily to deadheat with FAMILY TRIPS for second. FAMILY TRIPS chased
the pace three wide to the stretch, made a run to mid stretch then was outfinished and nailed on the wire to tie DREAMING ABOUT YOU. REAL KEEPER
contested the pace two wide to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was outfinished. SEIZE THE CHANCE dueled outside of REAL KEEPER and three
wide to the stretch then also responded to mid stretch but was tiring late. EDDIE'S PRINCESS chased the leaders two wide to the stretch then got outkicked
and tired. FINAL DEMAND chased the pace to the turn then was in tight between rivals, steadied leaving the three eighths and gave way.

FLAT WHITE broke clear and set the pace two wide to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then stepped out while the rider was trying to uncock his whip
but was corrected then drifted out late. PERRY STREET was chasing to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch, responded but had to check
leaving mid stretch when the winner drifted out into his path then could not improve late. JUNGLE ROAR was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the
stretch and was closed ground steadily late. ELUSIVE LOVE also chased the pace, saved ground and loomed a threat to mid stretch then flattened. TRASH
TALKIN CAT got outrun to the turn, also circled four wide but came up empty in the drive. FLICKERING LIGHT pressed the winner three wide to the stretch
then tired. CLASSIC PRESENCE trailed throughout. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run involving the winner and the runnerup but failed
to alter the results in a unanimous decision.

CAJUN BETTOR was outsprinted to the turn, raced three wide then swung out widest in upper stretch, rallied with a stout late run and got the nod on the
line. PEPPER SINGS set the pace while off the rail to the stretch, responded doggedly in the final furlong but was nailed in the last jump. CHANGING
IMAGE chased the leader to the turn, came two wide to the stretch then shifted out, rallied through a tight opening between rivals and was game to the line.
CASH LIMIT had no speed, raced three wide on the turn then angled out widest for the drive and closed willingly. IVORIAN got outsprinted to the turn,
saved ground to the stretch, shifted out for room in mid stretch then was blocked behind rivals and had to take up leaving the sixteenth pole. SIZZLING
EVENING pressed the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed determinedly to mid stretch then was outfinished. KLAY NATION prompted the action three
wide to the stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
WHOA NESSIE was four wide to the backstretch, stalked to the second turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, responded then was bumped sideways by
LADY BREXIT leaving mid stretch, but straightened and prevailed. LADY BREXIT was outsprinted, settled to the half, was two wide to the stretch then
shifted out, forced her way between rivals bumping the winner leaving mid stretch, had to angle out late and finished willingly. EVERYBODY DOES IT
chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then closed with a good run inside rivals in the final furlong. LEA'S REWARD prompted the
pace to the second turn, moved up to engage for the lead two wide, dueled to mid stretch then dug in gamely but was bested. LACEY'S RAINBOW was
pinched between rivals at the start and checked, had no speed, got fanned four wide to the stretch and finished willingly but too late. TINK'S TWIRL trailed
to the second turn, had to swing out five deep to the stretch but was finishing in a mild rally. PURE PERFECTION set the pace to the second turn,
responded determinedly when hooked by LEA'S REWARD, stayed to mid stretch then tired. FIERY CAUSE was four wide to the backstretch, settled to the
second turn, was two wide to the stretch but gave out in the drive. The stewards conducted an inquiiry into the stretch run involving LADYT BREXIT and
WHOA NESSIE but failed to alter the results.
