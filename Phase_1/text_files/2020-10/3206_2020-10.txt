Footnotes
MADE MY DAY (IRE) assumed the role of primary pursuer after making contact with UNCLE NED at the start, was rated along accompanying FORWARD
CURVE from path three, patiently kept watch as the leader rattled off fraction after fraction, got cued up spinning onto the top of the lane, closed in on the
one to catch in a steadfast manner in the final furlong, out-dueled the nemesis during the last few jumps to get up. FORWARD CURVE broke sharply, cut
over into the two path with the advantage, was held in reserve showing the way, shadowed by the winner one path farther off the rail, settled onto the head
of the stretch and was switched over to stronger handling, saw the top one whittle away at the deficit springing from the eighth pole, yielded reluctantly at the
end. ROYALE took up the chase two to three wide after making contact with another at the start, came into the stretch under a drive, fanned out five wide
for racing room, rallied for the show. VICARAGE guided over to the inside route after being bumped right after the start, picked up interest maneuvering into
path three from top of the second bend to the five-sixteenths marker, got set out six wide from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, mustered a
mild response afterwards. ACCESSIBLE was gently pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, pursued the pace primarily two wide during the initial stages,
was moved one path wider and quickened on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch, flattened out. INAPPROPRIATE rated within striking distance
two wide, lacked the needed response. UNCLE NED bumped with MADE MY DAY after losing its footing leaving the gate, raced sluggishly along the rail
bringing up the rear, failed to rally after being spotted two wide at the top of the lane. ONTHEWINGSOFLOU bumped from between rivals at the start, was
strung out three wide on the clubhouse bend, went about the subsequent one in path two, came three wide into the lane and backed away. TIZ ENVY
remained stationed along the rail after the start, checked hard prior to stepping onto the backstretch as the runner up was assuming control, kept pace with
the front runners for three-quarters, cut the corner into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
SOUTH AFRICA gained a slim lead after breaking in line with TRUE PALACE, slid onto the inside route, was forced to fend off a pair of rivals out in paths
two and three during the run around the bend, settled in upper stretch and was given his cue, responded to shake free, padded the winning margin in the
last eighth, kept busy to the end. NEURO along the outside, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, was already being roused by the quarter pole,
commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, won the place. ERNIE BANKER was moved into the three path after the start, forced the issue as the
outermost of three from path three for most of the trip on the turn, swung into the lane, failed to keep pace with the winner then lost out on second. PIER
FORTY remained stationed along the inside route, tracked the front runners hand urged, got asked to pick it up after the half had been completed, cut the
corner into the stretch and was outfinished. ME 'N SAP set up the two path, pressed the issue from between rivals from the top of the bend until near its
end, gave way. TACKLE sat reserved in between rivals from path two on the turn, got driven towards path six heading for the three-sixteenths marker,
folded. TRUE PALACE two wide departing the backstretch, was never in it. JUDGE ALEXANDER darted over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the
backstretch, tagged along with TRUE PALACE at the back of the pace, went into the stretch, had no offering.

GRADED ON A CURVE tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take narrow command a furlong from home, dug in dueling with the runner up to his inside through to the finish and got the bob gamely on the wire.
KLICKITAT forwardly placed just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, took over
command straightened away, got headed a furlong out and knocked heads to the finish with the aforementioned foe in game fashion but ultimately lost the
bob on the line. NUTZFORBOLTZ tracked the pace just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. RAPT coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. THE J Y bobbled at the break, recovered to
establish the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper
stretch, yielded command straightened away and weakened. PIPES chased along the inside, came under coaxing in the two path three furlongs from home,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. MANIFEST DESTINY just off the pace two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, retreated through the latter portion of the turn, went four wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
BRUSH COUNTRY forwardly placed vying for control during the initial stages, dropped into a tracking role as the first fraction was being finalized, despite
having been put to some hand encouragement, inched its way onto the outer border of the inside route after departing the backstretch, was forced to remain
on hold, idling in traffic from the general area of the three-eighths pole, turned about two wide into the lane, came upon a fleeting opportunity with which to
split rivals a sixteenth or so later, was unable and'/or unwilling to do so before that passage got clamped down after SKYLER'S SCAMJET wandered slightly
to the outside himself. ventured onward idling along, came upon a second opportunity with which to split rivals and launch a rally with approximately a
sixteenth to go, after SHAMROCK had drifted out several paths, willingly moved through this much wider space, went to the front end and held sway.
RELEASETHETHUNDER pursued the pace two to three wide, got sent out into path six spinning into upper stretch, clawed his way forward to be along for
the place. SHAMROCKED disputed the pace from path two while between opponents for a good portion of the trip leading up to the end of the bend, shifted
out into path three for the stretch run, battled onward for the advantage, came out a few paths in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole, saw the top one assume
the top soon afterwards, stayed on for the show. SKYLER'S SCRAMJET argued for the lead from along the inside, saw winner grab the top in deep stretch,
then weakened in the final sixteenth. HAWAIIAN NOISES rode the rail, angled three wide into the stretch, lacked the necessary response.
WEGOTOLDYOUGOTSOLD departed the backstretch from path three, went into the lane a couple of paths wider having already backed away, then backed
away even more.

GRANDMAS FAVORITE just off the pace two to three wide in pursuit, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong tussling with the runner up through to the finish and was up in the final jumps to prevail. COMPLEX SYSTEM hustled from the gate,
chased along the inside, got let out spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, knocked heads with the
aforementioned foe getting collared in the final strides and was forced to settle for the place honors while clear of the rest. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER
established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed along the inside, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was
collared near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. NO NAY NOW (IRE) chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. COLLOQUIST broke in at the start bumping ROMA CARPE in tandem with
BAYERN'S MIRAGE who broke outwards, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
weakened. MARKET IMPACT chased two to three wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals in the drive. BALLYDOOLEY (GB) chased along the inside from mid pack, advanced under coaxing to bid inside at the quarter pole, couldn't sustain
the move and tired in the stretch. BAYERN'S MIRAGE broke out at the start and bumped ROMA CARPE in tandem with COLLOQUIST, chased just off the
inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. MATTY'S MARAUDER chased just off the inside from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide for home and tired. WARFRONT FIGHTER brushed the off side stall at the start, chased three to
four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and made no impact. ROMA CARPE got bumped between rivals at the start
who each broke his way, chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
AHEAD OF PLAN responded to an abbreviated brisk hand ride to establish the top, moved over closer to the inside, was firmly held carving out the pace at
or near the rail, attended by PROPENSITY to his outside, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, began the final furlong with BOURBON
CURRENCY having burst upon the scene to the inside most dangerously, came in slightly after some right side pressure in the general area of the sixteenth
pole, leading the pilot of the second place finisher to continue to ask his mount but under much milder encouragement for a couple of jumps, got corrected,
then dug in gamely to stay in the clear. BOURBON CURRENCY away well, remained forwardly placed, got set up in the two path prior to stepping off the
backstretch, stalked AHEAD OF PLAN within striking distance, waited for options from late on the bend until upper stretch, tipped onto the rail right around
the three-sixteenths pole for racing clearance, was put to a ride and closed the gap readily, loomed boldly, latched on by the start of the final furlong,
became hesitant for two jumps a sixteenth later, after the winner temporarily shifted over onto his route, gained ample enough room soon afterwards, vied
on with willingness but had to settle for second. PROPENSITY prompted the pace two to three wide, challenged in earnest heading onto the top of the lane,
failed to claim the top, stayed on for the show. KNOCKOUT PUNCH took up residence in midpack, pursued the pace two to three wide, fanned out towards
path six from upper to midstretch, went fairly evenly late. COBBLE HILL guided onto the inside by the half mile pole, angled four wide for the drive, made no
impact. DUBAI BOBBY three wide onto the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no rally. MITZRAYIM kept an eye on the lead while saving
ground, came up empty after being spotted two wide at the head of the stretch. OPERATIVE departed the backstretch from path three, got sent out six wide
after entering the turn, never made his presence felt. HURRICANE HILL sighted two wide at the top of the turn, got steered into path five for the drive, had
no offering. COACH VILLA faltered after undergoing a ground-saving journey. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the first two finishers in deep
stretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
NO MO' SPENDING chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the final furlong to be up in the final jumps to the finish. IRISH CONSTITUTION established the front
from the get go and showed the way in hand from the two path, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was caught in the final strides to the wire. CHASING
CARA tossed her head and lunged at the start getting away last and conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased three then two wide coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. STIMULUS CHECK broke out at the start
and was corrected, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. INFRINGEMENT
chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, got coaxed along with three furlongs remaining, angled four wide at the head of the
stretch and tired.

VICTORY BUILT established control in short order, was well rated on a loosely-contested advantage from just off the rail, got cued up right around the
three-sixteenths marker, saw its advantage getting chipped away belatedly, held sway. MOONSHINE MAKER took up the chase from the two path, was
under a drive by the five-sixteenths pole, narrowed in during the final furlong procuring the place. BLACK IRISH bobbled in at the break, tracked the pace
from near the inside, arrived at the five-sixteenths pole having been set down, entered the stretch, got steered out two to three wide, and went on to secure
the show. IMPERIO D pinched at the start, was three wide on the turn and sent out seven wide exiting it, rallied mildly. COMPETITIVE CLOUD underwent a
ground-saving journey, gained ground steadily down the stretch, but all done without ever posing a serious threat. APEX PREDATOR brushed at the start,
cut over to the inside, got roused before finishing off the half, stepped into the lane, weakened. SLUGO corrected after breaking slightly to the outside, was
strung out four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, came out after some left side stick work with approximately a sixteenth
to go, not making any headway at the time. LIQUOR appeared unsettled after making light contact with APEX PREDATOR in the shadow of the starting,
was guided to the inside, slipped to the outside midway on the turn, went two to three wide into the lane, never made its presence felt. STASH MY MONEY
two wide entering the turn, was sent out into path three exiting it, weakened. NEVER HOLD BACK squeezed at the start, was a bit rank afterwards, travelled
three wide on the turn, moved out six wide for the drive, lacked the needed response. TALESPIN raced two to three wide on the turn, got spotted five wide
in upper stretch, had no offering. HAVE A HEART sighted four wide at the top of the turn, was moved out eight wide down the stretch to no avail.
PERMANENTRESIDENT forwardly placed three wide, was through before completing a half. GRATTO SWING stopped after pursuing the pace from path
two, then was pulled up quickly after the finish.
