Footnotes
LAVENDER (IRE) broke in and bumped foe at the start, traveled outside a rival then two wide, angled out near the three-sixteenths pole, surged outside the
leader and got up late under a drive. QUIET SECRETARY sprinted clear and angled to the rail quickly, widened into the backstretch, saved ground into the
stretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole but was caught in the closing moments. FREEDOM LASS stalked the pace from inside, closed in two wide around the
far turn, chased in range through the final furlong but could not summon the needed response late and held the show. LUCIA'S DESIGN went three wide
into the first turn then angled in some around the bend, raced outside a rival into the far turn, came three wide into the lane and failed to produce a bid.
GOODTINGSCOMINPINK tucked inside early then moved out into the two path, came out some in the stretch and lacked a rally. ZUCCHERA off a bit slow
and bumped leaving the gate, trailed the field early and angled to the rail, tipped out into the two path on the second turn and was never a factor. STAR OF
AFRICA raced outside a rival on the first turn, angled to the rail on the backstretch, remained inside into the drive and weakened. SAPPHIRE SILK saved
ground throughout and never threatened.

wire. MUCHLY (GB) rated behind the leader while a bit off the inside, closed in entering the far turn, challenged CORDIALITY at the quarter pole, fought
from the outside through the final furlong but could not get by. COLONIAL CREED stalked the pace in the two path, moved out into the three path around

far turn then moved out into the four path, responded mildly to urging and gained ground late. MEAL TICKET off a bit slow from the outside, traveled outside
a rival then four wide into the far turn, moved out into the five path around that bend then back in a bit into the drive and flattened out. DONUT GIRL off slow

Footnotes
RAIN DIVA had good early speed from inside, cleared SAINTS PAYNTER and set the pace along the rail, moved out into the two path around the bend,
widened on the field in the lane and was ridden out to the wire. MALIBU CAT tracked four wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend, drifted out in
the lane and bested the rest. SAINTS PAYNTER off alertly and vied with RAIN DIVA for early command then chased that rival while outside another,
entered the turn three wide then exited four wide, drifted out slowly through the lane and lacked a bid. SUMMER LOVE stumbled badly at the start, chased
in the two path through the turn and weakened. HEART RIVER raced four wide entering the turn, angled to the rail around the bend then back out entering
the stretch and proved no menace.

Footnotes
CAMBY pressed the pace from inside, took over in upper stretch, fought with OCTOPUS through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. OCTOPUS bumped
at the start, set the pace under pressure from inside, lost command in upper stretch but fought back through the lane and proved second best. TRUTH
SEEKER broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, trailed the field and angled to the rail, saved ground around the turn and got up for the show. BIG
BARREL chased off the inside, went four wide through the turn and weakened. LUCK'S ROYAL FLUSH chased four then three wide around the turn and
faded in the lane. VODKA TWIST brushed with inside rival at the start, chased off the rail, dropped back two wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
RUSTIC CANYON raced a bit off the rail in range of the leader, saved ground into the lane, tipped out near the eighth pole, put in a late bid and got up.
SILVER SUMMER set the pace inside, showed the way clear into the stretch and was caught in the late stages. TABLE FOR TEN allowed to settle near the
inside, went two wide into the far turn then moved out into the three path around the bend, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a late
rally. TRIBAL WAR CHANT stalked outside the leader then a bit off the rail, took aim two wide into the stretch but faltered in the final furlong. CLAIM OF
PASSION saved ground into the lane and never responded to urging. SEA OF LIBERTY unhurried in opening stages, raced off the rail, went four wide into
the second turn then moved into the three path and weakened in the drive. DOC TOMMY settled off the rail then outside a rival, went between foes at the
seven-sixteenths, steadied between at the quarter pole and could not regain momentum. JOHNNY PODRES tracked off the inside, went three wide into the
far turn then came in a bit around the bend, moved back out in the stretch and weakened.

RUN SNAPPY set the pace under pressure to the inside, cleared and angled to the rail on the turn, inched away into the lane and drew off under urging.
NASREDDINE off slow to begin, raced outside a rival early, moved out into the four path and closed well for the place. SANTOS TO WILSON pressed the
pace inside, in tight and checked at the three-eighths pole, moved a bit off the rail and got edged for the place. DRIVEHAPPY settled a bit off the inside,
went three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. LAUREL RIVER chased four then three wide around the bend and lacked a bid. NAMESAKE lacked early
speed, raced four wide then angled in on the turn, steered out back out leaving the bend and never made an impact. HOT PASTRAMI chased the top pair
from inside, steadied off the heels at the three-eighths pole, remained inside and weakened. MAC DADDY TOO chased from between foes, two wide
around the turn and faded in the drive. REFI NOW hard to load into the gate, off alertly from the outside, chased the speed three deep, moved into the two
path around the bend and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT BOTH SANTOS TO WILSON AND RUN SNAPPY
CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT AT THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
MO FORZA settled a bit off the rail, exited the bend two wide, came out in the lane, rallied four wide and drew away. SHARP SAMURAI stalked the pace
from inside, tipped out in the lane, bid between foes and proved second best. BOB AND JACKIE forwardly placed a bit off the rail, traveled outside a rival
around the far turn and into the stretch, bid three wide in the lane and edged BLITZKRIEG for the show. BLITZKRIEG set the pace inside, led clear to the
eighth pole, relinquished the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and lost the show. MAJESTIC EAGLE tracked a bit off the rail, raced two wide and outside a
rival into the stretch, chased between foes in the lane and proved no menace. ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) raced along the inside, saved ground into the lane and
failed to threaten. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE chased in the two path or outside a rival, moved three wide leaving far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
DEBT MONGER stalked the pace in the two path, applied pressure on the backstretch then chased the leader into the far turn, re-bid into the lane, took
over approaching the eighth pole and drew clear. GRYFFINDOR threw head to come away slowly, asked soon after and rushed up inside, moved clear and
set the pace along the rail, received pressure on the backstretch then inched away from that rival into the far turn, challenged again from that same foe into
the lane, fought back inside, lost command near the eighth pole and stayed on to secured the place. NEXT REVOLT stalked the leader in the two path and
finished willingly. MY JOURNEY stalked the speed off the rail, went three wide into the stretch and flattened. BAM BAM AGAIN went four wide around the
first turn, raced off the pace and five wide to the far turn, continued that wide into the lane and never rallied. LINFIELD traced between and was in tight
between runners into the first turn, angled to the rail around the bend, chased from inside, dropped back on the far turn and weakened.
SPEAKEROFTHEHOUSE raced five wide at the seven-eighths pole then moved in a path around the first turn, chased four wide to the lane and also
weakened. DOPO LAVORO entered the first turn three wide then angled to the rail, moved a bit off the inside then back to the rail and saved ground into the
stretch and never got involved.
