out three wide into the stretch, rallied but was outkicked by the top pair. GOT CURLY off slow and came in at the start, traveled along the fence into the turn
then angled out into the three path, steered back to the inside in the lane and finished well up the rail. LANCE THE LEGEND broke in at the start, chased
the early speed before sprinting clear from inside, showed the way into the stretch, lost command at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. DOGHOUSE off
alertly in the beginning, showed early speed then chased the leader a bit off the rail into the turn, angled to the fence around the bend then weakened in the

FLAT OUT JOY stalked the leader from outside, closed in around the turn and challenge midway through the bend and into the stretch, took a short lead in
upper stretch and inched away in the final sixteenth. WICKS AND CHAPPIES chased the leader two wide into the turn, remained a bit off the rail to the
stretch, angled out at the top of the lane, drifted in a bit under righ-handed urging, steered back out and came again late to earn the place. SWEET SONNY
had good early speed from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, met the bid from FLAT OUT JOY around the turn, lost command in upper stretch and
stayed on well from along the fence but lost second in the closing moments. CHOLLIMA tracked the pace widest early, traveled four wide into the turn then
moved into the three path around the bend and finished evenly in the final furlong. KATSAROS tracked off the rail then two wide into the turn, entered the
lane two to three wide and never made an impact.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE prompted the pace early then chased, challenged around the turn, headed rival at the eighth pole then took a short lead inside that
marker and held off the late charge from DOLCE at the wire. DOLCE chased three deep through the turn, summoned a late bid but could not get by the
winner. MISS FRAULEIN set the pace under pressure to the outside, inched away briefly before being challenged again around the turn, responded to
pressure and fought back along the rail, lost command inside the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly late. OVER ATTRACTED settled early inside,
angled out into and upper stretch, rallied and kept gaining to the wire. ACTING OUT chased between rivals around the bend, awaited room in upper stretch,
asked right-handed at the sixteenth pole and needed to find more. GALLOVIE (GB) chased inside a pair of rivals to the stretch and went evenly through the
final furlong. AFFIANCED stumbled badly at the start, raced outside a rival then floated out in upper stretch and lacked rally. TRANSPORTER stumbled
badly leaving the gate and was not persevered with.

CANADIAN GINGER set the pace with ICE KITTY to the outside, moved clear into the turn, inched away at the top of the lane and remained clear. DANIEL
THE DREAMER away quickly then dropped back bit to stalk outside the top duo, chased three wide through the turn and into the stretch, could not summon
the needed late punch to threaten the winner but stayed on well for the place. BLAZING CHARM lacked early speed, saved ground into the lane and
finished well up the inside. MISS BENNET tracked three then four wide around the turn, urged left-handed in the drive and failed to respond. ICE KITTY
pressed the pace from outside, started to weaken approaching the quarter pole then tired in the lane.

Footnotes
HOTITUDE broke well and raced up close outside a pair of rivals, chased three wide around the turn, bid outside and headed the leader at the eighth pole
then drew clear. TIME FOR EBBY stalked the pace while being steered toward the inside, angled to the rail around the turn and saved ground into the
stretch, angled out in the drive and rallied for the place. SILK FROM HEAVEN settled early, raced two to three wide into the stretch, drifted out in the lane
and summoned a mild late bid. MISS MEGAN knocked into rival at the start, set a pressured pace, moved clear around the turn, headed at the eighth pole
and weakened late. A MELIS broke in and bumped rival at the start, pressed the pace outside the leader, failed to keep pace and chased two wide into the
drive and kept on through the final furlong but lacked any late punch. HOT ON THE TRAIL stumbled badly in the beginning, raced off the pace while off the
inside, angled in on the turn and failed to threaten. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA bumped hard at the start, settled off the pace, came off the turn three wide and
was never a factor.

three wide, bid outside the top pair but was outkicked in the final furlong. SMILING SHIRLEE bumped from the inside at the start, chased outside a rival,
three wide into the turn then moved into the two path before shifting back out three wide into the stretch and failed to respond when asked.

Footnotes
PRINCE RICKY contested the pace from inside, cleared rival around the turn, showed the way through the drive, challenged in deep stretch and won the
bob. FULL DRAW well placed behind the top pair, traveled two wide around the turn, chased the winner through the lane then came with a late bid but lost
the bob. TIME TO TESTIFY bobbled leaving the gate, trailed the field early, went four wide into the stretch, angled out and summoned a mild rally to best
the rest. FLOYD MONEYMAKER tracked four wide into the turn, angled six wide leaving the bend and flattened in the final furlong. GOV FROM ABOVE
bumped from the outside at the start, off the pace in the early going, went three then two wide around the turn, angled out at the eighth pole and improved
position. MASTER RECOVERY mid-pack up the backstretch, moved to the rail and saved ground around the bend and into the stretch but lacked a rally
when needed. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN attended the pace three deep, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. PAPA'S HONEY off the pace early,
angled in on the turn then into the stretch and had little left for the drive. WILD CAT CANYON dueled for the lead from the outside, lost contact with the
winner around the bend, chased three to four wide into the stretch and gave way. MR SHOW OFF tracked five wide into the turn, angled into the three path
around the bend and came up empty. RAISE THE STAKES broke in and bumped rival leaving the gate, saved ground around the turn, crowded by rival in
upper stretch and was never a factor.
