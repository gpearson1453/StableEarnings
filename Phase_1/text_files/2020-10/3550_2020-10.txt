Footnotes
MY PRINCESS ELLIE brushed with outside rival at the start, went between foes around the first turn then moved up to press the pace from outside, took
over at the quarter pole, held a short lead over the runner-up through the final furlong and inched away late under urging. I'M ALL THE JEDI brushed at the
start, sped to the front and set the pace a bit off the rail through the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch with company to the outside, challenged
around the far turn and lost command at the quarter pole, continued inside the winner through the length of the stretch and stayed on for a clear second.
BIG CHICK came away awkwardly at the start, tracked in the two path then between foes into the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and bested
the rest. TAKE HER TEMP broke out and brushed rival, up close three deep then off the rail, went three deep once more into the far turn then four wide into
the stretch and weakened. PINK PHLOX stalked under restraint early from inside, saved ground into the lane and tired. TIZ PURE GRACE brushed in the
beginning, trailed the field through from off the rail, eased in the stretch to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL GIFT stalked outside a rival, took aim two wide around the far turn, put to left then right-handed urging in the lane and edged rival late. FLASH
MAGIC sped to the front and set the pace near the inside, inched away on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, led clear to the sixteenth pole and
got caught in the closing moments. DERBY QUEST traveled a bit off the rail through the first turn, went two wide around the last bend and had nothing left.
HATSHEPSUT pressed the pace briefly from outside into the backstretch, lost contact with the leader and chased two wide, was along the rail into the far
turn then moved out into the three path while dropping back, then eased into the lane and across the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
RIP CITY settled off the leader in the two path, stayed two wide to the stretch, tipped out at the top of the lane, rallied to the front inside the furlong marker
and drew clear. DR. TROUTMAN hustled to the front, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, showed the way near the inside to the stretch, lost
the lead past the eighth pole but held on for second. CITY RAGE tracked in the two path on the first turn, entered the far turn along the rail then angled out
into the three wide and missed the place. LIBERAL (IRE) off a bit slow to begin, settled outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and failed to produce
a bid. RONAMO off a bit slowly, trailed into the first turn, raced along the inside then two wide into the lane, angled out upper stretch and made no impact.
NEVER EASY settled off the pace along the inside, saved ground to the stretch and proved no menace.

Footnotes
COMMAS SAVE LIVES set a pressured pace into and around the turn, cleared rival approaching the quarter pole, widened in the lane then held safely in
the late stages. WARREN'S MEMORABLE stumbled leaving the gate, tracked the speed in the two path, angled to the rail around the bend then back out
into the two path leaving the bend, steered out in the stretch and summoned a late bid while unable to threaten the winner. SUPERNOVA WILDCAT
prompted the pace outside the leader, lost contact past the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and weakened. PRETTY SAYLEE tossed
head to off a bit slow from the outside, stalked off the rail then three wide through the turn, asked leaving the bend and weakened. LEMON ICE broke out
but was corrected quickly, chased three wide then four wide on the turn and weakened. ISHKA BAJA off slow to begin, traveled two wide into the turn then
three wide exiting and was never a factor.

FIRST PREZ stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the backstretch, along the inside to the turn, angled out leaving the bend, steered further out
in the stretch, rallied six wide and bested MASTER RYAN in deep stretch. MASTER RYAN broke in and bumped rival, chased the speed between rivals,
checked as SQUARED STRAIGHT shifted in at the three-eights pole, continued two wide to the stretch then angled to the inside, put in a rail bid and gained
command nearing the sixteenth pole but could not fend off the winner. N. K. ROCKET MAN tracked the pace from off the rail, went three then four wide
around the turn, bid five wide and outside a pair of rivals in the stretch but got outkicked. SQUARED STRAIGHT chased three deep then shifted in at the
three-eighths pole, exited the bend three wide, bid between foes in the lane but was also outkicked in the late stages. COUNT ALEXEI sped clear and set
the pace early, moved off the rail in the stretch, led to the eighth pole then yielded to pressure. MR. CLUTCH dropped back early, raced in the two path
through the turn and failed to rally. RIVER NORTH bumped leaving the gate, chased the pace inside a pair of rivals, was in a bit tight at the three-eighths,
remained along the rail to the stretch and faded.

GRYFFINDOR sent for the lead and took control from inside, led a bit off the rail up the backstretch then back to the rail around the far turn, came a bit off
the rail into the stretch and held well under right-handed urging. BAM BAM AGAIN stalked the leader from inside, entered the stretch two wide, angled out in
the lane and finished willingly to gain ground late. NEXT REVOLT broke in and bumped rival at the start, forwardly placed outside the top pair, chased
outside a rival on the far turn and three wide into the stretch and edged foe for third. BODEGA pressed the pace from outside, chased two wide around the
far turn, moved to the rail in the stretch and got edged for the show. CONTE CAVOUR bumped leaving the gate, stalked off the rail, went two wide into the
far turn then angled out and came four wide into the stretch, asked in the lane and failed to respond. SHOW BUSINESS stumbled badly leaving the gate,
chased off the rail then four wide leaving the final turn and had nothing left. ETTERBAY UCKLAY trailed the field along the inside, moved out into the two
path leaving the far turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
NICE ICE stumbled at the start, dueled for command from outside, inched away on the backstretch then cleared into the far turn, angled in around the bend
and held gamely late. KITTYHAWK LASS raced four deep around the first turn, tracked four wide into the second bend then angled into the two path, moved
back out some in the stretch and put in a late bid, gaining on the winner to the wire while edging CLEARLY GONE for second. CLEARLY GONE tracked the
pace three deep, angled to the rail around the far turn, finished well through the final furlong and missed the place. HURLEY stalked along the inside,
steadied off the heels of MISS FLAWLESS into the far turn and altered out, raced off the rail into the lane, angled out upper stretch, showed a mild response
but could not make an impact on the top trio. LUCKY PERIDOT stalked the pace between rivals, in tight at the three-eighths pole then angled to the rail after
MISS FLAWLESS checked back, then weakened in the lane. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) broke through the gate prior to the start, dueled for command from
inside the pressed up the backstretch, chased along the inside then came in tight quarters and checked sharply near the three-eighths, remained inside to
the stretch and was ridden out to the wire.

Footnotes
OIL CAN KNIGHT pressed from outside then dueled around the turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, cleared rival nearing the eighth pole and drew
away. POSTERIZE set the pace under pressure, dueled around the turn and into the stretch, failed to keep up approaching the furlong grounds and proved
no match in the late stages. SHANE ZAIN stalked outside a rival then three wide into the stretch and outfinished CAMBY for the show. CAMBY chased the
top pair from inside, moved out into the two path leaving the turn, urged right and left-handed in the drive and got edged for the show. LITTLEBITAMEDAL
raced along the inside then angled off the rail early, went three wide into the turn then four wide leaving the bend and failed to rally. VANDER KELEN raced
four wide into the turn, angled into the three path around the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
WESTWARD BREEZE off a bit slow from the outside, tracked two wide into the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, surged to the front in upper stretch, quickly
clear and won going away. SQUARED SHADY well placed behind the top pair, bid three wide into the turn, took control and carried a short lead into the
stretch, failed to offer any resistance to the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to hold the place. OUR LITTLE TIGER off slow and broke in, trailed early
then went around a rival, chased outside a rival or two wide into the stretch, angled out and got up for the show. FLAG SALUTE pressed the pace from
inside, lost ground into the turn, chased along the inside to the lane, altered out in upper stretch and got edged for the show. DON'T RUB IT saved ground
around the turn, angled out in the stretch then back to the inside and failed to rally. MISS REBEKAH saved ground to the lane and was never a factor.
CARELESS STAR set a pressured pace outside of FLAG SALUTE, put that rival away then dueled with SQUARED SHADY around the turn and gave way
in the lane.
