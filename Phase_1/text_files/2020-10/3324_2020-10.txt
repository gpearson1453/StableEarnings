Footnotes
OUR LITTLE DEVIL broke sharply despite bumping with NY BETH GETSITDONE, set the pace inside, and widened through the stretch under pressure. NY
BETH GETSITDONE broke in bumping OUR LITTLE DEVIL, chased outside that one throughout, and had enough to save the place. MATCHA was outrun
for three-eighths of a mile, moved out for the drive, and finished with good energy outside the runner-up. TWINKIESANDTURNIPS was in range turning for
home in the two-path, and lacked the needed bid. YOUR MY SUNSHINE lagged well back to the stretch, and improved position without becoming a factor.
MYSTIC MOON moved out approaching the top of the lane, and could not gain. SAUCY TUNE checked inside TOO STYLISH going past the three-eighths
pole, and dropped back approaching the stretch. MADAME ROUGE was forced out into the turn outside TOO STYLISH, and tired. MAKE A MINT chased
the leaders three wide early, and faltered into the stretch. SHINING SILVERSTAR showed little. TOO STYLISH took up sharply, strode awkwardly and got
out heading into the turn, dropped far back and was eased up late.

Footnotes
DESERT GENERAL saved ground unhurried early, came under a ride entering the far turn still inside, moved out four wide near the quarter-pole, kicked in
after straightening away for the drive, caught STARSHIP ARAMIS a sixteenth out and pulled clear. STARSHIP ARAMIS set the pace inside, got collared by
LI'L MEATBALL and SO LONG CHUCK after six furlongs, battled back to regain command in upper stretch, could not contain the winner through the late
stages, and saved the place. TIPSY KITTEN settled in striking range for six furlongs, finished willingly and just missed the place outside the top two. TIP
SHEET brushed with AREYOUTALKINGTO ME after the start, raced well back to the stretch, and improved position past tired horses. SO LONG CHUCK
brushed with LI'L MEATBALL at the start, prompted the pace two wide, bid between horses putting a head in front on the far turn, then weakened through
upper stretch. LI'L MEATBALL became unruly and brushed with SO LONG CHUCK leaving the gate, raced four wide into the first turn, challenged for
command outside the leaders five-sixteenths out, but could not sustain the rally into the lane. AREYOUTALKINGTOME brushed with TIP SHEET after the
start, and failed to menace.

ALPILLES set the pace inside to the stretch, dug in through the final furlong and held off challengers from both flanks. SUBSIDIARY brushed with FAST
VENEZUELA after the start, pursued ALPILLES from outside all the way, and ran on with good courage to get the place. BETTERTHENYOURX was
hemmed in behind the leaders around the turn and through upper stretch, lodged a late bid inside, and was outkicked to the wire. PLAY THAT TONE saved
ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved out to the four-path and was going well too late outside the top trio. TAKE THE OVER was outrun inside for three
furlongs, and gained mildly without threatening. THE OTHER CAT bumped with FAST VENEZUELA at the start, chased three wide to the top of the stretch,
and had no rally. BROADWAY PEGGY raced two wide around the turn, and posed no threat. FAST VENEZUELA bumped with THE OTHER CAT at the

Footnotes
ADVANCE CASH brushed with TRINNI SUMMER at the start, dueled early outside INDY LYON, edged away around the turn, moved inside through the
stretch and widened under a drive. TRIPLE JEOPARDY was outrun to the stretch, kicked in suddenly on the far outside past the eighth-pole, and was up for
the place. HEALS THE SOUL checked sharply toward the inside past the half-mile marker, moved out approaching the stretch, and ran on with good
courage to gain a share. BIG VENEZUELA saved ground into the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. BLACK V. K. fanned five wide coming off the turn, and
improved late. INDY LYON vied early inside ADVANCE CASH, could not match strides around the turn, and tired. DOO WOP DON raced three wide in
range to the stretch, and tired. BIG FRANK lacked room through most of the stretch run, was brushed by DREAM OF ANFIELD a furlong out, and tired.
THIS DUDES NO FOOL brushed the left side of the gate coming out, advanced four wide on the turn, and flattened out in the drive. MASTER OF
DISASTER reared at the start coming out several lengths behind the field, and remained far back. DREAM OF ANFIELD shied out greenly and brushed with
BIG FRANK in mid stretch, and tired. TRINNI SUMMER brushed with ADVANCE CASH at the start, and was through early.

Footnotes
LAKE PARIMA took command with an alert beginning, rated along through leisurely early fractions, responded when set down at the top of the stretch, and
remained clear. DIVINE MARTHA prompted the pace outside LAKE PARIMA from the start, was asked in earnest five-sixteenths out, could not cut into the
margin and ran on second best. REMARKABLE SILVER raced three wide early, moved in through the middle stages tracking behind the leaders, and could
not gain through the stretch under pressure. MATADOR MOON was well back into the far turn, came four wide for the drive, and improved position without
menacing. VENEZUELANCHAMPION never got out of the second flight. MOONLIGHT MISS was four wide early, went three wide on the far turn, and had
no rally. COPPER swerved out to avoid the spill entering the first turn at the back, and remained outrun. CATIRAS TEAM was forwardly placed early, and
tired. LOOKN FINE AS WINE settled in the middle of the field early, and tired. MYSTICAL CHARGE got clipped from behind entering the first turn, and tired.
LETSNOTGETOEXCITED clipped heels behind MYSTICAL CHARGE entering the first turn, fell unseating the rider, was apprehended and escorted off.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ENTERING THE FIRST TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
BAJAN GIRL rated along through an easy pace, widened approaching the stretch, and continued to draw away through the stretch hand urged on her left
lead. HEIRESSINDY had the rider momentarily step off in the gate due to a fractious horse next door, broke a step slowly, steadied inside past the
seven-eighths pole, saved ground to the stretch, and rallied to be clearly second best. ANTIGONE entered the backstretch four wide, and failed to menace.
FREE TO FLY took up behind horses going by the seven-eighths pole, raced four or five wide, and failed to threaten. CONGRATSROSY was four wide
early, lodged a brief bid outside the winner on the far turn, but gave way into the lane. YES FACTOR appeared to take a bad step and checked sharply
midway on the far turn, and dropped back. THISSMYTIME became fractious unseating the rider and briefly sitting down in the stall prior to the start, backed
out and reloaded, checked entering the first turn behind horses, steadied along with the rider straight up in the irons late on the first turn, dropped far back
after six furlongs, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
ROCKET JOE COPPER vied early outside rivals, took over up the backstretch and moved inside, and was driving to stay well clear. ZAP DADDY saved
ground early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and finished with good energy. DUROCHER was outrun to the stretch, and rallied belatedly
outside rivals to get up for the show. TUNE IN advanced mildly leaving the far turn, and finished evenly between horses. SOUPER JAGUAR saved ground
to no avail. WISE TO LISTEN lacked speed for a half-mile, and improved without becoming a factor. GRAN MALBEC never reached contention. POSITIVE
PHIL raced three to four wide, and was no factor. FAMOUS FACT vied early inside, remained prominent to the quarter-pole, and gave way. TAAMER
moved up after a half-mile, but could not sustain the bid. BENEFACTOR steadied between the leaders on the first turn, retreated steadily approaching the
stretch, and jogged in far behind. Six-furlong fraction unavailable due to timer malfunction.

Footnotes
MANGROVE MAMMA set the pace inside, turned back a challenge from GREY CHARLOTTE approaching the stretch, and was driving to stay clear. GREY
CHARLOTTE pressed the pace outside MANGROVE MAMMA from the outset, bid in earnest coming to the quarter-pole, could not get by and ran on
second best. TERRY'S DREAM saved ground throughout, and finished evenly inside. PLAYERA steadied early between horses, was outrun to the stretch,
and rallied outside rivals for the last major share. PINE LEAF stumbled at the start, raced evenly and lacked a solid final response. IRAZU failed to menace
three wide. BLAZED N CONFUSED was urged along after a quarter-mile, and faded past the quarter-pole. QUIET STRENGTH was outrun throughout.
LEYENDA hit the left side of the gate at the start, steadied off the heels of PLAYERA early, and was never close.
