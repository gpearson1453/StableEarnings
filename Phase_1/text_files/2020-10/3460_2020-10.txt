Footnotes
SUSI SOLE was unhurried while racing four wide around the first turn, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in deep stretch.
SQUARE PEG set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. STYLISH NINETYNINE raced off the pace two
wide, came five wide into the lane and rallied for the show. WEE ARCH tracked the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. LA SMARTY broke outwardly and
slowly, raced five wide around the first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, moved into a clear second two wide around the far turn and weakened
in the lane. SPITFIRE ANNIE failed to menace while racing two wide. I AM A. LURING chased the pace four wide and faded nearing the stretch. LWF
DRIVE BYE GAL stumbled at the start and made little impact while racing two and three wide. SISTER SEVILLE was rank and steadied along around the
first turn and was through early. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE pressed the pace two wide and stopped after a half.

around the far turn, stormed to the front nearing the eighth pole, dueled outside of the winner from there, held a narrow lead to deep stretch and was
outgamed late. V. I. P. TICKET tracked the pace three and four wide, could not quicken with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on to easily best the
rest. AULD LANGE SYNE saved ground and failed to menace. PALACE KITTEN stalked the pace two wide and faded around the far turn. THE STIFLER
set the pace along the rail and retreated from the five-sixteenths. SAINT ALFRED played no factor while racing three and four wide. HE'S SUPER LUCKY
was outrun inside.

APRILNESS set the pace along the rail, led past the eighth pole, could not resist the winner but held well to preserve the place. MOSLER'S IMAGE stalked
the pace two wide, could not match strides with the top two in the final furlong but held well enough for the show. PRINCESS NINA lacked early speed
inside, advanced two wide around the turn, loomed nearing eighth pole, continued on the lead and flattened out. SONG OF HONOR was bumped at the
start, saved ground and never threatened. CINCONOLA was outrun while racing three wide. RENAGADE RUSH played no factor while racing four wide.
VERBIEN O. P. was bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and steadily faded.

second. ZAYA lagged well back inside, advanced five wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. HERO'S HOPE stalked the pace three and four wide
and lacked a closing bid. FINAL PROSPECT was fractious in the starting gate, raced five wide around the first turn, went three wide around the far turn and
never threatened. SACRAMENTO Q was fractious in the gate, raced two and three wide and failed to menace. LITTLE MAZZY had brief speed inside.
