Footnotes
SKY VUE tracked from between rivals off the early leaders, was held up in behind entering the turn two wide, gradually moved out to be four wide coming
out of that bend, took command just outside the eighth pole and drew clear. RECEPTION pressed the early pace from outside, went three wide into the turn,
was no match for the winner but fought on to maintain the place. TUTTA TERLINGUA attended from between rivals early, went two deep on the turn with a
narrow lead, was overtaken in upper stretch and fought on for second to no avail. MOVIN' ON BYE raced off the leaders just off the inside about two to
three wide into and on the turn, moved out four to five deep in upper stretch and improved position. ATTILAS GAL vied for the early lead inside rivals but off
the rail, moved nearer the rail entering the turn and began to weaken. SEEKARAP raced outside toward the rear, went four to five wide on the turn and
failed to rally. LAST TO BLUSH failed to threaten while saving ground. SWEET PARTING switched outside foes with the early lead and advanced with mild
coaxing outside those, went into the turn four wide and just off the leaders but came up empty thereafter. FRITZIES FLAME broke awkwardly and several
lengths slowly, switched outside rivals and was encouraged forward moving to mid-pack four to five wide into the turn, was empty in the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
IMA REAL DEAL settled off the leaders tracking from inside, switched outside the leader heading toward the far turn, bid three wide coming to the quarter
pole, drew clear in the stretch. GOLD NOTE settled last but one early racing just off the rail through the first turn, moved out thereafter, began to advance
past rivals four to five wide leaving the turn and continued to improve to get up for place in late stretch. MOVE IT MISTER raced outside and off the leaders
mostly four to five wide in the early going, passed foes about three wide into upper- to mid-stretch but was outfinished for place. TREBULSKI raced
mid-pack three to four wide in the early stages, shifted in and saved ground on the far turn advancing past rivals, needed more in the lane. SEXY DEXY set
the pace racing in the clear just off the rail, was challenged nearing the quarter pole, overtaken at that juncture and gave way. INCLUDE HOO was kept of
the inside at the rear, went mostly in the four to five path and passed tired rivals. JEDI WARRIOR shifted in heading to the first turn, went two wide on that
bend mid-pack, continued just off the rail and was empty for the drive. STRYDER was urged forward at the break, chased the pacesetter from outside going
three wide, dropped back and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION OPENING FRACTIONAL SPLIT UNAVAILABLE.
