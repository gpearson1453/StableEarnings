path but then was no match late. STRICTLY THE BEST broke slowly, raced very wide and closed too late. BOSTON LIGHT raced between foes while just
off the pace and had no rally. OUR STORMIN NORMAN'S head was moving at the break, he was angled to the rail, bid on the turn then tired.
GOLDENLINEOF, in the four path while unhurried, failed to menace. LITTLE VINNIE stalked from the four path then tired.

seven sixteenths marker, waited for room on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch and just missed for the place spot. SIZZLING ROMA raced off the
pace, tracked between rivals on the turn, continued between horses in the stretch and lacked a bid. MAD MARY stumbled at the start, raced off the pace
inside and failed to threaten. WOMAN FLYER set the pace racing in the two path, shook free on the turn, dueled passing the quarter pole and weakened.

Footnotes
CONGRATS ANSWER, two wide second flight, moved out wider racing into stretch, opened a long lead near mid stretch and then held on under pressure.
FOUR SEASONS GIRL broke slowly, saved ground to the turn, swung out wide into stretch and closed. SECRET ZAR, bothered badly leaving the gate,
saved ground early, swung wide into stretch and closed well. BELLA G, between rivals and just off the pace, swung out very wide into stretch and came up
empty. SHATTER ME saved ground just off the pace, was blocked near quarter pole, eased out to secure racing room but then angled back to the rail and
had no kick. NEW JERSEY stumbled leaving the gate then was bothered badly, soon after, failed to menace passing tiring foes. I'AM A UNICORN came in
sharply after start causing crowding, raced widest and tired. JULIET'S MUSIC lunged and opened her gate prior to start, vied for the lead two wide and then
tired. GROOVE broke slowly and showed little. JAFFLE duel for command just off the rail, drifted out and tired.

Footnotes
IRISH HONOR, racing in the three path while just off the pace, fell back on the turn, split rivals rallying through stretch and took the lead in the final seventy
yards. CAPO KANE, reluctant to load, dueled three wide, drifted out while drawing clear near mid stretch and couldn't hold off winner. JIMMY THE KID
dueled for command in the four path, moved closer to the rail on the turn and faded late. BRETT'S WORLD came in and bumped with PRINCIPINO leaving
the gate then continued to come in and bumped that same rival, raced wide and finished willingly. PRINCIPINO came out at the start, contributed to the
bumping, with BRETT'S WORLD, continued to be bumped by that rival, raced very wide. DOWNTOWN DOC BROWN dueled for command racing wide and
then gave way. COBBLE ROAD lunged slightly breaking slowly and showed little. MR. DODA was not a serious threat. HARRY EL GALLERO broke right
hitting the side of the gate then showed little. GO SKIPPY GO ducked in after the start and was far back.

closer to the rail, eased out through stretch and was just up. PITCHING ARI stalked two wide, took the lead near quarter pole, extended his lead with a
furlong to run and was nailed on the wire. MR THRIFTY vied for command inside and battled tenaciously to the wire. INFORMATIVE, three wide under
