DYNAMIC FORCE was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch proved best. DYNA'S GAMBLE was away alertly
and had the lead on the turn but with a clear lead through the stretch failed to hold. STROLLING POSSE forced the pace and was a factor on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. QUEEN'SPLATE NOLAN had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the six path
at the top of the stretch failed to fire. POSTMAN PAT set a pressured pace but chased on the turn and had nothing left. ONE POUND STERLING was well
back, showed little and from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no impact. HOLYSNAPENEYEBALLS was off the pace and roused from the inside
on the turn but had no response.

MISS TEA BLONDE was in range, a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. STARDUST KITTEN was
hustled early, dueled on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. KEEP YOUR SILENCE was in touch, had a mild gain on the turn and was up
for show. FLATOUTONAMISSION showed speed from the outside and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch gave way.
FOREST AT DAWN was well back, trailed the field on the turn and was not a factor. WEDDING RING was off slow and showed little in a dull effort.

TOWN DANCER was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and was much the best. GUNZIG STINGER was in range and moved up on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. MAKE IT RAIN was off the pace and gained ground on the turn but leveled off
through the stretch. IM NO SAINT was unhurried early and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no real threat.
OPTIMYSTICAL was well back, raced evenly on the turn and was the best of the rest. LORD PIETRO broke poorly and showed little while outrun.
BOURBON PARTY showed speed from the outside but chased on the turn and came up empty. MI CHIAMO STEFANO was up close early but lost ground
on the turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

Footnotes
BREAD CRUMBS was in range, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. TRINITY THUNDAH showed speed
from the inside, had a slim lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. CONQUER THE BREEZE forced the early pace and dueled on
the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. HONORABLE GIBSON was off slow, saved ground on the far turn and was up for a
share. SOUL N' SPIRIT was in touch and had a good position on the far turn but weakened through the stretch. TIZ TAP TANGO was off the pace, showed
little and had no impact. KYSLIOS'S JUSTICE was in mid pack but lost ground on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
BEL TEMPO was unhurried early, gained ground far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear. AUDREY GRACE was in mid pack and
a factor on the far turn but with the lead at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. MUSICAL FLIGHT showed no speed, had a mild gain on the far
turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. HILLTOP HARMONY forced the pace and had the lead on the far turn but had nothing
left. JACK'S MEMORY was off the pace and moved up on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. ALERT KITTEN set
the pace but lost ground on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch. REBEL LIONESS was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but came up
empty.

NAKED ILLUSION tracked the early leaders from the outside, was a factor on the far turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch
prevailed. ABOVE THE LINE stalked the early leader and forced the pace on the far turn but was outfinished. STARONTHEHORIZON was up close and
had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. NATURAL HABITAT was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired
foes through the stretch. HIPPIE CHICK was off the pace and hustled along on the far turn but was not a factor. DOODLE DANDY was in range and had a
mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ALITTLEIRISHLUCK set the pace but chased on the far turn and from the
four path at the top of the stretch was empty. MISSION CITY GIRL was in touch, raced evenly on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RO was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off. BUTLER'S PICK was up
close, had a slim lead on the turn and vied from the three path through the stretch but was no match for the winner. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was
unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. WHO'S GOT IT had no speed and saved ground
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. BRADY O'BRADY was off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch needed more. RAVEN'S CRY showed speed from the inside and was a factor on the turn but had nothing left. MIDNITE
SNACKATTAK was hustled early but chased on the turn and came up empty.
