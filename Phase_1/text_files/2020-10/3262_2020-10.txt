HERE COMES BARNEY was hustled to the front, responded to looming threat approaching the stretch and stayed clear. ZBIG chased four to five wide
leaving the backstretch, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, closed gradually outside but could not stall the winner. DITES MOI reserved off the
pacesetters, drove four wide at the head of the lane and was along late for show. CAPTAIN WAY sat just off the pace while four wide, launched an all out
rail bid and weakened with a sixteenth remaining. MOON JUICE hurried away, chased inside through the turn and came up empty for drive. POOR RUBEN
outrun throughout.

Footnotes
NO COLLUSION sat in striking position from the two path, was shuffled back in traffic leaving the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader, rallied outside
and edged away. CAGEY settled just off the pace while three wide, cleared the lead at the three eighths, responded to challenged from NO COLLUSION
then was out finished but best of the rest. HI DREAMIN lagged early, raced wide entering the lane, closed late for show. BETTY DO IT raced four wide into
the opening turn, advanced quickly outside leaving the backstretch, fanned three wide into the far turn and lacked a closing response. SALTY O'DAY was
rank leaving the opening turn, angled inside then raced in tight quarters under a strong hold along the rail, lacked running room inside into the far turn and
faded. PIPPA unfair start and declared non-starter. SECRET PROPOSAL led the field into the backstretch, was overtaken into the far turn and gave way.
*STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race involving PIPPA, after review PIPPA was deemed to have had an
unfair start and was refunded. **STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry in the backstretch involving SALT O'DAY but made no change.

LYLA LORRAINE rated off the pace while three wide, drove four wide into the lane, rallied determinedly outside then dug in getting by just in time. WHOOP
IT UP chased the pacesetters from between foes, came three wide then was headed at the top of the stretch and was caught late. LEENA lagged early
while four to five wide, gained closer order in the far turn, shifted outside into the stretch, finished well outside missing out. THRILLOFTHECHASE vied
racing into the backstretch, led the field through the backstretch and flattened out through the stretch. CAMANO COMET dueled leaving the chute, chased
leader through the backstretch and was unable to improve position. WEST PRINCESS settled in the four path off of the pacesetters, chased through the far
turn and had nothing left in reserve. ROADSIDE KISSES outrun throughout.

down and held. DOMENICO saved ground inside, coaxed three wide into the final turn, closed steadily and missed. RUN JEANNE RUN settled three to four
wide early, went in pursuit of the leader leaving the backstretch, lodged an all out bid but was no match for winner and edged out late. ALL MIGHTY BO
raced in second flight from the two path, bid outside then steadied nearing the stretch and improved late. SHELLEY'S DREAM chased between rivals
through the backstretch and had nothing left in reserve late. STEELFORCE never reached contention. STREET RULER tracked inside and tired early.

Footnotes
BONANZA CREEK hustled away, saved ground through the turn, came five wide entering the lane, drifted in through the stretch while rallying steadily
outside and was along in time. IMACLASSICMEN quickest to the turn then angled towards the rail, dueled outside of LORD STANLEY through the final turn,
edged away into the stretch and was run down late. LORD STANLEY vied inside, moved up alongside IMACLASSICMEN to contest the lead, was unable to
sustain the bid that was needed and weakened inside. GOLDSHAFT hurried away, raced three wide into the opening turn, was set down for a drive at the
quarter pole and flattened out. WILA MIST last away then hustled outside to the turn and offered a late mild rally. IT'S NO HOLIDAY hurried, chased through
the turn and faded. JAZZY GIRL allowed to settle and lacked a serious bid. I'MAMUDDERTOO broke inward and was outrun. TARTANS QUEST never
reached contention.

Footnotes
RACING RIVER came outward leaving the chute bumping BACK ALLEY CAT, was under strong hold inside, swung out three wide then moved up
alongside SLEW'S BAK to challenge the lead, dug in late and inched clear. SLEW'S BAK showed outside speed then angled inward quickly, contested the
early pace, responded to challenge from RACING RIVER and was bested. WYE CROSS shifted outside leaving the backstretch, chased wide into the lane,
rallied gradually under encouragement then inched up to earn show. SOUTHERN WARLORD stalked the pacesetters while three to four wide, drove four
wide then rallied determinedly inside and narrowly denied late. BACK ALLEY CAT fractious in gate then was bumped away, dropped back into the far turn
and rallied belatedly. SILENT RHYTHM away well then contended the early pace from the two path, was overtaken then chased inside and gave way into
the stretch. REGAL CANDY fractious in gate then trailed the field and failed to menace. TANNIN tracked outside and retired early.

Footnotes
HALLIE'S HERO settled outside early, gained closer order through the far turn, came four wide nearing the quarter pole, angled in early stretch then rallied
gradually inside and held sway. ZICATELA tracked three wide, advanced outside through the final turn, droved up alongside the SOLO RING and was out
kicked by inside rival. EDDYSHAK sat mid pack early, swung five to six wide coming out of the final turn, closed gradually under steady urging and missed.
SOLO RING contested the early pace from the two path, moved clear around the five sixteenth, started to show signs of tiring entering the stretch and gave
way grudgingly between foes. MR. KALYPSO raced at the back of the pack, lodged a rail bid at the five sixteenth marker and raced evenly through the
stretch under urging. ACE OF DIAMONDS was gapped early and bid belatedly. LONE PIONEER late mild bid. HOOCHIECOOCHIE SAM lodged a mild bid
and flattened out. WARREN'S VAN GOGH lacked serious bid. ALL UNDER CONTROL sat in striking position while four wide and was done early. IRISH
GOLD sprinted clear leaving the chute, contended the early pace inside of SOLO RING, steadied near the five sixteenth and retreated. JOCKEY
OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of IRISH GOLD against the rider of SOLO RING alleging interference at the five sixteenth pole was not
allowed.

CASH REWARD angled to the inside to rate the pace, took pressure through the backstretch inside of SUPER INDIAN, gained a short advantage over rival
with a furlong and a half remaining and held under steady handling. INDICATIVE raced three wide into the opening turn, settled four to five wide, was asked
to quicken through the final turn, was gaining late but settled for second best. SUPER INDIAN (FR) went three to four wide leaving the opening turn,
prompted the pace from the two path, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed then was out finished for place still maintained for third. MOROCCAN
WARRIOR stalked the pacesetters from the three path, chased four wide into the lane but unable to improve contending position through the drive.
BOLSANO saved ground from the two path early, lacked running room inside after the five sixteenth marker and bid evenly through stretch. BIG EGYPT
chased five wide through the backstretch and failed to threaten in the drive. AZTEC KEY offered little. NORTHERN SKY saved ground inside and lacked
bid.

Footnotes
MY SAMURAI WARRIOR rated the pace inside, drew clear through the far turn and remained unchallenged. KIWITAHI chased four wide, rallied four wide
entering the stretch and edged away for place. CHISUM G stalked two to three wide, chased in closest pursuit into the final turn and was out kicked for
place. LITTLE BRIAN sat mid pack from just off the rail, lodged a rail bid into the stretch and flattened out. MR. IRRELEVANT away well, chased the leader
four to five wide and tired early. NEVER EVEREVER was not a factor.
