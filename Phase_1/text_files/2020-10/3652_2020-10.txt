Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL CURE , patiently handled in range while between rivals, eased out and took closer order heading towards the lane, engaged WELLING from
his outside with a quarter to go, was roused clear past the three sixteenths then held firm under a steady drive. WELLING edged up inside under rating past
the five eighths, tracked leaving the far turn, got through along the rail to take command entering the lane, ceded to the winner past the quarter pole but
stayed on well from there while well clear of the rest. TOE CURLIN' KISS lagged off the pace, angled six wide under a ride entering the lane, kept on
willingly and got the show. ENGLISH TAVERN lost ground five wide, moved up some into the turn to prompt the pace, was under pressure outside foes into
the lane, failed to go with the top pair but continued with some effort. RIGGINS , between rivals, altered in through the drive but lacked a solid finish.
OFFICER COUNTRY took over to the inside of horses early on, set the pace off the rail, began getting out mid turn, wandered to about the six path entering
the stretch, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. TROUBLE COFFEE prompted three to four wide, dropped back between foes mid turn then came
up empty. GALLINIPPER , three to four wide, was steadied briefly in upper stretch and failed to pose a threat. NOBLE WEED was rated back from between
runners soon after the break, angled in and made a run mid turn, chased into the lane then faded. JUNIOR BUG was hung out very wide, moved up into the
turn to be in range, chased to mid turn then tired.

IN THE LOOP sprinted to a two wide lead leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and drew off under urging. DRILL'S LI'L MAN showed speed
along the rail down the backstretch, dropped back a bit on the turn, swung to the three path turning for home and rallied. JACK STRAIGHT , three deep
chasing the winner around the turn, weakened through the stretch. SUCCESSFUL ZIP hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled out in mid stretch and failed
to menace. SUNMAN circled the turn three wide and was not a factor. WOLFINBARGER saved ground on the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, was
fanned four wide in upper stretch and gave way. KING MAURO trailed.

Footnotes
SKI BUNNY rated close up, bid three deep to join the leaders with a little more than a half mile remaining, sparred past the three eighths then shook clear
mid way on the final turn, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, lugged in while on her left lead then was taken in hand through the final sixteenth. WE
FIVE sped to the early lead along the rail, was headed with three quarters to go, came back to poke a head in front near the far turn, dueled, angled out
chasing the winner into the lane then came back to cut into the margin as the winner was being geared down. RYE STREET , four wide early, settled off the
pace, moved up five wide into the stretch and finished willingly. KHALOS VISION rated in range while in the clear, angled under a ride to take closer order
past the five sixteenths, pursued four wide into the lane and faded. GRAND ENTRADA lagged far back to the quarter pole, shifted out and closed too late.
LA SMARTY broke a step slow and was outrun. SQUARE PEG broke awkwardly and failed to menace. PO DUNK pulled her way two wide and put a head
in front soon into the backstretch, failed to shake free, was surrounded into the far turn and faltered past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
LOST IN LIMBO saved ground around the turn stalking the pace under snug rating, found room along the rail in upper stretch, swept to command
approaching the eighth pole then drew out while kept to his business. CAREY TIMES , two wide waiting for room leaving the turn, floated three wide turning
for home, angled to the rail near the eighth pole and rallied nicely. BLESSED ARION showed speed along the rail, disputed the pace, drifted out turning for
home, brushed ZYRAMID when drifting out near the eighth pole and weakened. PIANZI lacked speed behind horses, angled out on the turn, swung to the
seven path in mid stretch and rallied. PHANTOM RO , two wide on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and flattened out between horses. TIP
FOR TAP saved ground on the turn and was not a factor. BULL SHARK , four deep on the turn, weakened. PERFECT COVER , reluctant to load into the
starting gate, hugged the rail on the turn while outrun. ZYRAMID , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, was brushed in mid stretch and gave way.
AMERICAN TALENT stumbled leaving the starting gate then raced in the two path on the turn while outrun. TEAK disputed the pace two wide and faltered.

Footnotes
HALF HAMMERED edged up between rivals early, was under coaxing chasing a three pronged battle past the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the
lane, swept to command in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive in mid stretch then proved best while kept alert. QUICKSTRIKE was shuffled back
nearing the five eighths pole, recovered and dropped in, advanced towards the rail nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and closed willingly. GOLDEN
MOON SHINE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined near the three eighths, sparred to the inside of a pair of rivals to the head of the
lane, faded in the final furlong and managed to just save the show. AWFULLY FOXY broke slowly, lagged of the early pace, saved ground into the lane,
worked outward through the final furlong and rallied. STORYBOOK FARM stalked outside, bid three deep to challenge leaving the far turn, dueled and
gained a slim lead after a half mile, kept on to about mid stretch then gave way. MS MAD DOG stalked the pace, bid between foes departing the far turn,
battled into the lane and weakened in the last eighth. NOR PER OURS chased the pace, circled five wide and lacked a bid. MONKEY ON MY BACK saved
ground stalking the early pace, was under pressure mid turn, drifted and weakened. R AWESOME ROSE , off the pace, raced between rivals leaving the far
turn, altered in near the three sixteenths but lacked a rally. BROOKE N LOGAN lacked speed, raced outside rivals into the turn then began a retreat past the
three eighths pole.

Footnotes
INSIDE THE BOX edged up to the inside of rivals nearing the three quarter pole, rated kindly while saving ground mid turn, angled five wide advancing into
the lane, straightened away and closed determinedly under right handed asking, forged to command near the sixteenth marker and drew clear. PILOT
EPISODE stalked inside rivals, eased out mid turn to have aim on the dueling leaders, rolled up four wide to engage the leader soon into the lane, took
command near the three sixteenths, failed to shake free then gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. BY THE BOOK was rated back from between rivals
soon after the break, saved ground while off the pace past the half mile marker, swung five wide with momentum into the lane and kept on with good energy
to bridge the gap. FAIRY WISH , off the pace while two wide early on, dropped to the rail around the turn, remained inside through the drive and closed
steadily. SPEEDY VANESSA broke alertly, took command and dropped in to secure the rail, set a pressured pace into the turn, dueled from the three
eighths to upper stretch, fought on to mid stretch then faded. CAR LADY lagged off the pace, came four wide for the drive, shifted further out and continued
with interest. ALWAYS A QUEEN , close up while four wide between rivals, saw the leaders get away past the half mile marker, was under pressure into the
lane but came up empty. DANCE AND DANCE , two wide between rivals stalking the early pace, was under a ride mid turn and faded. GOOD LIFE CIDER
lost ground five wide outside rivals and dropped back mid turn. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT pressed the pace two wide, drew alongside mid turn, dueled to the
five sixteenths then faltered.

Footnotes
DR. RUSTY RAYMOND accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and held sway under urging. JUNGLE WARRIOR , two wide well off the
pace around the turn, swung to the four path turning for home and rallied. TOM TERRIFIC saved ground around the turn, chased the pace and failed to
rally. CHARGE AHEAD saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired foes. OTIS OTIS OTIS , reluctant to load into the
starting gate, chased the pace while two wide on the turn and gave way in the drive. NIC NIC BOOM , two wide around the turn, was not a factor. SPUD ,
three deep on the turn, chased the pace and faltered. FIVE STAR PERFECT was outrun. JUST ENOUGH was outrun.
