Footnotes
IN IT FOR LIFE bumped at the start by outside rival, well placed behind three horse duel on the backstretch, took advantage of leading rival floating out and
got thru inside late in the turn, drove clear and won well. FOR MY BROTHER bumped at the start, vied between rivals for the lead on the backstretch, lost
some momentum when inside rival drifted out in the turn, reengaged in the stretch and earned second late. GODDESS APHRODITE settled along the inside
on the backstretch, entered turn along the rail and made bid along the inside in stretch and in range of leader, flattened in deep stretch and edged for
second. DABZILLA vied three wide on the backstretch for lead, entered turn three wide, floated out by rival late in turn to the six path in the stretch, kept on
in the stretch gamely under urging. SARAH'S SMIRK vied inside for the lead and maintained rail position entering the turn, started to drift out midway
through the turn and faded in the stretch. DIOSA broke thru the gate prior to the race, bumped inside rival at the start, stalked pace off the rail and never
threatened.DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED AND NO FRACTIONS WERE GIVEN
