was hustled from two-wide and the rail on the turn then finished under a determined drive and was gaining late. HURRICANE DANCER stalked the pace,
was hustled three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. BALA FALLS led quickly, was headed mid backstretch, chased two-wide on the turn but
evened out in the late stages. IN A TWIST raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then closed with some interest through the stretch.
LYRICAL NOTE was pinched back at the start and settled off the pace, closed three-wide through the turn then rallied belatedly but did not menace. CAT'S
WHISPER, away slowly and off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then closed a gap in the stretch. NOW WE ARE NINE was
away slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the turn but evened out mid stretch.

Footnotes
KATZ ON THE MOON stalked the pace, was hustled through the turn, chased along the rail into the stretch, bid in the final furlong, had a short lead a 16th
out and held under a drive. PINKY DUDE, always in range, was hustled four-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive, but missed. PAPA TONY forced
the pace, bid mid turn, moved to a clear lead and led into the stretch, was engaged in the final furlong and gave way grudgingly. ZOOMER MUSIC, in range,
was hustled five-wide on the turn then chased gamely to the end. GHOST ISLAND settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn and finished all
out. CAUSE FOR ALARM raced in mid pack, chased hard four-wide late turn then closed with strong interest. A GERSHWIN TUNE settled in mid pack, was
hustled five-wide on the turn then rallied mildly from the outside. D MAGICIAN set a pressured pace, was joined mid turn and was quickly headed, chased,
but evened out in the late stages . CAPTURE THE RIDE settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn but was never in contention. HOPE VISION
raced in mid pack, was hustled four then three-wide late turn but never reached contention. WUK UP QUEEN was rank leaving the gate and settled well off
the pace, moved over to the rail, saved ground on the turn but lacked a rally. RADIO NOWHERE stalked early, was three-wide and dropped back late turn
and also lacked a rally.

Footnotes
PINK SCRIBBLES settled in mid pack, closed along the rail late turn, bid a furlong out, dueled and prevailed under a drive. BETWIXTING was off poorly,
closed up to stalk the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, bid in the final furlong, battled, but was outfinished. SILVER DAHLIA stalked the
pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and closed willingly. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD hit the gate leaving, settled off the
pace, closed four to six-wide through the turn then rallied from the outside. SYSTEMIC RISK broke inward and was steadied, forced the pace, raced
two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but was outkicked from the furlong marker. TEACHER'S PET raced in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on
the turn then rallied belatedly. TAKE CHARGE EH settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then failed to menace. IMA BEAST set a pressured
pace, was passed a furlong out and faded. DREAMS ARE FREE, in touch, was hustled two-wide from mid pack on the turn but lacked a rally. DISCREET
BEAR, rated in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
RIDE A COMET was unhurried early, went to the outside on the backstretch, angled four-wide to commence a rally at the 5/16ths pole, surged to the lead in
the stretch and was ridden out. KINGLY stalked the pacesetter while racing on the outside, was two-wide on the turn, began a big past the 5/16ths pole, led
briefly in the stretch but was no match for the winner. SOLIDIFY trailed the field early, saved ground, angled four-wide past the 1/4 pole and rallied without
threatening for the win. DUN DRUM raced in midpack on the inside, came off of the rail turning into the stretch, briefly lacked a path in early stretch but
finished well. BRASS COMPASS got out to the early lead, raced off of the rail, was headed late on the turn then gave way in the final furlong. IKERRIN
ROAD (IRE) broke sharply, took back to midpack, was asked for more late on the turn then tired in the stretch. THOR'S ROCKET raced in midpack on the
outside, was asked midway around the turn while racing three-wide and had no rally. MIRACLE SILVER hustled for early position, stalked the pace while
racing inside, came under the whip late on the turn and came up empty.

closed four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely through the stretch. PATROL raced in mid pack, closed along the rail on the far turn, chased through the
stretch but evened out late. SOCIETY JOE stalked the pacesetter, closed two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th.
SUNDANCE HIT settled in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn then rallied gamely. CONQUER HIM settled in mid pack, came three to five-wide through
the far turn then rallied with good energy. ITMAKESMEWONDER, in range, raced three and four-wide on the first turn then was hustled three and four-wide
on the far turn then chased through the stretch. KEEP YOUR WORD raced in mid pack, was roused on the far turn but finished evenly. EMBRACE MY
UNCLE settled in mid pack along the rail, backed away early on the far turn then galloped home after making sure POLYDEUCES was through the turn. ICE
BLUE settled in mid pack, dropped back while two to four-wide on the far turn, and like the former rider and for the same reason, galloped home.
POLYDEUCES ran up on heels and stumbled approaching the first turn along the rail then his rider lost her irons midway through the first turn of a mile race
and while it was terrifying yet somewhat amazing that the jockey, who was looking a lot like an Olympic gymnast going through her program on the pommel
horse, managed to stay on and finish the race. HE'S A GIZMO settled off the pace, trailed the field by a respectable distance, angled out on the far turn and
escorted POLYDEUCES to the wire. THIS RACE WAS AT "ABOUT" ONE MILE AND WAS HAND-TIMED FROM THE GATE.
