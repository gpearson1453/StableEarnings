Footnotes
TOMMY THE TORCH Toyed early, took charge off the rail and then widened as much the best. SIMBASALLTROUBLE Forced the issue from between
early, tracked along the two path and earned the place. D S ADVANTAGE Vied for the lead four across early, tracked along the three path and finished with
interest. DOWNTOWN GOLD Lagged back, saved ground on the turn, eased out and was going well late. LOVEJOY Slammed at the start by THE HEART
FIXER, four wide on the turn, lodged a bid outside and hung. LIAMS MAJESTY Well placed along the two path to the lane and tired. OTTER Three path on
the bend, was outrun. HURRICANE ALPHA Broke three lengths slow and was always outrun. LEGENDARY BID Vied for the lead from between three deep,
appeared in tight at the three-eighths pole, took up and tired. THE HEART FIXER Ducked out slamming LOVEJOY at the start, two path on the turn and
tired.
