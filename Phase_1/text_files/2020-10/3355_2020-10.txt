Footnotes
APPRAISED stalked the pace in the three path, slowly gained through the final furlong and wore down his foe late. CHUCK'S DREAM set the pace in the
two path, continued on gamely through the lane and gave way grudgingly. KORCZAK settled off the pace while racing three wide, angled in to save ground
around the far turn and was along for the show. LE GROS BILL played no factor while racing two wide. YEI YEI settled off the top two in the clear two wide,
came under heavy pressure around the far turn and had no response. ROMAN WARRIOR was outrun while racing three and four wide. UPPER CROWN
chased the pace inside for a half, went three wide around the far turn and retreated.

ground off the pace early, went three wide around the far turn and improved position. TWIRLING THRILL set the pace two wide around the first turn, cleared
early on the backstretch, led inside around most of the far turn and tired. NOR PER OURS steadily faded inside. SINEAD RAID was outrun.

Footnotes
DREAMER'S MOON was hustled from the gate, set the pace in the two path, was collared on both sides near the five-sixteenths pole, battled on between
foes from there and re-cleared late. SHYZA stalked the winner three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led past the eighth pole but was
clearly second best late. DANCER'S MELODY tracked the pace inside for a half, moved through a clear opening at the rail nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
dueled at the rail through midstretch, was in a bit tight nearing the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. GETOUTTAMYWAY settled off the pace while racing
three wide, bid four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. ALL GOOD TIMES failed to menace while racing three wide. ITS A JOURNEY
played no factor while racing two wide. MONGOLIAN HUMOR was outrun inside. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF DANCER'S MELODY AGAINST
THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
TALKS IN HER SLEEP settled off the pace along the inside, made good progress inside around the far turn, swung five wide nearing the lane, closed
outside, reached even terms near the sixteenth pole, dueled outside and prevailed. THREE COINS saved ground off the pace, moved up two wide between
rivals around the far turn, bid between foes in midstretch, battled inside of the winner to the wire and just missed. HOLIDAY CURLS stalked the pace inside,
bid two wide around the far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and was outfinished.
MALICEINTHEPALACE raced well off the pace while saving ground early, advanced three wide around the far turn, angled back in nearing the lane, bid
inside in upper stretch and flattened out late. MUCHA SUERTE went evenly while racing two wide. A RING THING failed to menace while racing three wide.
HER JUSTICE played no factor while racing three wide. BLACK COAST was outrun while racing two wide. WILLOW DRIVE sprinted clear soon after the
start, set the pace along the rail and retreated around the far turn. TOURBILLON ROSE had brief speed two wide. SWEEPING CHERRY made little impact
while racing three wide. BRASS BERET was never close, eased, cantered across the wire and walked off.
