Footnotes
HASSAH (GB), rated in mid pack, was patient behind rivals while on the rail through the turn, angled out upper stretch, rallied and swept by the leader in the
late stages. VEIL forced the pace briefly then stalked, bid at the top of the stretch, drove clear but was passed near the 70 yard pole. PRINCESS FABIANA,
at the rear early, closed three-wide on the turn, rallied, but evened out in deep stretch. CRY UNCLE settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on
the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch then rallied mildly. FINDING PERFECTION raced in mid pack early, saved ground on the turn, chased into the
stretch but never reached contention. SUBZERO PLUS set a pressured pace, shook clear near mid turn, was engaged at the top of the stretch, yielded, but
chased to no avail. MACHO BOURBON broke outward, forced the pace, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes

PRICELESS showed brief speed then stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide late turn and chased through the stretch. SADIE IRENE was herded outward
at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn the finished gamely. BLONDE ATTITUDE broke outward and settled off the pace, closed
along the rail late turn then rallied between foes. AFLEET CONNECTION settled in mid pack, circled four to six-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. JACK'S
MEMORY raced from off the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, angled out upper stretch and closed gamely. NO QUESTION raced in mid
pack, was hustled angling from two to five-wide through the turn then rallied gamely. SUGATI, in range early, was hustled along the rail from mid pack on
the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. ZYANZA broke alertly and showed brief speed, was hustled hard three and four-wide on the turn then
evened out in deep stretch. BEAR KITTY hopped leaving the gate, raced in mid pack, came three-wide three-wide through the turn but never reached
contention. ANTHECROWDGOESWILD stalked early then dropped to mid pack on the turn then flattened out in the final furlong. MY CANTATA had early
speed, was hustled in range three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. ALERT KITTEN showed brief speed, dropped back on the turn and

Footnotes
PIQUET stalked the early duelers while three wide down the backside, advanced outside the pace victor late on the turn, engaged that one in upper stretch
and drove by to a clear lead by the eighth pole, then needed the wire late. MODUS OPERANDI leapt up at the start, and was off the pace, moved up mid
backstretch into range while along the inside into the turn, angled out by the quarter pole and had dead aim on the two leaders in upper stretch, gaining late
on the winner to make it interesting. NOT ORBINARY began sluggishly and trailed early, was ridden along from mid backstretch and two to four wide on the
turn but was still near the rear turning for home, rallied in the five path in upper stretch and closed well, making up good ground in the final sixteenth.
IT'SNICETOBENICE along the rail and off the pace early, closed up the inside on the bend, came out in upper stretch to bypass a tiring foe and bested the
rest without threatening. POWER HOUSE settled in mid pack while outside, came two to four wide into range outside the place finisher on the turn and
stayed close until losing ground in the final eighth. WESTLODGE INTRIGUE broke on top and was under restraint while sitting outside a pace rival, cleared
off mid turn but the winner was on her quickly, staying game until the eighth pole when tiring and dropping back. LIL'S TURN sat along the rail and off the
pace down the backstretch, rallied inside on the turn and down the lane, finding her best stride in the late going. CAPE MIST trailed throughout, came two to
three wide on the turn and was able to pass a tired foe late. STORMY SUMMER rushed up inside early to duel the leader, battled on to midway on the turn
but began to leak oil and fell back down the lane.

MEET THE SOPRANO had brief speed, forced the pace, took the lead mid turn, held off MUSICAL RIDE through the stretch and drove clear late. MUSICAL
RIDE raced in mid pack, chased late turn, bid upper stretch, failed to get by and weakened late. SKY OF DREAMS settled off the pace, was hustled from
the rail on the turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied gamely. SHEZ A SEALY hit the gate leaving and settled off the pace, was hustled three to
five-wide through the turn and finished gamely but did not menace. HOLY LIGHTING stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then
evened out in mid stretch. LA PRINCESSA POLLY was taken off the pace, was hustled four to two-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response.
GOLD FORESTER, in range, came three and four-wide through the turn but lacked a rally. MUSICALLY INCLINED gained a short lead from rivals on the
backstretch, was headed mid turn, chased gamely to upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. STEPITUPSTEPHANIE had brief speed then pressed the
pace from the outside, came three and four-wide through the turn but lacked a rally.

three-wide on the turn, was blocked in the final furlong then rallied belatedly. THE GOOD WITCH stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn,

Footnotes
VICTOR'S DESTINY rushed up inside a rival to duel for the lead in the early going, traded punches with that one around the turn, joined three wide by the
eventual place finisher late turn, battled with that one down the lane and looked beaten at the sixteenth pole but re-rallied in the final forty yards, gutting out
a well deserved victory. WHISKEY VICTOR stalked the early duelers three wide, joined to make it three in a line late turn, headed the winner in mid stretch
and appeared on his way to the winner's circle only to be outgamed in the final stages. HARDY CANDY off the pace early, weaved his way through rivals on
the turn and down the lane, closing good ground late to get close to the top pair in the final yards. GIANT ATTRACTION shot up inside behind the top trio
early on the turn, angled out to take his shot turning for home and looked dangerous but stalled in the final sixteenth, settling for a minor award. VICTOR'S
WAY battled outside the winner early, was between the top two finishers until upper stretch, but faded in the final sixteenth. ABSOLUTION chased the
leaders along the inside, rallied in upper stretch but failed to sustain his move in the final sixteenth. MACHO T was five wide chasing the leaders down the
backside, still five and six wide on the turn and could not muster a challenge. SANDRETTI was three to four wide chasing between rivals down the backside
and around the turn, stalling in upper stretch and falling back. LOOKOUT LOUIE chased the leaders between rivals in the three path, falling back from
midway on the turn to the wire. SEAMUS chased four wide between rivals into the turn when seemingly in tight, checking out to last and staying there for the
duration.

Footnotes
ELITE SPEED forced the pace, came four then three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, led quickly, widened, then finished under a hand ride.
SIMPLE SOUVENIR raced in mid pack, closed five-wide late turn then rallied willingly. SEA FRET forced the pace, took command along the rail entering the
turn, set a pressured pace, was headed upper stretch and chased to the end. DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE was bumped by PLEATHER LACKET leaving the
gate then bumped SIMPLY A ZOOMER before getting up to stalk the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then moved to the rail in the stretch and rallied
gamely. LADY SUNSHINE always in range, was hustled four to six-wide through the turn, showed some rally in the stretch then finished evenly. HONEY
GIRL settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. TRAIL BLAZING ESSA was bumped at the start and settled
off the pace, came four to six-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. SIMPLY A ZOOMER was bumped from the inside
and passed the momentum along to TRAIL BLAZING ESSA who was a part of her being pinched back just out of the gate, raced two-wide through the turn
then chased through the stretch. VENUS VERITY in range early, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn then finished evenly. PLEATHER
JACKET bobbled and lurched outward bumping DRUMGREENAGHBRIDGE as they left the gate, showed speed, was headed entering the turn, stalked to
late turn and backed away and lacked a rally. POCKET settled well off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but never reached contention.
ENGLISH BISCUIT raced in mid pack, chased four-wide on the turn but flattened out in the final furlong.
