Footnotes
KING TARZAN sped right to the front, shook off pressure from both flanks around the turn in the two-path, and stayed clear under a mild drive. HIGHLY
NOTED hit the right side of the gate at the start, lacked room along the inside behind SCOOBYS PALACE at the top of the stretch, stayed on the rail and
rallied with good courage. TOP BOMB was outsprinted early, cut the corner into the stretch, and rallied mildly to be along for the show. SCOOBYS PALACE
skimmed the rail pressing the pace into the turn, moved to the two-path past the three-sixteenths, and faded. TOLL GATE was no factor through an even
effort. RUN AWAY SON came four wide off the turn, shifted in through the furlong grounds and could not gain. LITTLE STORM GODS broke slowly, and
was outrun inside. FREELANCE raced widest through the lane and made no impact. MAUREENS' STAR tired after a half-mile four wide. BROTHER SKYE
pressed the pace three wide, and tired leaving the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
SMASH tracked outside MORE THAN USUAL for a half-mile, took over into the far turn, built a sizeable advantage after six furlongs, and was all out to hang
on for the decision. WICKED TEMPTATIONS saved ground early, moved to the two-path going around a tiring rival midway on the far turn, came out
brushing EARTHQUAKE in the midst of a rally near the sixteenth-pole, and was getting to the winner from outside at the finish. DRILLOMATIC was outrun
for six furlongs, came five wide into the stretch, and rallied willingly outside the top two finishers. EARTHQUAKE was in the three-path much of the way,
came into the stretch in the four-path, and was making little headway when brushed by WICKED TEMPTATIONS a sixteenth out. SUPERHIGHWAY
bumped lightly with TEXPECTATION at the start, saved ground early, came four wide off the far turn, and tired. TEXTPECTATION bumped lightly with
SUPERHIGHWAY at the start, and was outrun. MORE THAN USUAL sprinted clear early, was powerless to fend off SMASH into the far turn, retreated
steadily, and was eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
VALID EXCHANGE eyed the dueling leaders into the turn, slipped through on the rail to take over in upper stretch, and moved away under a drive.
YEUDIEL had the four-path turning for home, and rallied outside MUST BE A MONSTER to get second late. MUST BE A MONSTER dueled for command
in the two-path inside RICKY RUN, got the best of that skirmish after a half-mile, got overhauled from inside by VALID EXCHANGE into the stretch, and
yielded second through the closing yards. DIALED IN GOLD saved ground to no avail. PROSPECT PROJECT was slow into stride, and made no impact.
MIGHTY FAST was outrun three to four wide. RICKY RUN contested the pace outside MUST BE A MONSTER for a half, and gave way.

Footnotes
THREE DEEP stalked the pace outside to the turn, took over in the three-path outside GUMWRAPPER going by the quarter-pole, was roused to open up
through upper stretch, and was hand urged to draw off in the last eighth of a mile. HARPER GO LUCKY moved in a bit from the three-path around the turn,
rallied between horses leaving the eighth-pole, and ran on willingly to hold the place. ALRAHAAL raced close up early inside, dropped back a bit while
moving out four wide after a half-mile under a drive, and offered a mild response on the far outside. SENZAZIONE bumped with KRAMDEN just after the
start, was outrun to the stretch, and passed tired horses. AT THE BEACH pressed GUMWRAPPER from outside, made no headway under a drive between
horses late on the turn, and faded. SON OF GREATNESS was no factor. GUMWRAPPER sped to the front at the start, yielded to the winner approaching
the stretch, and had nothing left into the last furlong. KRAMDEN bumped with SENZAZIONE a few strides after the start, stayed close early, and stopped on
the turn.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S ROSE was slow to get going, saved ground ridden along and beginning to find stride after a half-mile, slipped through on the rail to take over from
NYSSA past the three-sixteenths, dueled inside DEEMED ESSENTIAL for most of the last furlong and prevailed gamely. DEEMED ESSENTIAL advanced
four wide near the quarter-pole, challenged outside ARTIE'S ROSE leaving the furlong grounds and was outdueled to the wire. PRIME PALACE was outrun
to the stretch, and rallied mildly in the two-path to overhaul NYSSA for third. NYSSA set a pressured pace inside DANESSA BABY, got the best of that
dispute turning for home, then was overtaken from both sides through upper stretch. VILLAGE QUEEN raced three to four wide, and did not factor. MY
BEAUTY PRINCESS felt the whip just past the half-mile marker, struggled to keep pace on the turn three wide, and tired approaching the stretch.
DANESSA BABY pressed NYSSA from outside to the end of the turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
TRISOMIA grabbed the lead early in the two-path, shook off inside pressure from THE DEVILS BACK into the turn, and stayed clear through the stretch
under a drive. YADI saved ground outrun for a half-mile, stayed on the rail beginning to advance past the quarter-pole, and rallied willingly to get up for
second. AYCAPOTE came three wide off the turn, and rallied mildly outside to pick up the show. EL ZEUS moved up into the turn in pursuit of TRISOMIA,
could not reach that one into the lane, and weakened. SKYRAY got squeezed back between THE DEVILS BACK and CAJUN EMBERS just after the start,
raced two wide improving position on the turn, and ran on evenly through the stretch. EXATLON advanced from the back outside leaving the turn, and
finished evenly. ARMANDO'S TEAM was never prominent. CAJUN EMBERS tired after a half. BARBIE'S KING gave way around the turn. THE DEVILS
BACK pressed the early pace inside, tired after a half, and was eased up through the stretch. GUESS FIRST trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ABARRIO FOREVER was outrun early, advanced late on the turn three wide, tipped to the five path rallying through the furlong grounds, caught NENITA
from outside in deep stretch and edged clear. NENITA lost her footing awkwardly at the start, moved up three wide late on the turn, reached the front
outside DOMINEER in mid stretch, ran on gamely but could not contain the top one. MYSTIC COMIN HOME bumped with DOMINEER at the start, rallied
inside past the eighth-pole and was just up for the show on the rail. FIAMMA MAMMA chased three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid closing bid.
DOMINEER bumped with MYSTIC COMIN HOME at the start, dueled outside DON'T EATTHEAPPLE to the stretch, and weakened in the last eighth of a
mile. SURPRISE ARRIVAL lagged far back early, and improved outside through the stretch. DON'T EATTHE APPLE dueled inside DOMINEER for a
half-mile, and faltered in the stretch. SOCIALLY ASTRAY was never prominent. BABY ALIDETT was finished early three wide. KEEP AMERICA GREAT hit
the left side of the gate and bumped with DELTA HUTCH at the start, and was done early. WINE BOTTLE dropped far back after a half-mile. DELTA
HUTCH bumped with KEEP AMERICA GREAT at the start, showed early speed four wide, retreated on the turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
SNAP HOOK went up to engage STRONG HEADED from outside into the first turn, edged away from that rival after six furlongs, responded when hooked
from outside by INDIMAAJ late on the far turn, battled back to regain command through the furlong grounds, and was clear late. INDIMAAJ bumped with
ALEJANDRO'S TEAM at the start, pressed the pace three wide, poked a head in front with a quarter-mile to run, but yielded through the stretch. AFRICAN
HERITAGE came under a ride three wide midway on the far turn, and finished evenly. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM was bumped and bounced around between
INDIMAAJ and HARD LIGHTING at the start, improved position after six furlongs, but needed more late. HARD LIGHTING bumped with ALEJANDRO'S
TEAM at the start, raced three wide early, and posed no threat. CREA'S BKLYN LAW was always outrun. STRONG HEADED vied inside SNAP HOOK to
midway on the far turn, and gave way.

edged clear late. DECKOLOGY dueled inside GATOR FIFTY TWO through the opening half-mile, moved to the rail battling inside FLAWLESS MOON and
LONDON WEREWOLF through the lane, and stayed on stubbornly to earn the place from the latter. LONDON WEREWOLF was never far back, bid in the
three-path coming off the turn, fought between horses through the stretch, and was outfinished. MR. CESCO bumped lightly with FLAWLESS MOON at the
start, was outrun to the stretch, and improved mildly for the last major share. STEADILY bumped lightly with FLAWLESS MOON at the start, briefly loomed
a threat along the inside turning for home, but flattened out. GATOR FIFTY TWO dueled outside DECKOLOGY to the top of the lane, could not hold his spot
and was overrun from both sides. ELVIS COLE tired after showing brief speed. SHAKEM N BREAKEM was outrun throughout. RED NATION raced wide
and was through early. MACHIAVELLI dropped far back after a half.
