Footnotes
WHENTHEDOVESCRY, exchanged bumps with UNCLE NEARIS at the start, was quickly righted, then moved to terms prompting a rival's pace racing
through the backstretch into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and held sway through the lane under firm left handed pressure. GONZO settled along
the inside racing to the turn, shifted out entering the lane gathering stride, split foes midstretch and shifted four wide in the closing stages while finishing with
interest to gain the place honors. DRAMA STAR worked his way to the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and improved
position in late stages. MR. LUV MAKER tracked off the first flight outside rivals three, then four wide into the turn and offered no rally. RIPE ATTACK, urged
to a forward placing along the rail, shifted out three wide racing into the turn continuing in brief pursuit but gave way racing into the lane. AMAROQ, off
slowly, then pinched back at the start, never menaced thereafter. UNCLE NEARIS broke out bumping the eventual winner and exchanged several bumps
with that rival, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. I AM TOO WILD broke sharply, angled
inwards while moving to gain a narrow advantage, disputed the lead into the turn and gave way entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
BIG MAN BOB broke readily to gain a position just off the leaders, stalked the pacesetter under rating along the inside racing through the backstretch,
tipped out entering upper stretch, then angled back to the rail racing through the lane and came through inside the pacesetter to wrest command and go
clear under firm handling. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT, reserved well off the second flight just off the inside racing to the far turn, commenced a steady advance
racing into upper stretch, shifted to the four path leaving midstretch and prevailed for the place honors. BOURBON TAN, urged to the lead along the inside,
dispatched a rival into the far turn, held sway on a clear margin into the lane, briefly resisted but yielded to the winner late. POCKET PLAYER angled to the
rail in early stages while settling well off the leaders, switched out entering the lane gaining position, was fanned five wide in the closing stages but
continued with interest to gain position to the end. CLOUD TO GROUND tracked just off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted three
wide on the far turn advancing on the leaders racing into upper stretch but had no final kick. HUEY ATTACK settled between foes in early stages, continued
four wide into the lane but had no closing bid. MILBURN settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. DARK WOOD (IRE), reserved
along the inside early, failed to menace. END ZONE, urged to a forward placing tracking the leaders as part of the second flight to the backstretch, gave
way racing through the far turn. MEMORIES OF ARTIE settled between foes in early stages and proved no threat. MESSED UP was never a factor.
CARAMEL ANGEL was urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch and gave way nearing upper stretch.

COOL AMBITION was settled last while angling inside, saved ground through the turn, angled out racing into upper stretch while advancing on the leaders
to bid five wide leaving the furlong marker and continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under strong handling. MY CURBY tracked just off
the first flight three deep between foes racing into the turn, shifted to the four path racing into the lane to gain the advantage midstretch but couldn't fend off
the winner. STUMP ducked out at the start, then was held up while his rider corrected his course, recovered to track just off the leaders along the rail racing
into the turn, bid inside foes entering upper stretch, then was taken up avoiding tight quarters, altered course outside some tiring foes and prevailed for a
share. EXPECT ELPRADA, urged prompting a rival's pace, dueled for command between foes into the lane and gave way leaving midstretch. FRENCH
MINDED broke readily, was urged dueling for command on a narrow advantage racing a bit off the rail into the turn, shifted in under pressure nearing
midstretch and gave way late. BUDDY BUD, caught five wide tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, dropped out early. SPEARED was a brief factor
four wide between foes in second flight but gave way early. PABLO DEL MONTE came through close quarters at the break to track off the leaders between
foes to the turn and came up empty in the drive.

DEWY'S HIT ducked out at the start crossing into the path of LORING PARK, was quickly righted to track just off the pacesetter outside a rival under light
rating racing to the backstretch, responded with a sharp advance when prompted to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, drifted out entering the
lane gaining a clear advantage and came under firm right handed pressure to maintain the advantage to the end. CHATTER BOX tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the far turn, swung four wide racing into the lane and continued with a steady response to close the gap while edging a rival for
the place honors late. DYNABLUE tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch and continued with interest to
gain position between foes to the end while outkicked for second. KENNESAW was rated stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, lost some
ground to the winner nearing upper stretch, continued with a steady bid to challenge inside that rival leaving midstretch but lacked the needed final kick.
LORING PARK, caught in tight quarters at the start, settled between foes to the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the lane and displayed some late
interest while continuing a bit greenly to improve position to the end. DEJOHN tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn but lacked a
closing response. Z U AT THE RACES, came through close quarters start to track outside foes, made brief progress four wide racing through the
backstretch to the far turn but came up empty in the drive. MACHO CLASSIC sprinted clear of the field while angling to the inside, held sway on a clear
margin to the far turn and gave out abruptly once headed racing into upper stretch. DUCKDEVIL settled outside foes to the backstretch and failed to
menace.

between foes nearing upper stretch, gained a narrow advantage entering the lane and gamely held the margin under firm handling. V MAN tracked outside
foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, bid five wide nearing the lane and continued willingly to challenge the leader nearing the wire. SYRUP,
caught four wide into the first turn, tracked just off the leaders outside foes through the backstretch, was urged four wide through the far turn to challenge for
command nearing upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. AL TAWEEL, pinched back out of close quarters at the start, settled last to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance angling to the six path entering the lane and continued to improve position. BEAST MODE settled well back racing
off the rail into the backstretch, angled in nearing the lane, altered course avoiding traffic in upper stretch but continued with interest to gain some position
between rivals. TORNADO BOY tracked the leaders between rivals off the second flight racing to the backstretch, continued four wide into the lane but had
no rally. COWBOYS DREAM, urged between foes prompting the pace into the backstretch, dueled to upper stretch and gave way. COLOMBARD, urged to
dispute the pace inside rivals, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way into the lane. DRAMA IN DANUBE settled between foes and offered no
rally. STANDFORTHEANTHEM angled inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch but faded early. AUNDREYA'S BOY flashed brief pace
three wide between foes racing to the backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
STOCK TRADE was rated off the second flight between foes in the opening half, was prompted to split foes three deep nearing midstretch and narrowly
prevailed in time under firm left handed encouragement. READTHECLIFFNOTES, urged to the lead outside a rival racing to the first turn, angled to the rail
once gaining the advantage, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper stretch and continued grudgingly to just miss. HIGH ON SUGAR settled well off
the leaders along the inside racing to the backstretch, came out nearing upper stretch, was fanned five wide racing through the lane but continued willingly
to close the gap. TUFF ATTACK angled to the inside tracking off the second flight in the opening half, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the three
furlong marker, saved ground through the bend, shifted out entering the lane and gained position three deep between foes while racing in close quarters to
the end. BROKEN KEY tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, advanced three wide after a half to lodge a brief bid outside the leaders
leaving the far turn but lacked the needed final kick while being fanned four wide late. GIACALLURE settled last to the backstretch, gained some position
between foes racing into upper stretch, then was forced to alter course six wide in the closing stages. MUCH CLASS tracked off the first flight outside foes,
advanced to lodge a brief bid on the far turn but soon flattened out. HALF OF MANHATTAN, pulling hard between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the
inside tracking just off the pacesetter nearing the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance but proved empty late.
SKYCRAFT settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. ANGELINO settled between foes racing to
the backstretch and offered no rally. CONTRACTION switched out early tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch but gave way after a half.

DEFENDER, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, advanced to press the issue outside a rival entering the
backstretch, went clear racing into the far turn while angling to the inside and held sway on a widening margin under mild urging. RIVER CACTUS was rated
off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance and continued with a
grudging effort to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. EXEMPLAR tracked off the second flight along the inside, shifted out to split foes three
wide in upper stretch, couldn't gain ground on the leader and was outkicked for second. HAMAZING VISION settled last to the backstretch, gained some
position racing into the lane, then angled five wide in the last furlong to gain some position. RUFFOLO, urged to dispute the pace along the inside on a
narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, tracked the leader into the far turn and gave way into the lane. GOT EVEN SMARTER tracked the leaders
inside a rival as part of the second flight, advanced to contention along the rail entering the far turn but had no closing bid. BAROQUE, forwardly placed
between foes racing to the backstretch tracking just off the first flight, shifted three deep nearing the far turn to lodge a brief bid but soon gave way.

AND HE'S LOOSE, forwardly placed along the inside stalking just off the pacesetter, shifted out splitting rivals on the turn pressing the issue, gained a clear
advantage racing into upper stretch and was roused to extend the advantage. BE AN INSPIRATION, bumped at the start, was held up in close quarters
early, switched out five wide advancing on the leaders racing into the turn and continued in that path to prove best of the others. BEE HAPPY ATTACK
angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight, saved ground through the bend to upper stretch, then tipped out late to bid between
foes but had no final kick. PUNCHNGO, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace, continued three wide into the turn and gave way in the drive. WAR TRAIL
settled last along the inside, saved ground through the turn and continued evenly in late stages while racing in tight quarters. ROCKET RIDE tracked the
leaders three deep between foes in second flight, shifted four wide on the turn and faded in the drive. OFF TO THE BEACH settled between foes and failed
to menace. IRISH LIGHTED ROAD urged to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for command on the turn and gave way. NORTHERN THRILL
tracked off the second flight along the inside to the turn but offered no rally. DISTINCT THUNDER dropped back early. SKEETERSKEETS broke outwards
bumping BE AN INSPIRATION, was collected off that foe and never menaced thereafter.
