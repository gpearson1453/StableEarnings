MORESTRIDE bumped was rival while drifting in soon after the start, gained a narrow lead before a quarter, set the balance of the pace while getting quick
fractions and widened through the stretch at will to win as much the best. CALIFORNIA MARTINI stalked the pace from the three path into the stretch,
dropped inside and finished well clear for second. VICTORY DIVISION hopped at the start, trail well back early then had a mild rally through the stretch
along the rail. HAKMAN battled with the winner down the backstretch, chased that one into the stretch then weakened. BRILLIANT JOURNEY had speed
into the turn then wilted. TRULY OBLIGATO had brief speed. ARTIE AND JESSIE was bumped and in tight between rivals leaving the chute then failed to
reach contention.

GRAZIA WHO prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, gained a narrow lead, dug in gamely under right handed urging and proved best in a stiff drive.
CRISTALINDA allowed to settle, circled rivals on the turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead a furlong out then
couldn't handle the winner. MA KETTLE stalked the pace into the stretch and finished determinedly in the four path. APRIL MARIE was bumped at the start,
made the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace into the stretch then weakened in the final furlong. WAFFLESORPANCAKES had good early speed
then faded. STAR OF PRIDE broke inward bumping APRIL MARIE then failed to menace.
