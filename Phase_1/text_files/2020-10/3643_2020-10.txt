Footnotes
BRILLIANT BROOKS grew fractious in the gate just after KABOB broke through his stall door and was backed out and reloaded, got bumped at the start by
KABOB when that rival broke inwards, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. STARSHIP BUBBA four wide in aim of the duel
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and steadily advanced coming under coaxing when vying outside that pair five-sixteenths from
home, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command three-sixteenths from home, came under growing threat to the outside and
was nailed in the final strides to the finish. SHANDIAN established the front and showed the way just off the inside briefly solo, got joined outside by NO
MORE MIRACLES at the nine-sixteenths and dueled with that rival into the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, had the aforementioned foe
advance three deep and vied inside a pair, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths, then weakened in the late
stages while along clear for the show honors. CAUSE I SAID SO chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened. ADIOS AMIGOS chased four to five wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home,
offered no response. NO MORE MIRACLES broke in mid pack and chased briefly three wide before advancing to duel three then two wide with SHANDIAN
to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got joined outside by STARSHIP BUBBA and vied between foes briefly before spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. KABOB broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, broke in at the start bumping
BRILLIANT BROOKS, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TONED UP remained stationed along the inside after appearing to get away without apparent mishap, was let out a notch shortly after departing the
backstretch before getting set down in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, was on the move to the outside entering the turn, took over path two from
a weakening GIRL OF TOSCONOVA a furlong later, brushing with the rival during the final stages of it, ground its way towards the one to catch, altered
course towards path three in midstretch, poked a head down in front with approximately a sixteenth to go and edged away. MAGNETIQUE established the
top upon completing the run along the chute, set an ambitious pace racing in the two path, pulling noticeably on the left, kicked away from the primary
pursuer as three-quarters was being reeled, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when finally called upon for more, got overhauled right around the
sixteenth marker, held well to save second. LEM ME HAVE IT a forward factor racing three wide, commenced the stretch one path farther off the inside, got
outfinished. FIRST DAWN off the inside throughout, was three wide and being ridden along on the turn, shifted considerably wider gearing up tor the stretch
run, winding up in the neighborhood of path eight, gained some en route for the final significant slice of the purse. KITTEN BY THE SEA bumped with GIRL
OF TOSCONOVA right after the field had been sent on its way, raced strung out three to four wide on the turn, was under some urging spinning about
seven wide into the stretch, had no offering and was allowed to back away. GIRL OF TOSCONOVA lightly bumped with KITTEN BY THE SEA in the
shadow of the starting gate, prompted the pace three wide, got lightly steadied getting pinched after having lost position by weakening in the vicinity of the
three-sixteenths pole, backed away readily afterwards. MICROMILLION chased the pace two wide while being urged on the turn, angled into the three path
spinning onto the top of the lane, gave way.

Footnotes
THE SOUND stumbled at the start and was brushed by INSTINCTIVE RHYTHM who broke outwards and was away last albeit only conceding at most two
lengths to the front, raced five paths off the inside under rating early on before advancing outside to take over command five and a half furlongs out, tucked
to the three path with five furlongs to go before taking to the two path into the turn, showed the way given some rein to work with and came under steadily
increased pressure from the runner up to the outside, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat
to the eighth pole, then inched away repelling the challenge to the finish kept to task. INSTINCTIVE RHYTHM broke out at the start brushing the
aforementioned foe, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing to challenge placed to coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, cornered four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive offering up a bid to the eighth pole latching on the leader, then got
steadily repelled to the finish while running on clear for the place honors. RISK PROFILE showed the way early on before being displaced from the front at
five and a half furlongs from home, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five
wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. DREAMS OF TOMORROW forwardly placed three then two wide down the backstretch,
tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
DEMOCRATIC VALUES coaxed from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping to the two path through the turn put to coaxing
midway, angled out six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BOURBON RISING chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide
through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
KUMAR broke about a length the tardiest, contently brought up the back of the pack for the opening half, proceeding along the backstretch one-paced, got
maneuvered to the outside stepping onto the top of the turn, made up a good amount of real estate unleashing a four wide run, rider atop with a good hold
on the reins, got cued up angling one path farther off the rail into the stretch, maintained the momentum, closing the gap readily, wore down the leader well
inside the sixteenth pole and edged away. SINGAPORE TRADER quickly established the top, got rated sailing along from the inside, feeling mild pressure
from MILTON THE MONSTER out in the two path, was coming up to the three-sixteenths pole when set down, saw the winner chopping away at the deficit
nonetheless, relinquished a short distance beyond the sixteenth pole, stayed on the place as the top one kicked clear. MILTON THE MONSTER prompted
the pace from path two, held on well during the stretch run to save the show. CREATIVE STYLE two wide in pursuit of the pace, mustered up a mild
response sufficient enough to secure the last major check. FOREVER WICKED tracked the pace from the rail, going about the turn hand urged, cut the
corner and went on to improve position. ZEALOUS raced three wide on the turn, was in the same path heading home, gave way. WILLING TO SPEED took
up the chase three to four wide, was more the latter under encouragement coming into the lane, backed away.

LIAM'S MISSY established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under light coaxing near
the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, went clear being flashed the stick to the off side intermittently and was in hand through the final sixteenth
to the finish prevailing comfortably on the wire. WHITE FROST chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to
three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors well clear of the rest. TREASURE LANE hustled
from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. REFUND COUNTRY five
paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide
into upper stretch and tired. FIRING CAROL coaxed from the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CAUSE TO DREAM showed brief speed
four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths and faded, continued four
wide at the head of the stretch and folded in the drive.

Footnotes
LUCK MONEY took up position in midpack, patiently kept watch on the front runners while racing three wide, flashed interest late on the far turn, stepped
into the lane, struck the three-sixteenths marker and challenged in earnest, emerged at the eighth pole as the new and undisputed leader, came under
heavy pressure in the final stages, but dug in well to preserve the decision. HUNGRY KITTEN contently brought up rear while racing two wide, was
gradually maneuvered into path four from the top of the second bend to the five-si8xteenths pole, commenced the stretch run one path farther away from
the rail, had a good finish down the center of the course, came up short. MUTAMAKINA (GB) guided onto the inside route, was rated tracking the pace,
steadied when caught in a bit tight approaching the five-sixteenths pole, was shuffled back to next-to-last, went three wide into the stretch, settled in and
was given her cue, kicked into stride and closed in, altered course towards path six between midstretch and the sixteenth marker, displayed solid late foot
securing the show. LUCKY STRIDE unhurried taking the two path, swung out four wide into the stretch, narrowed in on the ones to catch to earn the last
major check. CAP DE CREUS lost her footing at the start, then shouldered its next stall neighbor after shying from LEMON ZIP right afterwards, stalked the
pace from path two, got moved out into the third one heading home, weakened in the final furlong. LEMON ZIP prompted the pace from the two path, took
over when BEAU BELLE called it a day, this occurring a short distance from the five-sixteenths pole, led the others into the lane, but the winner lurking
dangerously just to her outside, yielded when challenged a sixteenth later then steadily backed away. OLYMPIC GAMES (FR) reserved two wide early,
travelled in path three on turn two, got moved out five wide for the stretch run, had no offering. BEAU BELLE showed the way from the inside, accompanied
by LEMON ZIP to her outside, surrendered leaving the midway point of the far turn, stepped into the stretch and retreated. CAMBELIZA two wide until the
quarter pole, never made it into a contending position, took a four wide stroll into the lane then after being placed to a protective hold was allowed to fade
away.

Footnotes
SOUTH AFRICA five paths off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and advanced on the
duel through the latter portion of the bend under his own power, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five then four wide into upper stretch
straightening away in the three path, took command at the three-sixteenths, shied out slightly under a near sided stick at that station and again inside that
marker when nearing the sixteenth pole, then shied out a third time under a near sided stick digging in under late threat and held safe to prevail.
JEMOGRAPHY lunged at the break and was bumped between foes who each broke his way getting away last, chased three wide from near the rear, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, closed outside with a mild kick latching on the winner as that rival hit the
finish showing good courage after the rough start. JERRY THE NIPPER broke out at the start bumping JEMOGRAPHY in tandem with RIKEN who broke
inwards from that rival's outside, dueled from the three path with RIKEN to his outside, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, remained patiently handled until
placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, got collared at the three-sixteenths, ran on through to the finish to preserve the
show honors. LEAP TO GLORY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to miss for the show honors. TROUBLESHOOTER coaxed from the start, chased four
to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the wire. NOTORIOUS FLIRT chased
along the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no
headway. BIG THICKET chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home, weakened in the stretch. THE LAST
ACE hustled from the gate, showed brief speed inside a pair from the two path, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths
and retreated, went two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. RIKEN broke in at the start bumping JEMOGRAPHY in concert with JERRY THE
NIPPER, who broke outwards, came under hustling and dueled to the outside of JERRY THE NIPPER from the four path, tucked to the two path through the
turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got shaken off spinning three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
STEP DANCER made it over to the inside route, got rated tracking the front runners for over three-quarters, tipped to the outside prior to entering the
stretch, drafted behind KIDNAPPED for a spell, deftly altered course back over to the hedge deep into the furlong grounds, right after the runner up had
himself abandoned the inside route, clawed up to the one to catch, slipped by leaving the eighth pole and edged away. LIKE A SALTSHAKER secured the
pocket after bumping with CLAW in the shadow of the starting gate, sat within striking distance of the pacesetter, arrived at the end of the second bend,
stepped into the lane with clear sailing along the hedge corridor, after the leader shifted towards the two path, availed of the opportunity and seized the lead,
wound up drifting into path two himself in midstretch, inadvertently providing an opportunity for the eventual winner, put up resistance before yielding with
less than an eighth to go, stayed on with willingness to salvage second. SPACE LAUNCH sat reserved two wide, between rivals for a good portion of the
journey on the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch, rallied mildly to secure the show. WOOTTON ASSET (FR) strung out three wide during the initial
stages, worked a tuck along the inside by the conclusion of the backstretch, was on hold, stuck fourth in line along the hedge coming up to the quarter pole,
swung out four wide for clearance during the early stages of the stretch run, closed in well for the last significant slice of the pot. IT CAN BE DONE took up
the chase three wide until the head of the stretch, stayed in contention until midlane before weakening. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY sluggish at the start,
travelled four wide on the far turn, fanned out towards path seven from upper to midstretch, gained some, but all done without making any impact. IT'S A
GAMBLE brushed with another after bobbling at the start, underwent a four wide until the top of the lane, settled in and had no response. CATMAN taken off
the second place finisher to avoid some contact right after the field had been sent off and running, saved ground until the end of the backstretch, got eased
into path two at the half mile pole, completed the run around the far turn, got sent out in the direction of path eight once in the stretch, never made its
presence felt. KIDNAPPED set the pace from along the inside, moved into the two path coming under pressure after reeling off six furlongs, relinquished
soon afterwards and backed away. CLAW bumped at the start after coming in slightly, disputed the pace from path two until the quarter pole, stepped into
the lane and folded. HEAT OF THE NIGHT made light contact with IT'S A GAMBLE right after the start, raced three wide on each bend, arrived in the
stretch, had no offering, then was taken in hand late and allowed to fade back.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC DUNHILL four paths off the inside down the backstretch in aim of the leader, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing
five-sixteenths from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out to the two path nearing the eighth pole as the leader drifted to the rail, rallied
digging in to knock heads through the final sixteenth and prevailed gamely on the wire. SHARE THE RIDE established the front and showed the way rated
on the pace from the three path, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths before making his way to the inside three furlongs from home, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, drifted in to the rail nearing the eighth pole safely in front, came under threat to the
outside through the final furlong fighting head to head through the last sixteenth stubbornly but was nailed at the finish. ARCH CAT three to four wide in
pursuit down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in
under a drive prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. MIHOS chased along the inside down the backstretch, tipped out three wide
seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
SHE SO NAUGHTY spared for control from path two, challenged in earnest spinning from between rivals into the stretch, dueled dircectly across SWEET
SNEAK from upper stretch onward, showed good determination to get the job done. SWEET SNEAK sat forwardly placed three wide, increased her
presence as three-quarters was being reeled, got hooked up a tussle with the winner for the practically the whole length of the stretch, wound up denied.
MEMORIES ETERNAL brushed at the start, raced two to three wide on the turn, swung towards path four for the stretch run, proved no match securing the
show. BELLEZA at a considerable distance off the rail at all times, sat parked out four to five during the run around the bend, was about as wide racing in
the stretch, made no headway in the last eighth. MIA CALIA rode the rail, tipped to the outside midlane, made no impact. MIZZEN THE MARK three to four
wide midway on the turn, was in the neighborhood of path six at the furlong marker, went on to mainly improve position. WOMEN NOT EASY showed the
way rated along from the inside, appeared vulnerable approaching the quarter pole, gave in to the top twosome as they turned into the lane almost together,
backed away steadily. COURTED made some contact with MEMORIES ETERNAL at the start, travelled four wide on the turn, gave way after going a half.
SILENT EMPRESS sighted pulling early on the backstretch, shifted about between the inside route and path two for the first half, stepped into the stretch
and faltered. LET ARTIE LEAD two wide onto the turn, went four wide into the stretch, ventured onward to the finish line under a protective hold having
never made her presence felt.
