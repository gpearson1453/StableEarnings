SHE'S A LUCKY ONE settled well, lodged a four wide bid on the turn, took over and held sway in the stretch. EMMY GOT EVEN reserved early, advanced
on the turn and closed ground willingly in the stretch. CHANCE OF FROST forwardly placed, entered the stretch three wide and lacked the needed bid.
CANELA CALIENTE was outpaced while four wide and displayed mild late interest. VAGARY gained the early lead, was brushed aside on the turn and
faded. IRISH MUSIC saved ground, lodged a brief bid leaving the turn and came up empty in the late going. IZE DISCREET ROSE was always outrun.

outpaced early, lodged a four wide bid on the turn, remained four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. CLEVER LIL SIS broke outwardly, forwardly
placed, was urged to improve on the turn and came up empty in the late going. DANCING DIAMOND broke inwardly, led early, was headed on the turn and
gave way. ATHENA CITY showed little.
