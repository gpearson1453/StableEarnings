HAVEULOSTYOURMIND was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and drew
off through the lane with complete authority. OFFICER OF WAR pulled early, steadied nearing the half mile pole, moved four-wide through the turn, reached
a striking position but failed to gain on the winner late. MARK MY WORD was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. STANLEY'S WAVE chased the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the
three-eighths marker, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly in the drive. BARABBAS chased the leaders while racing three-wide,
moved up in tandem with the winner to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the drive. MY FIRST TRIP sprinted clear at once, raced
off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going a half.

OH MARVELOUS ME was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, reached his stable-mate with a
furlong to run and edged away from that rival in the drive. WINDRIBBON was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing three-wide, responded
when challenged by the winner with a furlong to run and gave way grudgingly to that foe. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was bumped at the break, settled off the
leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. CATFISH HUNTER broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing
four-wide and gave way after going a half. PROOF IT lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

drew off. XIMENA'S HONOR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly
second best. JAN'S BEST settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished evenly. ZOEY
EMERY was off a step slow, lagged early, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. UNCOMMONBLESSING stumbled at the start, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NACHO GOLD was away alertly to dispute the pace from the inside for the opening quarter and

DECKLOAD was off slow, pulled to the lead, increased his margin through the back-stretch and yielded to the winner through the final sixteenth. PAMPER
ME NOW chased the leader from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. TIZ BRILLIANT settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. WINNING BLUFF raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and lacked the needed rally. PREACHINATDINNER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into
the stretch and was not a factor. I WORK FOR CARROTS chased the leaders from the inside for a half and weakened.

drew off. SALTY MINNOW sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged nearing the half but
could not match strides with the winner in the drive. DRIZZY chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the half, vied and
failed to sustain his bid in the drive. DYF lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly late. CHRISTINE'S JACK chased
the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way through the final furlong. DOUBLE A. PROSPECT showed no
early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. ZIPPY GROOM settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the
second turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
BISHOPS OF COMPTON broke sharply to track the pace of STRATUS BIRD from the inside, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole, reached the fore
with a furlong to run and drew off. BELL OF RAINIER lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good
energy. FLORISTA (IRE) raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. STRATUS BIRD sprinted clear
soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. STREETLIGHTROMANCE was forwardly placed from
the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. IKNOWYOURFACE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a
half.

PISTOL POWER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up three-wide through the second turn to offer a bid nearing the quarter and edged away in
the drive. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT sprinted clear at once, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter and gave way grudgingly to the
winner in the drive. AQUA FRIO was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly.
AWESOME SLATE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly in the drive. BRAHMS FOREST raced off the
pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled in with a furlong to run and was not a factor. WEST COAST INDY lacked early foot,
raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. PARTY FOR ONE broke sharply to chase the leaders
while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. GRAY ADMIRAL showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, did not
offer a bid and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MIXO was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards to be going
away. PURE PURSUIT broke sharply to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by SO LUCKY nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that
rival but could not resist the winner late. TUMAC MOUNTAIN was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy. SO LUCKY was away in good order to press the pace of MIXO while racing
three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied and gave way in the drive. FUZZY DOLPHIN was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and stayed on well. OWNERS' PRESTIGE (AUS) raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked
the needed rally. PLAYOFF BOUND was taken in hand at the break, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
EMMA'S A BEAST was bumped at the start, set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out to be kept
to task. SALTY LITTLE LASS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished
well to hold the place. VERAAJ chased the leaders from the inside, drifted out approaching the stretch, angled in and finished willingly. EARLY MORN
lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. COASTAL REIGN was off a step slow, showed no early
speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. LINCHPINS WAKE was off a step slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through
the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and did not offer a bid. SALTY NUGGET lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the
stretch and did not reach contention. BELLAMAGIC showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. COLOUR OF MONEY
raced off the pacesetters early, was carried out nearing the quarter and weakened in the drive. PORT LIONS was bumped at the start, pressed the pace
