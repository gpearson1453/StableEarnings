Footnotes
COCONUT GROVE settled off the pace and along the inside into the turn, angled out into the five path picking off rivals and was fanned out into the eight
path turning for home, continued to pass foes while lugging in and not switching leads through the stretch, trading the lead with a rival before outgaming that
one in the final seventy yards. SKY DRAGON settled in the two path and between rivals on the turn advancing from mid pack to just in behind the leaders,
was on hold waiting for room until upper stretch, got that space between tiring foes at the three sixteenths marker, getting a brief lead but was immediately
collared by the winner, game to the wire but second best. CARA CATERINA off the pace early and had only two rivals beaten midway on the turn, came two
to three wide in upper stretch and found her best stride late, closing smartly with good energy for the show spot. JUST PLAYING off the pace, held up on
the turn when on heels behind a rival, finding her best stride when angling out in the final furlong and coming with a rush for a minor award. EXCELLING set
the pace outside a rival down the backside and around the turn, still battling in upper stretch, regained a brief lead but was laying in and no match as the top
pair went by, losing more positions in the final stages while failing to switch leads. KARAKONTIE FLYER had a perfect trip between runners and in behind
the two leaders, appeared ready to make her presence felt when room appeared in mid stretch but brushed slightly with a rival and no response was
forthcoming. MRS. GOT ROCKS rushed up the rail to mid pack chase the leaders, stayed in range until upper stretch but had no bid from that point. LOTS
TO LIKE was three to four wide advancing on the turn, moved inside with the winner while fanned seven wide turning for home, failing to sustain her bid in
the run down the stretch. TIZ AFFAIR had the lead but was taken down to chase the leaders along the rail, appeared to have run when held late on the turn
but did not respond when asked in the stretch. RAVEN'S SONG was three wide chasing the leaders in the second tier, loomed up turning for home but
faded quickly in upper stretch. NORTHERN PASSAGE chased the leaders along the inside, dropped back from late on the turn to the wire without a bid.
SMART MUNNY broke very slowly from the gate and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STATE CROWN forced the pace, raced three-wide on the turn, bid upper stretch, drove clear and held under steady handling. LOVE IN THE AIR stalked
the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn, launched a determined drive and gained steadily to the wire. CARELESS HEIRESS showed brief speed then
pressed the pace two-wide, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. ROAD TO ROMANCE led after a brief duel, drew clear and set the pace, was
collared and then headed upper stretch and chased to the end. DIAMOND ORE raced in mid pack, chased three-wide on the turn then finished evenly.
GOSPEL HILL settled off the pace, closed two-wide late turn then showed some interest in the stretch. SPIRIT DANCE broke inward and bumped
OVERSTATE, settled in mid pack and never reached contention. MISS FLOKI raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn
but lacked a closing response. OVERSTATE, bumped at the outset, raced in mid pack early, was hustled four-wide from the back of the pack late turn and
lacked a rally.

Footnotes
JOJOMAR forced the pace, dropped back a bit at the turn, chased into the stretch, had command a 16th out and finished under a hand ride. LAST
ENDEAVOR gained a short lead, set a pressured pace, was passed a 16th out and held place. HEEHAA hopped leaving the gate, was rank on the
backstretch, closed along the rail late turn then finished gamely. DIAMONDBACK forced the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn then evened
out in the stretch. INFAMOUS COVERT broke outward then settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the turn, lugged in through the stretch, was steadied
late and evened out. DR. JEWEL, always in range, was hustled two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. MALIBU MANDATE stalked the pace, chased
three-wide on the turn, came out and bumped INFAMOUS COVERT upper stretch then evened out. TICKET TO ALASKA, in range early, was hustled three
and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. FIRST PRINCE raced from off the pace, saved ground but was not a threat. POOL SIDE broke slowly and
settled well off the pace, saved ground much of the way but lacked a rally. FORGOTTEN TREASURE raced in mid pack early, was hustled hard two and
three-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
JEANIE B (GB) was fanned five wide into the first turn, advanced into a nice open gap trip four or five lengths behind the two dueling leaders, moved up in
upper stretch to take those two rivals on, drove by inside the eighth pole and opened a clear margin, holding safe a late closer in the final stages.
HOLYANNA was four to two wide near the rear around the first turn, had one beat around the second turn before kicking it into high gear in the final furlong,
cutting into the winner's margin late without threatening. GREY SEAL dropped over causing a few rivals to take up into the first turn, settled into a pressing
duel with a rival down the backside and around the far turn, eventually getting by that rival in mid stretch but the top pair had already gone by, hard pressed
to hold the show. ALL QUALITY had rail speed throughout, battled inside a rival throughout and stayed on game for a minor award when the dust had
cleared. GOLDEN VISION was bumped at the start and trailed throughout, came off the inside late on the far turn and rallied past some tired foes inside the
final furlong. ETERNAL PEACE broke in at the start, was steadied inside rivals into the first turn, settling in mid pack down the backside, tried to rally in
upper stretch but could only put in a mild run without threatening. WEST PAW was steadied hard when four wide between rivals into the first turn, settling off
the pace and stayed three wide around the far turn, never putting in a bid. SAY HEY (FR) was steadied hard between rivals into the first turn, dropping back
to off the pace, no rally forthcoming when asked in the stretch.

DICTATE broke outward, led quickly, set a reserved pace, was joined upper stretch, battled to the wire and prevailed under a drive. JLOHR JAN stalked the
pace, chased from two-wide and the rail on the far turn, bid upper stretch, dueled but lost the nod. SMARTY ILLUSION was rated off the pace, chased
four-wide on the far turn, rallied gamely but was no threat to the top two. LETTER ROLL steadied at the start and settled off the pace, closed along the rail
and two-wide on the far turn but failed to menace in the stretch. SWEET UPROAR stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then evened out in
mid stretch. FREEDOM MACHINE stalked the pace while racing three-wide throughout, was hustled on the far turn but tired at the top of the stretch.
ABOVE THE LINE settled in mid pack, came four-wide through the first turn, chased along the rail on the far turn but also tired at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
BELICHICK settled in mid pack as the leaders battled through solid fractions, moved up gradually with the rider high in the saddle into range while three
wide on the final turn, hit the front late on the turn and had a clear margin in upper stretch while still on his wrong lead, holding a safe advantage and
switching leads at the sixteenth pole, not threatened to the wire. MEYER was inside near the rear through the first turn, came into range two to four wide on
the far turn and followed the winner into the stretch but could not match that one's closing kick, a clear second best. ENGLISH CONQUEROR was inside
the winner going down the backside, took the rail route through the far turn and had to await room as the speed began to stop at the top of the stretch,
darted through an opening along the fence in upper stretch, holding the show spot over a late closing foe. DEVIANT settled well off the pace, rallied into
traffic and lost his path at the three sixteenths, gathered up and re-rallied for a minor award late. CLAYTON was in mid pack before rallying along the inside
to get in behind the tiring leader midway on the far turn, came off the inside to await room behind a wall turning for home and angled out to take his shot but
drifted in and bumped a rival at the three sixteenths, levelling off from that point. ENCHANT ME was well back along the inside, advanced on the rail into
range on the far turn but could not sustain his bid, besting the balance but quite far back. MIGHTY HEART sped to the lead and was pressed by a rival
through fast fractions, put his pace buddy away but had been softened up and could not hold off many challengers nearing the stretch, tiring down the lane
from his early efforts. MUSKOKA GIANT was well back early, circled into contention two to five wide on the far turn but tired in upper stretch, lugging in on
his wrong lead and levelling off in the final furlong. TOLD IT ALL tucked in behind the early duelers, came off the inside to take a shot at the pace survivor
but his bid wasn't as strong as the others, no match down the lane. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE trailed by a good margin into the far turn and rallied mildly to
approach the rear of the field but stalled in upper stretch. KUNAL forced the pace until dropping back suddenly from midway on the far turn, crossed the wire
and walked off.
