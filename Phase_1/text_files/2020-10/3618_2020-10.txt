and was geared down in the final stages. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS broke in the air and chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final stages. CAMPIONI raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in
the stretch run. BLUE STEEL stalked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and steadily faded throughout. ABOVE BOARD set the pace
early, widened on the field nearing the lane, was off the rail into the lane and tired down the lane. TRES EQUIS was in the three path into the lane and
improved position. HOORAY FOR HARVEY had early speed then folded up. QUICKSILVER was through after a half.

COPLEY set the pace early, was in the four path into the lane then drew off down the lane under a steady drive. WESTERN PHAROAH lunged at the start
and trailed the field early on while hugging the rail, was stopped slightly and waited nearing the quarter pole, got through along the rail into the lane and
finished willingly down the lane for place. SIR ACEALOT raced back early on, rallied along the turn while making a bid, was in the four path into the lane and
moved up in the stretch run. PAYSTER tracked the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. TOWN AGENDA was
bothered and checked early on, raced in the seven path into the lane and improved position in the stretch. MR. BANYAN broke out at the start and was
never a threat. WAYPOINT chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and empty down the lane. NIP N TUCK was through after a half. HAPPY
DASH had early speed then folded up. BIG SKY MONTANA was done early.

Footnotes
ATTACHMENT RATE vied along the inside of the pace setter, dueled with that foe into and around the far turn, kicked clear passing the quarter pole, and
widened under driving pressure through midstretch. ALEX JOON tucked off of the pace into the first turn, trailed into the far turn, but angled out and rallied in
the three to four path through the latter half of that bend, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, but failed to make headway and was second best.
DISTORTED MOON tracked the pair of leaders from the three path, but failed to keep pace with the eventual winner turning for home, and chased through
the lane. LUNA'S IN CHARGE set the pace outside of ATTACHMENT RATE, dueled with that foe around the far turn, but proved no match for him at the
quarter pole, and tired through the lane. ONE NATION trailed early on, took the turns in the two to three paths, and failed to factor. GUIDED MISSILE
tracked from midpack four wide around the first turn, tucked to the rail into the far turn, but faded thereafter.

TRAIN TO ARTEMUS set the pace along the inside, drew off turning for home, widened her advantage through upper stretch under driving pressure, then
was geared down approaching the sixteenth pole. SANTA RITA took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced well off of the pace two wide into
the turn, split foes passing the quarter pole, then shifted out at the furlong pole while sustaining her rally, and secured place by holding CUZZYWUZZY at
bay. CUZZYWUZZY raced off of the pace along the inside, lost position into the turn, saved ground around it, then rallied through traffic through the lane
while chasing SANTA RITA, but failed to catch that horse for place in the late stages. THUNDERING CREED reared in the gate, then bumped with an inner
foe at the start, rallied from far off of the pace in the five to four path around the turn, reached place in upper stretch while no match for the leader, but
flattened out through the final furlong. TIZ A BIT LUCKY got bounced around between horses at the start, trailed the field three wide into the turn, shifted five
wide turning for home, and rallied mildly past tired foes. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI pressed the eventual winner from the outside, but proved no match for
that foe passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened through the lane. JOY OF PAINTING hopped at the start, tracked from midpack two to three wide
and between horses, got rank into the turn without reasoning, then failed to factor. SUGAR DIVA chased the leaders four to three wide, but tired passing the
five sixteenths pole. IMPEACH ME tracked from midpack along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring foe passing the three furlong pole, and
faded thereafter. IMPERIAL MOON raced off of the pace four wide, and failed to factor. DOUBLE DARE YOU stalked three wide, but weakened passing the
three furlong pole, and was done early.

CLUB CAR pressed the pace setter along the inside down the backstretch, dueled with that foe around, kicked clear of that rival in upper stretch, and was
ridden out to the wire. ZUSHA set the pace outside of CLUB CAR down the backstretch, dueled with that foe around the turn, but proved no match in upper
stretch. A. P. PRINCESS stalked three wide, but failed to keep pace with the dueling leaders in upper stretch. DIAMOND CRAZY tracked from along the
inside while about a path off of the rail, but failed to factor. CARDAMON trailed throughout.

NEPAL UP trailed early on, rallied in the three to four path around the far turn to produce a bid passing the quarter pole, forged an advantage at the three
sixteenths pole, and drew off under driving pressure. CLAYTNTHELIONHEART tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the first turn, inched
closer into the far turn to vie outside of pair of rivals, forged an advantage approaching the quarter pole, but was headed by an outer rallying rival at the
three sixteenths pole, then held place thereafter. FORTUITY stalked along the inside and from the pocket, but got outmoved by an outer foe while tipping
three wide at the quarter pole, then kept on, but failed to make a bid for place. CIBOLIAN raced off of the pace in the two path, but failed to keep pace with
the leading group around the far turn, then passed tired foes for a minor reward. ORIGINAL INTENT was off a step slow and brushed an inner foe at the
start, saved ground far off the pace around the first turn, shifted from the two path to the four path turning for home, and passed tired foes without getting
involved. SHARECROPPER set the pace along the inside, but was headed by outer foes approaching the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane.
KENTUCKY GHOST prompted the pace three wide around the first turn, then vied two wide and between horses around the far turn, but weakened turning
for home. EL AHIJADO prompted the pace two wide and between horses around the first turn, but was done early.

Footnotes
BAOZUN saved ground while rating off of the pace around the turn, advanced while hugging the fence turning for home, bid for the lead inside of the pace
setter at the three sixteenths pole, then drew off thereafter under mild hand urging. NEW EAGLE stalked four to three wide, loomed outside of the leaders
passing the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage at the quarter pole, but was quickly surpassed by an inner rallying rival at the three sixteenths pole,
then tired on his left lead, but held show. PRADAR got bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked from midpack in the two path, shifted to the four path
turning for home, and stayed on to secure a minor reward. MR. MUTADDA trailed the field in the two to three path around the turn, tipped in from the four
path passing the quarter pole, and offered a mild rally. ROCK ON KITTEN set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the quarter pole, and weakened.
RAYO DE LUZ vied two wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. UNCLE GREGORY bumped an outer foe at the start, raced far off of the
pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor. TWINKLING KNIGHT was crowded between horses at the start, trailed along the inside
early on, and never got involved. TOWN DRUNK prompted the pace three wide early on, but chased it from the four path around the turn, and weakened
while drifting to the five path turning for home. PRAISE BE TO GOD raced far off of the pace in the three to four path before swinging six wide turning for
home, but had no rally. PER RULING FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING COMMISSION, MR. MUTADDA WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.
