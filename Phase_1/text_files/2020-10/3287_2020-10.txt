WHO'S THE DIVA NOW sprinted clear, pulled away on the turn and held sway in the stretch. QUINN ELLA outpaced early, advanced on the turn and
finished well in the stretch. GIGGLES AND SMOKE chased along the inside and stayed on without posing a threat. ANIMATOR settled well, moved closer
on the turn and made a mild rally in the stretch. LUCKY ROAD stalked the pace and weakened. MEMORABLE ANGEL was always outrun. CAT WALTZ
failed to threaten. HALEYS HEIST reared at the start and dislodged her rider. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY TO
THE START AND MADE NO CHANGES.
