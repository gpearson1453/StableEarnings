Footnotes
SANTA GUAPA held a clear margin while in hand, widened her advantage when called upon in upper stretch, and held on from the oncharging TAKE
CHARGE RO at the wire. TAKE CHARGE RO stalked along the inside around both turns, but failed to keep pace with the loose leader in upper stretch, got
headed for place by REARRANGE at the three sixteenths pole, but fought on to reclaim that position the final stages, then sustained her late charge to cut
the gap on the leader, but ran out of ground. REARRANGE tracked from midpack in the two path around the first turn, inched closer outside of a pair of foes
around the far turn to bid for place in upper stretch as the loose leader kicked away, forged that position from TAKE CHARGE RO passing the three
sixteenths pole, but flattened out thereafter, and was bested by that foe for place in the final furlong. PALAMOS (GB) was off slowly, got keen in the three
path around the first turn, then remained on her left lead in upper stretch, causing her to lugg inwards at the three sixteenths pole, then chased evenly after
being corrected. PRINCESA BLANCA broke outwardly, then saved ground around the turns while off of the pace, but failed to factor. DEMORA was off
slowly, trailed the field in the three to four paths around the turns, and never got involved. PRETTY PLUM stalked two wide, but was outmoved by
REARRANGE for place passing the quarter pole, and subsequenty weakened. QUEEN LOUISE was off slowly and shied from an inner foe at the start, then
saved ground far off of the pace, but was outrun.

Footnotes
REGAL BEAUTY settled far off of the pace, advanced four wide through the latter half of the turn, then sustained a steady charge through the lane, produce
a bid at the sixteenth pole, and drove past the leader in the final stages. RISING SEAS set the pace along the inside, shook clear of the pressing LEXI ON
THE MOVE passing the quarter pole, opened up a margin through upper stretch, but drifted out passing the furlong pole to meet REGAL BEAUTY's bid,
and got bested by that oncharging foe in the final sixteenth. PURRFECTLY CLAIRE chased three wide, held striking position turning for home, but was
outkicked by an outer foe passing the furlong pole, shifted inside of the drifting leader, but failed to catch that foe for place in the late stages. CHARMING
LADY saved ground off of the pace, and improved along the rail through the lane. LEXI ON THE MOVE prompted the pace setter from the outside, inched
closer turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, and tired. CALL ON MISCHIEF stalked along the inside, but failed to produce
a bid before weakening through the lane. RECODED tracked from midpack two to three wide, and never got involved. CECI VALENTINA trailed along the
inside, and was outrun.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL CLASH vied three wide early on, cleared inner foes and cut down to the rail into the turn, showed the way before kicking clear in upper
stretch, then held sway to the wire. MONTE NE stalked from the four path and between horses, around the turn, took aim on the clear leader as other foes
tired in upper stretch, but proved no match for the leader passing the furlong pole, and kept on to prove second best. DYESS took the turn in the three path
far off of the pace, cut the corner turning for home, then stayed on inside of foes through the lane. FIRST CITIZEN tracked from midpack in the five path,
and leveled off through the lane. OAK ROOM bobbled at the start, trailed the field around the turn before swinging to the six path tuning for home, but failed
to factor. DUBLIN YINZ MONEY stalked from the three path and between horses around the turn, but failed to factor. CHAMPERS stumbled at the start,
then was outrun. TRUMPIN ON vied along the inside early on, then stalked the leader from the two path while inside of foes around the turn, but weakened
in upper stretch.
