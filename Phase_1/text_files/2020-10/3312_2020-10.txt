late. TARTAN THE BULL allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out mid stretch and got up
for a share. BIG CHICKEN MAN sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
HERE COMES JACKIE mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up in
the final strides. WRONG COLOR tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, angled out to bid outside the leader into the lane, shook clear, then
was outfinished. LET'S GO BABY mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room
and evened out. FEETS OF FEATHER allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady
gain and missed the show, gaining a share. JULUCA never far back, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and
ran evenly in the stretch. MIDNIGHT PIRATE passed tiring rivals. BIG ANGEL sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, then faded in the stretch.
