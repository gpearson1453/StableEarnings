Footnotes
CLAIRIERE rated far off of the pace in the three to four paths around the turns, shifted five wide turning for home, then produced a grinding rally through the
lane while drifting in subtly, reached late and just got up. SUPER QUICK established a clear margin around the first turn, received a breather into the far turn
before holding an advantage from an outer foe around the far turn, then spurted clear from that rival passing the quarter pole, held that clear margin through
midstretch, but was tested late and got nailed on the wire. WILL'S SECRET lied forwardly placed three wide and between horses, rallied through the lane
while inside of CLAIRIERE, but was outkicked by that foe passing the sixteenth pole. SHIP IT raced off of the pace from the five path into the first turn,
tucked to the three path around that bend, then attempted to rally between horses through the lane, but was outkicked by outer foes at the furlong pole, then
kept on to achieve fourth. JAIL HOUSE CODE stalked two wide, vied around the far turn, but was repelled by the leader turning for home and weakened.
MEJTHAAM tracked from midpack four wide, but came under a drive into the far turn and lacked a response. GOOD PENNY broke inwards, then saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LEN LO LADY saved ground in midpack, advanced to pocket stalking position into the far turn, but faded after shifting
off of the rail turning for home. EILEEN ALEXANDRA was off slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MISS ADELINE lied forwardly placed in the three path, inched closer around the far turn to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, sparked a duel as the
inner pace setter dug in, and prevailed late under driving pressure. YABA DABA DIVA set the pace along the inside, dug in in upper stretch as MISS
ADELINE made a menacing bid, battled gamely, but was outfinished late. GO BIG GREEN stalked along the inside around both turns, but chased the
dueling leaders through the lane while making progress, shifted out to attempt to split those foes inside the final sixteenth, but lacked a kick to do so, then
steadied when the hole closed. BELLA CONCHITA was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace, then produced a grinding rally to narrow the gap on the
leaders through the lane. JEWEL AZUL got keen between horses through the stretch for the first time, raced far off of the pace three to two wide around the
first turn, then saved ground around the far turn, but to no avail. DANGER prompted the pace setter two wide, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the
quarter pole, and weakened thereafter. VIETNAM tracked from midpack in the four path around the first turn, then from the three path around the far turn,
but failed to factor. MALIBU SUPER SPORT was off slowly, raced far off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, then in the four path around the far
turn, but did not make an impact. LA BURNETT buckjumped at the start, then trailed around both turns and never got involved. FADED MEMORIES dwelt a
bit at the start, tracked from midpack in the three to two path around the first turn, but was done early and faded between rivals around the far turn.

Footnotes
KING FURY tracked from midpack in the three path, inched closer outside of the pair of foes into the far turn to make a three wide bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole forged an advantage outside of SUPER STOCK approaching the furlong pole, and held firm to the wire as that foe battled on. SUPER
STOCK stalked two wide, bid for the lead into the far turn, vied between horses turning for home as KING FURY ranged up alongside, but was headed by
that foe in upper stretch, then battled on gamely to the wire, but failed to regain even terms. ONCOMING TRAIN stalked along the inside, chased the
leaders under coaxing around the far turn, then stayed on through the lane while inside of ARABIAN PRINCE, and prevailed over that foe for show.
ARABIAN PRINCE trailed the field two wide around the first turn, then three wide around the far turn but chased the leaders through the lane and failed to
menace. FRANZ JOSEF tugged his was to a clear advantage early on, then clung to the lead inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but proved no
match for those rivals passing the quarter pole, and gave way through the final furlong. CRIME SPREE saved ground off of the pace while keen around the
first turn, but got rank passing the six furlong pole, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
CAMP HOPE raced forwardly placed four wide around the first turn, bid for the lead three wide into the far turn, forged an advantage turning for home before
kicking clear in upper stretch with good energy, widened under driving pressure while shifting ground inwards, and was geared down through the final
sixteenth. LEBLON lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, loomed behind the leading group passing the five sixteenths pole, but failed to
match stride with an outer foe passing the quarter pole, kept on to split foes at the furlong pole, and proved second best. BUSINESS MODEL bumped with
an inner foe at the start, then was jostled between horses into the first turn, tracked from midpack three wide, then chased the leading group through upper
stretch before shifting to the rail at the furlong pole, and rallied past tired foes for show. HOPE AND DIGNITY set the pace along the inside, but proved no
match for the eventual winner passing the quarter pole, and tired late to get outfinished for minor rewards. GRAND DESIGN was off a step slow, trailed the
field in the three path around the far turn, then swung eight wide turning for home, and rallied outside of foes for a minor share. MYSTICAL MAN was
brushed by an inner foe into the first turn, tracked from midpack five wide around that bend, inched closer to striking range four wide into the far turn, but
chased the leaders evenly through the lane. FLORIFORM lost his footing at the start, lunged inwards and bumped a foe, then raced far off of the pace in the
three path around the first turn, five wide around the far turn, and sustained a mild grind while needing correction to prevent lugging through the lane.
SHARTLE broke sharp, prompted the pace three to two wide into the backstretch, vied between foes around the far turn, but weakened passing the quarter
pole. SCARLET FUSION saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, then between horses around the far turn, and did not factor. SOUTHERN
PASSAGE bumped with an outer foe at the start, then bumped that foe again into the first turn, raced off of the pace inthe two to four paths around the
turns, swung seven wide turning for home, and failed to menace. RACE CRAFT took a solid bump from an outer foe at the start, then prompted the pace
between horses around the first turn before taking back to stalk from the inside, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole, and weakened. RYE
SENSE OF HUMOR lied forwardly placed along the inside around the first turn, but was done early.

Footnotes
COACH prompted the pace three wide while perched outside of a pair of foes, vied outside of those rivals around the far turn before drawing off turning for
home, met LADY TRAVELER's bid in upper stretch, held tenaciously to repel that foe approaching the sixteenth pole, and won going away. LADY
TRAVELER tracked from midpack in the three to two path, then inched closer in the four path around the far turn to produce a mild bid outside of COACH in
upper stretch, but was turned away by that foe passing the sixteenth pole, and proved second best. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT saved ground off of the pace
around the first turn, advanced inside of foes down the backstretch to stalk from the pocket into the far turn, shifted two wide to pass the tiring early pace
setter at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch, then held show while chasing those foes home. DASH TO THE
TOP bobbled and bumped a foe at the start, saved ground far off of the pace around the first turn, then from the three to five path around the far turn, but
chased the leaders through the lane without producing a bid. MIDNIGHT BALLERINA trailed the field in four path around the first turn, rallied inside of a rival
around the far turn before swinging five wide turning for home, but leveled off before menacing. TORSIE'S CHARM raced far off of the pace in the three to
four paths around the turns, got fanned six wide turning for home, and failed to factor. ORSETTO stalked along the inside, but weakened around the far
turn. MALIBU BIRD dueled for the lead along the inside around the first turn, held a margin down the backstretch, but was headed by foes passing the three
furlong pole, weakened turning for home, and was eased through the lane. SALTY AS CAN BE dueled for the lead two wide before pressing the pace setter
down the backstretch, vied between horses into the far turn, but proved no match for an outer rival turning for home, and weakened.

Footnotes
KING'S OVATION tracked from midpack in the three path under steady urging, shifted four wide turning for home, grinded away with lengths to find on the
vying leaders through midstretch, but quickened late, and drove past inner foes approaching the wire. TRUMP CARD was off a step slowly, stalked three
wide, inched closer into the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace with his inner counterparts in upper stretch, but kept on
under driving pressure, rebid at the sixteenth pole, but was surpassed by an outer oncharging foe. RUNWAY MAGIC pulled keenly to rush along the inside
down the backstretch to a stalking position into the turn, saved ground around that bend before tipping four wide passing the furlong pole, but was outkicked
by an outer foe and kept on to achieve show. OUTASITE cleared early on, dug in to cling to an advantage from multiple rivals in upper stretch, repelled
those bids through the lane, but tired in the final sixteenth. GROUP HUG raced far off of the pace, took the turn in the two path and between horses, then
offered a belated rail surge in the final furlong. ROYAL TRYST trailed the field, advanced three wide around the turn before tipping seven wide turning for
home, and sustained a mild rally while shifting ground inwards. BIG LAKE bobbled a bit at the start, stalked from two path while inside of foes, bid for the
lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole, vied through upper stretch, but weakened through the final furlong, and bled. COMMANDEER raced far off
of the pace in the two path, and failed to factor. FROSTED OVER raced off of the pace three wide, swung six wide turning for home while inside of ROYAL
TRYST, but was herded inwards by that foe through upper stretch, then shied from inner foes at the furlong pole. FOLIAGE bobbled a bit at the start,
chased from midpack two wide, but tired. COPA stalked four wide, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and weakened after being floated five wide at
the quarter pole by the eventual winner. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM saved ground off of the pace, but was done early.
