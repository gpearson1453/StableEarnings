closed well for the show. WILD WINTER allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, wakened late and held a
share. ABLE BAKER CHARLIE mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. BREZNO allowed
to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and passed tiring rivals. LOVE TO SINGH well placed and inside, held position

Footnotes
SAMURAI ZIP stalked the early pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader gaining a short lead into the
stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. GREATEST GAME chased the pace, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide
into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. FLY FRIENDLY SKY mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
lacked the needed late kick. BALK mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and got up for a share.
TONEDADDY improved position. MY PATRONUS set the pace on the inside and faded in the lane. GOHARA was no factor. BAYSIDER was pulled up and
walked off.

Footnotes
PARKIN IN THE REAR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the lane, then drew off and was kept to the task.
THREATLEVELMIDNITE (GB) allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not threaten
that one and held the place. SEA MONSTER tracked the pace, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, then weakened late and held the show. SIDE
ACTION never far back, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and got up for a share. TRUDIAN'S PROMISE well
placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in the drive. BOURBON BLAST mid pack, gained
a striking position four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in the drive. GET ME A DIAMOND was a brief factor, outside.
OUR MAGICAL GIRL was no factor. TORTILLA DE PATATA was never involved.

Footnotes
ENTHRONED well placed, saved ground through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task.
NORMANS GIRL GAYLE mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and
closed well for the place. TIPARILLO mid pck, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the show.
DISCRIMANATION tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. SNIPER SIS well
placed and between, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened the final furlong. BUTTON CANDY
passed tiring rivals. KATZ THE STORM allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened in the drive.
ISLAND BETTY well placed and inside, gained a short lead into the turn, then faded in the stretch. DREAMINGOFROSEALLA set the early pace well off the
rail and had no stretch rally. REINA CARIBE was no factor. ENLISTED was never involved.
