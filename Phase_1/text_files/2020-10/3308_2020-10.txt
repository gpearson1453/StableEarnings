NO REGRETS raced three wide early, then stalked close up three wide, commenced a bid nearing the far turn, dueled two wide on the turn, battled heads
apart with SPIN CYCLE, gained a slim advantage and gamely maintained that edge through the final sixteenth to prevail. SPIN CYCLE tracked between
rivals in the early stages, split foes past the half mile marker into contention, dueled inside on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of NO REGRETS in a
spirited stretch duel and fought determinedly to the wire. TRAVELIN' SONG raced two wide off the pace, went five wide past the quarter pole and rallied
mildly for third. PURCHASING POWER was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, angled out entering the stretch and closed belatedly outside. COBH
raced close up inside, then chased and weakened. PAINTER'S PRIDE bobbled at the break, raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and lacked a
rally. PIPPIN stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and tired. SHOELESS set the pace racing in the two path, then dueled, chased and tired.
