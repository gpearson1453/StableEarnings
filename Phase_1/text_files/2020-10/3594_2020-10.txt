DOCSLUCKYCAT pressed the early speed, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, prevailed after a long stretch battle under strong handling. TALE OF
LACEY was never far back, rallied at the quarter pole three wide, finished with good courage and just missed. HAKMAN set the pace and dueled on the
lead from the rail, held grudgingly to be narrowly beaten. TO WIN raced close up until mid stretch, then weakened. BISCUITS AND GRITS raced mid pack
and had no rally. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY flashed brief foot, and was through early. MONSTER HUNTER was off slowly and was no factor. SUGAR MAC
was outrun.

position throughout on the inside, finished willingly to be second best. COUSIN chased, the winner early, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close then held
well in the drive. IRON DRILL was allowed to settle early, rallied on the inside and finished well. BRISKY tracked three wide and went evenly. DEPUTY OX
raced close up early and faltered in the stretch. REAGANIZE allowed to settle, failed to menace. L. L. B. STORM was no factor. SCOTCH raced mid pack
early and gave way. EL ANDARIEGO showed little and trailed.
