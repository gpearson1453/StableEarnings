Footnotes
IT'S PAZIBLE set the pace just off rail, shook loose to open a long lead in early stretch and then won under mild handling. JUMP SHOT got to the rail on the
far turn, took up sharply in tight near quarter pole, recovered and battled gamely to gain place. NO FLY ZONE raced wide, lugged in bumping RISING
STORM into PROTA near mid stretch. RISING STORM ducked in leaving the gate, eased out five wide on the turn, was bumped into PROTA by NO FLY
ZONE, near mid stretch, appeared to be pushed and tapped twice in the face by the rider of PROTA. MANAGING RISK broke slowly and was outrun early,
split foes on the turn, angled out in stretch but was no threat. CHAMPAGNE'S ON ICE raced two wide dueling, came in near stretch and impeded JUMP
SHOT while tiring. RULES stumbled leaving the gate, raced four wide while just off the pace then tired. PROTA, three wide in second flight, was bumped
soundly near mid stretch, his rider pushed RISING STORM and tapped that rival twice in the face as his rider lost his balance momentarily, recovered and
faded. HURACAN broke slowly and was never a factor. DOUGIE vied for command three wide then tired. GAME CHANGER showed nothing. FINN'S
POSSE showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARD INQUIRY, AND CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS OF RISING STORM AND PROTA, NO FLY ZONE
WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED EIGHTH.

HAPPYASCANB took the lead between foes entering the first turn, set the pace in four path, drifted wider through stretch and was driving to the wire.
MARKOFTHEMAKER raced three wide and just off the pace, was no threat to winner but finished gamely for place. SMART PROSPECT saved ground
throughout, challenged and loomed boldly on the far turn but then flattened out. FOX IN THE FOG took up in tight and bumped with INSPIRED OPTIONS
rounding the first turn, left with the rail while just off the pace then tired. INSPIRED OPTIONS bumped with FOX IN THE FOG and steadied rounding the first
turn, steadied lacking room entering the backstretch, saved ground and tired. GALLIC WAR raced wide and showed little. GRAY LITTLE MEADOW stalked
the pace outside winner then gave way. PREFONTAINE was never a factor. THIN SPACES WAS ORDERED SCRATCHED ON THE ADVICE OF THE
VETERINARIAN. ALL WAGERS ON HIM, EXCEPT IN THE PICK 3 WERE REFUNDED.

WHISTLING BIRDS tracked the pace with a ground saving trip, chased on the far turn, rallied two wide into the stretch, dug in gamely between rivals
passing the furlong marker, gained a short lead at the sixteenth pole and held determinedly. DEBBIE'S PASSION raced two wide off the pace, rallied turning
for home, lacked room at the eighth pole, then split rivals, surged late and dug in gamely to the finish. NAME CHANGER stalked close up two wide, chased

Footnotes
COUNTY CORRECTIONS chased between rivals in the early stages, moved up on the turn, chased FOREST RIVER into the stretch, angled in at the
eighth pole, rallied on the rail and surged late to get up for the win. FOREST RIVER away alertly to set the pace, raced off the inside, responded when
roused, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and yielded grudgingly late. RINGS OF JUPITER chased inside, chased the leaders on the turn and rallied mildly
outside for third. DREAMY MARTINI raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane, gained mildly and got the nod for fourth. STORM TALES raced three
wide off the pace, came three wide into the stretch and just missed for fourth. MIDNIGHT GAMES raced off the pace, came six wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. MY PIRATE raced off the pace, then chased between rivals and tired. HIGH FLYING GUY chased three wide, came four wide into the lane
and tired. AMERICAN COUGAR stumbled at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DIAMOND SQUARE raced three wide off the pace,
