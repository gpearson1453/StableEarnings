TIZ MY RIGHT led quickly, set a reserved pace then held sway under a drive. FINEST JEWEL broke outward and settled in mid pack, raced four-wide on
both turns, closed on the far turn then finished with a determined drive. DEE DEE'S ANGEL ducked in at the start and was bumped from both sides, raced
in mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn then closed mildly. MAMITA'S CHICA, away slowly and off the pace, came four-wide through the first turn
and three to five-wide through the far turn then closed outside rivals in the stretch but failed to menace. TWENTYTWENTYCREST settled in mid pack,
angled from the rail to three-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. I LOOK INCREDIBLE bobbled leaving the gate, stalked the pace, chased hard on the
far turn then flattened out in the stretch. MARTINI SUE bumped with TOY SHOW the start, stalked the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn then failed to
menace. AUDREY GRACE bumped with TOY SHOW leaving the gate, settled in mid pack early, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but never reached

Footnotes
BARKIN trailed the field for the first six furlongs, came up the inside around the far turn into range late on the bend, angled out when entering the stretch,
drove by the leaders near the eighth pole and widened under aggressive handling late. SARATOGA VISION settled off the pace early, moved into mid pack
along the rail by the far turn, angled out to engage the leader turning for home and led briefly by the three sixteenths pole but was immediately tackled by
the winner and settled for a well beaten second best. SHES THE NORTH was pulling hard early and opened a big lead into the backstretch, stalked and
pressed by a rival into the far turn, shook off that rival but was headed into the turn for home, battling on gamely to hold the show spot although well back.
CON THIEN broke out at the start and settled off the pace while three wide around the first turn, came into mid pack between rivals on the far turn and had
the winner to her inside nearing the stretch but couldn't match her energy, settling for a minor award while inching up on the show horse late. SPORT'N
FORTY four to three wide in mid pack on the first turn, stayed three wide chasing down the backside before dropping back in the three path late on the far
turn, re-rallying mildly to pass a few tired foes down the stretch. JLOHR JAN between rivals in mid pack, angled out to four wide late on the far turn to look
dangerous turning for home but was laying in upper stretch while outside runners and hung in the final eighth. BUTTERED TOAST trailed the field into the
far turn, came out three to four wide at the rear of the pack and out into the six path at the top of the stretch, but had nothing left for the stretch. COCONUT
GROVE chased the open length leader down the backside, moved up to stalk and press that one into and around the far turn but had nothing left for the
stretch drive, backing up severely in the final eighth.
