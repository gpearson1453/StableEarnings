Footnotes
EXTRA DOUGH waited behind the leaders passing the five-sixteenths two wide, shifted out a couple paths finding clearance approaching the stretch, rallied
steadily outside rivals and was along in time. MAKINALEGACY was outrun for a half-mile, moved from the two-path to the rail rallying in upper stretch, got
through inside EL GRAN PICHON reaching a short lead past the sixteenth-pole, and was edged out near the wire. CONSILIUM saved ground outrun early,
swung four wide late on the turn, rallied staying on his left lead, and finished gamely outside the top two. MUST BE A MONSTER was reserved just off the
early leaders, ranged up to challenge three wide after a half-mile, and weakened between horses past the eighth-pole. EL GRAN PICHON vied for
command from the outset inside RICH'S RAGS, stayed on to mid stretch, and was overhauled from both sides. RICH'S RAGS bumped with
MAKINALEGACY at the start, dueled outside EL GRAN PICHON to the stretch, and gave way leaving the furlong grounds. RICKY RUN raced four to five
wide around the turn, and posed no threat. ADIOS SEE YA stumbled at the start, moved inside around the turn, and tired. SCOTCH WHISKEY was outrun
three wide. DIALED IN GOLD showed little.

Footnotes
ROBINTAKINCHARGE set the pace along the rail, edged clear around the turn and widened under steady left-handed urging in the lane. FIRST AND
THREE settled off the pace outside early, angled to the rail nearing the five-sixteenths pole, finished willingly inside of foes and was up for the place in the
final strides. FOURTH DESIGN pressed the winner two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, weakened and lost the place in the final strides. SMOKE
'N' GLOAT raced up close inside down the backstretch, tipped two wide near the five-sixteenths marker and came up empty in the lane. BENEFACTOR
chased the pace three wide and faded in the stretch. DIAMOND BACHELOR played no factor while racing three wide. SHIDOSHI was outrun inside.

Footnotes
COMPETITIVE HERO dueled early inside rivals, shook off TRY ME getting clear after three-eighths of a mile, and was driving to stay in command.
BEASTER was outrun to the turn, angled four wide past the three-sixteenths, and finished well outside to be clearly second best. HIGHLY NOTED bumped
with TRINNI VALENTINE at the start, saved ground throughout, and bested the others. TURPIAL was outrun three wide to the stretch, and improved
outside for a share. TRINNI VALANTINE bumped with HIGHLY NOTED at the start, struck the rail and checked back to last past the seven-sixteenths,
stayed inside and finished with interest. MASTER Q stayed in range two to three wide early, bumped hard with GO ORTEGO GO at the top of the stretch,
and weakened while moving inside. SIXTY ONE moved in around the turn, and was always outrun. HE AIN'T NO SAINT was never prominent. GO
ORTEGO GO raced four wide around the turn, bumped hard with MASTER Q at the head of the lane, and tired. TRY ME vied outside the winner early, and
gave way leaving the turn. DEVILISH TAIL was outrun while racing five wide. GOOD BOY ROY took up sharply between MASTER Q and GO ORTEGO GO
early on the turn, and dropped far back.

Footnotes
GUACO was outrun to the stretch, rallied between horses coming to the eighth-pole, collared the leaders from outside with 70 yards remaining and was
going away at the finish. DEO FORTE went up to contest the pace outside WITH A BIT OF LUCK heading to the turn, wrested command in deep stretch,
but could not hold off the winner. THE SPIDER bumped with SHANGHAI LEVI at the start, saved ground to the stretch, moved out through the furlong
grounds and finished willingly. CAPITAN FOFO chased after the leaders into the turn, made no headway through upper stretch, stayed on his left lead and
ran on for a share outside the top trio. WITH A BIT OF LUCK crossed over with the early lead, dueled inside DEO FORTE around the turn and into the
stretch, and yielded a sixteenth out. SHANGHAI LEVI bumped with THE SPIDER at the start, raced far back to the stretch, and passed tired horses.
BAHAMIAN BEAT pursued the leaders three wide into the turn, and tired into the lane. JUAN BOLY was outrun four to five wide. MALETTA bobbled after
bumping with FELON at the start, and saved ground to no avail. GUMWRAPPER was finished early two wide. FELON bumped with MALETTA at the start,
and was through before reaching the stretch. CHANDLER'S DRAMA collapsed near the three-sixteenths pole falling heavily and unseating the rider, and
was vanned off.

Footnotes
JUST KIDDING prompted the pace outside SINGINGINTHEJOHN, challenged for command on the far turn, took over after six furlongs and widened
through the stretch under pressure. NO GETTING OVER ME was never far back, raced three wide into the stretch, and could not seriously threaten the
winner while best of the others. CHARLIE THE GREEK bumped with INGREIDO at the start, and was no menace through an even effort. INGREIDO
bumped with CHARLIE THE GREEK at the start, raced in the two-path far back for six furlongs, and passed tired horses. DARDANELLOS raced four wide
much of the way, and was outrun. SINGINGINTHEJOHN grabbed the early lead in the two-path, moved in on the far turn coming under attack from JUST
KIDDING, yielded after six furlongs, and faltered through the lane. RESIDENT stumbled badly at the start, and was always far back.

Footnotes
WHOLEBODEMEISTER was forwardly placed inside early, waited for room past the three-eighths while edging off the rail to the two-path, found clearance
at the top of the stretch, caught FOOLISH HEART from outside with a furlong remaining, and drove clear while swapping back to her left lead 50 yards out.
FOOLISH HEART bumped with MANGROVE MAMMA at the start, set the pace inside, could not hold off the winner leaving the eighth-pole, and was clearly
second best. SPLASH CASH loomed a threat with a three-wide bid around the turn, but flattened out into the lane. QUEEN DOMINA broke slowly, and
passed tired horses while never a factor. ARTIE'S ROSE broke slowest, and never menaced. BEAUTY QUEEN tired after a half-mile three wide.
MANGROVE MAMMA bumped with FOOLISH HEART at the start, pursued that one from outside into the turn, and was finished approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
HARD WEST settled off the pace along the inside, made progress at the rail around the turn, swung four wide near the quarter pole, swept to command in
midstretch and drew off under a drive. JACK B WINKLE raced off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch, was brushed nearing the eighth pole and
finished willingly to gain the place. FIRST DEGREE lacked speed while racing two wide around the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and was along for
the show. COLOSSAL STORM was fractious behind the starting gate, set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. SUNDOWN KID raced
two wide in midpack for a half, angled in nearing the quarter pole, bid at the rail approaching the eighth pole but could not sustain. MONEY HOUSE played
no factor while racing two wide. YES FOR LESS hit the starting gate, saved ground and was never close. SIESTA MOON dueled three wide for a half,
wandered about in midstretch, brushed JACK B WINKLE near the eighth pole and retreated. STARSHIP TAXI bobbled at the start but was still away quickly,
contested the early pace two wide between foes and tired nearing the lane. PRICEY VICTORY chased the pace two wide, drifted four wide nearing the lane
and retreated. HE HAD A SECRET was in tight at the start and was outrun outside.
