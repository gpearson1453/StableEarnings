DAPPER JACK away alertly, dueled for the lead two wide into the far turn, set the balance of the pace and prevailed under strong right handed urging.
OPEN OUT trailed into the far turn, closed fast in the five path and was steadily gaining on the winner late. DINESEN stalked the pace into the far turn,
inched closer in the four path into the stretch then was outfinished. TROPICAL CYCLONE failed to menace. PIOCHE GOLD was hustled up to contest the
lead into the far turn then weakened. ANGEL'S KNIGHT inside, stopped lane.

Footnotes
I RECALL never far back, circled rivals four wide into the far turn, made the lead two wide at the top of the stretch, drifted out late despite right handed
urging and just lasted while fully extended. HIGH FIRE unhurried early, closed willingly in the eight path through the stretch and just missed getting up in
time. GRIZABELLA stalked the pace for a half, slipped through along the inside to make the lead entering the far turn, set the pace to the top of the stretch
then was outfinished. JETTIN PEGASUS was in tight at the start then found her best stride late in the four path. H. F. CARMEL unhurried early, moved
closer along the rail after a half, steadied when in tight entering the far turn then dropped back. AT FIRST BLUSH moved up along the inside into the far turn
then came up empty. STEPHANIE'S FAITH had speed into the second turn then wilted. IMPAZIBLE MINK chased the early pace, drew on even terms for
the lead before a half then flattened out. SHORE OF EDEN set the pace for a half then faltered. THE RIDER OF HIGH FIRE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTRE REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

PERFECTINGTHEVIEW sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, battled into the turn, shook clear and won under mild urging.
HEAVENLY BIRD trailed through the turn, closed fast in the five path and finished clear for second. PRINCESS EX chased the pace four then three wide,
bid into the stretch then leveled off. JUSTA COWGIRL delayed the start while refusing to load, bore out at the start bumping a rival, was quickly bumped
hard by SWEET BETTY JOYCE, had good early speed then lacked the needed response late. RACEY WEEKEND failed to menace. SWEET BETTY
JOYCE bore out badly at the start bumping hard with rivals, dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, had speed until mid stretch then gave way. QUEEN
OF THE TILES was bumped hard and forced out wide at the start then never a threat.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS N DEW hopped at the start, shifted outside, circled rivals five then three wide through the turn, made the lead before the top of the stretch then
won as rider her pleased. DEB'S ALL OUT trailed into the stretch, closed fast in the six path and finished clear for second. DANCING GRACE dueled for the
lead three wide, brushed entering the turn and finished determinedly. CEE CEE'S GOT THIS dueled for the lead along the inside into the turn, dropped back
then came on again late in the three path. EASTER PRIDE dueled for the lead four wide, brushed entering the turn, battled into the stretch then weakened
along the rail. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE sprinted to the lead while splitting horses two wide before a quarter, matched stride to the top of the stretch then faded
late. HASTEY WAY was through early.
