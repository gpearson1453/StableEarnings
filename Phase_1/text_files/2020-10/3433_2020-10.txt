Footnotes
EL SICARIO veered in at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, came off the inside to the three-path rallying in mid stretch, caught PUGIN from outside
and edged away late. PUGIN dueled for command outside VALEROSO from the start, got the best of that dispute past the eighth-pole, but was worn down
through the last sixteenth of a mile. THIRSTY'S PRIDE stayed close toward the inside for a half-mile, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and
could not seriously menace with an even finish. VALEROSO dueled inside PUGIN, and weakened on his left lead leaving the furlong grounds. THE
CAPTURED STAR moved inside around the turn, and could not threaten. TESTIFIED stumbled at the start, moved out five wide near the quarter-pole, and
could not reach contention. HAIL SOUTHERN chased three wide to the top of the lane, and tired. COLTONSTHEADMIRAL broke a step slow, stayed in
range four wide for a half, and tired.

Footnotes
FOLEY SQUARE grabbed the early lead inside, rated along through moderate fractions, and widened through the stretch hand urged and shown the whip.
DARESCA alternated between the rail and the two-path for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and was up outside BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND for the place.
BENNY'S GIRLFRIEND chased the winner to the stretch, drifted out past the eighth-pole and was outfinished for second. CALLMESENORITA broke a step
slow, trailed early inside, swung four wide off the far turn, and made no late headway. CAPTURED LIGHT chased to the far turn, could not gain under
pressure approaching the stretch, and tired. IRISH THUNDER was no factor through a three-wide trip. TAYLOR'S FIRST brushed the left side of the gate
coming out a step slow, faltered into the far turn, and jogged in far behind.

in upper stretch, outkicked GRAN ETIQUETA through the furlong grounds and pulled clear. MARKISTAN was outsprinted early, and finished with good
energy on the far outside to get up for second. GRAN ETIQUETA saved ground throughout, loomed along the rail turning for home, could not go with FREE
TO FLY past the eighth-pole, and was overhauled for the place. LIL MISS HOTSHOT set the pace near the inside for a half-mile, and gave way between
horses in upper stretch. PANAREA pressed the pace outside LIL MISS HOTSHOT for a half-mile, and gave way into the lane. PATIENT DIGNA showed
speed two wide to the turn, and tired. GREY JAZMINE raced three to four wide, and was finished early.

Footnotes
TIZ THE DUDE was never far back, moved out three wide to lodge a bid turning for home, caught AWESOME BEACH from outside coming to the
sixteenth-pole and drove clear. WESTERLY WIND bumped with ARTIE'S LADY twice at the start, getting turned sideways the second time, was outrun
early, moved inside around the turn, came off the rail in deep stretch and was up outside AWESOME BEACH for second nearing the wire. AWESOME
BEACH bumped with BRO GUN at the start, set the pace inside, and weakened through the final furlong. UNIMPEACHED bumped with UPRISE at the
start, raced in striking range two to three wide, and lacked the needed late bid. NINJA saved ground outrun early, put in a run along the rail turning for home,
and finished up evenly. CHUCKY pressed AWESOME BEACH from outside, and gave way into the lane. CUATE was no factor. HANGAR ONE faded four
wide approaching the stretch. ARTIE'S LADY bumped with WESTERLY WIND twice at the start, and tired after a half. BRO GUN bumped with AWESOME
BEACH at the start, and was outrun. UPRISE bumped with UNIMPEACHED at the start, and was through early. SMOOTH LIKE SILK lost contact with the
field early, jogged in far behind, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
PATRICK'S LASS pressed SHE'S CLASSY from outside, wrested command in upper stretch, and dug in late to hold ROYAL HABIBI safe. ROYAL HABIBI
was ridden along behind the leaders on the turn, eased out three wide with aim into the stretch, could not reach the winner and was clearly second best.
SHE'S CLASSY crossed over with the lead after an alert break, got collared by PATRICK'S LASS after a half-mile, and weakened inside. MASHUGANA
was no factor inside. HOPE LADY stayed close two wide to the end of the turn, and faded. MAK HERO was always outrun. MISS ITALY was finished early
two wide.

Footnotes
ISADORABLE AIDA settled in midpack early, rallied through upper stretch, collared DIXIE PRINCESS from outside past the eighth-pole and drew clear, and
was all out to hang on. BAHAMA KITTEN was unhurried early inside, advanced coming off the far turn, bid through deep stretch and just missed outside the
top one. SWEET STORY swung four wide past the quarter-pole, and offered a mild response to get the show. SASSY JUSTICE was outrun inside to the
stretch, and passed tired horses. DIXIE PRINCESS set a pressured pace inside to the stretch, and weakened. SWEETLY MAID saved ground in range to
the stretch, and weakened through the final furlong. AVENIDA MANANA prompted the pace three wide to the stretch, and tired. NIGHT WATCH was no
factor three wide. HANNAH CATHERINE tired after a half-mile three wide. NOT NICE pressed the early pace between horses, and steadied along dropping
back under a hold through the far turn. TRILBY was never prominent, got pulled up just before the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
YOUCANTCATCHCURLIN steadied in tight between horses into the first turn, was outrun for six furlongs, came off the rail rallying through the furlong
grounds, and closed determinedly outside TOWN CLASSIC to get up in time. TOWN CLASSIC pressed the early pace outside GREEN MANSIONS and R
U LUCKY, dueled with the latter as the tempo quickened through the middle stages, edged away in deep stretch, but was run down in the final strides. R U
LUCKY argued the pace between horses for better than a half-mile, fought on inside TOWN CLASSIC around the far turn and into the stretch, and yielded
grudgingly late. DANVILLE saved ground throughout, and closed ground through deep stretch without threatening. REBELDE raced near the three-path
much of the way, and lacked a solid closing response. GREEN MANSIONS vied up front inside R U LUCKY and TOWN CLASSIC early, and gave way into
the far turn. MEADE reared up in the gate unseating the rider prior to the start, dropped far back after six furlongs, jogged in far behind, and walked off.

Footnotes
WALK UP MUSIC took closer order through the run up the backstretch, waited behind the leaders two wide a quarter-mile out, came clear through upper
stretch, collared JOE BENJAMIN from outside a sixteenth out and edged clear. UNPOPULAR OPINION saved ground in the second flight for six furlongs,
moved out in upper stretch, and finished well to be along for the place. JOE BENJAMIN pressed the pace outside MONETIZED, wrested command after six
furlongs, moved clear through the furlong grounds, but weakened in deep stretch. MAGICAL CAUSE raced near the three-path on the turns, and offered a
mild late response to get the last major share. MAJORITY RULES advanced to the far turn three then four wide, and tired after six furlongs. VASZAR
ACADEMY stayed close for six furlongs, lodged a mild bid outside JOE BENJAMIN turning for home, but faded past the eighth-pole. MY CHITU raced in the
second flight between horses early, and tired. SULEMAN raced four wide around the far turn, and could not reach serious contention. MONETIZED set the
pace toward the inside to the far turn, was overrun past the quarter-pole, and retreated.
