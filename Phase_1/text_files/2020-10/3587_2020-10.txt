Footnotes
TROPICAL TERROR settled at the rear of the field outside a rival, moved out four wide on the backstretch, came five wide into the lane, took over at the
eighth pole and cleared late. BUD KNIGHT broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, stalked inside then angled outside the leader, collared rival past the
five-sixteenths and gained command approaching the quarter pole, challenged from the outside and could not go on with the winner in the final furlong.
TABLE FOR TEN broke in and bumped rival at the start, chased in the two path then between rivals into the last turn, entered the stretch two wide and held
the show. BIG CITY BANE raced three wide around the clubhouse turn, remained off the rail to the far turn, was a bit tight between rivals while four wide
into the stretch, then flattened in the late stages. EL HUERFANO threw head and got pinched back between rivals leaving the gate, swung out around the
field and cleared, angled back to the inside and set the pace to the far turn, lost command nearing the quarter pole and gave way. PUSH THROUGH
unhurried in the early stages and moved to the inside, stayed along the fence to the lane then angled out at the three-sixteenths pole and faded.

Footnotes
SQUALOTORO in range early outside the top pair, went three wide into the turn, exited four wide, rallied outside the leading duo, battled with LUCKY RYAN
SEVEN through the late stages and edged rival. LUCKY RYAN SEVEN broke out, stalked from inside then moved up to duel with ACTING CAT into and
around the turn and into the stretch, put that rival away at the eighth pole then met the challenge from SQUALOTORO in the final furlong, fought gamely to
the wire and yielded grudingly. ACTING CAT set the pace early, dueled with inside rival around the turn and into the stretch, fought to the eighth pole but
proved no match in the final furlong. TWIRLING DERBY away quickly then dropped back off the pace, chased three wide into the lane, angled out in upper
stretch and showed a mild response. WITH DUE CAUSE off slow from the inside, traveled along the inside then two wide leaving the bend and never
threatened. MASTER RECOVERY entered the turn four wide then angled into the three path and could not rally. WILD CAT CANYON stumbled, lost path
and checked at the start, took the turn three then two wide and was never a factor. BALLET ROYALTY chased the top pair up the backstretch, saved
ground into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
UNICORN sped to the front and moved to the rail, responded when pressured around the far turn and into the stretch and held AUNT LUBIE at bay to the
wire. AUNT LUBIE forwardly placed behind the leader just off the inside, bid outside around the far turn and challenged through the stretch but lacked the
needed late kick to get by. SASSYSERB raced two wide then along the rail on the first turn, trailed the field through the early stages, took the second turn
two wide, split foes in the stretch and gained the show. AWESOME DRIVE pulled early then stalked between rivals to the stretch and lacked further
response. HOLLYWOOD GIRL stalked three deep to the stretch and failed to produce a bid. LEXINGTON GRACE (IRE) stalked the pace inside a pair of
rivals, cut the corner into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
PAPA TURF broke in then sped to the front, set the pace inside a trio of rivals, cleared around the turn, led through the lane and held safely. JAN'S
RESERVE brushed and shuffled back between runners leaving the gate, traveled four wide into the turn then five wide entering the stretch and finished with
a late rally. R CHA CHA stalked two wide then three wide into the lane and edged rival for the show. BLACK STORM stumbled a bit at the start, settled off
the pace, saved ground into the lane and missed the show. FABOZZI pressed the pace outside the leader, lost contact with the leader around the turn and
weakened in the drive. MORE HONOR forwardly placed four deep up the backstretch, lost ground into the bend, chased four wide to the stretch and
weakened. COUNTRY ROAD brushed from outside rival leaving the gate, traveled two wide into the turn, came out into the stretch and was never a factor.
RINESHAFT up close three deep early, dropped back around the turn, eased into the stretch and coasted across the wire, then walked off following the
race.

ONE BAD BOY set the pace inside, received some pressure on the backstretch, challenged around the far turn, roused into the lane, kicked clear in upper
stretch and held well in the closing moments. MAJESTIC EAGLE stalked the pace from inside, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole, finished well and was
gaining to the wire. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) in range early from the two path, went between foes near the half-mile, challenged ONE BAD BOY from
outside on the far turn, failed to match the winner in the lane and flattened in the final furlong. MURAD KHAN (FR) tracked two then three wide around the
first turn, stayed off the rail through the second bend and failed to respond when asked. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) traveled three wide through the first turn,
closed in on the leader three deep on the backstretch, dropped back around the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN WINDOW stalked the pace through the early stages, went between foes near the seven-sixteenths pole, waited for room around the bend,
angled in at the top of the lane, bid along the fence and overhauled foes. DESTINY'S JOURNEY vied between for command then dueled outside DESERT
SMOKE, inched away briefly around the second turn before being challenged again from outside, fought gamely to the eighth pole then yielded to the
winner. BOONESBORO BEAUTY raced five wide at the seven-eighths pole, advanced widest up the backstretch, bid four wide at the quarter pole and
flattened in the final sixteenth. SENORADIABLO hustled from the inside then pulled into the first turn, remained inside then lacked room from the
three-eighths pole to the quarter pole, tipped out into the two path and finished evenly. MAJESTIC DIVA attended the pace three deep, dropped back a bit
off the top pair but continued outside a pair of rivals, went three wide into the lane then angled out and weakened. SUPER KLAUS raced off the pace, came
off the second turn three to four wide, angled out in upper stretch and lacked rally. LOVE OF ART (IRE) tracked off the inside, entered the stretch three wide
and proved no menace. DESERT SMOKE sped to the front, vied for the lead inside then dueled with rival to the far turn, failed to keep up into the stretch
and folded. ATINA (ARG) chased off the rail, three wide into the lane and weakened.

right-handed urging and drew off in the final sixteenth. HEARTFULLOFSTARS off a bit slow to begin, traveled near the back of the pack along the inside,
moved a bit in the stretch and split foes late to earn the place. JAMMING EDDY broke well then stalked the top quarter, raced along the rail into the turn
then angled three wide, put in a mild bid at the top of the stretch but failed to kick on the winner and lost second in the closing moments. ITALIANO off a bit
slow to begin, chased from inside then moved up to challenge, gained the lead into the turn, dueled from inside through the bend, lost command into the
stretch and flattened out while still earning a minor award. APPRECIATED tracked off the inside, raced four wide then five wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. RAYRAY away quickly from the gate, attended the early pace, raced three wide into the turn, dropped back on the turn and came four wide into the
lane, then kept on through the final furlong. BIG SCOTT DADDY dropped back early, raced outside a rival then two wide into the stretch, asked in the lane
but never responded. DO NOT SWIPE LEFT showed early speed outside a trio of rivals, started to weaken around the turn, came off the bend three wide,
then tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MISS ADDIE PRAY settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide leaving the turn, then closed outside the leader to be up late. THIS TEA in range
early while outside a rival, took aim three wide into the lane, grabbed command in upper stretch, led through the final furlong but could not fend off the
winner. AWESOME ELLA unhurried in the beginning, raced two wide then angled to the rail nearing the far turn, moved back off the rail and came three
wide into the stretch, finished well and earned the show. WIND AND HOPE broke out, dueled from outside then stalked the leader, bid outside at the quarter
pole and led briefly in upper stretch, drifted to the inside mid-stretch and weakened late. LAKAYA came away awkwardly and bumped with inside rival,
swung out and raced ten wide at the top of the lane, then showed a mild response to improve position. NURSE GOODBODY lugged out early crossing over
the dirt, raced off the rail throughout, came out into the lane and raced eight wide in upper stretch, then failed to respond when called upon. VIA ANGELICA
traveled two wide into the clubhouse turn, went four wide into the lane, moved out further in upper stretch and lacked a rally. ACOUSTIC SHADOW dueled
for the lead from inside then moved clear, showed the way to the far turn, lost command in upper stretch and faded. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) forced out and
bumped rival at the start, angled to the inside, saved ground to the stretch then tipped out and failed to threaten. DISAPPEARING ACT stalked the pace
inside, got cued up into the far turn, lacked the needed response and faded in the drive.
