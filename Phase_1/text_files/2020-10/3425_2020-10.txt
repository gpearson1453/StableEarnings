DIALED IN ON ALICE mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off inside the final
furlong. HURRICANE AMIGO stalked the early pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then was no match for the winner in the late going
and held the place safe. JOEYVILLE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out late for clear
racing room and missed the place. GALICENO well placed and outside, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and evened
out. SHAENA BUE ran evenly. JUST A JOKER set the pace on the inside, shook clear into the turn, then weakened the final furlong. JOE FLASH improved
position. ROYAL ATTIRE loose prior to the start, was a brief factor, outside. STORMBIRD'S SONG was never involved. RELENTLESS ALBERT had a wide

Footnotes
CAN'T KATZ HER allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, made a steady gain,
edged ahead and held under steady pressure. LYNBROOKE mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a
steady gain and lacked the needed late kick. SMARTY SOCKS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into
the lane, angled out for clear racing room and closed well for the show. FROSTY LINZ bore out through the first turn, moved up two and three wide through
the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, gaining a short lead, then weakened late and held a share. BLUEBERRY DUDETTE never far back,
looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, was bumped, steadied and weakened. INHONOROFOWENJR well placed,
held position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, drifted in and faded. NEW CIRCLE passed tiring rivals, inside.
SHESAROCKSTARTOO sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. ABILIFY ran
evenly for three quarters, then had no rally. RIDOUT ROAD was no factor, inside. DUCHESS OF DUBLIN well placed and outside, faded through the
second turn. YOU CAN INCLUDE ME was never involved.
