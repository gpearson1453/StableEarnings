Footnotes
LAPIS STORM broke outward slightly, edged to a clear lead outside of LUCKY LORRETTA down the backstretch, set the pace while saving ground on the
turn and kept on under a drive in the lane. R U FORREAL was bumped between horses in the opening strides and taken to the rear, saved ground around
the turn, rallied under a drive inside into the lane, and stayed on inside. HELEN MAE'S SONG grazed the gate, tracked the leading pair two wide, took
closer order approaching the turn, tracked the leader two wide around the bend, was driven three wide in upper stretch but outfinished. LUCKY LORRETTA
tracked the pacesetter while saving ground down the backstretch and turn, continued her pursuit between horses from upper stretch as R U FORREAL
rallied inside her,, and weakened in the final sixteenth. DARLIN ROSIE broke inward and bumped R U FORREAL, settled midpack, chased in the two path
on the turn, and had no response under a drive in the lane. HEY HEY was in tight between horses in the opening strides, settled in second last, raced in the
three to four path on the turn, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
PRESENT OF HERO tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, continued under patient handling conceding some position while angling
to the inside after a half, came through split rivals just off the inside midstretch to bid along the rail in the final sixteenth and just struck the front nearing the
wire under firm right handed pressure. EYE ON THE FINISH was reserved off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, swung four wide racing
into upper stretch, steadily drew on terms with the leaders to strike the front nearing the wire but just missed. CALYPSO KEY tracked the leaders three deep
in second flight to the backstretch, continued in that path into upper stretch advancing on the pacesetter while exchanging some contact with AUIRIGA, then
continued three deep between foes to challenge for command late but was outkicked by the top pair. STORMY EMPIRE, in touch with a rival prompting the
pace in the opening half, pressed the issue racing into the far turn to edge forward racing into upper stretch but was collared leaving the sixteenth marker.
TEMPTATION EYES, reserved off the second flight along the inside racing to the far turn, couldn't produce a closing bid. AURIGA tracked just off the first
flight along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch while exchanging some contact with CALYPSO KEY and came up empty
late. TEARS FOR PAULA, urged along the rail pressing the pace into the backstretch, dueled to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DRIVER DAN sped to the lead between foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin a bit off the rail, was roused clear racing into the
lane and held IZZY IN A TIZZY on a safe margin under pressure. The latter angled inwards while being rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
saved ground on the far turn steadily gathering momentum and was making solid progress along the rail late. DEBONNAIRE DUDE, forwardly placed along
the rail stalking just inside the pacesetter, switched outside that rival racing into the lane while being urged to advance but had no late kick.
DANCINGINTODARK, reserved last while angling inwards, was held up while pulling a bit inside foes entering the backstretch, shifted out to split foes
nearing the lane but lacked the needed late bid. A SHEEN CAT, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pace racing to the far turn, gave way into the
lane. ROCKTHEPULPIT, caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and steadily faded on the far turn. BE
AN INSPIRATION, held up off rivals to the backstretch, offered no rally. OFF TO THE BEACH was caught in close quarters racing into the first turn, then
was held up entering the bend, settled between foes and lacked the needed late response. BERACUDA HEART tracked off the second flight along the
inside and faded into the far turn. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE, caught in close quarters racing three deep between foes into the first turn, steadied off rivals
nearing the backstretch and faded early. TO THE BANK proved no factor.

Footnotes
KATIE M'LADY, momentarily reluctant to load, sped to the lead just off the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn
and held sway through the stretch under steady handling. READY AT MIDNIGHT angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane while being urged to advance and edged a rival for the place honors while no match.
SCENT OF SUCCESS was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, angled to the inside while continuing in pursuit of
the leader racing into the lane and just missed for second. MPEMBA tracked off the second flight three wide while held up momentarily avoiding some traffic
on the first turn, was prompted to advance three deep on the far turn and continued evenly between foes to late stages. BEE DANNA angled to the inside
racing to the first turn, was caught in tight quarters momentarily leaving the seven furlong marker tracking off the second flight, saved ground to upper
stretch but lacked the needed late kick. CHICHI RIVICHE was rated off the second flight to the backstretch, angled in on the far turn and continued evenly.
JOAN'S WAY angled inwards while pulling her way between foes into the first turn, was steadied in close quarters midway through that bend, shifted outside
foes on the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and came up empty into the lane. SHE'S MY RIDE tracked the leaders as part of the
second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, made some brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but proved empty in the drive. UNIQUE GIRL
settled along the inside early and failed to menace. TIZ A QUEEN hesitated at the start to break well behind the field, raced wide into upper stretch and was
never a threat. DARE TO HOPE dropped out early.

Footnotes
SKYCRAFT settled at the rear, was pushed along and took closer order in the four path on the far turn, swung toward the center of the track in upper
stretch, sustained his rally under a drive, led near the sixteenths and was ridden clear.. DOMIKATE chased three wide through the clubhouse turn, settled at
the rear of the main group down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn, rallied three wide in the lane but was outfinished by the winner.
HAMAZING VISION disputed the pace inside of LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS until proving no match for the closers in the final sixteenth of a mile.
LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS dueled outside of HAMAZING VISION, was caught with a sixteenth of a mile remaining, and flattened out. MIAS MOONBEAM
raced at the inside of the chasing flight on the clubhouse turn, tracked the dueling pair down the backstretch, continued his pursuit in the four path on the far
turn, but could not find enough in the lane. RIO SECO tracked the dueling pair through the clubhouse turn, chased two wide down the backstretch, raced
toward the rear in the three path on the far turn and never mustered a rally. ANTRIM'S GIANT raced between horses into the clubhouse turn, began to drop
away near the seven eighths while appearing uncomfortable, trailed into the backstretch, pulled up past the five eighths, and was vanned off.

first flight, shifted in nearing the turn stalking the leaders, was urged to split foes three deep leaving midstretch and was just outkicked by the top pair.
STORMIN EL PRADO, urged along the inside pressing pace, edged forward racing into the lane, drifted out nearing midstretch carrying out several rivals
and faltered late. LIBERAL LUNACY, urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn, was carried out leaving midstretch and gave out. CREAL
WONDER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in late stages. TAKE ME UP BRADY, urged
to forward placing three wide prompting the leaders into the turn, was carried out leaving midstretch and gave way. SHANGHAI POINT, held up last, angled
inside, saved ground on the turn, shifted six wide racing through the stretch but had no late kick. SAMURAI MIKE tracked the leaders three wide between
foes into the turn, was fanned wide into the lane and had no rally. RIV dropped out early.

Footnotes
FRONTANA settled near the rear three wide, began to improve when urged three wide on the turn, sustained his rally four wide in the lane and got up in
time. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER was hard urged for early speed, disputed the pace inside foes early, continued to set a pressured pace through the turn,
shook clear in the lane but was caught. FASCILITATOR chased midfield, raced in the three path on the turn, rallied under a drive three wide in the lane but
was outkicked. PUBLIC SAFETY settled at the rear, improved in the four to five path on the turn, rallied five wide in the lane, and gained with good interest
to the wire. MIND TRAPPE tracked the leading flight early, was urged three wide on the turn, continued under a drive between horses in the lane, but
weakened in the final furlong. AMERICAN HERITAGE tracked the leading flight outside of MIND TRAPPE early, was pushed along to keep the leaders in
his sights into the turn, raced between horses around the bend, proved no match for the leader into the lane and flattened out. ASTRONAUT OSCAR
disputed the early pace between horses, began to lose position approaching the half mile mark, chased inside on the turn, and came up empty in the lane
while still racing inside. ONE WAY HOME chased outside of FASCILITATOR early, weakened while driven in the three to four path on the turn, and was no
further factor in the lane. PYSER'S ORB was grazed by MEXICO MEMORIES in the opening strides, disputed the early pace three wide, continued to press
outside RICHIESGOTSWAGGER on the turn, and emptied out from the five sixteenths. MEXICO MEMORIES broke out and grazed PYSER'S ORB in the
opening strides, settled near the rear between horses, continued to race three wide at the rear on the turn, and was allowed to trail home while never hard
urged.

Footnotes
ZANFORCE bobbled at the start, was quickly righted, then angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin just off the rail into the backstretch, was
headed between calls after a half, continued to dispute the pace inside a rival into the far turn regaining the advantage, went clear racing into upper stretch
and just maintained the advantage to the end under left handed pressure. CALL THE COLONEL, held up avoiding close quarters along the inside racing to
the backstretch, shifted out after a half, steadily gained position three wide between foes racing through the far turn and continued willingly to the end to
close the gap. OGEE'S EKATI settled between foes in the last flight early, advanced four wide on the far turn to upper stretch and continued well enough to
prevail for a share. HIDE THE EVIDENCE, reserved well off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far
turn, then angled four wide in the closing stages to gain some position. TOUCH 'EM UP settled last to the backstretch and passed only tiring rivals.
SPEARED, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, pressed the issue gaining a brief advantage nearing the far turn but gave way into the
lane. FORGOT TO FORGET, forwardly placed three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, angled in nearing the far turn and steadily faded. FORT
COMMANDER tracked the leaders from out of striking distance off the inside to the backstretch and faded nearing the lane. LANDING GEAR, urged to brief
contention four wide racing to the backstretch, gave way after a half. PETEIZUM angled to the rail in the opening stages, was steadied off the eventual
winner racing into the first turn, tracked the leaders along the inside for a half and came up empty entering the far turn.
