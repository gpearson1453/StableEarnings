NO SUGAR NO CREAM angled to the inside to rate a clear lead, came under pressure midway on the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement
to hold on. EXTRAVAGANT MISS gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, then dug in for second past the sixteenth
pole and was gaining on the winner in a strong finish. RUMOURIST raced well off the early pace then bid at the rail into the turn, briefly occupied second
past the eighth pole but ultimately settled for third. SCORE ONE MORE chased the pace toward the inside, raced in the three path of the turn but drifted
toward the head of the lane and showed little further. TRACI'S GIRL chased the pace and raced near the rail on the turn, drifted a bit into the lane then
flattened inside the eighth pole. HIDE was not a factor. J C THE DESTROYER chased the pace outside and raced in the six path of the turn.

BLACK CANDY raced off the pace and off the rail, rallied from the eighth pole to take over inside the sixteenth and drew away later yards. EASTBOUND N
DOWN angled in to rate a slim lead well off the rail, kept the advantage nearest the inside through the turn but was caught mid-stretch, though, able to hold
on for second. PAGAN SMART raced with the early pace, remained close off the rail through the turn and was gaining on the pace-setter. TWOBITSARIDE
raced well off the pace and well off the rail and passed rivals in an even finish. ORILEYS TYPHOON chased the pace down the backstretch, raced in the
five path of the turn and showed little more. PLEASANT LEE gave chase and rounded the turn about the six path.

toward contention and entered the first turn about the five path, moved to even terms three wide at the nine sixteenths pole then gave chase nearing the
three eighths, rounded the far turn four wide and dug in to recover third later yards. BLACK STEEL raced with the pace two deep while between horses then
gave chase from the three eighths pole, but dropped back midway on the far turn and flattened stride inside the eighth pole. MEAN TO AMEND raced off the

Footnotes
THUNDERTURTLE raced well off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead two
deep nearing the quarter, contested the edge through the far turn and dug in determinedly to ward off the game stretch effort of WAKES UP HAPPY, who
rated a slim lead inside then came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught approaching the quarter, raced at a close disadvantage
nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to deep stretch before ceding; reluctantly. BEYOND PRETTY stalked the earlier pace inside then picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded at the rail on the far turn. UAINTSEENMECRAZYET saved ground racing well back then bid
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened into the lane. HARMONIC THUNDER settled back off the rail early on
then eased out into the backstretch, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the seven path of the far turn and passed rivals outside.
POSTINO'S QUEST raced well off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch. RAINBOW RIVER stalked the early pace about the three
path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. SHEZALEMONDROPKID stalked the early pace about the
four path then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, though, faded into the far turn. PIMM AND PROPER settled off the pace in the three and four
paths and showed little response through the backstretch. LINEA VERDE raced well off the pace and mostly saved ground.

Footnotes
BIRD TRAFFIC raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn,
angled to the four path to come between horses leaving the turn and dug in to get up the final yards. SUPER TWENTY FIVE broke awkwardly and outward
to make contact with Katie's Bayou then rated a short lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail
on the far turn but was caught in the final yards. BRING ME ANSWERS settled off the pace inside the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole,
was eased to the five path through the far turn, dug in to take third later yards and finished well. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled off the pace in the two
and three paths the first turn then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, though, flattened stride the final
sixteenth. RAVENEL stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and weakened. KIM'S PET saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the backstretch.
FACEY'S SISTER raced well back in the four and five paths. KATIE'S BAYOU was bumped at the break, raced in the five path the first turn and never
factored.

Footnotes
GIO DUDE rounded the opening turn in the three path and stalked from the seven eighths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the seven sixteenths
pole and was pressured from that point, raced clear midway on the far turn and held well under steady handling. KING MAURO stalked the early pace off
the rail and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, challenged approaching the five sixteenths, but dropped back midway on
the far turn and was no match in the stretch. LASER LOOP raced well back from early contention and left the second turn outside, started a bid approaching
the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. HOT N SPICY LOVE settled off the pace
and off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn and showed little further. ENVISION SUCCESS
saved early ground then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five and six paths and showed little more. THE WAYNE FACTOR
raced in the four path the first turn and bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. STROLLANOTHERTIME set the
pace inside, was caught nearing the seven sixteenths pole and promptly faded. CHARITABLE SPENNY stumbled and lost his rider leaving the gate. The
Stewards conducted an inquiry before declaring this race official.

Footnotes
BRIGINTINE ISLAND was hustled four wide through the front stretch to stalk into the first turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole then took the lead
two deep at the quarter and dug in under all out encouragement to just last. LIAM'S LOOKOUT settled off the early pace about the four path, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, drifted to the six path toward the head of the lane, but dug in when straightened away and
just missed the nod. MALIBU SPLASH raced well off the earlier pace in the three and four paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the five path then dueled for third. LANESBOROUGH settled close inside the first turn then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted into the lane then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. TECHNIQUE ONLY rated the pace inside, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail at the quarter and started to fade. HOT POSSEBILITY saved ground well off the pace,
showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the three path. IT'SMYINTENSION came away awkwardly and raced well
back. GANDARI stalked the pace off the rail the opening turn then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, though faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
DEVELIN' ROSE took over at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and dug in under steady stretch
encouragement to hold on well. MOJO MATTERS came away sharply then pressured the pace from the half mile pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two
deep on the turn but couldn't close the gap in the lane. BASKET GIRL chased the pace just off the rail, raced in range of the lead three wide on the turn and
finished evenly. SHARP'S MISSION gave early chase inside then angled to the four path in the upper stretch and finished evenly. HOPE FOR THEMONEY
stalked the pace, started a bid at the five sixteenths pole and rounded the turn near the rail but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. COPELANQUIKZIP
gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened. ACROSS AMERICA chased outside and never factored. QUITE SUGGESTIVE hesitated
then lunged from the gate and gave only distant chase outside.
