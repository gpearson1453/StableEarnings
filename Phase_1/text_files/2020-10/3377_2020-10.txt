KUDA HURAA contested the pace inside LA CROIX, saved ground on the turn, edged away to mid stretch and held on stubbornly. GIFTY chased the
leaders to the turn, got fanned out three then four wide to the stretch and closed steadily but too late. LA CROIX attended the pace outside the winner, was
two then three wide to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly. COMMISSIONESS chased the leaders to the turn, saved ground to the
stretch then lacked the needed late response. TIBBY GEE was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch and also did not rally.
SHAWNEE PASS had no speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TERRIBLE TED had good speed and dueled outside the runnerup while two wide to the stretch, inched away from ALL AMERICAN HERO to mid stretch
and held determinedly. ALL AMERICAN HERO also was dueling inside the winner and saving ground to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch then had
enough of a cushion to hold second. KNOWN hustled early but was void of speed, raced three wide to the stretch and closed ground belatedly. OPERA
GHOST was outsprinted to the turn, came three wide to the stretch and closed a gap without threatening. CHIEF EAGLE EYE had no speed, raced in the
two path on the turn but came up empty in the drive. GRAND SIERRA was chasing the top two while three wide to the stretch then weakened. ARC
NATION also chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then gave way.

TACOFLAVOREDKISSES had no speed, settled to the half, was asked for more four wide and got on terms on the second turn, responded when set down
for the drive and outbattled I'M SO ANNA for the win. I'M SO ANNA chased the pace to the second turn, rallied three wide between rivals, got bumped in the
rear quarters by MY FATHER FOOTSTEP at the quarter pole, dug in determinedly in the final furlong but had to settle for an easy second. MY FATHER
FOOTSTEP attended the pace to the second turn, was two wide between rivals then stepped out slightly nearing the quarter pole, took up and bumped I'M
SO ANNA at the quarter pole, was outrun in the drive but gamely got the show. DO YOU HEAR THAT had good speed, set the pace from the rail to the
second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and gave way. MANDO took back on the first turn and showed little. The stewards conducted an inquiry and the
jockey on MY FATHER FOOTSTEP lodged an objection for alleged interference at the quarter pole but in a unanimous decision then stewards made no
change.

TRISTRAM SPEAKER broke alertly, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded to prevail. HYDROGEN stalked the winner from the rail to
the stretch, had room inside the latter but could not make an impact while besting the others. CONTINENTAL UNION got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned
four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. LITTLE JOHN chased the pace two wide to the stretch, was outrun to mid stretch and did not
rally. SATANTA tracked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty. BLAISIN' EAMON pressed

Footnotes
BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) went right to the front, set all the pace inside, was off the rail into the stretch then responded and held driving. RATE FOR ME
stalked the winner to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly for second. THORN HILL CAT chased the pace to the second turn,
was three then four wide to the stretch and could not offer the needed late response. LOVENSEEK broke inward and forced FANTASTIC ARAGORN to
take up, stalked the leader to the half, was two then three wide to the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. IRON ALEX got outsprinted to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response. THE REF had no speed, raced three wide on the far turn
and was not a factor. FANTASTIC ARAGORN was crowded by LOVENSEEK at the start, took up and trailed throughout.

ROMAN RUSH took back from dueling SADDLE BAR early, pressed that one from the rail to the stretch then rallied to the front in mid stretch and held
determinedly. MIDNIGHT DESTINY chased the leader to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then finished steadily for the place. RIDEO was also
chasing to the turn, followed MIDNIGHT DESTINY into the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then was outfinished. AWESOME SILVER stalked the
leader to the turn, was off the rail to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. UNPOSSIBLE pressed the pace three wide to the stretch but
was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. SADDLE BAR hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then was collared by the winner
in mid stretch and tired.

driving. SOBERANO (FR) trailed to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then shifted widest and closed fast. UBER STAR was settled for a
half mile, bid three wide and rallied to duel for the lead to mid stretch then was outfinished for the win and tagged for second. SUNNY SPOT hopped in the
air at the start, recovered and settled for a half mile, was two wide on the second turn, rallied to mid stretch then could not sustain the needed response.
UNLAWFUL ACT was five wide to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, shifted out and was making up ground belatedly.
KING EDDIE sped to a long lead to the half mile pole then was tiring, got overtaken on the second turn and finished evenly. KLONDIKE CREEK was also
settled to the second turn, rallied four wide to engage for the lead to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. OH BE ONE had no speed, was
two wide on the second turn but failed to threaten in the drive. MY LUCKY MARK got outsprinted for a half mile, rallied inside into the second turn to get the
lead briefly but was outkicked to mid stretch and gave way.
