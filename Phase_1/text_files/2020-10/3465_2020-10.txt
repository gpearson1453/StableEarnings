Footnotes
BRIBERY rated just off the pace about the three path then stalked into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced at a close
disadvantage on the far turn, but closed to the front mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. MAID THE JOURNEY rated a short lead inside then
came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch, but dug in to just last
in second. MOSS BOSS stalked the earlier pace in the two and three paths then started a four wide bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and was gaining on second late. MALIBU CIRCLE stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
raced close off the rail through the far turn but steadied at the heels of Maid The Journey in the upper stretch, altered course from that point, though
flattened stride. FOR ARTS SAKE steadied at the start and raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. STAY IN raced well back early and left the first turn outside, made a bid nearing
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened. ONE BAD KAT saved ground well off the pace and showed little response
through the backstretch.

JUBA DID IT rated a clear lead through the backstretch then steadily widened to win handily. JUBA'S FANCY gave chase and raced just off the rail on the
turn, was carried out toward the head of the lane but came along to take second later yards. CANDY INVASION chased the pace inside then dueled through
the final furlong for third. IN THE GOSPEL gave chase inside then flattened past the eighth pole. JUBA EARLY rounded the turn off the rail and showed little
in the lane. STRINGFELLA came away awkwardly then picked up the chase, drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened. PONTICELLO gave chase
and rounded the turn in the five and six paths. MISTER DEEKS dropped well back. ALLOVERBUTTHECRYIN came away a step slow and was sluggish
getting into stride, and consequently, raced well back.

pace inside, raced off the rail on the turn then finished well while just missing third. RUNNING PRAYERS gave chase and rounded the turn about the six
path then finished well outside. MOON OVER VICTORIA saved ground on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. LIZZIE'S LAST was not a factor.

HENDAYA rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole and was steadily encouraged through the lane to hold on.
ECLIPTICALS VISKI stalked the winner then gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dueled for second later yards.
PRINCESS PENELOPE settled just off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in
the stretch duel for second. SHALL WE DANCE saved early ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, left the turn
about the five path, then finished evenly. SUNFLOWER ROSE stalked the pace from the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
raced in the four path of the far turn, though, showed little in the lane. JEAN GREY raced outside into the backstretch then gave chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the seven path and flattened stride. CAROLINA BAMBINA settled off the pace in the four and five paths and left the first
turn outside, bid only mildly and raced in the eight path of the far turn. TORNERO entered the first turn in the four path then picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, but weakened in the six path of the far turn. FIFTEEN K broke awkwardly, showed no response on the backstretch and was not
encouraged.

Footnotes
CAPE LOOKOUT rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole and widened through the far turn then held well under steady
stretch handling. JACK STRAIGHT stalked off the rail then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, proved no match
down the lane and had to settle for second. SINGANOTHERSONG steadied at the start then settled just off the early pace, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole but dropped back on the far turn and flattened stride. MY EMINENCE lunged at the break and raced six wide the opening turn, left the
turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, then flattened stride about the five path of the far turn. START FROM SCRATCH raced off
the early pace about the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but flattened stride in the three path of the far turn. TIZEZZY raced five wide
the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch then saved ground on the far turn. UNION GRACE was unprepared for the break and dropped
well back saving ground the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but flattened stride about the six path
of the far turn. HOBE SOUND, WHO WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER IN THIS RACE, BROKE THROUGH THE GATE AT THE MOMENT THE GATES
OPENED, AND CONSEQUENTLY, WAS DETAINED IN THE GATE, THE RIDER LOST HIS IRONS MOMENTARILY, THOUGH DID PERFORM AND
FINISHED ONE AND ONE QUARTER LENGTHS BEHIND UNION GRACE. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CONDUCTED BEFORE THIS DECISION WAS
MADE.

Footnotes
DAH PHILLY raced in the four path the first turn and settled off the pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead four wide past the five
sixteenths pole, contested the edge two deep on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane. IM A TRICKY ONE raced well back in the three and
four paths the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and closed for second the final yards. SAINTE
THERESE settled just off the pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn then flattened
out the final sixteenth. EARNED THE SHOT rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, raced in the seven path of the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. LADY'S CORK raced off the pace and off the rail early on,
bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. SWEET TWEET settled off the pace,
bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the six path then flattened stride the final furlong. TAVRIDA showed little response
through the backstretch. BRASS MAGNOLIA raced well back off the rail and was never a factor. VINTAGE GIN stalked the early pace inside and was at
even terms with GLORIOUS MYSTERY into the backstretch, dueled to a slim brief lead nearing the five sixteenths pole but was caught leaving the pole and
faded at the rail from the mid point of the far turn, while the latter of whom, was hustled to the lead and angled to the inside to show the way early, however,
dueled at even terms past the half mile, dropped back from between horses leaving the five sixteenths and faded readily at the rail on the far turn.
