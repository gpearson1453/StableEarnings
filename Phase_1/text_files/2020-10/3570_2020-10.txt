DISTILLED SPIRIT dueled inside for the early lead, dueled with HIGHWAYTWENTYSEVEN on the turn, drifted well off the inside, shook free in upper
stretch and edged away, driving. PASCAL CHANT stalked outside, chased three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied outside for
second. RICARDITO raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, rallied on the rail and got up at the wire for third. HIGHWAYTWENTYSEVEN dueled
outside a rival, dueled with the winner on the turn, weakened and just missed for third. SIR HIGGINS was off a bit slow, raced three wide early, continued
three wide on the turn and gained mildly. FLEET WARRIOR chased four wide early, raced between rivals on the turn, lacked a winning bid and finished
