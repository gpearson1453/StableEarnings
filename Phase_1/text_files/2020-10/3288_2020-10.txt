Footnotes
BLUEBIRD DAY stalked the pace on the outside, shook clear through the turn, held that margin the the final furlong, then held under steady pressure to
finish on equal terms with DON'T MAKE ME BEG. DON'T MAKE ME BEG well placed and outside, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane, made a steady gain to finish on equal terms with BLUEBIRD DAY. TWILA MAE fractious in the gate, saved ground through the turn, came
through inside of rivals, made a steady gain and closed willingly. RIDGELYSREDHOT mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four
wide into the lane and evened out. SUNNYMEDE DREAM chased the pace on the inside, angled out to looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that
path into the lane and weakened in the drive. SUGAR BRITCHES sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the turn,
then faded in the stretch. SOLDAT THE TOP was no factor. TAKE A RIP broke out at the start, looped up three and four wide through the turn and had no
rally. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION THE FINISH MARGIN ARE ESTIMATED BY EQUIBASE. PER RULING FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA
RACING COMMISSION, DON'T MAKE ME BEG WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

edged up for the place. VISKI JONES allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady
gain and missed the place. WHISTLE ME HOME allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and
got up for a share to finish on equal terms with THAT'S BUCKBEAK. THAT'S BUCKBEAK well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the
second turn, came through on that path into the lane, weakened late and finished on equal terms with WHISTLE ME HOME. ENGLISH LAUGHTER allowed
to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out. DRIFTWOOD set the pace off the rail, drew off
