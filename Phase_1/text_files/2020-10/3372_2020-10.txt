Footnotes
JUXTAPOSE broke alertly then settled off the pace, closed two-wide on the turn, swept to the lead mid stretch and widened well in hand. BELLA FIGURA
stalked the pace, was roused two-wide late turn, angled out mid stretch and finished gamely. ROSEBUD'S HOPE forced the pace, was three-wide on the
turn, chased four-wide approaching the stretch, bid early in the straightaway and edged to a short lead, was passed mid stretch and chased to the end.
CLOSE IMAGE stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch, angled out mid stretch but her rally stalled and she finished evenly. STOP WHO'S
THAT sprinted to a clear early lead, was soon under pressure from ROSEBUD'S HOPE, yielded to that one upper stretch and evened out. DESERT POEM
broke a bit outwards and was steadied, raced from off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn but failed to menace.

LUCKY SCORE forced the pace, bid early turn, dueled to the end and prevailed late under a drive. MAGIC SPIN was off a step slowly but had speed and
moved up to take command, dueled on the turn and battled to the end but was outfinished. ARTIE'S STORM got away slowly, closed on the backstretch,
raced raced two-wide in mid pack on the turn, chased into the stretch, was herded in behind a rival briefly then closed late. TRAGICALLY QUEWICK
pressed the pace three-wide, chased into the stretch, leaned in on a rival briefly then chased to the end. STREET TOLL settled off the pace, closed
three-wide on the turn, was blocked in the stretch but despite his rider's efforts would not alter course to the outside but offered a late run once no longer
behind the competition. LONGANDSHORTOFIT settled off the pace, was hustled angling inward from four to two-wide through the turn but lacked a closing
response.

Footnotes
DASHI chased the open length leader down the backside, moved up gradually to tackle that one late on the turn, had the lead outside the eighth pole and
drew off to a comfortable win. ELITE SPEED led quickly, had a clear advantage until the winner advanced to challenge late on the turn, battled on to the
eighth pole but was no match, a clear second best. L'AMOUR TOUJOURS off the pace and along the inside down the backstretch, came rail to three wide
around the turn and angled out in upper stretch, doing her best running late to garner the show spot. HONEY GIRL was taken back early, came along the
rail around the turn but could only inch up late for a minor award while far back of the top three. SAMANTHA'S JOY was mid pack and wide chasing early,
came two to three wide on the turn and stayed on evenly down to the sixteenth pole when eased in from there, noticeably off, and was taken away in a van
after finishing. QUEEN ANDHER COURT dropped back to trail while two to three wide around the turn, closing mildly down the stretch without threatening.
QUEEN BEACH chased the open length leader outside the eventual winner, held a clear third in upper stretch but weakened in the final furlong.
BEARTHESTORM broke in at the start and trailed the field by a good margin, rushed around three to five wide on the turn to get into mid pack but her rally
stalled and she retreated back to last in the stretch.

Footnotes
MASTER SPY was eased to a short early lead, raced clear on the turn then held sway under a drive. THREEFIFTYSEVEN was close early, pressed the
pace two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, launched an all out charge but couldn't close the gap. GIANT WATERS, bumped at the outset, stalked
the early pace, was shuffled back on the turn, angled out upper stretch and chased to the end. BEYOND MY DREAMS settled in mid pack, came three-wide
through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and finished under a determined drive. CARPE HORSESHOE settled in mid pack, came two-wide3
through the turn, chased into the stretch but finished evenly. CREDIT RIVER broke inward and bumped GIANT WATERS, forced the early pace, stalked on
the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. DRAGON'S BREW broke alertly, stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the turn but flattened
out in the final furlong. DOWNLOAD settled off the pace, closed a bit on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. TOO LEGIT was rank and under strong
restraint through the backstretch, settled and closed two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
SILVER SHERIFF, off slowly, pressed the pace, bid late turn, drove clear upper stretch and held sway under a drive. TRANQUILITY BASE inherited a short
lead early on the first turn, was headed on the backstretch, stalked from the rail, chased into the stretch and finished all out. SPRING EDITION settled off
the pace, came along the rail and two-wide through the far turn then rallied gamely inside. ROBUSTO bumped TAHANA and was steadied at the start,
veered out early turn so as not to run into HANDSOME LIKE ME, stalked five-wide to the far turn then moved inward to be three and four-wide, was hustled
into the stretch and finished gamely. SANDRETTI, off slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention.
TAHANA, bumped at the outset, forced the pace, dropped back nearing the far turn, was hustled two and three-wide but lacked a rally. LEGAL GUMP
hopped out of the gate, raced in striking range, closed along the rail on the backstretch, was hustled on the turn but had no response in the stretch.
HANDSOME LIKE ME led early while three-wide, veered out entering the first turn and lost the lead, regained command early backstretch and edged his
way over to the rail approaching the far turn, continued to set the pace but faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
DALLIAN M. was two wide and in mid pack early, came three to four wide to make it four in a line coming out of the far turn into the stretch, drove by the
pace survivor at the eighth pole and held safe to the wire. ENDORPHIN RUSH stalked and pressed the early leader throughout, wrestled a short and brief
lead away from rivals in upper stretch but the winner drove by at the eighth pole, clearly second best. NORTHERN CROSS sat along the rail in mid pack,
came off the inside to be between rivals and behind the four leaders at the quarter pole, brushed with a foe in upper stretch and gathered up to close well in
the final sixteenth for the show spot. KENTUCKY FAN was three wide into the first turn, settled in behind the leaders around the far turn and appeared
dangerous but when a seam appeared in mid stretch, a very mild run developed, a minor award the best she could produce. NAUGHTY MABEL was three
wide and off the pace on the first turn, moved up three to four wide to be in behind the leaders at the quarter pole, brushed with a rival in upper stretch and
levelled off in the final sixteenth. SAVED AT THE WIRE steadied along the inside into the first turn, came out to stalk and chase the leaders three wide
down the backside, bid for the front midway on the far turn but was outkicked in upper stretch, fading back the final furlong. DIVINE GENESIS cleared into
the first turn but was stalked and pressed throughout by the eventual place finisher, fading gradually from the quarter pole to the wire. GLINDA GOOD
WITCH trailed early before putting in a solid rail run to get into range midway on the second turn, but her rally stalled when failing to change leads down the
lane. CIGARILLO was three to two wide on the first turn and well back, put in a solid rally to look dangerous when two to four wide on the far turn but tired
from that exertion and levelled off in the final eighth mile. RACONTER from off the pace a mild rally developed on the far turn but could not reach contention.
TOURIST ATTRACTION swerved at the start and was off the pace throughout, dropping way back midway far turn and walked off.

Footnotes
HEAVENLY CURLIN raced in mid pack, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and got up late under a drive. CRYSTAL GLACIER
set a pressured pace, quickened on the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but failed to stave off the winner in the late stages. ENCHANTED LADY
was off slowly and settled in mid pack, chased four-wide on the far turn then finished under a determined drive. DAY DAYENU also got away slowly, closed
to mid pack, was hustled five-wide through the far turn the rallied gamely. CAIRA settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the final turn then
turned in a mild rally. MARCH OF DREAMS raced in mid pack, chased on the far turn then finished gamely through the stretch. COLDWATER settled off the
pace, chased four and five-wide on the far turn then closed outside rivals in the stretch. BAYOU BELLE stalked the pace while racing three-wide throughout,
was hustled on the far turn but tired in the stretch. NIIGON'S SPIN forced the issue, was under an all out drive to catch the leader late turn but flattened out
stretch. LAKE MANITOU, in mid pack early, trailed on the far turn but lacked a closing response.
