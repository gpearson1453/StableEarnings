Footnotes
SOLARITY sat in striking position while three wide, asked to quickened in the final turn, rallied gamely outside of RAIDER into the stretch and held under a
drive. RAIDER saved ground in the two path, split rivals entering the stretch then challenged SOLARITY through the stretch but lacked the needed late kick
to get by. HIDDEN GRACE quickly secured a rail position, showed the way through the backstretch from just off the rail, was headed at the top of the stretch
and weakened. SAVEITFORARAINYDAY saved early, chased four wide leaving the backstretch and yielded into the stretch.

SAMURAI GIRL stalked the early pacesetters from the three path, swept by the leaders into the stretch and drew off. BACKSEAT RIDER allowed to settle
early, went five wide leaving the backstretch then gained closer contention and got by late for place. PURE ROSE pressed the pace outside of CAN'T
TOUCH THIS, failed to match the winner in the lane and flattened in the final fulong. CAN'T TOUCH THIS broke sharply then quickly angled towards the
rail, contended the pace leaving the backstretch inside of PURE ROSE and left nothing in reserve for the drive. LITTLE ROSALYN lost irons leaving the
gate, chased five wide through the final turn and failed to menace. SAY IT'S NOT SO lugged out through the backstretch and was done early.

POWER OF INTENTION raced near the back of the pack while three wide, waited in traffic leaving the backstretch, found seam at the head of the stretch,
swept the lead and won going away. EVER TRUE vied inside leaving the chute, raced in close quarters inside, dropped back through the turn, angled out to
the four path near the three sixteenth pole and closed late for place. BEVOLUTION raced six wide leaving the chute, contested the pace from the four path,
gained a slim advantage into the lane and lacked a closing response. ADRIEN'S AURORA sat in range while five wide, fanned three wide into the far turn
and faded. STAR CZAR contended the early pace while two wide, was unable to move on with rivals and wilted. SILENT RHYTHM chased outside and had
no response when called upon. LUCKY LAST NIGHT saved ground inside early, drifted out leaving the backstretch and was eased.

SARAHS ELEGANCE vied three wide into the opening turn, prompted four wide outside of GEM OF INCEPTION, was roused at the head of the lane and
edged away late. GEM OF INCEPTION emerged the leader racing into the backstretch, set the pace while under a snug hold, gained an advantage through
the far turn, was collared at the head of the stretch and held on for place. FLY AWAY secured a rail position entering the opening turn, stalked inside, angled
out to the three path and lacked the rally needed. BLUES ROAR sat mid pack from the four path, chased leaving the backstretch and closed outside late.
PENNY A POINT was under a strong hold through the backstretch and passed tiring late. ANSTRUM saved to no avail inside. NU LEGACY chased outside
and had nothing left in reserve late. EMMA JEAN TOO broke slow and never reached contention.

Footnotes
MISTER HENRY LEE raced three wide through the opening turn, stalked the pacesetters through the backstretch, came under coaxing nearing the quarter
pole and prevailed under a drive. FINALLY GOTTCHA broke inward, vied outside into the first turn, dueled outside of RUCK to the three eighths pole,
gained a short lead then drifted inward at the sixteenth pole under right handed encouragement, rallied determinedly through the stretch and gave way in
the final yards. RUCK was quickest to the turn, dueled inside of FINALLY GOTTCHA, was unable to move on with rival in the far turn, lodged a rail bid then
steadied inside, angled out and held off a late drive for show. GEM ALTA allowed to settle outside, took closer order leaving the backstretch and raced
evenly through the stretch. GO WILD lagged early and bid belatedly. RAIDEN trailed the field and showed some interest late. DOUBLE BEAR chased inside
and tired. A. F. INDY hurried away then was taken back entering the opening turn, chased four wide through the backstretch and gave way. STEWARDS
INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of RUCK against the rider of
FINALLY GOTTCHA alleging interference near the sixteenth pole was upheld after review of the Stewards. FINALLY GOTTCHA was disqualified and
placed third for interference to RUCK.

Footnotes
ROMAN STEEL showed the way through the backstretch, responded to looming threat from ZBIG at the head of the stretch and held under a late drive. ITS
ALL ON SLEW rated off the pace while three wide, uncoiled an outside bid into the lane, was gaining late and missed. ZBIG chased the pace from the three
path, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole and lacked the kick needed. SMALL TOWN DUDE raced outside through the backstretch, drove five wide
into the lane and rallied steadily outside and missed. DJANGO UNREINED raced five wide leaving the chute, roused outside nearing the three sixteenth
pole and improved late. KING KLOVER raced mid pack, advanced along the rail under coaxing and flattened out. POCKET DIAL lacked a serious bid.
DITES MOI chased outside early and failed to threaten. POOR RUBEN offered little. FORMAL TUX no factor. GAME READY rated off the pace while four to
five wide and weakened. WOLSKI was unable to keep pace with the field and tired.
