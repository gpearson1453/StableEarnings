sixteenth pole and cleared the field in the final stages. HONORING MAJOR trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the lane
and was gaining in the late stages. HOUSE LIMIT tracked the pace early three wide then pressed the leader while two wide, took over and cleared the field

THE GRASS IS BLUE was bumped at the start and trailed the field early on, began a rally along the turn, was in the five path into the lane, rallied in the
stretch to complete circling the field, drove past the leaders and drew away in the final stages. COREY came in at the start, chased the pace early, made a
bid three wide nearing the lane, inched ahead near the eighth pole and was no match for the winner in the final stages. FEELING MISCHIEF pressed the
pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid near the eighth pole from the inside but weakened late in the drive. INJECT chased the pace early, was
in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. FLASH TOWN came out at the start, set the pace early, was on the
inside into the lane and faltered in the stretch run. YOGURT was never a threat. LADY GOLDSTART stumbled at the start and was through after a half.
TWICE SMITTEN was bumped and bothered at the start and was done early.

BODENHEIMER set the pace along the inside feeling mild pressure from GOOD WITH PEOPLE, drew clear passing the quarter pole, held a margin
through midstretch, then tired through the final furlong, but lasted. COWAN saved ground off of the pace, tipped three wide in upper stretch and produced a
rally, and was gaining on the leader through the late stages, but ran out of ground. AGOG trailed the field around the turn, swung six wide turning for home,
and stayed on well, but failed to threaten the top two. GOOD WITH PEOPLE stalked two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader passing the quarter
pole, and tired through the lane. RODERICK tracked from off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, but
lacked a rally and tired through the lane. PETIT VERDOT chased three wide, but weakened in upper stretch.

SMILEY SOBOTKA stalked three wide, came under a drive around the far turn, but produced a bid turning for home outside of WINDCRACKER, inched an
advantage with a furlong to run, and edged clear. WINDCRACKER stalked two wide forged an advantage with five sixteenths to go, cut the corner turning
for home to hold an advantage from SMILEY SOBOTKA, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, and gave way through the late stages. BUSINESS
MODEL saved ground from midpack around the far turn, inched closer down the backstretch to be in range of the lead while two wide and between horses
at the half mile pole, forged show through traffic turning for home, then stayed on well, but failed to catch WINDCRACKER for place. ANTIGRAVITY raced
off of the pace three to four wide around the first turn, then advanced five wide around the far turn, but leveled off through the lane. RAM stalked along the
inside, but was blocked and shuffled back behind the tiring early pace setter turning for home, shifted two wide in upper stretch, and kept on inside of foes.
REPO ROCKS brushed the gate at the start, got caught five wide around the first turn, advanced six wide around th far turn to be in range turning for home,
but flattened out. INVISIBLE WAR tracked from midpack four wide around the turns, but failed to make an impact. MUNQAD hopped at the start and trailed
early on, took the far turn in the three to four path before swinging six wide turning for home, but failed to threaten. PALAZZI saved ground off of the pace to
no avail. DIRECTIONAL cleared off while racing in the bit and a bit headstrong, got headed with five sixteenths to run, and weakened turning for home. JOE
MAN JOE was no factor. GOLD INCENSE got rank while far off of the pace in the latter half of the first turn, then was through into the far turn.

MUTASAABEQ hesitated at the sta, trailed the field in the three path around both turns, commenced a rally while circling the field eight wide turning for
home, produced a strong kick in upper stretch to bid outside of INTO THE SUNRISE passing the furlong pole, and drove clear in the late stages. ABARTA
was urged along racing in midpack two to three wide down the backstretch, but retreated between foes around the far turn to trail the field in upper stretch,
altered course to the eight path in midstretch, and produced a late rally outside of NATHAN DETROIT to achieve place in the late stages. NATHAN
DETROIT was bumped behind at the start, settled far off of the pace two wide, swung seven wide turning for home, but was outkicked by MUTASAABEQ in
upper stretch, needed correction to keep from lugging in and shied a bit as that foe cleared and crossed over, then stayed on through the lane inside of
ABARTA. INTO THE SUNRISE set the pace while staying a bit off of the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, but was overhauled by MUTASAABEQ
approaching the sixteenth pole, and yielded thereafter. ARREST ME RED stuttered a bit and was jostled between horses at the start, stalked along the
inside and from the pocket, then attempted a rail bid in upper stretch, but flattened out. PRIVATE ISLAND stumbled at the start, then raced far off of the
pace in about the two path, and stayed on along the inside through the stretch. SPYGLASS tracked from midpack six to five wide around the turns, but tired
in upper stretch. BARRISTER TOM was caught in the five path while prompting the pace into the first turn, shifted three wide around that bend, stalked
down the backstretch, but weakened four wide in upper stretch. BLAME THE BOOZE broke outwards, prompted the pace from the four path into the first
turn, shifted down to the two path around that bend, stalked down the backstretch, but weakened in midstretch. INDY TOURIST bumped an outer foe at the
start, tracked from midpack, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a rally, then was eased in midstrech. REALLY SLOW was off slow and bumped at
the start, then saved ground, but weakened.

VALIANCE stalked from midpack four to three wide around the first turn and outside of foes, inched closer to bid at the five sixteenths pole, battled outside
SHEDARESTHEDEVIL in upper stretch before forging an advantage approaching the furlong pole, drew clear from her inner counterpart passing that
marker, then met OLLIE'S CANDY bid in the late stages, but safely fended that foe off to the wire. OLLIE'S CANDY stalked along the inside, saved ground
around the turns, chased from behind the leaders into the lane, glided to the three path passing the three sixteenths pole, then produced a rally, grinded
away outside of VALIANCE to produce a late bid, but was fended off by that foe. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an
advantage in upper stretch, but was headed by VALIANCE approaching the furlong pole, and gave way thereafter. LADY KATE pressed the pace setter two
wide, but failed to keep pace with that foe and an outer bidding VALIANCE passing the five sixteenths pole, and tired. SARACOSA trailed early on, took the
far turn in the two path, but failed to factor. OUR SUPER FREAK raced off of the pace two wide, but never got involved and was outrun.

RUNAWAY ROCKETTE tracked from midpack in the two path, waited patiently for racing room while blocked in upper stretch, shied passing the furlong
pole while splitting foes, surged to produce a late bid, and got up approaching the wire. PICASSO COLLECTION broke inwards and was off slowly, trailed
the field, swung eight wide turning for home, and rallied outside of foes through the lane, but just missed on the wire while achieving place. TEMPER TIME
stalked the loose leader two wide around the first turn, inched closer as that foe rated back into the backstretch, vied after passing the five furlong pole,
forged an advantage at the furlong marker, but was caught in the final sixteenth, then was nailed on the wire for place. CANDACE O stalked two wide and
between horses, shifted three wide at the quarter pole, and commenced a grinding rally through the lane, but was outfinished by a pair of foes in the late
stages. ILLIOGAMI stalked three wide around the turns, was floated four wide at the quarter pole, then chased the leaders through the lane without making
a bid. INFORMATION MOSAIC tracked from midpack in the three path, advanced to striking range four wide around the far turn, but leveled off through the
lane and chased evenly. POINT OF INFINITY saved ground off of the pace, shifted seven wide in midstretch, and produced a mild kick. JOY IN GRACE
stalked along the inside, chased through upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. ESPERER (FR) cleared off while keen early on, then vied inside
of TEMPER TIME down the backstretch, but was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, and weakened late. TARA HILL (IRE) raced far off of the pace two
wide, then waited for racing room four wide and between horses around the far turn, but failed to factor. FADED MEMORIES was bumped and bobbled at
the start, then failed to factor. LATE FOR TAPS raced far off of the pace three to five wide, and failed to make an impact.
