Footnotes
GALATIANS stalked the pace under confident handling down the backstretch, moved up a bit two wide leaving the far turn, gained command in upper
stretch and held sway under encouragement. SILENT MALICE , along the inner rail down the backstretch and around the far turn, eased out to the three
path in upper stretch, advanced to mid stretch then finished evenly. ROYAL THUNDER , three deep the first turn, sprinted clear approaching the first turn,
angled in on the backstretch, set the pace along the rail, lost the advantage in upper stretch and weakened late. MY DANNY BOY showed brief speed on
the first turn, raced three wide on the backstretch and on the far turn then turned in an even effort. AMAZING CAT dropped back through the stretch and
walked off after being eased late. ONE MORE NIGHTCAP unseated his rider when stumbling at the break. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the
start but no action was taken.

SPLASHERSTOWN rushed between rivals soon after the start, sped clear nearing the half mile pole, set the pace two wide, opened up in upper stretch
then was fully extended to hold sway. KEEPER IN SPITE tracked inside, eased out for a clear run near mid stretch and finished gamely to gain. MAGIC IN
MALIBU rated in the clear and in range mid turn, angled five wide for the drive and rallied mildly. NO CON TESTA saved ground chasing the pace and
offered a mild late response. RAPIDASHQUEEN , four wide advancing into the turn, stalked past the five sixteenths and faded. MEGALOMANIA failed to
menace. RED HOT KITTEN stalked between rivals past the five sixteenths, steadied out of a tight spot in upper stretch, shifted in and faded. TALKS IN
HER SLEEP , three wide between foes past the half mile pole, dropped back. MERRY MAID , off slow when rank, was outrun.

ALPHA QUEUE stalked the pace, moved up three wide on the turn, gained command in upper stretch, opened up and was kept to pressure in the drive.
WHAT DOES IT TAKE bumped KING ALAN when bearing in at the break, raced four deep leaving the turn and rallied. KING ALAN , bumped leaving the
starting gate, prompted the pace outside FOLE'S NOTION, gained a short lead into the stretch then weakened through the final three sixteenths of a mile.
STRICTLY BUSINESS lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch, raced outside foes and passed tired ones. NO LAYING UP , along the inner
rail most of the trip, failed to rally. HUNTER JOE , along the inner rail around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. FOLE'S NOTION set a
pressured pace along the rail then retreated through the stretch. MEDAL OF WAR dropped back on the turn.

Footnotes
CERULEAN SPRINGS , taken to rate while saving ground, took closer order mid turn, eased out into the lane, shifted out further past the quarter pole,
closed determinedly under left handed rousing, sustained despite being floated out late and got up. BEYOND THE VICTORY took command early and set
the pace toward the inside, moved clear with a half mile to go, widened past the three eighths, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, continued gamely
despite drifting out but just could not contain the winner. DIXIE DRAWL stalked three wide, edged up between foes into the turn, shifted in approaching the
stretch and churned on. COLONEL JUAN settled off the rail, angled out mid turn, circled five wide into the stretch but could only muster up a mild kick.
WALK AWAY JOE , four wide advancing into the turn, came under pressure past the three eighths and faded between rivals. WINNING DRIVE prompted
the early pace outside BEYOND THE VICTORY, had that one get away leaving the half mile pole, chased into the stretch and faded late. BALLIVOR lagged
off the pace, angled in for the drive and failed to menace. AMATTEROFTIME bobbled at the break, saved ground while well back, angled out for the stretch
run but had no response.

Footnotes
BEAR FORCE WON edged up three deep past the half mile marker and garnered a stalking spot, tracked the duel mid turn, angled four wide into the lane,
closed under pressure to engage the leader with a furlong to go, wrested command heading to the sixteenth marker and drew out late. WHATS THE
CHANCES prompted the pace two to three wide outside the leader, moved to a slim lead mid turn, dueled into the lane, shook clear near the three
sixteenths, dug in when confronted in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final fifty yards. LITTLE BAY , bumped at the break, rated in mid
pack, moved up two wide into the lane, eased out but lacked a solid finish. JUSTACALLAWAY broke a step slow, raced off the pace and removed from the
rail, came four wide for the drive, drifted in when a bit green in mid stretch, corrected and closed between foes. LEADING MAN saved ground stalking the
leaders, was under pressure into the lane and faded in the final furlong. KING SHAWN stalked the early pace between rivals, shifted out four to five wide for
the drive but came up empty. DESPITE ODDS steadied at the break, moved up some then steadied past the five eighths, raced three wide into the lane,
altered in and kept trying. KUKULKAN sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, was joined into the turn, dueled past the five sixteenths, kept on
willingly to upper stretch then weakened. NOT TELLING gave early chase inside, remained inside into the lane and faded. DIVINE PROPORTION failed to
menace. NOBLE KING broke outward, was rated back early, raced wide around the turn and failed to menace. BEAN POLE eased back from between
rivals soon after the break, saved ground and retreated.

ON THE TOWN stalked the pace, raced three wide around the turn, gained command inside the three sixteenths pole and steadily drew away under smooth
hand riding. QUIET COMPANY , quickly clear, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead inside the three sixteenths pole and weakened. PALM READER ,
well placed in the two path between horses leaving the turn, swung out turning for home and gave way. SAFFRON SPIRIT prompted the pace outside
QUIET COMPANY for a half mile then weakened. PERFECT REINS , four deep around the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CASSEY'S GIRL was urged to the front, set the pace towards the inside, turned away a challenge leaving the three eighths, opened up under a solid drive
in mid stretch and held firm. WILLOW DRIVE rated three wide early, was under pressure circling into the lane, kept on willingly while on her left lead and got
up for second in the final strides. BROADWAY TROUPER prompted the pace outside the winner, lodged a mild bid leaving the far turn, pursued into the
lane and gave way grudgingly. WALK IT OUT NANNY saved ground in an even effort. CANDY CORNER , between rivals leaving the far turn, angled four
wide in upper stretch and offered a mild kick. CARROT CAKE was shuffled back near the five eighths, raced between runners leaving the far turn and
lacked a solid recovery. BOTTLE COURAGE lost ground four wide and failed to menace. MAY ON THE RUN , inside, gave way. INDEHERE broke slowly,
raced off the rail and was outrun.
