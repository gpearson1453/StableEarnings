Footnotes
GRANDMA JO vied outside early, fanned four wide through the turn, headed into the stretch and won driving. IMACLASSICMEN jostled away, vied while
three wide, gained a slim advantage inside at the quarter pole and was out finished. ALYS CODE sent for speed, steadied into the opening turn losing
ground and rallied mildly late. ARCHIEWAY fanned three wide through the first turn and lacked the rally needed. CUZ IM A DANCER lacked early speed
and lodged a late mild bid. DOCSLASTJOKE showed some early speed, saved ground through the turn, drifted out after the three sixteenth and failed to
improve through the drive. IPAYUBACKPROMISE last away and passed tiring. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL broke out and was outrun. BUFFALO BOYANN
offered little.

Footnotes
PARKING PERMIT saved ground in easy striking range, was asked to quicken approaching the quarter pole, got through on the rail to reach the front inside
of BIG AL'S VISION and MISSY'S PADRAIG and kicked clear under good handling. BIG AL'S VISION set the pace from off the rail to the stretch, could not
match strides with the winner and held the place. MISSY'S PADRAIG sat in striking position while four wide, loomed boldly nearing the quarter pole, rallied
determinedly outside of BIG AL'S VISION but was unable to get by and finished best of the others. HOLY MUCHACHO raced three wide through the
opening turn and lacked a closing response. HARRY'S HAMMER raced at the back of the pack and failed to threaten in drive. TRADER LYNN saved
ground and lacked a serious bid. KING KLOVER tracked outside and faded.

Footnotes
MARYAM never far back outside, angled in approaching the far turn, came four wide then rallied steadily getting by in time. PRINCESS ROBBI vied for the
early lead from the two path, gained a slim advantage through the final turn and was rundown in the final yards. TACTICAL EDGE sat off the pace inside,
launched a rail bid into the stretch but was out kicked. SNEAKY SISTER attended the pace while three wide, was unable to move on with PRINCESS
ROBBI then chased into the lane and lacked the kick needed. TROOPER JENNY pressed four wide early and came up empty in the drive. CAN'T TOUCH
THIS broke well outside, tracked five wide through the backstretch, dropped back leaving the final turn and faded through the stretch. INSTANT WYN
shuffled back entering the backstretch, trailed the field through the far turn and was outrun. NORTHERN BREEZE was not a factor.

Footnotes
MOLESLEY quickest leaving the chute then set the pace from just off the rail, responded to encouragement approaching the stretch drive and just held.
CYCLONE DAN allowed to settle early, split rivals at the head of the lane, angled out in the final sixteenth, was gaining on the leader with every stride and
just missed. NORM'S PLACE sat in range, fanned four wide turning for home, rallied outside and held show. OJO DEL MAR raced well off the pace inside,
shifted outside at the head of the stretch and closed late. STAPLETON brushed entering the backstretch, tracked inside through the far turn, lodged a rail
bid and raced evenly through stretch. TIMELESS TALES trailed the field and bid belatedly. VENDING MACHINE prompted the pace while three to four
wide, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and wilted in the stretch. LONG TIME DON drifted out into the backstretch brushing STAPLETON
then dropped back through the field, re-rallied at the three sixteenth pole then gave way.

Footnotes
GEM ALTA raced in second flight while four wide, went in pursuit of the leaders from the three eighths and wore down the leaders inching by. RUCK quickly
angled in to secure a rail position, sat in easy striking position inside, lost ground into the far turn, gained outside of FINALLY GOTTCHA and was narrowly
bested in the final strides. FINALLY GOTTCHA contested the early pace then led the field through the backstretch, drew clear two furlongs remaining, was
showing signs of tiring entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly inside. GO WILD saved ground from just off the rail, chased through the final turn and
launched a late bid. MISTER HENRY LEE stumbled after the break, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival late. OUR DANDY'S BOY chased in closest
pursuit early, was asked to quicken at the five sixteenth and failed to menace. A. F. INDY tracked in second flight and retired early.

the three sixteenth pole and offered a mild bid late. CHATTY GAL settled inside, swung out in the final turn and lacked a closing response. ROX STAR

Footnotes
SPANISH DIVA sat in easy striking position inside, swept the lead at the three sixteenth pole and widened with a few late reminders. LETTUCE sent for
speed from just off the rail, edged away leaving the backstretch, was quickly overtaken with a furlong and half remaining and finished second best.
CLASSIC TARTAN tracked outside through the backstretch, fanned three wide into the far turn, rallied mildly into stretch and held on for show. STEAL A
KISS veered out leaving the backstretch, advanced outside and lacked the rally needed. PUDDLES saved ground inside, lacked a response under urging
and flattened out. SOPHIE MCTROPHY away well, chased inside and faded gradually under encouragement. ROLL WITH ME showed little. SEDITION
offered a late bid and failed to menace. IBROX GIRL never reached contention. HI HO PICOLO sat just off the pace while four wide and was done early.
