finished with good energy. BAVARIA pressed outside the winner in the three path to the stretch then weakened. SHEPHERD'S WILL broke slowly, moved
to press inside the winner then weakened. CRYPT had position four wide to the stretch then tired. MISTER ARANGUIZ was outrun. NOTORIOUS REY

Footnotes
TALLULAH DARLING was fractious in the gate, steadied along the rail behind the leaders early on the turn, came out into the four path, rallied to the front
entering the stretch, drew clear then lasted. LIGHT MY PATH lagged early, came out two wide for room nearing the stretch while rallying, continued to rally
between rivals through the lane and closed a gap in the final yards. REIN SUPREME bobbled a stride out of the gate, was slow early, rallied the four path
around the turn, moved closer in early stretch but lacked a strong closing response. AMERICAN ALI showed speed from the outset, steadied between foes
midway on the backstretch, took to the outside, gave her best outside the early leader nearing the quarter pole then stopped in the lane. GIVEN ACHANCE
made the early pace along the rail and was finished after a half. VIBRANT GINGER moved to a clear lead from the outside midway on the backstretch,
angled in, stayed out from the rail around the turn while in control for just over a half then stopped.

Footnotes
CHRISATUDE bobbled leaving the gate, moved to press outside the early leader, raced the three path around the turn, drew clear before five furlongs,
remained clear into deep stretch and lasted. NAUGHTY PRINCE wasn't far back in the four path into the stretch then closed a gap in the final yards to miss.
INHONOROFTHEMOON was slow early, made a run in the five path into the stretch but lacked the needed closing response. MIDNIGHT HAULER came
out three wide for room nearing the lane then gained mildly. KELLI'S SMILE moved along the rail to press the early pace, fell back entering the turn and
tired. ATLANTIC CHILL bobbled leaving the gate, moved clear soon after, held on two wide for over a half then tired. TYGER BRIGHT stumbled badly
leaving the gate, angled to the inside, was hustled closer soon after, steadied in tight leaving the half-mile pole, stopped and was eased up.

FIREINTHEPULPIT pressed two wide outside the early leader then surged to the front in the final yards. BAGGINS made the pace along the rail but couldn't
last. EXCHANGE FEVER was hustled into tight quarters near the half-mile pole, remained in tight into the turn, angled to the rail for room midway on the
bend and lacked the needed rally. Objections by Gonzalez against the top two finishers were not allowed. MOOCHIE MAN chased the top two into the turn
then tired. NONPLUSULTRA raced wide into the stretch and weakened. OMENED BY was no factor. HUSBAND IN LAW was far back.
