Footnotes
DREAM'N DEMON drifted out slightly in the opening furlong, controlled the pace, eagerly widened in the stretch and drew away under wraps. HURACAN
outrun early, closed well in the final furlong to get up for the place. RICKIE'S MELODY pursued the pacesetter throughout and weakened in the stretch.
RAILROAD BILL clipped heels and bobbled in the opening furlong then was always outrun. METALLIC TUNE dropped back at the start and trailed
throughout. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the rider of RAILROAD BILL against the rider of DREAM'N DEMON for interference soon after
the start, DREAM'N DEMON was disqualified and placed fourth.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT BOUNTY, just off the rail and just off the pace, eased out a bit and split foes on the far turn, took the lead, drifted out, while clear, under left
handed pressure and was ridden out. OWESAYCANYOUSEE set the pace in three path, drifted out under steady left handed pressure through the stretch,
brushed ANISSA lightly deep stretch and edged away from that rival while no threat to winner. ANISSA, in three path, eased out near the quarter pole, was
fanned wider through stretch and was brushed lightly and steadied in deep stretch. VIVA NEVADA, wide and just off pace, tired. ROSE OF DUBLIN broke
slowly, was two wide and tired. HOLA PRINCESS broke slow and trailed. AFTER A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ANISSA AND A STEWARDS
INQUIRY, OWESAYCANYOUSEE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
REFI settled off the leaders outside, bid wide in the stretch, caught the pacesetters and edged away. BULLZILLA led between rivals down the backstretch,
was collared again in the stretch and continued gamely. MARNESIA ONE STEP well back inside early, angled wide on the turn then rallied late. TICKED
ALL DABOXES dueled three wide, led narrowly at the quarter pole and proved empty in the stretch. CALL FITZROY broke sluggishly, advanced inside then
faltered. ERIN GO BRAUGH hustled close up along the rail to the stretch and gave way. MOUNT OLYMPUS chased outside and weakened steadily. SLAM
BANG lagged far behind along the rail and was never a factor.

TOO MUCH JOHNNIE saved ground just off the pace, drifted out badly through stretch and edged away with speed to spare. JUMP SHOT broke slowly and
was very wide early, moved to the rail before leaving the backstretch and while no threat to winner, gained place. LOUIE'S WISH raced well out from the
rail, bid on the turn but then flattened out. PROTA set the pace just off the rail, drifted out badly through stretch and gave way. RISING STORM saved
ground just off the pace, also drifted out and gave way. MANAGING RISK failed to menace. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD, fractious in the gate, raced very wide
and tired. GAME CHANGER showed little. RULES, in the four path and just off the early pace, was finished before a half. RACEHORSEINARED stalked
from the three path then stopped.

LUCKY OLIVIA ROSE hustled to a clear lead inside, widened in the stretch and remained safe under mild pressure. NEW JERSEY prompted the winner
outside, faded in the stretch but lasted for the place. BELLA G dropped well behind inside, moved wide in the stretch and closed well just missing the place.
LI'LBITO'CHARM moved closer inside on the turn then came up empty through the final furlong. GO METRO GIRL was urged just off the pace inside then
faltered on the turn. MIGHTY ELECTRICA settled within striking range three wide then gave way after half a mile.

METHODICAL lacked speed, advanced wide then surged through the final furlong to draw clear under steady urging. OUR STORMIN NORMAN split rivals
rallying near the three eighths pole, led briefly in mid stretch and continued gamely. ASHRAQ rated along the inside, swung wide moving with the winner but
was outfinished. OTIS OTIS OTIS was urged close up outside and continued willingly to the finish. STRICTLY THE BEST trailed far behind, rallied very wide
on the turn and in the stretch closing the gap. INSPIRING JUSTICE hustled to a clear lead inside to the stretch then weakened. TOMASCO saved ground
just behind the leaders and faltered in the stretch. LITTLE VINNIE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter for half a mile then gave way. G DADDY chased
wide and began fading on the turn.

Footnotes
SKIPIN ON ORCHARD, three wide early, moved to the rail on the turn, was angled out near mid stretch and closed determinedly to get the decision.
BREEZY GUST set the pace in the five path, was clear in mid stretch but couldn't last. MY DANZIG PARTNER, between rivals early, came wide into stretch
and had little gain. ASPEN XTREME, far back early, passed tiring foes. GREAT GO GO dueled for command two wide but well off rail, tired. TALENTED
SON saved ground and tired.

Footnotes
KING'S GOLD broke slowly and was outrun early, rallied between foes on the final turn then went three wide, closed and was along in time. DONNIE
BRASCO saved ground just off the pace, eased out after a half, took the lead near mid stretch but was outfinished. SURFER BOY GEORGE was wide and
just off the pace, took over and was clear on the final turn but then weakened. YONDERING, racing three wide, challenged near mid stretch but then
flattened out. HUSSAR saved ground while never far back, split foes on the final turn and had no late kick. BILL'S MAFIA broke sharply as the field left the
gate twenty three minutes past scheduled post time, set the pace two wide then had nothing left. SYNERGIZED saved ground racing in closest pursuit,
drifted out then tired. EL DULZURA, racing outside, dropped back steadily.
