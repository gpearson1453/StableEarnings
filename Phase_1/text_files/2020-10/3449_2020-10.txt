Footnotes
RISK MANAGER chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, edged clear of foe near the sixteenth pole and drew
away in the final stages while geared down. HARD KNOCKING vied for the lead early on, took over command along the backstretch, was off the rail into the
lane with a clear lead, clung to the lead near the eighth pole but gave in and was no match for the winner in the final stages. HE'SPUREGOLD raced back
early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the inside but did not have enough for place in the final stages. TAPWOOD raced
back early along the outside, was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. LAVISH MCTAVISH was bumped
around at the start and trailed the field early on, raced along the four path into the lane with late gain in the stretch run. OPTIMUS KAT chased the pace
early, was in the five path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. BOURBON HIGHWAY was never a threat. LOW TIDE WARNING set the
pace along the first turn, was tugged along the backstretch, raced along the four path into the lane and gave way down the lane. PURE COURAGE was
never a factor. TOUR THE WORLD was never a threat. COMMAND CENTRAL was through after a half. MASTER OF WAR was bumped at the start and
never involved.

Footnotes
VICE VERSA chased the leaders three wide while close up, inched forward as wider foes did the same at the half mile pole, vied three wide and between
horses around the turn, forged a narrow advantage passing the five sixteenths pole, clung to that margin in upper stretch inside of DONNELS CREEK after
other vying foes weakened, and gamely fended that foe off to the wire. DONNELS CREEK stalked four wide, inched closer vie for the lead into the far turn
while between horses, held position in upper stretch after other vying foes tired, and sustained the duel outside of VICE VERSA through the lane, but was
denied by that rival. STAY HAPPY broke well but was slow to get going through the early stages, trailed the field by a distance while under mild
encouragement down the backstretch and into the turn, cut the gap on his rivals turning for home, then sustained a rail rally through the lane, but did not
have enough. COMPLEXIFIER saved ground from midpack before shifting three wide turning for home, then stayed on to split tiring foes at the sixteenth
pole for a minor reward. ELGAR shifted two to four wide turning for home while off of the pace, then tipped six wide in upper stretch, and produced a mild
kick. ADHHAR was off slowly without incident, raced far off of the pace around the turn before swinging six wide turning for home, but failed to menace.
CARDIAC KITTEN tracked from midpack five wide, inched forward into the turn, vied five wide around the turn, but flattened out on his left lead in upper
stretch. DUPLICATOR set a pressured pace along the inside, held an advantage from four foes into the turn, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, dug
in in upper stretch before weakening. CABOT vied two wide and between horses around the turn, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
HIGH CRIME vied outside of NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) through a fast pace, forged an advantage from that foe in upper stretch before drawing clear at
the sixteenth pole, then lasted to the wire to hold off closing rivals. POWER END saved ground in midpack around the turn before shifting four wide passing
the quarter pole to split foes, bumped COMPETITIVE SAINT in the process, then commenced a late rally into the collapsing pace with a swift kick through
the final furlong, but missed. RACE DRIVER broke outwardly, raced far off of the pace pace in the two to three path around the turn, swung seven wide in
upper stretch, and produced a stout late rally, but ran out of ground. INFINITE stalked three wide before tucking to the rail into the turn, saved ground
around the bend before chasing the dueling leaders through upper stretch, then shifted off of the rail passing the furlong pole, and gained through the late
stages as the pace collapsed, but was outfinished by outer oncharging foes. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY raced far off of the pace in the four path around the
turn, then got floated six wide turning for home, and produced a mild kick, but was outfinished by an outer foe for minor rewards. COMPETITIVE SAINT
settled off of the pace three wide around the turn, but was bumped and forced five wide turning for home by an inner foe, then rallied mildly between horses
through the lane to cut the gap on the leader, but was outfinished by rivals. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) set a quick, and eventually collapsing, pace along
the inside under stout pressure from HIGH CRIME, dug in after being headed by that foe in upper stretch, then gave way in the final sixteenth. ARTEMUS
CITYLIMITS lied forwardly placed five to four wide into the turn, inched forward turning for home to be in range of the dueling leaders passing the quarter
pole, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, which caused him to fail to keep pace with those foes, and tired thereafter. GRANDAL bumped with an inner
foe at the start, then tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but tired through the lane, and bled. KITTEN'S MAN was pinched back at the
start, then saved ground while trailing around the turn, and failed to factor. EXPLORER stalked four to three wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe turning
for home, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BON RAISON trailed the small field in the four path around the turn, chased his rivals through upper stretch without making much progress, then tipped five
wide to be outside of those foes passing the furlong pole, found stride and produced a late kick, and just got up. MANNY WAH stalked along the inside,
shifted off of the fence turning for home before splitting the leaders to produce a bid passing the three sixteenths pole, forged an advantage and cleared
passing the furlong marker, but was nailed by an oncharging outer foe on the wire. SEVEN NATION ARMY stalked three wide around the turn, then four
wide turning for home, but leveled off through the lane, got outkicked by an inner foe at the furlong pole, then an outer foe in the final sixteenth while
achieving show. COOL ARROW set the pace along the inside while feeling pressure from ADMIRAL LYNCH, was headed by that foe passing the five
sixteenths pole, dug in to sustain vying position through midstretch, but yielded passing the sixteenth pole. ADMIRAL LYNCH vied two wide, forged an
advantage and cleared off turning for home, but tired three wide in upper stretch, then weakened after being headed at the furlong pole.

Footnotes
STUNNING SKY got caught in the three to four path around the first turn while reserved far off of the pace, then took the far turn in the five path before
being floated six wide turning for home, but produced a determined rally outside of rivals through the lane to catch the clear leader approaching the wire.
PRINCESS GRACE saved ground in midpack around both turns before swinging four wide turning for home, blew past the leaders at the furlong pole with a
swift turn of foot, quickly drew clear, but tired late and was worn down approaching the wire. HOW IRONIC trailed in the two to three path around the far
turn, rallied behind the leading group through upper stretch, surged through traffic passing the furlong pole as PRINCESS GRACE kicked away, then
sustained her rally through the late stages to close the gap on that foe, but was outfinished by an outer oncharging rival. WITEZ settled off of the pace in the
two path, then took the far turn in the three to four path, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then kept on for minor rewards. DUOPOLY
stalked along the inside while saving ground around both turns, committed to a rail bid in upper stretch, produced a mild one inside of foes approaching the
furlong pole, but was outkicked by outer foes passing that marker, then got outfinished for a minor placing. OUTBURST (GB) set the pace along the inside,
dug in to hold an advantage in upper stretch, but was overhauled by PRINCESS GRACE at the furlong pole, then faded thereafter. SUGAR FIX stalked two
wide, then three wide around the far turn, inched forward turning for home to vie in upper stretch, but faded at the furlong pole. ANTOINETTE tracked from
midpack two wide, then from the four path around the far turn, but came under a drive approaching the five sixteenths pole, failed to respond, and weakened
through the lane. WALK IN MARRAKESH (IRE) prompted the pace setter from the outside, vied around the far turn, but weakened in midstretch. PRANKED
saved ground around both turns while far off of the pace, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
LITTLE BELLA raced far off of the pace two wide, advanced slightly in the five path around the turn, then sustained a late rally, wore down the loose leader
through the late stages to get up at the wire. MS. MALEVOLENCE dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, then just inside of
COMPETITIVE FIRE around the turn, drew clear of that foe passing the quarter pole, held a wide margin through midstretch, but finished poorly and got
nailed on the wire. VEILED VIXEN tracked from midpack in the four path around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole before
staying on for a minor reward. QUEEN OF VERONA bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside, then from the two path around the turn, but
lacked a kick to make a bid through a large hole between foes in upper stretch, and got outfinished by an outer foe for show. COMPETITIVE FIRE dueled
for the lead three wide early on, then two wide around the turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. DUCHES OF GRACE raced forwardly placed two to
three wide and between horses, but weakened without encouragement passing the three furlong pole. ACTRESS ON BOARD was off slowly and failed to
factor. SHESDIAMONITE was bumped by an inner foe at the start, dueled inside of a pair of foes early on, but failed to keep pace with them into the turn,
and wilted around it.
