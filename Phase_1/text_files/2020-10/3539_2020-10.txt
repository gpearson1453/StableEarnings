all of the pace from the inside and was tagged late. MIDNIGHT LUCK saved ground to the stretch, eased out and just missed. HEAVENLY TIGER settled
early two wide, came three wide on the second turn and flattened out in the late stages. FLYING PETER PAN was well placed to the second turn and came
up empty. CAPACITOR pressed the pace outside and gave out.

Footnotes
DESCARTES took command instantly and set all of the pace from just off the rail, responded to fine rating and held determinedly. OF GOOD REPORT
settled inside, saved ground to the stretch, eased out but hung in the final stages. OUR SILVER OAK stalked three wide early, offered his best bid at the
furlong pole but flattened out late. SHADRACK was rank early, came four wide to the stretch but lacked the needed rally. BRONZE WARRIOR prompted the
winner two wide into the lane and weakened.

CIMARRON raced unhurried early while fanned four wide to the backstretch, circled rival five wide on the second turn and rallied strongly from the outside to
get up late. FANTASTIC SECRET advanced three wide on the first turn to gain command into the backstretch, set all the pace and gave way grudgingly.
MISS YOU MOM lagged to the stretch then closed willingly from between rivals. FRUITFULLY settled on the rail early, rallied four wide on the second turn,
offered his bid in the upper stretch and hung. CIRCULODEGANADORAS dueled early, saved ground and weakened. TOTALLY NORMAL pressed the pace
two then three wide to the stretch and gave way.

PULPIT SINGER took command from the gate and set all of the pace from off the rail under good rating and won driving. SWEET CHAYANE stalked three
wide early, came four wide on the second turn but could make no impact. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD pressed the pace two and three wide and raced gamely.
VONHRA was never too far back from the inside, came two wide on the second turn but lacked the needed rally. CHARLIE'S BELLE lacked early speed,
came four wide on the second turn but did not threaten. RUN FOR A MILLION saved ground to no avail.

ALL AMERICAN HERO emerged from the outside after the break to take a clear lead into the turn, extended his advantage to the furlong pole and held
without being asked for his best. UNUSUAL MISCHIEF was slow early, came two wide on the turn and had a mild rally. CINDERELLAS PRINCE stalked the
pace three wide and had no rally. KNOWN broke slow and trailed, circled rivals four wide on the turn but lost his punch. IDIOT IN LOVE saved ground to no
avail. SHUMWAY chased the winner from off the rail and came up empty.

THUNDER WOMAN set the pace from well off the rail, edged clear on the turn and held her advantage gamely. RAELEE prompted the pace two wide and
was gaining in the closing stages. JAZZY EINSTEIN settled, saved ground and came on without being a serious factor. MIME was always forwardly pace
but failed to muster a rally while in the two path out of the turn. RED DAHLIA lacked early speed, raced three wide on the turn and did not rally. CHECK

Footnotes
BOLD ROMAN held a short early lead, drew clear on the turn and held driving. PUNALUU lacked good early speed, came to the outside for the drive and
closed willinglluy. TINA'S EXCHANGE settled early, came three wide on the turn but did not rally. HILL CROOME stalked from off the rail and weakened.
KONA SKYE saved ground to no avail. ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE showed little. SADDLE BAR was not a factor.
