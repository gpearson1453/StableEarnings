LEAVEUWITHASMILE prompted the pace five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was patiently
handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive taking command just inside the eighth pole, then inched away to the
finish kept to task. RYAN'S CAT hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits under some pressure from the
aforementioned foe to the outside, tucked to the inside through the turn, got let out spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and was
collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. MISSION WRAPITUP coaxed from the gate,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. THE GREAT DANSKY broke a bit awkward when coaxed from the
start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under a drive nearing the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. REJECTED AGAIN broke in at the start under coaxing, chased briefly inside before tipping
out to chase from the three path, tucked to the two path through the turn and came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went three to four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. DOUBLE SHOT coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside until tucked two to three wide through the turn,
came under a ride at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. GLENN LIKES GIN broke a half a beat slow, chased
three wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
THE SICARII moved into a forward position after an apparent clean getaway, began to vie as the widest of three, from path three, coming up to the half mile
pole, was still locked in a three-way tussle getting called upon stepping onto the top of the lane, but with all the participants having shifted one path farther
off the rail, battled onward with determination to get the job done in the final furlong. JUMP FOR JOY remained stationed in the two path after the start,
contended for the top from between opponents during the run around the bend, went approximately three wide entering the stretch, left the eighth pole
going at it one on one with the winner, saw that rival slowly take charge and had to settle for second. RELEASETHETHUNDER racing near or along the
inside route, disputed the pace as the innermost of three from the top of the turn until deep into the furlong grounds, weakened late in the show slot.
OUTRAGEOUS BET saved ground for nearly a half, angled three wide into the lane, inched up towards the ones to catch, nudged PSYCHIC ENERGY
outward for better racing room in deep stretch, fell short of snagging away third. PSYCHIC ENERGY took up residence in midpack after the start, was rated
along in path two with a good view of the contested pace, swung out into path five for the stretch run, failed to make headway in the final furlong. IAN
GLASS away last after shouldering the left side of the starting gate, dove over to the rail, stayed along it for the opening half, got steered out five wide
stepping into the lane, gained some real estate but all done without making any impact.

Footnotes
PERFORMER brushed the off side stall at the start, settled unhurried along the inside tracking the leader in close range, got given some rein and was very
lightly coaxed at the three-eighths and advanced along the rail moving inside the leader to take over command nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch in command, the rider sitting chilly in stark contrast to his only tepid threat to the outside, got urged twice a furlong out and received
a sole tap to the left shoulder inside the eighth pole remaining safely in front in hand to the wire to prevail comfortably and easily on the line. MUSICAL
HEART hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, floated to the two path six furlongs from home, remained patiently handled through
the turn and had the aforementioned foe advance inside through the latter portion of the turn, got set down displaced from the front spinning three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive through to the finish chasing the chilly handled winner home well clear of the rest and along second best in a good effort.
EMPTY TOMB three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. ZERO
GRAVITY chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. FOREVER MO coaxed from the gate,
chased two to three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
UNICORN SALLY at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, sat parked out five wide on the turn, got cued up spinning slightly closer to the
inside into the lane, charged to the front during the ensuing furlong, extended the lead out to a comfortable margin before getting geared down in the final
seventy yards. MIZZEN THE MARK chased the pace from path four, got set down as three-quarters was being completed, got maneuvered about two paths
closer to the rail coming into the stretch, saw the winner take over, but held on well herself to garner the place. BELLEZA rated along contending for the top
from the two path, came under a ride for the drive, proved no match once the winner got going in upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. EIGHTY
SEVEN NORTH vied for control from along the inside route until upper stretch before faltering. RUNNING ON ENTRY pursued the pace three wide, flashed
some interest approaching the five-sixteenths marker, was under a ride spinning into the stretch, got worked into the five path by midlane, made no
headway. SARATOGA LULLABY two to three wide on the turn, was sent out five wide exiting it, lacked a response. KISS AND RUN settled into midpack,
was noticeably pulling on the bit for much of the opening half, departed the backstretch from the two path, angled four wide into the lane, failed to fire
appreciably. SOPHIE FATALE quickly spotted along the rail, displayed only brief foot. ARRIETTY stumbled after the start, got tucked into the two path on
the backstretch, got set down stepping onto the turn from the two path, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
VINEYARD SOUND hustled from the gate, dueled five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch with SHAMROCKED to his inside, tucked to the
two path through the turn, got set down spinning three wide for home, dug in under a drive continuing to knock heads through the length of the stretch
trading brushes with his main rival to his inside and shook away nearing the finish in game fashion to prevail. SHAMROCKED coaxed from the start, dueled
four then three paths off the inside with the aforementioned foe to his outside, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home, dug in clinging to command to the eighth pole and dueled through the length of the stretch to the finish fighting on to the
end and trading light brushes but was shaken off in the last strides to the wire. DURKIN'S CALL chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. PREAMBLE three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. HAWAIIAN NOISES hustled from the gate, chased
along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI two to
three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. JUSTIN FRONT coaxed from the
start, chased just off the inside coming under urging at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
TEXAS BASIN tucked along the inside route prior to departing the backstretch, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners, cut the corner with the rail
corridor having sufficient room with which to launch a rally, got cued up and did just that, arriving at the eighth pole after a powerful burst of speed, vied with
vigour matched up with MOMZA beginning a little down the road and gamely proved best. MOMZA bumped into by VOTER PROTECTION, took up the
chase two to three wide, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, got guided over closer to the rail after a tussle between them got sparked off, was
valiant to the end, but wound up denied. VOTER PROTECTION in sharply with his initial step, bumped into the second place finisher, displayed no ill effects
from that incident and settled into the two path by the top of the turn, stalked the pace from midpack, angled out five turning into the stretch, ground his way
into the show slot during the last eighth. RISKY WOODS off a half beat slow, was sighted three wide at the top of the turn, spun into the lane slightly closer
to the rail, clawed his way towards the ones to catch, shifted wider in deep stretch for clearer room, made some late headway to get up for the final
significant slice of the purse. KENTUCKY KNIGHT retained the advantage after being about a half length the quickest out of it, was along the rail holding off
pressure from a pair of foes to the outside for much of the initial step, went into the stretch, gave in to heavy pressure shortly after leaving the eighth pole
and weakened. BERHANU disputed the pace two wide from between rivals until midstretch, gave way. PACIFIC LEGEND sat within striking distance of the
contested path travelling two wide, was forced to idle along behind some traffic for a furlong beginning in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, came up
empty when finally roused. SONO GRATO stalked the pace four wide, was put to a drive at the five-sixteenths marker, went into the lane and gave way.
GREATHEART on the track early, came away at the start forwardly placed, was in path three arguing as the widest of three for the top, asked for run a good
for a good portion of the trip on the turn, came to a grinding halt deep into the furlong grounds and readily backed away.

Footnotes
RAVEN ROCKS prompted the pace from the outside in the three path, tucked to the two path through the turn and applied pressure between foes as a pair
advanced to join outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied to take command near the eitghth pole, dug in
under threat to the finish and prevailed gamely on the wire. NOT PHAR NOW chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong threatening to the finish but was ultimately repelled to the wire. WUDDA U
THINK NOW brushed the near side stall at the start and was bumped by NEURO who broke outwards a step, came under hustling and established the front
shortly after the break, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from RAVEN ROCKS to the outside, got joined by a pair to the
outside midway on the turn and came under coaxing now under pressure from a trio, took the inside route into upper stretch clinging to the front, dug in and
was headed a furlong out, ran on battling on inside to the finish and preserved the show honors on the line. THE GOLDEN DOOR three wide in pursuit from
the tail of the field, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly and missed for the show honors.
NEURO broke out a step at the start bumping WUDDA U THINK NOW, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then from the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid, then flattened out in the late stages. A
VOW OF BEAUTY chased just off the inside from near the rear, got coaxed along midway on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. ERNIE BANKER four wide in aim of the leader down the backstretch, advanced three wide between foes through the turn to apply pressure to the
front when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. SCUTTLEBUZZ just off the pace five paths off the
inside, advanced four wide through the bend to stack outside the top trio applying pressure from the outside three furlongs from home placed to coaxing,
went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. SHINJUKU six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, got
put to coaxing midway on the bend, went eight wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SIX PERCENT away in good order, pursued the pace towards path two, was confidently-ridden going by RED ZINGER in tandem with the second place
finisher coming up to the five-sixteenths pole, sparred side by side with COLD HARD CASH still on hold until deep into the furlong grounds, was allowed to
drift inward, with the nemesis following suit, sealed that opponent onto the tighter going along the inside route with a brush in midlane, ventured onward
vying with vigour, with the top twosome even lightly leaning on each other at times, gamely proved best. COLD HARD CASH settled into midpack after the
field had been sent off and running, crept up to the front runners from path three, got asked to pick it up approaching the three-eighths pole, overtook the
pacesetter together with the top one a sixteenth later, gradually moved onto the inside route during the stretch run, induced somewhat by SIX PERCENT,
traded off a few leans with the top one here and there in the stretch, got denied. FARRAGUT forwardly placed along the inside during the journey leading up
to the conclusion of the backstretch, tipped into the two path at the top of the turn, came under some hand urging, was taken in hand fleetingly as RED
ZINGER was releasing the advantage in the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out into path four from upper to midstretch, went on to finish a
non-threatening third. FOREVER WICKED saved ground until the quarter pole, angled three wide into the lane, lacked a solid closing punch. TOO EARLY
chased the pace two wide on the turn, gave way. BEACH ACCESS along the outside, was two wide and under a drive during the run around the bend,
commenced the stretch two paths farther off the rail, tired. RED ZINGER appearing keen, threw down a lively clip during the opening stages from the two
path, slid onto the rail at the half mile pole, felt an uptick in pressure crossing the midway point on the turn, got displaced even while being roused a
sixteenth later, went into the stretch and steadily backed away.

Footnotes
LEAD GUITAR three wide in pursuit from mid pack, steadily advanced and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong tussling briefly with SUNNY DALE before taking command nearing the sixteenth pole, then dug
in and held safe to prevail over a late closing rival. BOHEMIAN BOURBON chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kicked on offering up late foot latching on the aforementioned foe as she hit the wire.
I'LLHANDALTHECASH just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, ran
on through to the finish to secure the show honors. ROSE FLOWER (GER) three wide in pursuit from near the rear, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SUNNY DALE established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in
hand just off the inside shaking away to a safe lead, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch set down for the
drive, dug in under a drive under threat and was collared nearing the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the late stages. MY SASSY SARAH hesitated at
the start getting away last and walking out of the gate conceding six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside from the tail of the
field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and showed good courage offering up a mild bid to cut the
field in half to the finish. SARATOGA TREASURE four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. XANTHIQUE hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside forwardly placed, tucked inside through the turn and
got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. GETMOTHERAROSE chased two to three wide from near
the rear under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. ELLE'S TOWN broke out at the start and brushed
with LEAD GUITAR, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch,
tired, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
GOOD CREDENCE off the inside throuighout, stepped onto the turn from the three path, picked it up when asked springing from the five-sixteenths pole,
challenged in earnest as the outermost of the front runners, took charge during the ensuing furlong, drew off. PLAYTONE rode the rail until the end of the
bend, got called upon for the drive home, had to alter course from upper to midstretch all the way towards path five for clearance, straightened away and
rallied for the place. JEWEL OF ARABIA away well, grabbed a narrow advantage, cut over to the inside, vcontended as the innermost of three beginning
from around the half mile pole, straddling the right border of the inside route, sensed ARCHUMYBABY in the process of launching a menacing rail-skimming
run during the final stages of the run around the bend, cut the corner, with the pilot leaning inward, keeping the inside clamped down, got asked for its best a
few jumps later, proved powerless to stave off the winner, got caught late for second. ARCHUMYBABY tracked the front runners from the pocket, got
switched over to a drive at the five-sixteenths pole, advanced towards the ones to catch, got steadied when in tight along a non-usable seam in upper
stretch, weakened in the final furlong. FIGHT ON LUCY travelled between opponents from path two on the turn, swung out four wide into the lane, made no
late headway. JC'S SHOOTING STAR two wide onto the turn, got sent out six wide exiting it, lacked the necessary response. LETMETAKETHISCALL
disputed the pace between rivals from path two on the turn, gave way. CARTWHEEL failed to menace after undergoing a four to five wide journey. VIRADIA
a pace factor strung out three to four wide on the turn, folded. Following a claim of foul lodged by the trainer of ARCHUMYBABY against the rider of JEWEL
OF ARABIA alleging interference in the stretch, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.
