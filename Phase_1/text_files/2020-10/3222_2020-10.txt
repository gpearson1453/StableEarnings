Footnotes
EL RAYO D'SHERGAR bobbled at the start, raced six wide to the turn, stayed widest into the stretch and grinded away all out to prevail under stout
handling. ZIGGY BARCELONA settled in to the turn, raced on between horses through the stretch while next to the winner from the sixteenth pole and just
outfinished in a game effort. PLATINUM MAC just off pace to turn, battled hard in the stretch run but caught in the final stages. NIT PICK stumbled start, no
speed to the stretch and improved position through the stretch only. ROCKA BARRY sharp inside speed to the stretch and gave way readily. WAR
ADDRESS never a real menace. WARRIOR SPIRIT dropped back on the rail into turn.

Footnotes
LICHITA broke sharp with the lead, dueled to the quarter pole sharply roused to go clear in the stretch run with a good effort. WINE ME UP BABY good
break with winner to the turn, could not keep from the quarter pole but proved up best of the rest. POCA MUCHA had a slow break, raced outside
throughout and came along for the show spot late while no threat to the top pair. WINDY CORNER had a slow break and never factored. SHAN'S TIGER
good break chasing top pair to the stretch but came up empty and faltered late. JANE'S GOLD TOUR could not keep up from outside. ROBERTO'S DREAM
had a tardy start and never a contender. PLAYFULMISSSAMURAI was through early and dropped back readily.

C F V RED NOVA bumped a horse at the start losing a step on the field, gradually moved up to get behind the leaders on the turrn while in the three path,
took on the sole leader from outside down the stretch and prevailed from the sixteenth marker. BIG TRUCK was mid pack and off the rail, ranged up in the
four path on the turn, lost a bit of ground running to mid stretch but had late foot to take the place spot. RUN RABBIT bumped a foe at the start, pressed
outiside the leader while clear of the rest of the field, ran on to vie with the winner down the stretch but was flat and lost lengths past the sixteenth pole.
WHAT A BEAST set a pressured pace with another foe while clear of the rest of the field, lost position on the turn and faded down the stretch. RAMSES
was never close and widest in the stretch. GETTING JIGGY was no threat.

Footnotes
NEVUS was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, vied on the turn and down the stretch and readily cleared to the lead while erratic in late stretch. SARAH
JANE was bounced between horses at the start, prompted the leader early, wound up between horses on the turn, led late but was outpaced by the winner
and second best. ROCK'N ROLL MUSIC was way back early, made a steady gain down the stretch to the eighth pole and improved position late. BIG
PERFORMER was bumped at the start, got close, dropped back a bit on the turn and improved position in late stretch. TEQUILA FLATS was urged on the
turn, ran evenly to late stretch and improved position. FIGHTIN WITH PRIDE was bumped at the start, a bit rank early and very wide in the stretch. R
HOUDINI was wide on the backstretch and no threat. FREEDOM MIKE bumped a horse at the start, led early, stayed close to late stretch and faltered
before stumbling past the finsh, throwing the rider and walking off.
