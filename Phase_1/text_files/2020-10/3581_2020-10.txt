Footnotes
I JUANA HERO was sent for speed, cleared to the lead, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and remained in
command while kept to the task. RONAN raced between horses in the chasing flight, took up hard at the seven sixteenths to evade a fallen jockey, dropped
to the inside for the run around the turn and improved position while saving ground, was taken three wide into the stretch, and kept on while no match for the
winner. POLLY WAR CRY raced at the inside of the chasing flight, took up at the seven sixteenths to avoid a fallen rider, was urged in the three to four path
on the turn and took closer order, was driven into the lane in the five to six path, chased on mildly in the lane and got up in time for show. APPLE VALLEY
tracked the pacesetter two wide, continued to track her in the three path on the turn, went to a drive two wide in upper stretch, and weakened. NURSE
KATIE chased three wide early, took up at the seven sixteenths when CLASSOFSIXTYNINE unseated her rider, raced behind the loose horse until altering
in near the three eighths, was urged in the four path past the three eighths, and proved empty in the lane. ZIP ATTACK BABY settled at the rear in the five
to six path on the backstretch, altered further out past the seven sixteenths to steer clear of a fallen rider, trailed in the four to five path on the turn and never
rallied. CLASSOFSIXTYNINE was urged to show pace early but outsprinted to the lead, tracked the leader inside of APPLE VALLEY while racing keenly,
lost action at the seven sixteenths and unseated her rider, completed the course without a rider, was apprehended past the wire and walked off the course.
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE SEVEN SIXTEENTHS; UPON REVIEW THEY MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
DRIVER DAN broke readily, was urged inside rivals to gain the advantage racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn,
went clear while shifting a bit off the rail racing into upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under hand urging. DARK WOOD (IRE) tracked
off the first flight along the inside from out of striking distance in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn steadily gaining position, then shifted out
in the closing stages while failing to gain terms with the winner. NEXT MONDAY, brushed at the start, settled last between foes racing to the backstretch,
swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position while gaining a share. GREENSPAN, pulling a bit between
foes in the opening stages, was urged to prompt the pacesetter racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into the lane. THE DOGMEN was rated out of
striking distance tracking the leaders three deep to the backstretch, made some brief progress in that path nearing the far turn but came up empty
approaching the stretch. THE FIRST HERO broke sharply, was urged to brief contention three deep racing into the first turn, raced a bit wide to the
backstretch, faded from contention after a half, then was eased in the final sixteenth but walked off the course under his own power.

Footnotes
ANTRIM'S GIANT tracked behind the leading flight, continued in range in the four path on the far turn, was taken four wide into the lane, drove to the lead
three wide midstretch, and edged clear. BAROQUE disputed the early pace inside of YOU SPLIT TENS, cleared through the clubhouse turn, set the pace
down the backstretch, was confronted into the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, kept on gamely but could not hold off the winner in the final furlong.
CITALI raced keenly between horses in the rear group early, took closer order down the backstretch, continued in the three path in the rear group on the far
turn, rallied into the lane but was caught behind traffic in upper stretch, and came on mildly late for third. YOU SPLIT TENS was keen to dispute the pace
outside of BAROQUE early then taken back to track the pace around the first turn, continued to track in range down the backstretch, encroached outside of
BAROQUE into the far turn, vied between horses, continued to contend under firm hand urging after his rider lost his crop in upper stretch, and weakened in
the final furlong. BIG MONEY MACHINE settled three wide in the rear group early, took closer order down the backstretch, was pushed along in the five
path in the rear flight on the far turn, driven in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. MIAS MOONBEAM hopped at the start, settled at the inside of the
rear group, took closer order down the backstretch, bid three wide into the far turn, came into the lane still three wide, and emptied out.

Footnotes
COWBOY TUFF brushed the gate, then was bumped just after the start, was urged between foes to prompt the pacesetter racing through the backstretch,
pressed the issue on the turn into upper stretch, wrested the advantage nearing the furlong marker and went clear under firm left handed encouragement.
FIXICO broke sharply, sped to the lead along the inside in the opening stages dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command through the
turn to upper stretch but proved no match while shifting outside the winner late. WAVE'NDUMONI broke outwards bumping TAZ ATTACK, was righted to
track off the second flight between foes, was held up losing some position when caught in close quarters approaching the turn, shifted to the rail leaving the
midway point of the bend and continued with interest inside foes to gain a share in the closing stages. LASTFORTINOFAMILY angled to the rail in early
stages tracking off the second flight racing into the bend, shifted out three wide racing through the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. DAZZLING
DIABLO angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders in the opening stages, steadied momentarily racing past the seven sixteenths marker, continued
near the inside to the stretch and faded in the drive. UPSHUR COUNTY shied outwards at the break bumping the eventual winner, was held up outside
rivals in the opening quarter, raced four wide into the turn and offered no rally. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN broke outwards brushing at the start, pulled his way
between foes in the second flight while going a bit erratically under restraint and faded between rivals racing into the stretch. LONESOME DREAM shifted
off the inside early while pulling hard between foes, continued racing rank three deep between foes, swung out nearing the lane, then bore out sharply
nearing midstretch and never proved a serious threat. BOOGY SOKS, forwardly placed tracking just off the first flight racing four wide in the opening stages,
continued outside a rival in second flight into the turn and steadily faded into the stretch. TAZ ATTACK hopped at the start while being bumped, was settled
last and trailed the field to the stretch.

Footnotes
TIGHTROPE set the pace while being pressured by SMOOTH PAPA to his inside, continued to set the pace two wide on the turn, was driven in upper
stretch, opened up slightly in midstretch, began to tire late but held. SMOOTH PAPA was restless in the gate, came out and bumped MKAR THE FAST in
the opening strides, pressed the pace inside of TIGHTROPE, saved ground through the turn while still attending the pace, was driven inside down the lane,
kept on tenaciously even as TIGHTROPE opened up slightly, regained some ground on him late but did not catch him. BRAVO BRAVO was restless in the
gate, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and three wide on the turn, proved no match for the leading pair down the lane but chased on with
continued interest to prove best of the rest. TLALOC raced at the inside of the chasing flight, was driven inside into the lane, and kept on while not being
able to gain ground on the top three. WISE KHOZAN chased between horses, swung four wide into the lane, altered out when a hole closed in upper
stretch, and kept on mildly. MKAR THE FAST was bumped by SMOOTH PAPA in the opening strides, stumbled, bumped THE GEEK as he regained his
footing, chased three wide down the backstretch and four wide on the turn, was taken five wide into the lane, and never found enough to threaten. Z U AT
THE RACES settled near the rear, raced toward the rear in the four path on the turn, was taken six wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally.
FLEETRIDGE settled at the rear inside of THE GEEK early, saved ground through the turn while trailing, came into the lane under a drive and lacked a bid.
WILLTOBELUCKY tracked the leading trip, was pushed along near the half mile mark but nonetheless began to lose round, chased three wide around the
bend, was driven five wide into the lane and came up empty. THE GEEK was lightly bumped by MKAR THE FAST in the opening strides when that one
stumbled, settled in the rear flight outside of FLEETRIDGE, raced near the rear in the three path on the turn, mustered no rally and was allowed to tail off
the lane.

Footnotes
MARK OF THE Z ducked outwards at the start, was quickly righted, then urged between foes to gain a narrow advantage just off the rail racing through the
backstretch, dictated the pace inside a rival racing into the turn, forged clear nearing upper stretch and held sway on a commanding advantage while being
kept to left handed pressure. HELLOFAGUY, reserved in early stages while shifting off the inside racing through the backstretch, swung out seven wide
racing into upper stretch and produced a sustained response to narrowly prevail for the place honors on the wire. STORMY PACIFIC ducked out at the start,
was righted to race in the last flight between foes, was prompted to advance while angling out five wide racing into the lane advancing in tandem with
several rivals and continued with interest while just missing for second. COME ON DOVER, momentarily caught in close quarters at the start, was held up
between foes in early stages, shifted outside foes racing into the turn, angled six wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to gain some
position. SEBA'S DANCER angled inwards to track just off the second flight between foes racing three deep into the turn, shifted out to split rivals four wide
in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. GALAHAD KID settled well off the field racing to the turn and passed outside some tiring rivals in the
closing stages. NORTHERNBRILLIANCE tracked off the second flight racing four wide into the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch and steadily
faded. PREACHER TIME, caught in close quarters at the start, quickly recovered to track off the first flight three deep racing into the turn, continued in
pursuit of the leader to upper stretch and gave way in the drive. SHO POKE angled inside tracking just off the first flight racing into the turn and gave way
after a half. SOUTHSIDER angled inwards to prompt the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn and gave way after a half. DANCIN NICKY angled
to the inside early tracking off the second flight and retreated early.

Footnotes
TRAPPE VALLEY came away well but settled back to track the leading pair, encroached upon them three wide on the turn, continued to stalk them three
wide into the lane, kept on outside of BYBEE as he took the lead in upper stretch, took the lead with a furlong remaining, kept on under a drive and held
sway. BYBEE stalked outside of the pacesetter, pressed him two wide through the turn, wrested the lead into the stretch, kept on as TRAPPE VALLEY
continued to loom outside him to midstretch, was headed by that foe with a furlong to go, kept on well inside but could not regain the lead. IMPRESSED
chased midpack down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, was taken five wide into the lane, rallied outside in the final furlong but could not get
to the leading pair in time. LYKAN tracked the leading pair inside of TRAPPE VALLEY early, continued in the pocket on the turn, was driven two wide in the
lane and proved no match. FORTIFIED EFFORT raced in second last early, settled back to race two wide in the rear flight into the turn, took the turn in the
five path, kept on mildly three wide in the lane but ultimately proved no threat. FIRERY TALE settled at the rear, raced with the rear flight in the two to three
path on the turn, and offered no rally in the lane. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER was hustled for speed inside, was urged to maintain his lead while saving ground
on the turn, lost the lead to BYBEE into the lane, and weakened inside.

Footnotes
BRECHIN'S COMMAND, forwardly placed three deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the turn to press the issue outside a rival, dueled for
command into upper stretch and was driven clear. VALIANT LADY broke readily, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin racing into
the turn, dueled for command on the bend to upper stretch but proved no match late. AUBREY angled to to the inside tracking off the second flight racing
into the bend, shifted outside foes to race in the four path through the lane and edged a rival for a share in the closing stages. LIL BIT TIPSEY settled inside
foes in early stages, saved ground to upper stretch and gained some position in an even effort. LILLET, slow to gather stride, switched off the inside but
offered no rally while passing some tiring foes in the last furlong. EADS BRIDGE broke readily, prompted the pace between foes in the opening stages,
angled in nearing the turn to track just off the first flight and steadily faded after a half. TRUE TO JEANINE, caught five wide in the opening stages tracking
off the second flight, continued outside foes into the turn and faded into the lane. LEISHLANICK gained a forward placing while being rated just off the first
flight in the opening stages, altered course slightly nearing the turn to track the leaders outside a rival racing into the bend, made brief progress racing
through the turn but came up empty in the drive. ICE ATTACK dropped out early.
