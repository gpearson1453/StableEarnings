mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then finished gamely and gained steadily to the end. NEWS FLASH showed early speed, was headed
near the turn, stalked along the fence to the stretch, lost his path and came off the rail a furlong out then finished gamely. ALL INCLUSIVE forced the pace,
led into the turn, was joined mid turn, dueled, shook clear at the top of the stretch was passed in the late stages. KID FORESTER stumbled leaving the gate,

Footnotes
SLEEK LYNX (GB) raced in mid pack, closed two-wide late turn, rallied, led in the final furlong and drove clear. GOTE GO settled in mid pack, was hustled
two-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and gained steadily to the end. IN MY OPINION stalked the pacesetter, chased three-wide into the stretch, rallied
determinedly but evened out late. BELIEVING showed brief early speed, stalked the pace, bid a furlong out but failed to match strides. AMERICAN
BOURBON sprinted clear early, set a reserved pace, drifted out mid stretch, was passed in the final furlong and gave way. ON A TOUR raced from off the
pace, was hustled two to four-wide late turn, launched an all out stretch drive but showed no late gain. SHOW ME THE GOLD settled off the pace, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. MUNNYFOR RO raced off the pace, was hustled late turn then evened out in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
LOOKINATAMIRACLE stalked the pace, rode the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch, bid in the final furlong and prevailed under a drive. SOUPER HOT
stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied, bid in the final furlong but was outfinished. CHECKERBOARD FLOOR
showed early speed, was engaged briefly, led on the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was collared in the final furlong and was outfinished. ARI
GOLD SPEEDWAGN bumped ENNIS THE MENACE at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the turn then rallied late outside. MONEY
MATTERS settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then rallied gamely in vain. KAILI'S BIG BOY broke outward, settled in touch, chased
five-wide on the turn then evened out in the final 16th. BACHELOR PAD bumped ENNIS THE MENACE leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, came
four-wide through the turn, was all out in the stretch but evened out with a 16th still on tap. ENNIS THE MENACE, bumped from both sides at the outset,
raced from off the pace, closed along the rail on the turn but never reached contention. ROCKCREST forced the issue, drew even entering the turn, gave
way, chased to the stretch and flattened out.
