CHRISTY JACKSON cleared quickly and assumed command down along the inside on the backstretch, maintained lead into the turn and into the stretch in
the three path and powered away. SIX EIGHTEEN chased leader two wide on the backstretch, enter turn two wide and into the stretch, never threatened
leader while being a clear second. LOUDER CALIFORNIA stalked pace along the inside throughout the backstretch and into the turn, responded to urging
in the stretch and rallied up for third. MILLIE JOEL tracked leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and into the stretch in the three path,
kept to task and edged late for third. SUGARATSUNDOWN chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside and had to
steady early on the turn and lacked a rally thereafter.
