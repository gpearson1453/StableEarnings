Footnotes
PLAMEN came out a bit at the break, corrected and gained a slim lead to the inside of MARKET CAP, dueled under rating while racing towards the rail,
came under pressure approaching the lane, shook clear under left handed rousing in mid stretch and held firm while hand ridden the final seventy yards.
EXCURSION settled in the clear and in closest pursuit of the embattled leaders, came under a ride near the far turn, moved up three wide to have aim
entering the lane, drifted in briefly near the three sixteenths, corrected but lacked a serious finish. MARKET CAP dueled outside the winner, drifted out
under a drive near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. ROMP , unhurried early, advanced some three wide into the stretch, was getting in near the three
sixteenths, corrected with left handed asking and had some belated interest. LET US MAKE GOLD , in tight at the break, was outrun.

Footnotes
OUR STAR , under a firm hold early while saving ground, angled out past the five eighths, moved up wide into the far turn, bid four wide outside the leader
nearing the lane, struck the top soon into the stretch, kicked clear under solid handling, turned away a mild threat in mid stretch and widened while kept to
task. BEYOND FOREVER settled inside, angled out near the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch, ranged up to loom in mid stretch but flattened out.
REILTIN OIR rated off the leaders heading to the first turn, pulled her way forward and bid three deep to command near the five eighths, cleared after a half
mile, dug in briefly when threatened past the quarter pole then weakened in the final furlong. COSITA RICA pressed two wide, raced between foes past the
five eighths, pursued into the far turn then tired. HELL OF AFIRE took over early, set the pace towards the inside, could not fend off a challenge near the
five eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA bumped and forced out ALWAYS SOMETHING when bearing out at the break, hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid
stretch, was under brisk urging and drew off. GIFTED HEART disputed the pace outside the winner, failed to match strides with that one the final furlong but
finished willingly to hold the place. DEEP RED bumped with ALWAYS SOMETHING soon after the break, raced off the rail, angled out in mid stretch and
lacked the needed rally in an even effort. ALWAYS SOMETHING , jostled leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
HOLLIS sped to the front, set a rated pace towards the inside, edged away a bit when roused into the lane, kept on under strong right handed
encouragement past mid stretch, widened near the sixteenth pole then was fully extended to hold off COMPLETED PASS. COMPLETED PASS broke a
step slow, was hustled up between rivals soon after, was under pressure chasing mid turn, swung four to five wide into the lane, straightened away and
made a grinding run to gain. LOVE YOU MUCH was shuffled back in the opening furlong, saved ground while trailing past the five sixteenths, angled out
into the lane, dropped back in for the final furlong and closed steadily to nab the show. TEXAS WEDGE rated between foes early on, pulled his way forward
past the five sixteenths, eased out with aim on the winner past the three sixteenths but came up empty. FRANCATELLI , away alertly, rated outside the
winner, came under pressure into the lane and faded in the final furlong. TIGER BLOOD was hung out four deep nearing the turn, remained off the rail while
pursuing mid turn but lacked a bid. TEMPT ME TWICE flashed speed inside, chased into the turn then faded.

NOBODY KNEW sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, pulled away through the stretch and was under urging in the drive. NATTY BEAU
raced in the two path between horses around the turn and in the stretch and finished gamely. CAMP PENDLETON , briefly steadied when shuffled back
near the five eighths pole, circled the turn three wide and weakened the final furlong. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON saved ground on the turn, swung outside
near the eighth pole and showed a mild, late move. MANKLIN CREEK bumped with CANTWAITTOBEKING when coming in at the break, saved ground on
the turn and failed to rally. PEPE AND HEYWOOD , fractious in the starting gate, soundly bumped CANTWAIITOBEKING when bearing out at the break,
was a forward factor along the inner rail to mid stretch then faltered. STRICTLY BUSINESS raced in the three path on the turn while outrun.
CANTWAITTOBEKING bobbled when soundly bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three deep and was outrun. CHICO CON ALEX retreated.

Footnotes
A GREAT TIME broke inward a bit and bumped with a rival, drafted back well off the pace while saving ground, raced under patiently handling while edging
up into the lane, swung out and found clear sailing leaving mid stretch, leveled off when switching over to her correct lead, surged past rivals and went clear
in the final yards. MR. AL'S GAL , urged off the pace, dropped down near the turn, raced about three wide while picking up some momentum into the lane,
dropped in towards the fence, rallied along the inside to threaten for the lead past the sixteenth marker and continued gamely for the place. ODE TO JOY
saved ground mid turn, angled out in upper stretch, boldly split rivals leaving mid stretch and kept on with interest. WILD ABOUT STAR had speed then was
rated back off the leaders nearing the turn, rated kindly to the inside of rivals mid turn, eased out three wide into the lane, bid to clear in mid stretch, could
not resist challenges past the sixteenth marker and faded. DENDROBIA , in tight at the break, fell well off the early pace, came wide for the drive and had
belated action. JO JO AIR had speed between rivals then was shuffled back in the opening furlong, regrouped and moved up towards the inside mid turn,
angled four wide into the lane, chased on her left lead and faded. PEACEFUL , three wide with pursuit, angled five wide nearing the stretch and came up
empty. NOT IN JEOPARDY , three to four wide off the pace, swung six wide and lacked a bid. HEAR MY PRAYER rushed early, forced the pace between
foes into the turn, chased past the five sixteenths and weakened. GIGGLING had speed inside foes and handled some pressure, shook clear, raced two
wide into the lane and tired. CAPTAIN SAM forced the pace three wide outside rivals and tired. FOOLISH HUMOR , away alertly, vied four to five wide
outside rivals, checked when floated out leaving the far turn and faltered.
