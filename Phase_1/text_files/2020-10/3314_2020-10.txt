UNTILWEMEETAGAIN never far back, angled outside nearing the quarter pole, responded readily when set down, made the lead in deep stretch and
finished full of run to win going away. TIO PERICO pressed the pace along the rail into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, drifted to the five path,
remained on control until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. JAMAICAN MAGIC stalked the pace down the backstretch, loomed boldly three
wide nearing the quarter pole, drifted to the six path then faded. FAST FAIRY had speed for a half then weakened. TAURUS C failed to menace. NANTAN
close up inside, dropped back on the turn. J J JUNIOR was hustled along to set the early pace two wide, had speed into the stretch then gave way. PAHALL

MOBIL SONG stalked the pace into the stretch, drifted out to the five path bumping the runner up before the furlong marker, exchanged bumps with that one
through deep stretch and got up in the final strides three wide. THISGIRLISGOLDEN allowed to settle, closed four wide into the stretch in the five path, was
bumped before the furlong marker, leaned on the winner through the final stages exchanging bumps and gamely got up for second. CHECK OUT LINE
allowed to settle, closed willingly along the rail through the stretch. ROLLIN SO WICKED dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, shook clear, set the
balance of the pace and was outfinished in the final yards. PISTOL PACKIN BOS passed tiring rivals. SO GO MY LUCEILLE had brief speed. ADVENTURE
LAND contested the early lead along the inside through the turn then stopped. THE RIDER OF THISGIRLISGOLDEN LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF MOBIL SONG FOR INTERFERENCE THROUGH THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MOBIL
SONG AND PLACED HER SECOND.

KNOCKOUT RANGER allowed to settle, rallied three wide in the six path to engage the leaders past the furlong marker, battled to the wire and proved best
by the narrowest of margins in the final strides. CONDUCIVE chased the pace into the stretch, rallied two wide in the five path to make the lead past the
furlong marker and just missed hanging on. DOROTHYS BOY broke in front and quickly opened a daylight lead, set the pace until deep stretch then
weakened. SMOOTH TALKIN TOM was no factor. NETAS was never close, lost contact with his field on the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
ENJOY BASEBALL chased the pace into the stretch, slipped through near the inside to make the lead, shook clear in the four path and just lasted under
right handed urging. LABYRINTH never far back, moved up steadily in the six path and just missed. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB trailed into the stretch, swung
wide and closed rapidly in the middle of the racetrack. CREATIVE COURAGE allowed to settle, finished with good courage in the seven path. TEMPLE
MOUNT made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path and weakened. ZEKE THE STREAK hopped at the start,
chased the pace three wide into the stretch then gave way. MO TRAMP was through early.
