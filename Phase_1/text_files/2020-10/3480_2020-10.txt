ROLL THE STONE tracked the pacesetters, swung out five wide into the lane and ran down leader. BRING HOME STANLEY contested the lead, while
three wide leaving the backstretch, drew clear at the quarter pole and was caught late. PROVOCATIVE PRINCE saved ground in range, angled out to the
two path into the far turn then came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, rallied from just off the rail and was out kicked. RED CHOCOLATE raced
outside at the back of the pack and lacked a closing response. HE'S CRIMSON CODE hurried inside and was unable to keep pace with the field.
EYEOPENERBOB vied two wide in the early stages then was overtaken at the three eighths pole and faltered.

Footnotes
FACTORED IN sat outside in striking range, asked to quicken near the five sixteen marker, drove five wide and won driving. TRANG trailed the field from
just off the rail, swung out then closed outside and was along late for place. REDNECK REMARK set a pressured pace while four wide, edged away into the
lane and weakened inside late. REFLECTIONOFVALUES tracked five wide early, chased three wide from the three eighths marker, fanned four wide and
lacked the needed rally. TEN'S LEGACY settled inside then was bumped in the backstretch and had no response when called upon. SWEAR VENGENCE
hustled away then was bumped inside rival early, pressed two wide then was unable to move on with foes and tired into the stretch.

wide into the opening turn, lodged a bid nearing the three sixteenth pole and flattened out. WILA MIST dwelt leaving the gate then hurried to the opening
turn and lacked a bid. ELECTRIC FEEL brushed leaving the gate, chased in the two path then jumped over falling horse and yielded. STRONGER FOR

four wide, dueled outside of WEDGE POND then fell losing the rider, did not finished and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted
an inquiry in the final turn involving JUMRATAN but made no change after review. JUMRATAN fell in the turn.

SHARP DRESSED BEAU vied in the three path, seized command with a furlong remaining and won driving. SIR BRONX raced at the back of the pack
while three wide, closed outside under encouragement and got by late for place honors. ZIPPITY ZAP sat just off the pace inside, vied through the final turn
and yielded late. ROLLIN SEVENS lagged early, gained closer order with two furlongs remaining and rallied belatedly. STORMCHASER contested the early
pace from between rivals, rallied two wide into the lane and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. BAR NO Q sat in range and lacked a kick.

WHISKEY BOUND allowed to settle off the pace in the three path, was asked to quicken near the five sixteenth, was headed into the stretch and edged
away late. SHIMSHINE saved ground from just off the rail then was coaxed into the final turn, shifted out to the four path and was up just in time for second.
GO AWAY sat in striking position outside of REGAL MAX, moved up alongside the fore mentioned through the far turn, rallied between rivals nearing the
stretch and weakened late inside. RAIL HUGGER lagged throughout then started to close the gap leaving the final turn, angled out mid stretch and missed.
REGAL MAX led the field through the backstretch, took pressure into the far turn and faltered.

RISING REVOLUTION allowed to settle off the pacesetters along the rail, advanced quickly inside into the far turn then angled out racing three wide into the
lane, swept the lead and kicked away. WILSON vied three wide entering the backstretch, dueled outside of HERE COMES BARNEY through the far turn,
gain a short advantage after the quarter pole and was out kicked. REGAL CANDY trailed outside early, came under coaxing leaving the final turn and rallied
belatedly to earn show. STUMPANATOR reserved off the early pacesetters in the four path, chased four wide and was caught deep stretch. ROBBI'S
RIVER RUN offered little. HERE COMES BARNEY vied inside leaving the chute, gained slim advantage leaving the backstretch then responded to
challenge from WILSON and wilted with two furlongs remaining. ROMAN STEEL contested the pace from between rivals and retired early.

SOLO RING set the pace along the rail under a snug hold, responded to challenge from DUNE D'ORO at the quarter pole and held sway. DUNE D'ORO sat
in striking position while three wide, moved up alongside SOLO RING to challenge the lead, rallied determinedly outside but was unable to get by.
ZICATELA tracked from the four path, bid three wide from the three eighths, rallied gradually outside and just missed. AT ATTENTION dwelt leaving, gained
closer contention into the lane and closed gamely late. MASKWECIS saved ground, asked to quicken near the five sixteenth marker, drove four wide and
rallied late. BARE BACK JACK saved from rail, angled out and lacked a response when called upon. IRISH TRICK vied between foes, was unable to move
on with rivals after the half and faded through the stretch. ABOVE THE MOON outrun throughout. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an
inquiry into the star of the race but made no change as AT ATTENTION dwelt and it was determined to have had a fair start.

Footnotes
TIMELESS TALES raced near the back of the field, advanced quickly through the far turn, bid five wide into the stretch and drove clear. MY SAMURAI
WARRIOR vied two wide into the opening turn, hustled up to contest the pace, dueled through the final turn outside of VENDING MACHINE, gained a slim
advantage at the head of the stretch and was caught mid stretch. INDICATIVE out sprinted leaving the opening turn then settled off the dueling pacesetters,
chased through the far turn then swung out three wide but failed to improve position through the drive and held on for show. BIG EGYPT saved ground mid
pack, chased from the three eighths, bid three wide into the stretch and evened out late. MARK YE WELL was under a snug hold early in traffic, raced four
wide leaving the backstretch, angled out sharply with a furlong remaining and finished well with good energy. AWESOME ANTHONY was taken up in close
quarters approaching the opening turn, swung wide into the lane and closed late. VENDING MACHINE clear the lead into the backstretch, contended the
pace inside MY SAMURAI WARRIOR and gave way late stretch. BOLSANO sat mid pack outside, lodged a three wide bid from the three eighths and failed
to threaten in the drive. WARREN'S VAN GOGH saved ground and lacked bid. ALBERTA BOUND outrun throughout. WILL TO GOLD chased four wide
into the backstretch and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. STEELFORCE showed little.

IMPOSING CAT last away then hustled outside, angled in sharply entering the opening turn, gained closer order entering the lane, shifted out quickly to the
four path and won driving. MADE FOR SATURDAY hustled away, angled towards the inside rail leaving the backstretch, found running room along the rail
into the lane and was out finished. LONG TIME DON raced four wide into the first turn, circled into the lane then rallied steadily outside and missed.
LOOKIECOOKIE fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, encountered traffic then swung out sharply near the three sixteenth pole and closed well.
BIONIC BIRD sent for outside speed, prompted action at the three eighths pole, dueled outside of TRANSPLANT entering the lane, was headed into the
stretch and weakened inside. TRANSPLANT vied hard inside, dueled through the final turn inside of BIONIC BIRD and gave way into the stretch. SYNNIN
hurried away, chased outside into the lane and passed tiring. OIL CHANGE lacked early speed inside and showed a mild interest late. PHIL POWER
hurried four wide in the opening stages, chased in traffic at the head of the lane, steadied after the three sixteenth pole and yielded. TALKIN' BULL failed to
menace. PEYTONS PRINCE vied four wide early, was unable to move on with rivals in the final turn, checked hard at the top of the stretch and retreated.
POP'S LITTLE GIRL outrun throughout. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch of the race but made no change.
