Footnotes
BALL LIGHTNING stalked the pace three wide, reached near even terms leaving the quarter pole, dueled outside of CRYSTAL COAST through the lane
and edged ahead late. CRYSTAL COAST set the pace in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane, fought
on inside of the winner past the sixteenth pole but was outfinished in the latter yards. IRAZU was shuffled back early, angled to the rail nearing the turn,
advanced inside to midstretch, tipped out leaving the eighth pole and lacked the needed rally. V K STAR came out and bumped BLUE EYED KITTEN at the
start, talked the pace three wide, came under a drive around the turn and had no response. MASTERING BELA bumped BLUE EYE KITTEN at the start,
had brief speed two wide, dropped back around the turn, came six wide into the lane and continued to fade. BLUE EYE KITTEN was bumped between foes
at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. WORKIN ECLIPTICAL was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
UNCLE PIP began to get going after a half-mile in the three-path, rallied to overtake the leaders passing the eighth-pole under a drive, and was confidently
handled through the last 70 yards. SIDARTH moved off the inside to go after the leaders coming to the quarter-pole, challenged outside CON PERMISO
and MONDAY'S WITH MIKE through upper stretch, stayed on his left lead and could not kick on with the top one. WATER CAY was outrun to the stretch in
the two-path, shifted out a couple paths and rallied mildly to go clear of the rest. TESTIFIED trailed early near the inside, angled out sharply forcing GRAB
THE CHANCE into THE METHOD at the top of the stretch, and improved for the last major share. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE pressed the pace from outside
to the stretch, and shortened stride on his left lead through the furlong grounds. CON PERMISO bumped lightly with GRAB THE CHANCE at the start,
contested the pace between horses into the turn, and faltered in the stretch. THE METHOD was going along four wide in the second flight when bumped by
GRAB THE CHANCE and forced out six or seven wide at the top of the lane, and tired. NEW ACCOUNT was no factor three wide. GRAB THE CHANCE
bumped lightly with THE METHOD at the start, was forwardly placed early, got bumped by TESTIFIED and forced out into THE METHOD near the
three-sixteenths pole, and dropped far back. RUN AWAY SON argued the pace inside rivals to midway on the turn, and was finished after six furlongs.

GREAT SISTER DIANE was squeezed back soon after the start, made progress between foes down the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the far turn,
tipped two wide near the quarter pole, struck the front in midstretch and powered clear while ridden out. PICARA set the pace along the rail, led to
midstretch and held well for the place while no match for the winner. FUJAIRAH saved ground off the pace for five furlongs, angled out in upper stretch and
was along for the show. STARSHIP NALA pressed the pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. CROWN AND SUGAR had early speed three wide and
faded around the turn.

Footnotes
TRISOMIA saved ground well out of things to the top of the stretch, opted to stay inside coming to the eighth-pole, got through on the fence in deep stretch
and finished with a flourish to win going away. DREAM D'ORO set the pace slightly off the rail to the stretch, stayed on with good courage and was able to
save the place. TAAMER got bumped by THREE DEEP at the start, stayed in range two then three wide to the head of the lane, and needed more late.
PURECRAZIDUDE dropped back a bit through the turn, lodged a bid along the inside through the furlong grounds, then flattened out in the two-path late.
UNCAPTURED KING was outrun early, swung out four or five wide approaching the stretch, and gained without threatening. DON H came in at the start
forcing MACHO D'ORO into THREE DEEP, pressed the pace outside for a half-mile, and gave way. THREE DEEP got pushed in, crowded and bumped
between horses at the start, and was outrun. MACHO D'ORO steadied after getting pushed in and bumped between horses at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK set a clear pace along the rail and widened under a drive. PALADIO tracked the winner from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter
pole, could not gain on the winner but finished willingly to be a clear second best. CARSON CITY KID stalked the pace two wide, came three wide into the
lane and finished evenly. C. P. A. GENIUS brushed with FLORALA AL at the start, raced two wide and lacked a closing bid. FLORALA AL was reluctant to
load, brushed at the start, chased the pace three wide, got out a bit nearing the lane and retreated. CASALSA was bumped at the start, saved ground
throughout, bled and was easing through the lane.

SEXY DREAM broke alertly and was nursed along on a short lead through easy early fractions, shook off bids from LIESEL and BABY LION turning for
home, widened through the furlong grounds under a mild drive and was hand urged the last sixteenth of a mile. LIESEL raced two wide, challenged for
command between horses five-sixteenths out, proved no match for the leader and ran on best of the others. FACTS ONLY saved ground in range to the far
turn, swung three wide approaching the stretch and outfinished the remainder. BABY LION pressed the pace outside for six furlongs, and gave way through
the stretch. SAMURAI FIGHTER broke a step slowly, raced three to four wide throughout, and tired after six furlongs. INDY FRONT moved inside around
the first turn, and made no impact. TREES THUNDER got bumped lightly by BEAUTIFUL TIZ at the start, lacked room into the first turn and steadied along
under a firm hold, and dropped far back after six furlongs. BEAUTIFUL TIZ stumbled badly bumping into TREES THUNDER and unseating the rider at the
start, completed a circuit of the course, and was apprehended and escorted off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE
RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

CREATE AGAIN set a rated pace along the rail, drew off nearing the lane and widened readily while ridden out. MY POINT EXACTLY hugged the rail at the
rear of the field and stayed on well enough to best the rest. TOUPHA chased the winner four wide around the turn and never threatened. PONT DU GARD
chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. JUST THE FACTS stalked the winner two wide and retreated nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
SEPTEMBERTEN bumped with COMPANY STORE looking to get off the inside entering the turn, ranged up to challenge outside UNPUBLISHED and
LEGAL DEAL after a half-mile, battled with the latter through a long drive and proved best in the closing yards. LEGAL DEAL vied outside UNPUBLISHED
from the start, got the best of that battle turning for home, dug in stubbornly while drifting out and was bested late. R MERCEDES BOY bumped with
UNPUBLISHED at the start, advanced while shifting out four wide near the quarter-pole, loomed outside the leaders through upper stretch, but was
outkicked. VALIANT APPEAL saved ground throughout, and improved for a share without becoming a factor. SANDYS BLAZE broke out bumping
COMPANY STORE, came five wide off the turn, and passed only tired horses. UNPUBLISHED bumped with R MERCEDES BOY at the start, dueled inside
LEGAL DEAL for a half-mile, and weakened into the lane. QUICK STEP ED was outrun three to four wide. COMPANY STORE got bumped by SANDYS
BLAZE at the start, bumped with SEPTEMBERTEN entering the turn, and faltered four wide into the lane.

R UNCLE ERIC sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, hit the rail entering the turn, raced a bit off the inside around the bend,
continued on the left lead in the lane, responded to a bid in midstretch and edged away again under a drive. TOOK A CAB settled off the early pace outside,
raced three wide around most of the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied for the place. DEBBIE'S ROAD saved ground off the pace, tipped out in
upper stretch, continued on the left lead, moved into contention nearing midstretch then flattened out. COLD WARRIOR chased the winner three wide and
was one-paced in the lane. SHORTLISTER stalked the winner two wide, angled in nearing the lane, bid inside near the eighth pole then weakened through
the final furlong. MAQUIAVELO brushed with SWINGIN ON A STAR at the start, raced three wide and failed to menace. SWINGIN ON A STAR brushed at
the start, was pinched back soon after, raced two wide and never threatened.
