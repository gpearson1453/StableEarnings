Footnotes
FILLE D'ESPRIT , eased off the rail leaving the backstretch, stalked the pace two wide around the turn, took command approaching the eighth pole, was put
to the whip and drew out. STAY OUT sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, angled in, hugged the rail around the turn and was no match for the winner.
GOTTAFLATHAVEHER , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened through the stretch. MISSIMARD raced along the innner rail most of the
trip and was not a factor. VOILA BABY , three wide on the turn, steadily retreated the final three furlongs. PAZ THE WINE raced in the two path around the
turn while outrun.

Footnotes
WHISPURRING KITTEN rated kindly stalking the pace, responded when asked two to three wide in upper stretch, secured command leaving the three
sixteenths, spurted clear under right handed rousing then held firm while kept to task. BELLY FLOP settled along the inside, moved up while continuing
along the rail into the stretch, shifted out from behind rivals leaving the three sixteenths and closed steadily. SEA STORY bore out at the break and bumped
with a rival, lagged well back while saving some ground, swung very wide for the final furlong, straightened and closed willingly. MISS OLD BAY sped clear
early, set the pace towards the rail, was collared in upper stretch, kept on willingly past the furlong grounds then faded late. IMAGINE VICTORY , fractious
and reluctant to load, saved ground off the pace, swung four wide making some headway into the lane and churned on. PERFECT KIND rated behind foes
leaving the far turn, angled three to four wide in upper stretch but lacked a bid. OLD LINE MAGIC , checked and forced out leaving the half mile marker,
recovered to move up four wide outside rivals past the three eighths, chased past mid stretch then faded. ORBETTE , three wide advancing between
runners mid turn, pursued to mid stretch then gave way. SING ALONG SUZY , between rivals mid turn, shifted in and faded. CONGA IN PARIS , bumped
and off slow, saved ground around the turn but lacked a rally. BELIEF CURE checked then shuffled back early, raced off the inside and faded. YEYETZI
flashed speed, was getting out past the half mile marker and faltered.

CLOSER LOOK dropped in and secured the rail soon after the break, pulled his way forward while saving ground past the five eighths, was patiently
handled mid way on the final turn, found room inside rivals leaving mid stretch, surged to command under a drive in deep stretch and held firm.
BACKWOODS BOOGIE rated close up three wide, bid outside a pair of rivals heading to the quarter pole, dueled past the furlong grounds and continued
gamely. JAMMINWITHBRANDON checked when a bit rank off the heels of a rival into the first turn, recovered and settled well off the pace, saved ground
leaving the five sixteenths, moved up in upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong grounds and finished well. BELLARMINE HALL settled off the pace and
off the rail, awaited some room leaving the far turn, edged up behind runners in upper stretch, eased out and rallied between. KINETIC SWAGGER tracked
the pace under some rating, bid between rivals heading to the quarter pole, dueled on a short lead past the furlong grounds, was overtaken past the
sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. MAKE A STAND stalked inside, eased out to have aim into the lane but one paced late. ABSALOM cleared early,
set the pace towards the inside, came off the rail when collared near the lane and weakened in the last eighth. THATWOULDBEGRAND , in range off the
rail, was under a drive chasing past the five sixteenths but came up empty. DADDY'S COZY settled off the pace, circled four wide into the lane but lacked a
bid. SARASOTA BOY lost ground four wide, chased to the far turn then faltered.

TOWN OF GOLD tracked the three pronged pace battle while saving ground, shifted out near the three sixteenths, made a grinding run under a drive and
got up in the final yards. GALLANT GEORGE went up between foes nearing the turn to contest the pace, gained a slim lead while being brushed and
sparring to the inside of HIGH LIMIT ROOM in mid stretch, maintained a tenuous advantage to deep stretch but wasn't quite good enough. HIGH LIMIT
ROOM , bumped at the break, advanced outside foes past the five eighths then bid three deep into the turn, vied under some rating then poked a head in
front entering the stretch, drifted in and brushed with GALLANT GEORGE in mid stretch then kept on trying to the wire. ARDANWOOD broke outward and
bumped with a rival, corrected and settled well wide, started a run leaving the far turn, progressed five wide into the lane and churned on. YOU ARE
AWESOME settled well back, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, raced three to four wide in upper stretch and had some late action.
DELAWARE DESTROYER , three deep early, emerged to race in the clear mid turn, chased into the lane but came up empty. UNIDENTIFIED MAN saved
ground under some rating around the turn, eased out and was put to some pressure in upper stretch then had belated interest. WICKED PRANKSTER sped
to the front, was joined by a pair of runners nearing the turn, dueled along the rail to upper stretch then weakened. CRACK THE SAFE was shuffled back
while saving ground heading to the turn, remained inside but failed to menace. VIRGINIA FIB , three wide between foes early, angled six wide for the drive
but lacked a rally. INDEFATIGABLE chased outside a rival and weakened in the drive. FILIGREE was checked between rivals leaving the far turn and
dropped back.

Footnotes
GALERIO prompted the pace outside dueling rivals for five furlongs, moved up to take command entering the stretch, drifted out a bit in the drive and dug in
tenaciously. THUNDERSHOOK , two wide between horses on the turn, angled to the five path in mid stretch and rallied outside the winner. TOUGHEST
'OMBRE stumbled when bumped by UNMATCHABLE soon after the break, circled the turn four deep, was fanned to the six path in mid stretch and finished
willingly. BIG CITY BOB saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail in upper stretch, was blocked in mid stretch, was taken to the three path
near the eighth pole and failed to menace. ROUGH SEA lacked speed behind horses on the turn, swung out for the drive, was fanned to the seven path in
mid stretch and failed to be a factor. FOREVAMO disputed the pace two wide and gave way approaching the eighth pole. UNMATCHABLE drifted out
leaving the starting gate, disputed the pace while hugging the rail and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
GALE , a bit headstrong early, pulled her way clear around the first turn, relaxed through the backstretch run while setting the pace towards the rail, opened
up leaving the far turn, responded when put to some solid asking in mid stretch then was ridden out to late. AMPLIO ESQUEMA settled off the inside,
moved some into the far turn, circled three to four wide into the stretch and kept on willingly to outdo BEGONIA for the place. BEGONIA angled off the inside
early on, rated about three wide, advanced after being given her cue past the half mile marker, pursued the winner into the stretch but flattened out late.
GIFTED TALENT was checked back from between runners soon after the break, found herself well back past the five eighths, angled three wide to
commence a bit of a run leaving the far turn and continued with effort despite threatening. ALONG THE WAY saved ground, eased out for the drive but
lacked a bid. THEGOODMIND (IRE) chased the pace and weakened in upper stretch. TALE LIGHTS lagged off the pace, angled out near the five
sixteenths but failed to rally. PLAY CHARADES stalked the winner two to three wide, was under pressure leaving the half mile marker and faltered.
