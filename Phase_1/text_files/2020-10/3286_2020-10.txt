IT'S SO EASY lacked speed, moved very wide advancing into the stretch and drew away under moderate pressure. FLEETERTHAN well placed behind the
dueling leaders, bid easily at the quarter pole, led between calls and continued gamely. TWIRLING LIZ vied along the inside to the top of the stretch and
weakened. BELLA G dropped back inside then offered some late energy. CONGAREE ROSE dueled outside to the top of the stretch and weakened. FLY
TIME trailed throughout losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
TIZ A DATE moved clear into the first turn, held off repeated challenges in the lane in a steady drive. NANCY B settled off the leaders, angled inside on the
final turn then made a gradual gain. SUPERGIRL POWER prompted the pace inside for half a mile, moved outside and finished willingly. SAVANNAH'S
DREAM saved ground, was put to urging after half a mile with a mild bid. FREE COFFEE forced the pace between rivals for half a mile then weakened.
FLORENCIA raced close up wide between rivals and was finished on the final turn. LOST POINT lagged far behind, moved wide in the stretch while closing
the gap. WITH ME WITHOUT ME dropped back early and was always outrun. LION AND THE WOLF was urged just off the leader four wide and stopped
abruptly. KISSKISS TELLTELL lacked speed and was never in contention.

Footnotes
IRISH COLONEL, just off the rail and pace, fought determinedly and got the lead in deep stretch. TEAK, the speedster, stumbled then was bumped leaving
the gate, saved ground and took the lead midway on the turn, drifted out slightly and gave way begrudgingly. DEVINE DENTAL set the early pace in four
path allowing rival to rally inside, drifted wider entering the lane and held on well. GRAVES ISLAND, three wide dueling for the early lead, faded. RAGE
AWAY came in and bumped TEAK leaving the gate then failed to menace. THOUSAND PERCENT, close up early while outside, bore out and tired.
HIZAAM, wide, failed to threaten.

STAYNSIDETHECIRCLE, inside and far back early, swung out six wide on the backstretch, bore into stretch, closed near the middle of the course and was
just up. GOTTA GET AWAY saved ground throughout, waited briefly for racing room near straight, continued inside and battled gamely to the wire.
ECLIPSED MOON broke slowly, raced very wide, took the lead near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. TRILOGY saved ground early, split rivals on the
far turn, moved out wider and lacked a strong closing kick. CLOONTIA set the pace just off the rail and faded late. GOLDEN SPEAR raced wide and failed
to be a serious threat. SPIDER JORGENSEN saved ground and showed little. SMART AND TOUGH stalked the pace two wide then stopped. Fractional
times were unavailable.

the stretch and weakened in a game effort. WINNING DRIVE saved ground early, moved out in the stretch and closed well. THE GREAT SAMURAI chased
outside, drifted wider in the stretch and faltered. MISTER HUMOR chased wide, dropped back on the turn and was no factor. SMART ROYAL T trailed
early, moved inside on the turn then proved empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
FINGLAS broke slowest as the horses left the starting gate twenty four minutes past scheduled post time, was outrun early, advanced steadily between,
moved out a bit for the stretch, took the lead leaving furlong grounds and quickly drew off driving. WORTH HIS SALT set the pace in the three path, resisted
when challenged but was no match. NOBLE KENT racing outside winner, failed to sustain his bid. KID MAC COOL came out the start, causing crowding,
raced out from the rail, moved in then tired. HOWBOUTDEMPATS was far back early then passed tiring foes. BANKER'S ISLAND took up then clipped
heels racing into the first turn, remained inside and failed to menace. SLOT came in leaving the gate contributing to the crowding after the start, raced two
wide then tired. HIGH FLYING GUY had his heels clipped racing into the first turn, saved ground in second flight then gave way in the final quarter.
STORMY JUSTIN steadied when bothered leaving the gate then raced very wide. THE MONEY TRAIN broke slowly then was never a factor. DIAMOND
SQUARE bothered leaving the gate, failed to menace. DON POLO stopped suddenly after a half and was eased.
