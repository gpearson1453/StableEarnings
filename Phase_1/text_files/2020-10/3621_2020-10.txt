Footnotes
PEQUENO MONTE pressed the pace from the inside but off the rail, forged to the front once in the stretch, and drew clear driving. TIGER'S SONG lacked
early, raced two wide to the stretch and finished willingly. LORD VADER set the pace outside and weakened leaving the furlong pole. DUCHAMP stalked
three wide into the lane but lacked a rally. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET flashed speed from the inside to the stretch and weakened. TEXAS BOB was unhurried
early, came four wide to the stretch but went evenly in the lane. SECOND BOLD was in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. WILD WAGER
lacked any early speed then closed too late. LUCKY CAUSE showed little.

CARTOONIST rushed up from the rail to gain command in the opening quarter, set all of the pace and held determinedly. WHOA BUDDY was unhurried
early, came through inside on the turn, loomed a bold factor at the head of the lane but could not gain. STRIKE IT LUCKY settled, was forced four wide on
the turn but had no rally. GLORY CALL showed good speed to the quarter pole then had nothing left.

FULL OF PEPPER raced within easy striking distance early, came through two wide into the stretch, split rivals and just got up. WAY TO FIRE close up
from the outset, raced three wide on the turn and finished gamely. TONI TWO POCKET showed speed from the outside, was fanned four wide on the turn,
led late but was tagged. SPUN AWAY was off a bit slow, saved ground and improved her position. YOU WANNA EAR RIP was not hurried early, raced in
the three path on the turn and finished in only a mild rally. MUNNY set the pace to the head of the lane but had little left. UNCHAIN HER HEART flashed
early speed but gave way on the turn. URBAN DIVA was never a factor. SENORITA ESTRELLA trailed throughout.
