Footnotes
LUGAMO vied outside SPEIGHTSTER RED while under a rating hold, assumed command around the turn, moved clear past the three eighths, opened up
when set down entering the lane, shifted in towards the rail and was under a solid hand ride the final furlong. ERIC'S EMPIRE , sluggish early, was under
pressure while saving ground past the three eighths, moved up into the stretch, altered out for room leaving the three sixteenths and finished with good
energy to be well clear of the rest. FLIGHT MAP dropped in nearing the five eighths and then edged up to a stalking spot, came back out under asking mid
turn, shifted five wide for the drive and churned on. SCOTTSDALE tracked the leaders three wide while under some early rating, came under pressure while
pursuing the winner past the quarter pole then gave way. SPEIGHTSTER RED shied inward from a rival leaving the chute, rushed up inside and took a
short lead heading to the five eighths, dueled inside the winner leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace past the five sixteenths and weakened. EL
EQUALIZER gave early pursuit while wide and retreated before going five furlongs.

LASTING IMAGE rated forwardly while saving ground, eased out and moved up between rivals into the lane, exchanged a bump when stalled near the
three sixteenths, altered in with a furlong to go, kept on under strong handling and forged to command in the final yards. PEACHY KEEN rated close up
while three wide, bid to engage the leader from the outside mid turn, dueled, was roused clear soon into the lane, remained clear under a drive past the
eighth pole, kept on gamely but could not deny the winner's charge. LOCK settled in the clear past the five eighths, angled out and moved up four wide past
the three furlong pole, bumped with the winner near the three sixteenths, chased and hung late. CARSON AND I set the pace two wide, held a clear
advantage leaving the far turn, dug in a bit when collared around the turn, dueled past the five sixteenths but had nothing left approaching the furlong
grounds. BULLDOG CONNECTION , off the pace and removed from the rail, dropped back around the turn.

MAKIN' OUT saved ground on the turn, eased out to the two path to pass the tiring THEDEVILMADEMEDOIT in upper stretch, closed inside horses late
and narrowly prevailed. ORTINOLA raced inside horses on the turn, was blocked in upper stretch, angled to the six path near the eighth pole and rallied
outside rivals. GIRL NEXT DOOR prompted the pace two wide around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. RAGTIME SUZY
lacked speed, was in the five path between horses in upper stretch, had a mild advance to the eighth pole then weakened. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN raced
inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. NEVISIAN SUNSET , four wide on the turn, was fanned to the six path in mid stretch and gaev way. WIN
THEN GRIN , three wide on the turn chasing the pace, gave way in the drive. THEDEVILMADEMEDOIT set the pace along the rail to upper stretch then
stopped.

Footnotes
MARDEN lacked speed, was two wide between horses mid way on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, closed outside horses, bid inside the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. NOBLE WAY stalked the duel racing behind horses on the turn, eased out to the five path in upper stretch, challenged for
the lead between horses near the sixteenth pole and was out finished. SEVEN ON THE ROCKS prompted the pace three deep around the turn, bid for the
lead near the eighth pole and weakened in the drive. GLORY SONG disputed the pace, was two wide between horses turning for home and weakened late.
TASTES LIKE PLAID , never a factor, hugged the inner rail on the turn. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD , checked in tight quarters along the rail leaving the
backstretch, steadily weakened. FORFIFTYFIVEROCKET , three deep on the turn, was outrun. D C FIREMAN sped to the early lead, angled in, disputed
the pace while racing along the inner rail and faltered the final furlong.

Footnotes
WHY NOT YOU settled well back, commenced a run leaving the half mile marker, moved up three wide into the lane, split rivals with a surge near the
furlong marker, took command soon after and eagerly widened while ridden out. NOT MY MONEY , taken to rate early, edged up towards the inside, eased
out and bid between foes into the lane, shook clear past the three sixteenths, could not fend off a challenge in mid stretch, drifted out, faded but saved the
place. THUNDERINTHEVALLEY broke slowly, pulled her way forward off the rail into the turn, circled six wide into the lane and hung. PO DUNK stalked the
early pace outside a rival, came under pressure mid turn, raced five wide between foes into the stretch and faded. MY SUPER SALLY vied outside a rival,
kicked away around the far turn, was taken on entering the lane, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then gave way. JENNYANYSPOT saved some ground
early on, angled out leaving the far turn, pursued to mid turn then dropped back. RUNFASTBABY was through after a half mile. CHAMBERED BULLET ,
fractious pre race, rushed up inside and contested the pace, failed to kick on leaving the half mile marker, faltered, was eased through the lane and walked
off.
