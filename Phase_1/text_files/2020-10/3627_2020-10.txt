Footnotes
BEAT THE RUSH stalked the pacesetter, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, rallied, swept to the lead in deep stretch and was up under a hand
ride. LEFOOTWOSTOMPS set a pressured pace, shook clear mid turn, was under a drive through the stretch but failed to contain the winner late. MISS
MATILDA pressed the pace, chased two-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. HURRICANE DIRECTOR was steadied leaving the gate, was used
early to gain contention, stalked from the rail, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. VINPEARL VALENTINE broke outward and settled in mid pack,
was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but never reached contention. O LA LA settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but
evened out in the final 16th. BLONDE COURAGE was steadied just out and settled at the back of the pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the
turn but failed to menace. CHERISH YOUR DREAM raced from off the pace, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.
MISS LESTER MURPHY settled off the pace, dropped back further approaching the turn and trailed home.

Footnotes
DANCING DOLL stalked the dueling trio of rivals early, advanced willingly four wide into the turn, had the lead quite easily by mid turn and continued in the
four path to garner a widening advantage by upper stretch, the result never in doubt down the lane. SNELL FLICKA sat on the rail behind the embattled
leaders, tipped off the rail turning for home and had a seam in upper stretch, driving through to get into second but the winner was long gone.
SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS dueled between rivals down the backstretch and around the turn, shaking off her two pace foes to get into second in upper stretch
but had to work hard late to hold the show spot. ROMANTIC GIZMO sat along the rail in mid pack, moved up around the turn, came off the fence to pass a
tiring foe at the eighth pole and was striding out best late, the wire coming too soon to get any more than a minor award. ROSIEJEWEL DANCER pressed
the pace three wide throughout, dropped back some when the winner ran by, re-rallying to the sixteenth pole but stalled from that point. SUPER
CHOCOLATE circled up three to four wide on the turn into range from mid pack, floated out into the six or seven path turning for home and levelled off in the
final furlong. SOEXOTIC settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the turn but could not reach contention and was vanned off after finishing.
HEART RUSH was sluggish early and dropped well off the pace, still trailing into the stretch and did pass one tired foe late. FUTURE GAMES was inside
two rivals being pressed all the way, began to leak oil late on the turn and fell back the final furlong.

Footnotes
WALTZING CHAMP stalked the pace, came three-wide through the turn, chased from the top of the stretch, gained the lead a 16th out and held under a
drive. AIM FOR THE SKY showed early speed, set a pressured pace, was headed a 16th out and chased to the end. BENLION raced in mid pack, closed
angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch, rallied gamely but hung late. RACING IN THE RAIN raced in mid pack,
angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn, moved out a bit looking for a clear path in the stretch and rallied gamely. GHOST OF THE MAMBO settled in
mid pack, rode the rail and two-wide on the turn, angled out mid stretch and closed gamely. MAKER OF AN EMPIRE hit the gate leaving, settled in mid
pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn, was blocked mid stretch, angled out and chased to the end. PHASE OUT broke outward, stalked the pace,
was hustled five-wide late turn, chased to the final 16th and evened out. SMART RIDE forced the pace, dropped back to stalk into the turn, was well-placed
in the stretch but tired. CHANCEL was herded at the start, closed on the backstretch, forced the pace on the turn, chased into the stretch and tired.
HANDSOME DEVIL hit the gate and settled well back, was hustled two-wide and was roused late turn but never reached contention. RED MERCURY raced
in mid pack, closed three and four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
ANN OF CLEVES got over nicely to the rail around the first turn while off the pace, came up to mid pack early backstretch, stayed inside on the far turn until
going around a tiring foe, got back inside in upper stretch before angling out at the eighth pole, dead aim on the tiring duelers and flew by inside the
sixteenth, widening late. BAYOU BELLE chased along the rail into the first turn, in between runners down the backside, got back to the rail midway on the
second turn, drifting out turning for home and the winner got up her inside, no match for that one but up late outside for the place late. NOVEMBER FOG
stalked the early leader two and three wide throughout, bid late on the turn and battled into a brief lead at the eighth pole, the winner going by quickly and
losing the place spot late. SHEDAT went to the front under a tight hold, was stalked and pressed throughout by a rival, finally headed near the eighth pole,
wilting in the final sixteenth. I WONDER broke in the air and dropped off the pace, five to three wide around the first turn, advanced three to five wide on the
far turn, continued to close down the lane while drifting in late, a very wide trip. CAPABLE was off the pace and trailing into the far turn, tipped out into the
three path turning for home and passed a number of foes in the final furlong while outside. CHOOSE HOPE was between rivals chasing three wide around
the first turn, stayed three wide chasing the top pair until beginning to drop back midway on the far turn and lost ground down the lane. YASINIA chased in
mid pack two to three wide around the first turn, drifted out while in range three to four wide on the second turn and had no closing kick while drifting back
inside down the lane. REAL CHOPPER jumped up at the start and trailed, had one rival beat on the far turn and could not muster a challenge. LA
CHAUFFEUR lead quickly but was taken back to inside chase the top trio, stayed in range until retreating far turn and stretch. STERLING SPEED broke out
at the start, six to four wide near the rear around the first turn, moved up four to six wide on the second turn before tiring and retreating the final quarter.

Footnotes
TEXT ME UP stalked the pace, closed two-wide on the far turn, gained steadily, led mid stretch and finished under a hand ride. GLORIOUS GIZMO had
early speed, was joined in a duel, forced the issue from early backstretch, led into the far turn, moved clear, was collared mid stretch and chased to the wire.
PETITE AMIE was away slowly and raced from off the pace, closed four to six-wide on the turn then while well off the leaders in the stretch prevailed in a
battle for show. PRESSURE FRONT broke outward and settled off the pace, closed four and five-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished
under a determined drive. MOON ROVER vied briefly then forced the pace, stalked on the backstretch, was hustled from mid pack two and three-wide on
the far turn, was steadied approaching the top of the stretch then finished gamely. FINE LADY settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the
final turn then chased through the stretch. SING YOUR LIFE raced in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns then finished evenly. RASPBERRY WILD settled
off the pace, saved ground throughout but never reached contention. CLEARLY SEEN raced from off the pace, was hustled four-wide through the far turn
but evened out in the stretch. CURLIN'S TIGER broke outward, closed on the first turn and took a short lead into the backstretch, was headed near the far
turn, backed away late turn and lacked a rally. TRIPLE SEVENS settled off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn then evened out in the stretch.
SICK SOCIETY raced in mid pack early, dropped back approaching the far turn and lacked a closing response.
