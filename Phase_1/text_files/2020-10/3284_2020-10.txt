Footnotes
TIMELESS GLORY was well rated while three wide down the backstretch, made a bid past the three eighths pole, went on even terms by the five sixteenths
pole, then was clear past the three sixteenths pole, then drew off in the final furlong to prove much the best under steady right handed encouragement.
TAPERINEA broke outwardly at the start, then went on to set the pace while crossing over to the rail, was headed on the second turn, proved to be no
match for the winner while clearly second best. SHENANDOAH FLASH was well placed on the backstretch then weakened, bested rest. PRIZED
CUPCAKE was allowed to settle on the inside on the backstretch then stopped.Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional
three pounds.

Footnotes
PRADO'S PLAYBOY was reserved early, came into the stretch four wide while advancing into contention, switched leads around the sixteenth pole and
exploded late to get up under a drive. AKAMAI vied for the early lead three wide for a half mile, then took over and moved over to the rail past the three
eighths pole, then dug in gamely in the stretch but was caught late. INDOCUMENTADO was rated early, made a bold bid three wide bid past the three
eighths pole to go on even terms with the pace setter, but hung late after a long stretch drive, bested rest. BAKER'S MAN tracked the pace three wide but
lacked the needed stretch bid, had no punch when roused. GALILEO'S ROCK was off slow, then was four wide on the backstretch while trailing, then came
in to the stretch five wide to offer a belated rally. JULIANO tracked the pace on the inside then faded. B R COOPER failed to menace. AIR TEMPLE vied for
the lead on the inside for four furlongs then gave way. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

EUROPA stalked the pace setter while in hand, made a three wide bid when ready past the quarter pole, assumed command leaving the three sixteenths
pole, then drew out in the final furlong to prove much the best under a drive. SCRIBBLE IT was away alertly and crossed over to the rail to set the pace
before the first turn, then was well handled on the front end was headed entering the stretch but proved to be no match for the winner while staying on for
the place award. GO BIG GREEN was allowed to settle early, made steady advance on the far turn and was between rivals past the quarter pole, then
came into the stretch four wide to offer a mild late rally. SOVEREIGN POWER was allowed to settle early and made an inside middle move on the
backstretch to move into contention, but offered no late punch. HOT AS BLUE BLAZES was reserved early, came into the stretch five wide to offer a belated
rally. KITTEN ROCKS was well placed early, then was four wide past the quarter pole and entering the stretch but was empty. CALL OF LOVE passed the
tiring
rivals.

then was slowly gaining late on the winner. WESTWOOD PROUD was allowed to settle early, swung out six wide for the drive to offer a mild late rally.
SIDNEY'S RANSOM set a pressured pace early, shook clear on the turn while off the rail, then was headed approaching the eighth pole but faded late.
