Footnotes
TIFFANY'S GAL forced the early pace, took over at the half mile marker and held sway thereafter. DELIGHT SURPRISE pinched at the start, was reserved,
advanced on the far turn and stayed on while four wide in the stretch. TIZAMISSILE settled while five wide and lodged a mild five wide rally in the stretch.
KYLIES COLLEGEFUND saved ground, lodged a bid on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch. GETTIUP AND GO dwelt at the start and passed tired
ones. D KELA SUNRISE led early and dropped back on the far turn. PRISMATIC never menaced. UNUSUAL NATIVE was outrun.
