Footnotes
PRIVATE KITTY quickly took command of the race and opened up on the backstretch, entered turn clear and into the stretch improved margin, responded
to urging while in the three path and won convincingly. LUV IS ALL U NEED bumped back at the start by inside rival, stalked pace along the inside and
stayed along the inside into the stretch and rallied up for second. CIOPPINO PASADINO bumped at the start and chased leader two wide on the
backstretch, entered turn two wide and responded to urging in the lane when getting edged for second late. C C THE BARTENDER tracked leaders off the
rail and in the three path, entered turn three wide and into the stretch in the four path, lacked needed response in the lane. LOVEFLIESONWINGS bumped
outside rival at the start, chased leader along the inside in the backstretch, and began to fade in the turn and came up empty in the stretch.
