KNIGHT'S CROSS tracked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, fought back late in the stretch and was just up at the wire. CANDY CARLOS set
the pace from the outset, was on the inside into the lane, drew clear in the stretch but was outfinished in the final stages. TAKE CHARGE D'ORO chased
the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane and was gaining in the late stages. RANSACK stalked the pace early along the
inside, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and was gaining in the final stages. DECEMBER SEVEN was unprepared at the start,
chased the pace early on, was in the five path into the lane and raced evenly down the lane. MILLWOOD was never a threat. ALTITO trailed the field
throughout. There was a stewards inquiry into the start of the race for DECEMBER SEVEN and after review they declared he had every opportunity at the
start to break.

Footnotes
CONFORMIST broke outwards, dueled for the lead outside of CLEARLY MAD, vied between horses around the turn as ROMAN PHAROAH ranged up,
then kicked clear approaching the furlong pole, and widened under driving pressure. ROMAN PHAROAH prompted the dueling leaders from the three path,
inched closer to produce a bid turning for home, but failed to match strides with an inner foe approaching the furlong pole, and leveled off to prove second
best. CLEARLY MAD dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but failed to keep pace with them approaching the furlong pole, and held show thereafter.
SMOOTHIE broke inwards, but avoided trouble by doing so, raced far off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide turning for home, and produced a
mild rally to cut the gap on the leading group. POIRIER was off a step slow and shied inwards aggressively from an outer rival at the start, raced far off of
the pace two wide around the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, and failed to menace. NAVEEN veered in at the start, raced off of the pace along the
inside around the turn, tipped two wide turning for home, and failed to factor. DECEIVER was off a step slowly, raced far off of the pace in the three path
around the turn, and never got involved. MY BOY GUS broke outwardly, tracked the leading trio from the four path, but weakened turning for home.

SPUN EAZY vied inside of the pace setter around the far turn, took back to stalk that foe into the backstretch, rated while looming large from the pocket
around the far turn, then slipped inside of the leader in upper stretch, and drew off approaching the furlong pole. MY AUNT MIMS stalked from the three
path around the first turn, then the two path around the far turn, but was floated back to the three path turning for home, got outkicked by a rail skimming
rival in upper stretch, and kept on to claim place in the final furlong. FOREIGN EXCHANGE set the pace while staying a path off of the inner rail, took the
innermost path around the far turn, but shifted back off of it turning for home, which allowed for ample racing room for the eventual winner, got surpassed by
that foe in upper stretch, then yielded through the final furlong. AUCTION FEVER trailed the short field along the inside around both turns, shifted out in
upper stretch, but failed to produce a bid while chasing the leaders home. BANKRUPTONTHEBEACH tracked the pace from the four path around the first
turn, then the three path around the far turn, but came under an all out drive turning for home, lacked a response, and weakened.

Footnotes
TOUGH LOVE set the pace inside of a pair of foes, inched clear in upper stretch before receiving a bid from NIGHT TIME at the furlong pole, but repelled
that foe in the late stages, and held sway. NIGHT TIME perched himself outside of the pair of leaders, inched closer through upper stretch to bid for the lead
at the furlong pole, but was turned away by his inner counterpart. STRAIGHT SHOT tracked from midpack along the inside, saved ground to be just behind
the leader in upper stretch, brushed DEAN MARTINI while tipping two wide, but lacked a kick to split the leaders through a narrow opening through the late
stages. SIR ALFRED JAMES stalked from the two path, chased from behind the leading group while shifting out through upper stretch, then produced a
mild late gain in the final furlong. NIFTY trailed the field early on, advanced three wide into the turn, shifted four wide turning for home, but chased the
leaders while being floated five wide through midstretch. DEAN MARTINI vied two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his inner
counterpart in upper stretch, then was brushed by an inner foe when put to tight quarters at the furlong pole, and faded thereafter. WILD POPIT got caught
in the six path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. HOME BASE bobbled at the start, raced off of the pace in the five path around the turn while a path
away from his immediate inner rival, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
SILVER PROSPECTOR saved ground from midpack, tipped three wide outside of the dueling leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, produced a bid in
upper stretch and forged an advantage at the furlong pole, cleared off, but drifted out in the final sixteenth, brushed MULTIPLIER approaching the wire, and
held. MULTIPLIER saved ground far off of the pace around both turns, bumped ROYAL MESA while trying to shift off of the inside at the three sixteenths
pole causing that rival to steady hard, forced his was out to the four path approaching the furlong pole, brushing LORD DRAGON through the process, then
produced a grinding bid through the late stages, but was brushed by the leader inside the final sixteenth, bumped with his outer foe approaching the wire,
and just held place. LORD DRAGON tracked from midpack in the four to three path, got floated four wide turning for home by the eventual winner, but
decided to angle back inwards to attempt to rally inside of that foe in upper stretch, bumped ROYAL MESA at the three sixteenths pole causing that foe to
steady hard, then got herded out to the five path by MULITPLIER approaching the furlong pole, sustained a steady grind, but drifted back in inside the final
sixteenth, exchanged a bump with that foe approaching the wire, and missed place. CASINO STAR was off a step slow, but angled out and got sent to the
front, reached the lead into the first turn, set the pace, but was headed at the quarter pole, fought on through the lane to vie until deep stretch, but yielded in
the final sixteenth. ROYAL MESA raced far off of the pace two wide, came under a drive passing the five furlong pole, took the far turn in the four path, but
steadied when put to tight quarters by an inner and an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole, then chased thereafter. PROVERB stalked from the three path
into the first turn, shifted down to the two path around that bed, inched closer into the far turn to bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage
passing the quarter pole, but tired in upper stretch, and weakened between horses at the furlong pole. FINAL CUT stumbled at the start, trailed the field
early on, took the far turn in the four to five path, and never got involved. CELTIC STRIKER stalked along the inside, but weakened into the far turn, and
was done early. Following the race, the rider of ROYAL MESA claimed foul against the rider of MULTIPLIER for interference in upper stretch, the riders of
MULTIPLIER and LORD DRAGON claimed fouls against SILVER PROSPECTOR for interference in deep stretch, and the Stewards posted an Inquiry, but
no change was made to the final order of finsih

PRINCESS THEOREM stalked along the inside, tipped three wide passing the five sixteenths pole, bid turning for home, and drew off under driving
pressure. SARANYA set the pace inside of TEMPER TIME, dueled with that foe around the far turn, but had little resistance for an outer rallying rival in
upper stretch, then held place. DRAMATIZER trailed the field in the three path around the first turn, took the far turn in the two path before tipping four wide
in upper stretch, then stayed on to claim show in the late stages. TEMPER TIME prompted the pace two wide, dueled around the far turn, but failed to keep
pace with his inner counterpart and an outer foe in upper stretch, then got outfinished for show in the late stages. SWEET MARY LOU lied forwardly placed
three wide, but weakened turning for home. JOY IN GRACE saved ground far off of the pace, and never got involved. QUEEN OF THE GREEN was done
early and showed little.
