Footnotes
PIT BOSS trailed along the inside around the turn, advanced inside of wider shifting foes while saving ground turning for home, came in to the lane behind
the leader with a few lengths to find, tipped outside of that foe at the furlong pole, bid passing that marker, then drew clear before safely fending off RYE
HUMOR's late grind. RYE HUMOR saved ground into the turn while off of the pace and inside of foes, smoothly shifted four wide turning for home, rallied
outside of leading foes through the lane, then sustained a grind in deep stretch to bid outside of PIT BOSS, but was denied by that foe. SOVIET dueled for
the lead outside of TREASURY early on, cleared off from that foe passing the half mile pole, held a clear margin through upper stretch, dug in inside of PIT
BOSS at the furlong pole, but was headed by that foe passing that marker, and gave way through the late stages. MASCABRONI stalked two to three wide,
held position turning for home behind the clear leader, but tired in upper stretch. BEAVER CREEK tracked from midpack three wide, then took the turn four
to five wide before being fanned six wide turning for home, then failed to menace. JEALOUS EYES chased along the inside, then two wide into the turn, but
weakened between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole. TREASURY bobbled a bit at the start, dueled for the lead inside of SOVIET early on, but
allowed that foe to clear off passing the half mile pole, stalked from the inside around the turn, but weakened passing the quarter pole. GHOST FIGHTER
raced off of the pace three to four wide and between horses around the turn, came into the lane in the five path between foes, but lacked a kick to split them,
and failed to factor.

Footnotes
ELIADE (FR) saved ground off of the pace around the first two turns, shifted off of the rail to gain two wide and between horses around the third turn,
bumped while KETTLE VALLEY in upper stretch while trying to shift out to the four path, did so after clearing that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, then
rallied to bid inside the furlong pole, drove clear in the final sixteenth, then just held from an oncharging rival. CAMBELIZA raced far off of the pace two wide,
smoothly shifted five wide through midstretch while quickening, produce a good kick through the final furlong to make a late bid, but just ran out of ground
and missed. DELTA'S KINGDOM prompted the pace two wide, vied around the third turn before kicking clear passing the quarter pole, but was tested by
ROMANTIC PURSUIT and ELIADE (FR) at the furlong pole, and got bested by the latter at the sixteenth pole before being surpassed for place. TWEETY
SHOW saved ground around the turns far off of the pace, and produced a mild rail rally through the lane for a minor reward. ROMANTIC PURSUIT stalked
three wide around each turn, inched closer turning for home, but flattened out and chased the clear leader through upper stretch, then was outkicked by the
eventual winner at the furlong pole, and was eased through the late stages as the rider lacked effort for minor rewards. JOY OF TREASURE raced off of the
pace two to four wide around the turns, and failed to factor. KETTLE VALLEY stalked two wide and between horses, but got fanned four to five wide turning
for home, then bumped by ELIADE (FR) in upper stretch before weakening. LATEST VERSION stalked along the inside, shifted out turning for home, but
lacked a bid and weakened passing the furlong pole. TIZAHRA set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of a foe around the third turn, but gave way in
upper stretch before wilting thereafter.

Footnotes
VILLANELLE prompted the leading duelers three wide, forged an advantage from them into the far turn, dug in while meeting bids from SOVEREIGN
APPEAL and FINANCIAL ONE around that bend, dueled tenaciously through the lane inside of the prior after the latter flattened out, and prevailed gamely.
SOVEREIGN APPEAL was forwardly placed four wide, bid for the lead between horses at the five sixteenths pole after FINANCIAL ONE forced his hand
into the far turn, dueled gamely outside of VILLANELLE through the lane, but was outdueled by her counterpart. POWDER RIVER stalked the pace from the
two path and behind the dueling leaders, waited into the far turn before splitting tiring foes three wide turning for home, then rallied through the lane with a
good finish, and was gaining on the leaders through the late stages. FINANCIAL ONE was reluctant to load, then was off slowly after lifting her head when
the gates opened, trailed the field around the first turn, then rallied stoutly five wide and outside of horses commencing at the half mile pole, sustained that
gain around the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out in upper stretch. TIZEMOTIONALGOLD tracked two wide and
between horses, but was outmoved by outer foes around the far turn, then kept on through the lane iwhtout threatening. CHOCOLATE SWIRL took the far
turn three to four wide, and failed to factor. ECLECTIC SOUL dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but proved no match for her outer foe
passing the five sixteenths pole, then steadied mildly while fading turning for home. BELLUCCI failed to factor. BEST INTENTIONS dueled for the lead
inside of a pair of foes, but weakened into the far turn, and stopped. HERO OF LOVE was done early and showed little.

Footnotes
MR DUMAS stalked two wide early on, allowed outer foes to advance down the backstretch while rating into the far turn, loomed large in hand while shifting
three to five wide turning for home, then kicked clear of inner foes passing the furlong pole, and widened under driving pressure. BIG SCORE saved ground
far off of the pace before splitting foes two wide turning for home to be in range of the lead, proved no match for the eventual winner at the furlong pole, then
sustained a grinding rally inside of foes to reach place in the closing stages. SPECTACULAR GEM stalked the loose leader from the two path, inched closer
turning for home to produce a bid in upper stretch, but was no match for the outer surging MR DUMAS passing the furlong pole, and was outfinished by an
inner foe in the late stages for place. RAMSEY SOLUTION settled off of the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced early when MONARCHS GLEN
(GB) forced his hand down the backstretch, tracked four wide around the far turn before producing a bid between horses in upper stretch, but was no match
for his outer foe approaching the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead, then chased other foes through the final stages. ENGLISH BEE swung six wide
while far off of the pace turning for home, and passed tired foes. RENAISANCE FROLIC tugged clear through the stretch for the first time, stayed clear
around the far turn, but tired turning for home, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, and stopped. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) trailed the field in the three
path around the first turn, gained four wide down the backstretch under mild restraint to be in range of the lead into the far turn but weakened in upper
stretch. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) broke through the gate pre-race, then stalked along the inside early on before being outmoved by foes down the
backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
SHESHAPPY was off a step slow, tracked the leaders from the three path, inched forward around the bend to loom while bidding in hand at the five
sixteenths pole, forged an advantage passing the three sixteenths pole as DANCE ON OVER produce a rail bid, then determinedly held that foe at bay
through the late stages. DANCE ON OVER was off a step slow, saved ground around the turn in midpack and produced a rail bid passing three sixteenths
pole, but was denied by an outer foe. SPY A STAR raced far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and rallied mildly outside of foes
through the lane. ESAGERARE saved ground far off of the pace before shifting three wide turning for home, then rallied mildly inside of SPY A STAR.
AMBITIOUSLY PLACED pressed the leader two wide, drew clear from that foe passing the five sixteenths pole, dug in to hold an advantage between
horses in upper stretch, but was headed at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. IZEONPOINT saved ground while trailing, and failed to factor. IT WAS
MEANT TO BE set a pressured pace along the inside, but weakened passing the three furlong pole. SPECIAL BLUE was done early.
