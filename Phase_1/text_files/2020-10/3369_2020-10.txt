while being pressured, was two wide for the stretch drive and weakened in late stretch. STANS HOOKIN BULL raced four wide into the turn then made a bid
but flattened out in the drive. SPOTTED BULL chased the early pace while three wide into the turn then faltered in the stretch. Internal fractions unavailable
