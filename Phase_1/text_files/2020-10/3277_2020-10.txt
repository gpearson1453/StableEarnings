Footnotes
TIZLEGAL led early, set a reserved pace, quickened late backstretch and again approaching the stretch, widened, then finished under a hand ride.
FREEDOM MACHINE stalked early, forced the pace two-wide early on the far turn then chased through the stretch. AMBITIOUS PRINCESS was rated off
the early pace, chased along the rail and two-wide through the far turn but evened out in deep stretch. FRAME THIS stalked the pace, was hustled from the
rail and two-wide on the far turn, failed to menace but was best of the rest. NORTHERN ALLURE closed to mid pack early on the backstretch, came
three-wide through the turn then flattened out in the stretch. ALL EYES ON ME stalked four-wide on the first turn, was hustled while moving two-wide to the
rail on the far turn but lacked a closing response. PENETANGUISHENE broke inward and was steadied at the start, settled in mid pack, chased four-wide
on the far turn but lacked a rally. DEARFUTUREHUSBAND forced the pace on the first turn, dropped back through the backstretch and far turn and trailed
home, finished race and walked off.

Footnotes
COURTING A KISS moved up to contend for the lead midway through the backstretch, dueled from the rail, gained a short lead in deep stretch and held
under steady handling. READY SOUL stalked the pace, closed into the turn, raced along the rail and two-wide then launched an all out charge in the
stretch, closed quickly but just missed. RED HIERARCHY dueled, raced two and three-wide on the turn, battled through the stretch but weakened in the
final yards. SPEEDY HANS settled off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely, but late. CASH DIVIDEND settled off the pace,
was hustled three to five-wide on the turn then rallied widest through the stretch. TAP THE MOJO stalked the pace, closed three-wide on the turn but
evened out in deep stretch. LEAD DIRECTOR settled off the pace, chased four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response. MIRACLE SILVER moved
up to press the pace mid backstretch, dropped back on the turn then came on again mildly in the stretch. BAY OF RUM dueled early under strong restraint,

closed along the rail on the far turn then finished gamely but was not a threat. LOMAKI'S GEM stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn then
finished gamely in vain. BODE'S TIPSY raced from off the pace, chased hard angling two to four-wide through the far turn then closed willingly in the

Footnotes
BEYOND MYBUDGET stalked the pace, circled four-wide late turn, led into the stretch then was kept to business, was drifting out in the late stages but
managed to hold under a hand ride. LA ISADORA raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied in the stretch
and was gaining late. BALLROOMS OF MARS stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. SWILLING,
away slowly, settled off the pace, closed two and three-wide on the turn then rallied mildly. KARAKONTIE FLYER stalked the pace, chased from the rail and
two-wide on the turn then evened out the late stages. DICTATE forced the pace, bid into the far turn, gained a short lead, was headed at the top of the
stretch and faded. SWEET UPROAR settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. RIVER OF PEARLS set a pressured
pace, forced the issue on the turn then tired at the top of the stretch. CALL HER JOEY started in mid pack, was hustled along the rail from off the pace on
the turn then lacked a closing response. SIMPLE SOUVENIR forced the pace, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
TORAH'S BLESSING settled off the pace, rallied inside to mid pack on the turn, tried to angle out past tiring rivals in mid stretch but stayed inside and knifed
through between them at the seventy yard pole, up in time to edge a fellow closer in a tight win photo. ANIMAL KRACKERS sat on the inside near the rear,
followed the winner inside on the turn and got a dream run up the fence, outnodded in a very close finish. CARL G was hard to handle early running
erratically, got inside a rival to duel down the backstretch and around the turn, shook off that one to clear off in upper stretch but tired in the final seventy
yards when the top pair went by. FINAL STRIKE two wide in a group of five runners chasing the early duelers, came out late on the turn to loom outside the
pace winner turning for home but couldn't seal the deal, hanging in the final furlong. TALL WATER was four wide chasing the early duelers, moved up to
look dangerous mid turn and top of the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. I HAVE HOPE was bumped at the start and trailed, commenced a long,
gradual circle the field move while four to five wide around the bend, still wide and closing through the lane, only inching up late. STERLING ICE led early
under a hold, allowed a rival to come up his inside and dueled with that one throughout, tiring on his wrong lead and dropping back in the final furlong.
PRINCE MARTHEUS stumbled at the break, bearing out into a rival, off the pace and three to five wide between rivals mid turn, only mildly closing in the
stretch while still outside. SCHIMMEL was between rivals and chasing early, seemed uncomfortable and dropped back midway on the turn, only running
evenly down the stretch without much urge by his rider. G PRINCE OF SILVER was inside a group of five chasing the duelers, but dropped back from
midway on the turn to the wire. THE KODIAC KID (IRE) broke out at the start, was four to three wide on the turn and never in contention. MR. TODD was in
the middle of a bunch chasing the duelers, dropping back from early turn to the finish.

Footnotes
COMMANDER TOM broke inward and bumped MASON'S GAMBLE, showed speed and raced at the fore, shook clear into the stretch and held sway under
light, intermittent handling. DERZKII raced in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn then finished full of run and was just up for place. SILVER
SMOKE broke inward but was also prominent early, dueled two-wide as the front runners exchanged the lead off and on through the battle, was left behind
at the top of the stretch, chased, but gave way gradually through the final furlong. ALPHA BETA GAMA raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail and
two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and rallied along the fence. VERRAZANO BRIDGE raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on
the final turn then finished gamely in vain. EXECUTIVE GIANT stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in the final furlong.
MASON'S GAMBLE was bumped then pinched back leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn but never reached
contention. COLTONS DREAM stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but lacked a closing response. I'M DASHING, away slowly
and off the pace, chased two and three-wide on the turn then evened out in the final furlong. VICTORY AT LAST settled in mid pack, was hustled three and
four-wide on the far turn then flattened out in the stretch. JR BOURBON raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the turn then tired at the top of the
stretch.

CALL ME WALLY, off slowly, moved up quickly to stalk the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch, gained steadily and was up late under a drive. COURT
BATTLE had a short early lead, drew clear leaving the turn, looked like a winner but was passed in deep stretch. SKYNYRD raced in mid pack, closed
four-wide late turn, was blocked at the top of the stretch, found a seam and rallied gamely. KITTEN'S SOLUTION broke alertly and settled in striking range,
closed four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. DANI'S VICTORY bumped with MAJESTIC SLEW at
the start, settled off the pace, closed four-wide late turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. FRITZIE'S BOY raced in mid pack, was
hustled from the rail on the turn, was all out in the stretch but evened out late. OCCASIONAL VIEW stalked early, came three and four-wide through the turn
but evened out in the final 16th. EXECUTIVE SIGHT settled in mid pack, came three-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the
final 16th. SAN NICOLA THUNDER forced the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch then evened out late. DRINK IN
MY HAND settled in mid pack, was hustled five and six-wide on the turn then finished evenly. MAJESTIC SLEW bumped at the start, settled in mid pack,
came three and four-wide through the turn then evened out in the stretch. DOT'S VISION raced in mid pack, encountered traffic while two-wide late turn,
when it opened, he closed along the rail to mid stretch then evened out.

Footnotes
SOUPER STONEHENGE stalked the early duelers three wide, advanced with authority to make it three in a line late turn, drove by at the eighth pole and
held off the perfect trip place horse late, looking confident the entire trip despite the wide journey. CIRCLE OF FRIENDS rushed up inside to settle in along
the rail behind the leading trio, got a dream run between the tiring duelers at the eighth pole but the winner had the jump on him, clearly second best.
MALIBU SECRET sat between rivals in the second group of three in behind the trio of front runners on the turn, got room after the winner cleared off in mid
stretch but could only grab the show spot late battling on gamely. RECONFIGURE followed the winner four to three wide on the turn and entered the stretch
on that one's flank with dead aim but hung in the final sixteenth settling for a minor award and losing the show late. ALACRITOUS sped up the inside to duel
a rival, put that one away turning for home but tired in the final furlong, dropping back inside. STORMFUHR off the pace early, roused two to three wide on
the turn but could only rally mildly in the final furlong to best the rest. SALIERI dueled outside in the early going, was still between rivals late on the turn but
began to lose ground in upper stretch and dropped back. IKERRIN ROAD (IRE) hustled from off the pace to get in behind the top group turning for home,
came off the inside by the eighth pole but levelled off quickly, mildly closing little ground. SAMURAI QUEEN was off the pace at the rear and stayed three
wide on the turn despite being alone back there, showing some acceleration in the final seventy yards without ever getting close. KAILI'S BIG BOY hopped
at the start and was far back, came four to five wide on the turn but could not enter the fray.
