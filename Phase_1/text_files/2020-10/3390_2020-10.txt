Footnotes
FROST ME at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, departed the backstretch three to four wide, was in hand bidding for command midpoint
on the turn, assumed control, got driven four to five wide into the lane, kept going well after being straightened away and kicked clear. CARA'S DREAMER
strung out four wide on the turn, was under a ride angling towards path six for the drive, failed to cut into the deficit in the lane, held the place. POP THE
BUBBLY took the inside route nearly all the way to the end of the bend, vacating the premises only long enough to scoot by former pacesetter GRAY
LOLLIPOPS in the general area of the three-eighths pole, got roused angling five wide into the lane, shifted inward a few paths shortly afterwards, won the
show. U SHOULD B DANCING took up the chase three wide on the turn, got worked into path five during the initial stages of the stretch run, flattened out.
BIG TIME LADY disputed the pace two wide, got set down when challenged by the confidently-ridden winner midway on the turn, gradually fell back
nevertheless, turned into the lane, backed away. WISH FOR MAGIC parked out along the overland route at all times, ventured down the stretch under a
protective hold. GRAY LOLLIPOPS disputed the pace towards the inside until the three-eighths pole, backed away, then was allowed to back away even
farther having been set to to a protective hold. MASU two wide onto the turn, was never involved, then ventured down the stretch under a protective hold.

Footnotes
WICKED TITLE three wide in closest pursuit of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and brushed with QUEENDOM when coming out slightly as that rival came inwards, took command a furlong from home, dug in and inched away in
the late stages to prevail. QUEENDOM chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out to swing five wide into upper stretch,
brushed with WICKED TITLE when coming inwards as that rival came slightly out, dug in fighting on to the finish latched on before being shaken off in the
late going while clear of the rest for the place honors. LA NEGRITA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide
into upper stretch, traded leans with SHE'S A LUMBERJANE to her outside through the stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. SHE'S A
LUMBERJANE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive trading leans
on one another with the aforementioned foe through the stretch, kept on and was just bested for the show honors. WIGGLE AND JIGGLE coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside, got set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and yielded
near the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. GRINGOTTS stumbled badly at the start losing all footing and belly flopping before recovering athletically
with a spring to her feet albeit conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path, chased two to three wide
detached at the tail of the field, went four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout unable to recover from the rough start. There was a general
Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

SAM AND SY put to some urging seemingly from the get-go, remained stationed along the inside route, unleashed a big burst of speed as the half was
being completed to wrest away the advantage, slid to outside heading for three-sixteenths marker, until three to four wide, drew out to a commanding lead,
primarily under a brisk hand ride, then finished off the majority of the final sixteenth being wrapped up. BOWING SNOWMAN underwent a ground-saving
journey, stepped into the lane then went to secure second. IN THE ZONE out-hustled for command by CAPE COD GEM, pursued that opponent from the
two path, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, ventured onward to finish a non-threatening third. CAPE COD GEM made contact with GO CASH
GO after leaning in with his initial step, went on to assume the top shortly afterwards, carved out the pace from the two path, got overpowered by SAM AND
SY approaching the end of the bend, drifted out approximately five wide in upper stretch, backed way. GO CASH GO chase the pace three wide after
bumping lightly with CAPE COD GEM in the shadow of the gate, commenced the stretch slightly wider, gave way.

INVALUABLE dueled three then two wide with WHISTLINGINTHEDARK to her outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and shook off that rival
and was confronted by the runner up, angled out six wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. DARE TO TRY bobbled at the break and
broke on top despite it, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch in close aim of the duel, tucked four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch, kept on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. FUN FINDER three wide in
pursuit from near the rear early on, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, improved position to the eighth pole, then
weakened in the late stages. QUASAR chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, bid swinging eight wide at the head of the stretch,
weakened in the final furlong. AVA K'S GIRL stumbled at the start recovering into WHISTLINGINTHEDARK, chased four then three wide under a ride from
three furlongs out, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. WHISTLINGINTHEDARK bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe who recovered
outwards from a stumble, dueled from the five path down the backstretch with INVALUABLE to her inside, tucked three wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths in the midst of being shaken off, went five wide at the top of the stretch and tired. ANYDAYISHERDAY coaxed from the gate,
chased just off the inside until tucked to the inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
With every member of this sextet well off the rail down the backstretch, CREATIVE STYLE stalked the fighting front runners from afar in the five path during
the run around the bend, was under a drive spinning slightly nearer the rail into the stretch, wore down FLOWERS FOR LISA inside the eighth pole, edged
away to a comfortable advantage then got geared down for the final seventy yards. FLOWERS FOR LISA gap-dueled with HUSHION towards path three,
got floated approximately six wide by that opponent as their tussle spilled over to the stretch, took over, saw the top one drive up to the front end with slightly
under a furlong to go, stayed on for second. SCARF IT DOWN four wide onto the turn, was in path three entering the stretch, made no headway.
PLAYWRIGHT sent over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, got roused on the turn, failed to its presence felt. HUSHION went at it
with the second place finisher in a protracted fight well isolated from the others, from path two, sputtered five wide into the lane, taking FLOWERS FOR
LISA along for the ride, relinquished soon afterwards and backed away. SHALAKO sighted travelling two wide on the turn, was never in it.

swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tipped out to the eight path straightened away, closed well outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong
taking command in the final strides to prevail edging away at the end. GHOSTGHOSTGHOST hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide in closest
aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors in the late stages.
LOVE ME TOMORROW coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for

Footnotes
AMERICAN POWER raced along the outside, departed the backstretch from the three path, ranged up to the front runners, challenged in earnest spinning
approximately five wide into the lane, vied with vigour between rivals from the head of the stretch until the wire, gamely got the job done. TIZ HE THE ONE
brought up the back of the pack for the opening half, chased the pace three wide on the turn, fanned out six wide heading for the three-sixteenths pole,
fought willingly all the way down the stretch as the outermost of a trio, got denied. MAD MUNNYS sparred for control from the two path, came under siege
from heavy pressure right after having struck the front end as three-quarters was being completed, battled onward with determination to the inside of its
fellow in-the-money finishers, relinquished in the final furlong, eventually having to settle for the show. MALIBU PRO disputed the pace from along the inside
route for six furlongs, faltered. HAMMERIN AAMER saved ground for nearly three-quarters, angled four wide into the lane, lacked the necessary response.
SUPER DUDE three wide onto the turn, was in the same one stepping onto the top of the lane, gave way.

CLENCH coaxed from the gate to show the way early on, got displaced by INK SPLOTZ five furlongs from home and chased just off the inside before
tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced in tandem nearing the quarter pole with BINKSTER to his outside,
swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. MORNING BREEZ coaxed
from the gate, raced briefly just off the inside before tipping out to chase four then three wide through the turn advanced put to coaxing nearing the
five-sixteenths and overhauled the leader to take over, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole,
ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest. BINKSTER coaxed from the gate, raced briefly inside before tipping out to chase four to five wide down
the backstretch and through the turn placed to light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced nearing the quarter pole and went seven wide into upper
stretch, couldn't sustain the momentum and weakened in the final furlong. BRUSH COUNTRY hustled from the gate, tipped out to chase five wide down the
backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. INK SPLOTZ broke through the
gate prior to the start and was reloaded, broke out at the start under hustling and ranged up to take over command five furlongs from home, showed the way
three then two wide coaxed along lightly at the three-eighths, yielded the front five-sixteenths from home, went two to three wide into upper stretch and
faltered.

Footnotes
DR. DEVERA'S WAY disputed the pace from between foes in path two until midpoint on the turn, left the three-eighths pole engaged one on one with
MACHO BOY to his outside, was the first to have its pilot commit to stronger handling, doing so spinning into the lane, staved off the aforementioned rival
during the ensuing furlong, came out twice from left side stick work in the final furlong, in the second instance after three salvos in rapid succession,
bumping lightly with and then briefly herding out MACHO BOY, who was at the time solidly hitched up, in addition to inducing the runner up into going
slightly wider himself and having his rider take hold, maintained its run and edged away after the incident BEACH FRONT strung out three to four wide in
midpack, wandered out towards path seven for clearance upon entering the stretch, narrowed in on the ones to catch in a steadfast manner, had the rider
take hold being induced into going wider in deep stretch by the wayward winner, recovered its best stride in short order and rallied into second. MACHO
BOY attained a forward position after the start, was in path three, vying as the widest of three for most of the way leading up to the three-eighths pole,
sprang from that station sparring with DR. DEVERA'S WAY, rider holding something back in reserve, challenged in earnest in the general area of the
three-sixteenths pole, had whittled away the deficit enough so as to be abreast of the top one when forced to steady getting herded/nudged outward by that
rival inside the sixteenth pole, got going again shortly afterwards,but fell back into third. OUR AMERICAN STAR travelled three wide on the turn, got sent
out five wide for the drive, mustered up a mild stretch response. DANGEROUS EDGE pursued the pace towards path two on the turn, shifted out towards
the six path during the early stages of the stretch run, weakened. JACK OF CLUBS made contact with LARCENY after stumbling at the start, got quickly
tucked into the two path, came into the lane, had no offering. I SAW IT ALL two wide entering the turn, was in path four exiting it, made no headway. FOTIS
saved ground to the quarter pole, came up empty when spotted six wide at the top of the lane. BANK ON THIS took the inside route until the end of the
bend, wandered out nine wide down the stretch to no avail. LARCENY bumped with JACK OF CLUBS in the shadow of the starting gate, was hung out four
wide on the turn, left the eighth pole hung out approximately eighth wide, gave out. AFTER PROM PARTY along the rail, argued for control as the innermost
of three for almost a half, folded. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on DR. DEVERA'S WAY and MACHO BOY in deep stretch, the result was allowed
to stand and the race was declared official.
