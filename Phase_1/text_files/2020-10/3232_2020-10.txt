Footnotes
BROAD STORM , lightly bumped by SIMMARD SHENANIGAN leaving the starting gate, was guided to the inside soon after the break, hugged the inner rail
on both turns while well off the dueling leaders, swung outside near the eighth pole, closed under brisk urging and took the lead late. NEVISIAN SUNSET ,
three wide the first turn, raced along the inner rail entering the far turn, swung to the three path mid way on the turn, gained the lead inside the eighth pole
and gave way grudgingly. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN , steadied and bumped the winner when forced out by ALIN AZUL leaving the starting gate, lacked
speed, raced in the two path in the stretch and passed tired rivals. SHAKE D MOON hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the eighth pole and faded
late. BIRD TYCOON raced inside horses for much of the trip and failed to be a factor. PUNK ROCK PRINCESS , four wide the first turn, moved to the two
path on the backstretch, disputed the pace to the stretch then faltered. WIN THEN GRIN , five wide the first turn, disputed the pace three deep down the
backstretch and faltered mid way on the far turn. ALIN AZUL bore out leaving the starting gate, showed speed between horses on the first turn, checked
entering the backstretch, dropped back and crossed the wire far behind the field while eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOBBY G tracked the dueling leaders while removed from the inside, bid three deep and in hand leaving the far turn, sparred outside rivals past the five
sixteenths, was roused clear entering the lane, opened up a commanding lead while under a drive past mid stretch then was kept to pressure to hold sway.
FINAL PROSPECT , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back while saving ground, angled out to go around a tiring rival in upper stretch, shifted back
towards the rail and closed steadily. HAYNE'S FEVER moved to a short lead outside BELFOUR near the seven eighths pole, sparred with that one to the
far turn, fought on between runners leaving the five sixteenths, wandered out a bit entering the lane and faded. SMOKIN HOT FACTOR stalked four wide,
advanced five wide outside rivals into the lane, failed to sustain past the furlong grounds and weakened. IRISHTOWN rated forwardly while saving some
ground, angled out past the five sixteenth, chased four wide between runners into the stretch then faded. BELFOUR secured the rail nearing the first turn
and got engaged in a pace battle with HAYNE'S FEVER, gained a slim lead after a half mile, was under pressure racing to the inside of foes past the five
sixteenths, had nothing to offer soon after, faltered through the drive and was eased late.

WICKED AWESOME , under a firm hold three wide while measuring the leaders, angled out a path past the three eighths, cruised to the front entering the
lane, kicked clear soon after then powered away under a steady hand ride. AIFE broke outward and bumped with MONKEY MIND, corrected and took
command, set a pressured pace while slightly off the rail, gave little resistance to the winner nearing the lane, wandered outward past the three sixteenths,
was straightened and kept on with some interest to save the place. HEAVEN ESCAPE forced the pace three wide outside AIFE, remained a factor to the
head of the lane then faded. MONKEY MIND , bumped at the break, recovered and saved ground stalking the pace, was under a solid ride leaving the far
turn, could not keep touch past the quarter pole and tired. IRONY OF REALITY , in close soon after the break, chased four wide and dropped back around
the final turn.

MIA BELLA ROSSA showed speed in the two path on the first turn, dropped back on the backstretch, circled the far turn five wide, gained the lead in upper
stretch, drew clear, drifted in near the eighth pole, switched to her left lead late and prevailed under steady handling. I'M NOT JOKING hugged the inner rail,
was put to urging near the three eighths pole, chased the pace and finished gamely. YES I'M EVIL , unhurried down the backstretch, swung to the six path
turning for home and flattened out. ALL GOOD TIMES raced inside horses and offered a mil, late gain. ANNIKA GOLD , three wide the first turn, raced four
wide the far turn and failed to be a factor. FIRTH set the pace in the two path and faltered in upper stetch. COLLOQUIUM , three wide on the turns,
prompted the pace and faltered.

UNMOORED sped to the front, set a rated pace about two wide, opened up after being set down in upper stretch and proved much the best while kept to
task. CHARGE TO VICTORY , four wide, steadily advanced into the lane, churned on while failing to switch leads and was clear for the place. ROYAL
COMMISH , off the pace, moved up towards the rail past the five sixteenths but lacked a solid finish. SINGANOTHERSONG flashed speed then steadied
after a sixteenth of a mile, dropped back two wide mid turn and failed to seriously recover. DEGAS , away alertly, forced the pace three wide outside the
winner, failed to keep up leaving the quarter pole then faded in the final eighth. COOP TRIES HARDER stumbled at the break, lost ground four wide mid
turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
LITTLE SKIFF broke sharply and cleared in the initial strides, was well handled setting the pace off the inside, kicked away a bit when given her cue in
upper stretch, kept on under hand urging past the furlong grounds, wandered outward then lasted after a few reminders with a turned down right stick. TOO
MUCH TIP stalked inside, eased out for room in upper stretch, straightened to be about three wide, was floated out a bit late and closed steadily to miss.
BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) , off the pace while saving ground, was patiently handled mid turn, cut the corner into the lane and rallied. FOGGY DREAMS
lacked speed, angled out leaving the three eighths, circled five wide into the stretch and closed willingly. WHY NOW , four wide nearing the half mile pole,
raced between rivals into the stretch but failed to generate a rally. DELICIOUS PURSUIT chased outside a rival, raced three then four wide in upper stretch
and gave way. SPLASHERSTOWN broke awkwardly, steadied briefly near the half mile pole and failed to menace. GOLDEN CAN , three to four wide
pursuing the pace, dropped back soon into the lane.

Footnotes
THUNDERSHOOK , two wide around the turn, remained in the two path through the stretch, closed inside horses, led late and drove clear. ZOOMER ,
caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate, was alertly steered to the inside soon after the break, hugged the inner rail thereafter and rallied strongly.
HOLD ME BLACK prompted the pace three wide around the turn, drifted to the five path when gaining the lead in mid stretch and weakened. PAT DADDY
chased the pace four deep around the turn, angled to the six path in upper stretch and flattened out. LAWN BOY (GB) , two wide on the turn, offered a mild
gain inside horses late. STROLL SMOKIN set a pressured pace two wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way. SEANY P , three wide on
the turn, gave way. NOVA BOY , four wide on the turn, angled to the seven path in upper stretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SINGAPORE TRADER prompted the pace three wide outside ABIDING STAR, drew alongside leaving the far turn, gained a slim advantage after six
furlongs, turned away an outside threat nearing the lane, kicked clear once set down in upper stretch, widened in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert.
PATRIOT DRIVE settled well off the inside, commenced a run near the five sixteenths, circled four to five wide into the lane and closed steadily to be clear
of the rest. NILEATOR bobbled slightly at the break, recovered and edged up four wide leaving the seven eighths to stalk the pace, bid three deep mid way
on the final turn, failed to match strides entering the stretch, chased to mid stretch and faded. TOE CURLIN' KISS lacked speed then passed some tired
foes in deep stretch. ABIDING STAR , right to the front, set the pace off the inside, handled outside pressure into the far turn, dueled past the five
sixteenths, saw the winner get away soon into the stretch then succumbed a furlong out. CHARGIN STORM chased towards the inside, shifted out in upper
stretch and faded. POSTERITY , away slowly, was outrun.

Footnotes
HARPERS FIRST RIDE , alertly steered to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail, disputed the pace with OWENDALE, was put to brisk
urging in the stretch, drew off and switched to his left lead late. OWENDALE , close up approaching the first turn, disputed the pace outside the winner down
the backstretch, around the far turn, remained almost on even terms with that one to mid stretch then weakened. CORDMAKER , allowed to settle back off
the early lead, stalked the pace inside horses, angled to the three path leaving the far turn and offered a mild gain in the drive. TENFOLD raced outside
horses down the backstretch, swung to the four path entering the far turn, circled four deep into the stretch and lacked the needed late response.
FOREWARNED , steadied when shuffled back about a furlong after the break, raced three wide the first turn, was well positioned on the far turn, steadied
behind CORDMAKER leaving the far turn then failed to rally. SOMEDAY JONES raced in the two path between horses down the back while in a stalking
position then gave way on the far turn. CLUBMAN , steadied when shuffled back about a sixteenth of a mile after the break, was outrun.
