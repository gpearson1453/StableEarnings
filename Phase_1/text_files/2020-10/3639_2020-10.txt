Footnotes
BROWN EYED BOY moved to the front from the outside entering the backstretch, was clear before a half, stayed out from the rail around the final turn and
held after a long drive. ROYAL COUP bumped with BIFF entering the first turn, came out into the three path on the final turn while moving then gained
slowly through the lane. SILVER EDGE made the early pace along the rail, bobbled and lost action nearing the four-and-a-half pole, remained within striking
distance along the rail but lacked the needed closing response. BIFF bumped with ROYAL COUP entering the first turn, came outside, raced the three path
around the final turn and gained late. WHERE'S THE BEN'S lagged early then found best stride too late. BLOOD RUNNER stopped inside and was eased
up.

HASHTAG WINNING was rated well out from the rail early, moved two wide to command early on the final turn, ran clear approaching the lane and widened
under mild urging. HERO'S HOPE was unhurried when caught well out into the track around the first turn, raced the four path around the final turn then
made a belated run outside. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST came well out into the track early while trailing, made a run in the four path around the final turn then
flattened out in the lane. EYES ON ME opened a clear lead into the first turn, stayed well out from the rail on the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the
far turn then tired. PAPA JOEL wasn't far back in the three path for over a half then stopped. TIZ SAMURAI stayed close on the outside to the far turn,
stopped and was eased up through the lane. The race was delayed 14 minutes while repairs were made to the track. The horses stayed in the paddock
during the delay.

through the lane. GIO LUCKY raced three wide around the turn and made up some ground between horses in the stretch. MORGAN S. bobbled leaving the
gate, gained early position outside, raced two wide around the turn and weakened. MALICIOUS INTENT improved position along the rail on the turn then
tired. SHAZAM broke slowly then was wide and outrun. I'M JUST LAUGHING had position along the rail for about a half then stopped. CAUSE FOR

Footnotes
SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS took command at once, stayed out from the rail once clear on the turn and was under urging through the lane. LOXODROME came
in some leaving the gate, bumped with GET SET, moved to press inside the winner into the turn then couldn't keep up but was clearly second best. AFLEET
TRAXX improved position two wide between horses on the turn then flattened out. TRIPLE A. PLUS had early position outside, was caught five wide around
the turn and weakened. LONG TOM ducked out sharply leaving the gate, bumped MANAHAWKIN then wasn't a factor. GET SET was shuffled back when
bumped from both sides leaving the gate, moved up outside early, raced four wide between horses around the turn and weakened. MANAHAWKIN was
bumped into GADAGO leaving the gate then wasn't a factor. GADAGO was fractious in the gate, was bumped and taken back from tight quarters leaving
the gate then was outrun. CRAIGGER had to be reloaded after becoming fractious in the gate, had position between horses into the turn then stopped.

through the lane. PICASSO MOON wasn't far back along the rail into the far turn, came out two wide between rivals and lacked a closing response.
GRACEYGAB raced three wide and weakened. TAKIN IT EASY stayed out from the inside while making the pace to the far turn then tired.

SHANGHAI MAGIC raced the two path around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, drew even on the front nearing the final sixteenth but was little
match. CALS MY PAL was slow from the gate, trailed early, circled around the turn and finished fast far out into the track. FOALSFILLYSPECIAL rallied the
rail around the turn, came out between rivals for the drive, loomed boldly into midstretch and flattened out. ART FORM raced four wide around the turn and
lacked a closing. NEARLY MISSED raced two wide and failed to menace. MAD MOMMA was hustled from the gate, moved to a short lead midway on the
turn, ran clear into the stretch then tired. PINK was finished early. RISQUE'S TREASURE was clear soon after the break, made the pace two wide into the
turn then stopped.
