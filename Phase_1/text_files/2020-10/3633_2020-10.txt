JENPIRESTRIKESBACK settled in just off rail and stalked the leaders, rallied inside to the stretch, eased out at the head of the lane and rallied steadily to
just get up. GALWALKSINTOABAR set all of the pace from the inside and gave way grudgingly. VACAVILLE SPECIAL permitted to settle early, came three
wide to the stretch but lacked a cloing responce. INCREDIBLY LUCKY trailed to the stretch and lacked a response. UNION SMARTIE pressed the pace
from off the rail and faded.

the pace from the inside and raced gamely to the wire. PRINCESS VIVIAN set the pace from off the rail and weakened. DRAW ME always within striking

MR. PICKLES was not asked for speed in the early going, ased out to circled his rivals four wide on the second turn, quickly took command and drew off as
much the best. ZOFFA pressed the pace two wide, led briefly but was no match for the winner. MISTY CAT the pace pace from the inside but had little to
offer in the stretch. ARMA D'ORO was settled early, raced three wide throughout and did not rally. SOONER THAN SOONER had no response after a two
wide trip. QUE SERA SIR RALPH saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
MO BOB (IRE) controlled the pace throughout and had enough to last. SEAU chased the winner throughout but could make little impact. LITTLE NO WAY
raced unhurried to the second turn then finished with some speed from the inside. JIMMY D lagged early, raced three wide on the second turn and came on.
SHOT OF A LIFETIME was well placed to the second turn from off the rail but had no response. LIFELINE failed to respond. PRAISE LOUDLY showed
little.
