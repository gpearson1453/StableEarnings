handling to hold on well. SCYTHE gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path, was carried out entering the stretch but got up for second in later
yards. BEST SHOT chased the winner off the rail, drifted into the lane then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. GRAND FIBER chased the pace
inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. ZEP chased the pace through the backstretch, raced in the four path of the turn and finished well
outside. SWISS SUNRISE gave chase about the three path then flattened stride past the eighth pole.

Footnotes
MODERN COWPOKE stalked the pace three wide then bid past the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dug
in under determined handling to inch away from LIL SILVER FOX, who raced with the pace two deep and dueled with the edge past the seven sixteenths
pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in gamely to deep stretch before ceding; reluctantly. WEAVING YOU BEHIND raced
with the pace inside and dueled close past the seven sixteenths pole, but, steadied from tight quarters nearest the rail approaching the quarter pole,
dropped back on the far turn and flattened stride. MEYERS STORM became fractious in the gate and steadily retreated after the break.

Footnotes
STEP OUT DANCING raced well off the early pace while saving ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved from that point and
raced at the rail on the far turn, angled four wide into the stretch and dug in to get up later yards. CARTER'S RUN settled off the earlier pace in the three
and four paths and left the first turn outside, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path, finished well to take second the
final yards and was gaining on the winner. CATCH MY CABOOSE settled off the pace and off the rail, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the
rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn, and while outfinished for second, maintained third. PRINCE OF WINDSOR raced off the pace about the three
path then picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn, eased three wide into the stretch and finished evenly.
SUPER GARNER was urged clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure into the far turn, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in
through the stretch and held on to deep going, but gave way late yards. CHARITABLE VISIT raced well back off the rail the first turn then started an outside
bid into the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the six path, left the turn widest and finished well. ROCKET ROAD showed little response through the
backstretch.

hold on. After leading the opening three sixteenths, THUNDER PUNCH gave chase from the three eighths pole and dropped back past the five sixteenths,
but, dug in leaving the turn and was making late gains. BELLA FEMMINA chased the early pace inside then eased to the six path on the turn and was along
to take third the final yards. GLOBAL FIRST chased the pace and raced near the rail on the turn then flattened stride later yards. CELIA'S PRIDE gave
chase and raced in the five path of the turn, but flattened stride later yards. COOK THE BOOKS chased the pace, raced in the three path of the turn and

Footnotes
DANZ A REBEL stalked the earlier pace from the three path then bid leaving the three eighths pole, closed to the front three wide approaching the quarter,
raced clear midway on the far turn and was ridden out under a hand ride. CASHTON PEAK settled off the early pace saving ground then bid into the
backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path, eased outward toward the head of the head of the lane and dug in to take second inside the sixteenth.
BLIMEY LIMEY stalked the pace in the three path and challenged toward the seven sixteenths, continued a close factor to mid turn but dropped back at that
point and flattened stride later yards. A. P. D'ORO raced well back saving early ground and picked up the chase into the backstretch, eased outward past
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the seven path and passed some rivals down the lane. BAY HILL rounded the opening turn about the five
path and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced three wide on the far turn then faded. OFFSHORE TRIP was
hustled to the front and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead nearing the quarter
and faded at the rail on the far turn. STACKSDENERO bobbled leaving the gate and settled off the rail, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole then
faded on the far turn. OUTVOTED was through early.

Footnotes
NURSE TOMPKINS raced well off the early pace while saving ground the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and angled out to circle rivals in
the five path of the far turn, then dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. NORTHERN HEAT steadied early and rounded the opening turn in the five
path, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, took a slim lead two deep entering the stretch, drifted a bit, came back to the front mid-stretch but was
caught late while able to hold second. YOUR EYES TO MINE took the lead and angled to the inside nearing the three quarter pole, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths, dueled clear approaching the five sixteenths, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch, though,
continued on gamely. SO RED THE ROSE raced off the pace toward the inside then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three
path and showed little more. HOT POSSEBILITY rated close to the early pace inside then gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the
far turn and had little left. ROARING SIDECAR rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace leaving the turn, picked up the chase from
the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the four path of the far turn. RESPECTED stalked the pace two deep the first turn then challenged leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, remained close through the backstretch then faded on the far turn. THANK YOU GIRL rounded the first turn about the five path and raced
outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

Footnotes
PAUL'S PLUNDER chased the early pace outside then took the lead three wide toward the quarter pole, contested the edge through the turn, dueled clear
mid-stretch and widened later yards. WHOA BLACK BETTY was slow getting into stride but steadily closed the gap, circled rivals in the six path of the turn,
dug in with a strong stretch bid to take second later yards and was gaining on the winner. MOON ME AGAIN chased the pace toward the inside, eased to
the four path rounding the turn and dug in to take third the final yards. MS. HAITI took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, gave
up the lead nearing the quarter pole but continued close at the rail on the turn, dropped back mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. BUSTIN
BUNNY gave chase and rounded the turn about the three path, though showed little in the lane. SMOOKIE pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths
pole but dropped back midway on the turn and weakened from the eighth pole. SHORE SHOT was outrun. TRIKKI NIKKI veered out at the break, gave
chase outside and rounded the turn about the seven path. TRACI'S GIRL gave chase then faded off the rail on the turn.
