Footnotes
WORKIN ECLIPTICAL settled off the early pace three wide, raced two wide around the far turn, closed inside through the lane and was up in deep stretch.
BEACH CHICK set the pace in the two path, put away the pace rivals to go clear in the lane but was caught late. LEARNT saved ground off the pace,
steadied off heels in upper stretch then rallied inside to gain the show. MY GLORY raced in range three wide around the first turn, two wide around the far
turn, had clear sailing in upper stretch and was one-paced in the lane. LA PINTA settled off the pace two wide, saved ground around most of the far turn,
angled out near the quarter pole, advanced through upper stretch but evened out late. ABUELA CORI broke slowly, was gunned up four wide around the
first turn, reached even terms and vied two wide down the backstretch and came up empty in the lane. OKALANI prompted the pace three wide between
foes and faded nearing the lane. TONALA hopped at the start and was outrun while racing two wide. VOODOOISM chased the pace four wide and tired.
MELANIE'S PRIDE steadied along at the rail around the first turn and was through early.

EXIT RIGHT stalked outside VENEZUELAN WARRIOR, took over after six furlongs and drew clear under a mild drive. VENEZUELAN WINNER established
an even pace to the far turn, proved no match for the winner after straightening away for the drive, and was clearly second best. GEOMETRICO broke
slowly, raced in the three-path much of the way, and posed no threat. CONGRATS AGAIN advanced mildly through the middle stages, but could not sustain
the rally. ALTMAN went along in striking range to the far turn, and lacked a solid response. PAINTED RAGS raced three to four wide early, and was not a
factor. TOLL GATE stopped after a half-mile, and jogged in far behind.

Footnotes
THRESHOLD was unhurried while racing two wide early, circled five wide around the far turn, reached near even terms approaching the eighth pole, dueled
outside of FREEDOM MATTERS from there and prevailed. FREEDOM MATTERS set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner, fought on to the
wire and gave way grudgingly. ZULU raced well back inside early, advanced three wide around the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, angled out leaving
the eighth pole and rallied outside. TUNE IN had early speed between rivals, rated back approaching the first turn, saved ground off the pace, cut the corner
into the lane, bid at the rail nearing the eighth pole and lacked a clear path through the late stages. CLINT MAROON (GB) stalked the pace two wide, bid
between foes near the quarter pole and evened out in the lane. ZAP DADDY checked early, saved ground off the pace rounding the first turn, advanced four
wide between foes around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. CAPTAIN D was outrun inside. SOUPER JAGUAR prompted the pace three wide,
checked while tiring near the quarter pole and retreated.

Footnotes
KIGER pressed FIGO from outside, met scant resistance taking over and moving clear past the three-eighths pole, drifted out brushing lightly with
CARPENTERS CALL leaving the furlong grounds, and widened late. CARPENTERS CALL eyed the leaders three wide for nearly six furlongs, loomed
outside KIGER through upper stretch, got brushed lightly while staying on his left lead, and was outfinished while much best of the others. TRIPLE
JEOPARDY raced three to four wide around the turns, and was clear for the show while not a factor. FIGO set the pace inside, could not withstand the
winner after five furlongs, and tired. BIG CITY RED tired before going six furlongs. TRUE CHAMPION was off two or three lengths behind the field, was
choppy-gaited a long way last coming off the far turn, got pulled up and was vanned off. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF
CARPENTERS CALL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
FOLLOW ME MOM pressed the pace three wide, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged under a drive. TONY'S ROSE raced off the pace two
wide, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and rallied. SWEETSWEETSWEET set the pace in the two path, was collared near the
sixteenth pole and lost second late. BY HIS GRACE saved ground off the pace, swung six wide near the three-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead
and rallied widest. BROADWAY PEGGY lacked early speed while saving ground, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between rivals. LADY NOY stalked
the pace from the rail, bid nearing the eighth pole but was outfinished. EFFIEMEISTER trailed outside early, raced three wide around the turn, came widest
in upper stretch and never threatened. YELLEN played no factor while racing three wide. SHELL BEACH PARTY chased the pace four wide and retreated
through the lane.

Footnotes
BIG THORN began moving midway on the turn, caught WARRIOR'S PRIDE from outside near the sixteenth-pole, and quickly drew away while swapping
back to his left lead. TAPSASIONAL advanced two wide getting closest to the breakaway pacesetter after three furlongs, rallied into second in deep stretch,
then just saved that spot. LAST MINUTE DEAL saved ground well out of things to the stretch, moved off the rail finding his best stride a sixteenth out, and
surged late between horses. WARRIOR'S PRIDE broke sharply and sped off through fast early fractions, grew leg weary a furlong out and gave way inside.
HARDCORE JUSTICE was outsprinted early inside, shifted out a few paths turning for home, and finished evenly. LITTLE DEMON raced two to three wide
for a half-mile, and lacked a solid late response. THOROVER broke slowly and was outrun early, swung four wide into the lane and made no impact.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT pursued WARRIOR'S PRIDE to the turn, and was finished before going a half. BLACK RIDDLE hesitated at the start spotting the field
four lengths or so, and showed nothing.

Footnotes
MAX K. O. set a clear pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. OVER THE CHANNEL settled off the pace along the inside, tipped out in upper
stretch and finished willingly to be clearly second best. DUROCHER saved ground off the pace, moved into third in upper stretch and finished evenly to
maintain that position. SCRAPS saved ground well back, tipped three wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. HARBOUR MASTER (GB) failed to
menace while racing two wide. COWBOY'S HERO stalked the winner two wide in the clear and came up empty. SECOND MATE saved ground off the
pace, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. STIRLING DRIVE played no factor while racing three wide around the first turn and five
wide the far turn. ROCKET JOE COPPER raced four wide around both turns and was through after a half. DREAM LINER (BRZ) chased the pace three
wide and tired.

Footnotes
NORTHERN set a pressured early pace inside, shook off his pursuers after a half-mile, and was driving to stay clear. DR HARLAN cut the corner advancing
into the stretch, angled out past the three-sixteenths pole, and finished with good energy. DARK AGES steadied back at the start, lagged well out of it to the
stretch, and rallied willingly in the two-path to go clear of the rest. FRENCH QUARTER came four wide off the turn, and was one-paced through the lane on
his left lead. STAR JUANCHO entered the stretch in the five-path, and made no headway. KAREN'S COVE was no factor two wide.
FOLLOWHISFOOTSTEPS pressed the early pace between horses, and weakened in the stretch. JAMAICAN dropped back around the turn, rallied mildly
through upper stretch, then flattened out. WAR GIANT chased outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, and tired. STARSHIP APOLLO was outrun
inside.
