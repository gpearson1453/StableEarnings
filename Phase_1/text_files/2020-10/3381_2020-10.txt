Footnotes
FOOD AND WINE pressed the pace, moved up along the backstretch to assume command, shied from the whip and veered out in the upper stretch,
responded to pressure, drew off and held safely. TORRES DEL PAINE ducked out at the start, was never far off the pace, challenged for the lead on the far
turn to loom a threat, fell back and was no match late. FLEET ADMIRAL was unhurried early, saved ground, advanced around the turn and finished well
inside to earn show. DAPER'S DRINK settled off the pace in a good position, rallied around the turn, bid and came up empty. STAND MY GROUND raced
in the back, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. SENOR SEVILLE lagged early, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a response. CLASSY
SOLUTION raced close to the pace, bid near the inside, had nothing left and gave way. SECURITY BREACH raced mid pack in an eeven effort and did not
threaten. HOSTILE WITNESS was not a factor. MY MOONSHINE was outrun. SINGLE FOCUS set the pace, fell back along the backstretch, tired into the
turn and gave way. OVERPOWER trailed the field.

angled out and offered a mild bid to be along for show. JOLLY SWAGMAN was in tight and carried out entering the first turn, fell back and improved position
in a steady effort. RATIFY pressed the pace while racing in hand, fell back on the turn, came up empty in the drive and faded. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME raced
close to the pace while saving ground, tired on the turn and gave way. DESHACKLED set the pace, tired on the turn and gave way. STROLLED ON BY was
in tight while racing between horses entering the first turn, raced outside and lacked a bid. RIPKEN was crowded and veered out entering the first turn,
dropped back and went evenly thereafter. AUCHINCRUIVE was in tight and came out entering the first turn and was through after a half. The stewards'

JOSEPH. JOSEPH was unhurried early, advanced to the turn, awaited room, bid between horses, closed willingly, got up late for place and was gaining on
the winner. NAUTICAL NATURE was sent to the front to set the pace to deep stretch, was outclosed in a good effort and lost position late. PADRINO'S
HEART was steadied behind horses along the backstretch, got through along the inside leaving the turn and closed well. TRIFOR GOLD raced close to the
pace along the inside, fell back and was taken off the rail, bid willingly and didn't have enough late. JEBOLOGIST showed speed to the turn, dropped back
and gave way. START WITH YES lagged early, raced outside, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. KNEESINTHEBREEZE showed speed to the

Footnotes
CLEAR VISION saved ground, shifted out on the far turn, challenged two across, dueled to late stretch and inched clear to prove best. GUNNISON was
unhurried early while never far back, was roused on the far turn, finished well, was gaining late and got up for place. DUNDALK set a pressured pace,
responded when challenged to duel to late stretch, faltered and settled for show. LAGOM pressed the pace while racing three wide to the turn and flattened
out. LIL COMMISSIONER pressed the pace between horses to the turn, tired and stopped. CAN'T PASS IT UP trailed the field.

Footnotes
HALFINTHEWRAPPER set the pace, drew off for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. LE PETITE PAPILLON was never far off the pace, bid
inside, closed steadily to narrow the gap, was no threat to the winner and finished second best. PROUD MANDATE was never far back, offered a mild bid
only and was along for show. MILLIE CHILD settled in the back and improved position in a steady effort. GO AMANDA lagged early, went widest in the drive
and lacked a bid. POLISHED COPPER saved ground, bid inside and came up empty. LAKE CHICOT stalked the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave
way.
