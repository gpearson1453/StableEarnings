Footnotes
GUNFIGHTERJUSTICE was allowed to settle early, went up three wide around the five eighths pole, made a four wide bid on the second turn, drew clear in
the final sixteenth to prove best, driving. HENRY RULES set the pace from the inside while being well handled on the front end, was sent down turning for
home, started to wander around the furlong marker, proved to be no match for the winner late while saving the place. DIRTY JUSTICE was rated early on
the inside, then eased out five wide around the five sixteenths pole for racing room, then offered a mild late rally to grab the show award late. ROYAL ICING
was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace setter three wide to the top of the stretch, angled in at the three sixteenths pole, but lacked the needed
stretch bid, lost show spot late. GUARD was three wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide, was bumped by the winner by the five eighths pole,
then tired. BENNY'S LEGACY failed to menace. UNCLE ROY was well placed early on the inside, steadied around the eleven sixteenths pole, stopped. The
mile time is omitted due to a timer malfunction. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
BLACK SAPPHIRE set the pace while racing off the rail and being well handled, then was sent down past the three sixteenths pole, then kept a safe margin
to the wire while being kept to her task. SERENA BECK stalked the early pace from in between horses and four wide, then made a four wide bid on the turn,
stayed on well but could not gain on the winner while clearly second best, good effort. BETCHA stalked the early pace three wide and in between rivals, fell
back slightly on the turn, then came three wide into the drive but lacked the needed stretch bid while besting the rest. SHES THE CAUSE was allowed to
settle early, came into the stretch four wide to offer a belated rally. BLOODY MARY MORNIN was off a length slow, outrun early, came seven wide into the
stretch to have a mild late rally. DRINKATTHECREEK stalked the early pace and made a mild bid five wide on the turn but was empty in the drive. GOLDEN
COMMAND was reserved early and was four wide by the quarter pole, came into the stretch five wide but had no rally. SHACKLELACKALACKA stalked the
pace from the inside then weakened.Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
T D DANCE was away alertly and was well rated early, made a three wide move past the five sixteenths pole, hit the front leaving the quarter pole, then was
kept to mild pressure to prove best while clear. BIG BLUE was allowed to settle early, was advancing on the second turn, awaited room leaving the quarter
pole, angled out four wide entering the stretch, finished well but failed to gain on winner while second best. FEBRUARY SON was bumped shortly after the
start, then was well reserved early, came into the stretch five wide, rallied well in the stretch. COMMITTED was settled back early, came into the stretch
seven wide to have a mild late rally. CAVE HILL was reserved early, then was two to three wide on the second turn, then found best stride late under mild
urging. TEXAS GANO was allowed to settle early, made a mild bid four wide past the quarter pole but was empty in the drive. SPEND BENJAMINS set an
unchallenged pace, then weakened after six furlongs. PARROT HEAD was allowed to settle while three to four wide but offered no rally. LODE OF
BLARNEY made a middle move on the inside then was empty. EXTRORBINAIRE failed to menace. ENRAGED was not a factor. Per Stewards, due to
Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

SOUL STREIT was sent to the lead and drew off on the turn, then drifted out slightly in the final sixteenth but held sway late to prove best under a drive.
HURRICANE HIGHWAY was reserved early, then launched a bid six wide past the quarter pole, then was five wide by the three sixteenths pole, continued
to close well but could not get to the winner, too late. GREELEY AND BEN was allowed to settle early and advanced on the inside by the quarter pole,
swung out three wide past the three sixteenths pole, rallied well but was outfinished for the place. KEEPIN IT CLASSY tracked the early pace, then was
three wide nearing the three sixteenths pole but faded. KELLER'S GOLD tracked the early pace four wide then weakened. CABOT TRAIL chased the early
pace, then moved to the inside in the stretch but had no rally. OLSON tracked the early pace in between rivals then tired. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19
protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

to make a bid on the front runners, assumed command before the furlong marker and was ridden out to prove much the best. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE
dueled for the early lead three wide and made a bid leaving the quarter pole, but proved to be no match for the winner while besting the others for the place
award. JETS A GINNIN dueled for the lead on the inside then faded final furlong while being outfinished for the place award, bested rest. MISS

Footnotes
TEE EM EYE was well rated early towards the inside, then was sent down to make a bid and was five wide past the quarter pole, continued that bid to go on
even terms past the sixteenth pole, then wore down that rival late to edge clear the final fifty yards to prove best under a drive. JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP set a
pressured pace then dueled for the lead towards the inside past the quarter pole, then shook clear past the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner
late in a game effort. PICANTE CALIENTE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the stretch while holding on to
the show award. SOME SAY SO was well placed on the inside, then checked past the three eighths pole on the inside, then lacked the needed winning bid
in the stretch. CREATIVE CREDIT stalked the early pace and came into the stretch four wide but had no punch. SUGARSUGARSUGAR was bumped at the
start, then was settled back early, came wide into the stretch to offer a belated rally. RAINTREE STARLET pressed the early pace, then was shuffled back
on the turn, swung out three wide for the drive but had no bid. SHE'S ALL SKEET lacked a rally. MAGINE had no response while on the inside early. Per
Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S CROSS broke outwardly at the start, then went up to duel for the lead three wide, made a bid past the three sixteenths pole, then drew clear past
the sixteenths pole, then drifted out slightly under left handed stick urging to remain clear. KULMER was allowed to settle early, advanced into contention on
the turn, then eased out to make a bid six wide leaving the quarter pole, angled in past the sixteenth pole, while gaining. CARSON RULES dueled for the
lead on the inside then faded final furlong, grudgingly. STORMY CACTUSA was keen early and went up in between horses to duel for the lead past the
seven sixteenths pole, then weakened final quarter of a mile. PRETTY BOY DAVE stalked the pace four wide to the top of the stretch then was empty.
WAVE LAND OUTLAW was not a factor. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.
