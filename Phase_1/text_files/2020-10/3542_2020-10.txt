Footnotes
MY BLONDE MARY chased the pace and rounded the turn about the three path then dug in from the head of the lane to take over mid-stretch and fought
off DOMS LADY through the final sixteenth. The latter of whom gave chase off the rail and angled out through the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the
stretch then outfinished in the duel through the lane. HICKORY MADE gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn at the rail, then raced
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. I AM AINE chased the pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly to pass
rivals. TRACI'S GIRL set a pressured pace inside, was steadily encouraged leaving the turn and was caught flattening stride mid-stretch. TRAP CITY raced
close in the three and four paths and had range on the leaders through the turn but showed little in the lane. MNEMOSYNE steadied on the chute, angled to
the outside to give chase then raced at the rail on the turn.

BANISHMENT stalked the pace from the mid point of the opening turn then challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dug in determinedly to take over
mid-stretch and was inching ahead through later yards. FRATHOUSE MUSIC took the lead midway on the first turn and rated the pace, was pressured
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dug in gamely, gave up the nod inside the sixteenth pole and grudgingly ceded. VIPER settled off the pace in the two
and three paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then finished well. NORTH DUBAI saved ground off the pace, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened stride. COMPROMISO raced in the five path the first turn and settled
off the pace from the seven eighths pole, bid nearing the three eighths, rounded the far turn near the rail then weakened. DEPUTY DREW raced well back
and entered the backstretch outside, but showed little response. A. P. D'ORO settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
BARBSGRAY LION was hustled along to set a pressured pace, dueled clear midway on the turn and held well under steady encouragement. WIGGLE IT
JIGGLEIT chased the early pace off the rail then angled four wide nearing the head of the lane, dug in for second mid-stretch and finished evenly.
UNCANNY chased the earlier pace toward the inside, eased out leaving the turn then flattened later yards. DON'T SPIN ME came away rank then gave
chase outside leaving the chute, rounded the turn about the seven path and finished well, while extremely wide. SAVANNAH ROXANNA chased the early
pace outside, angled to the rail past the quarter pole and finished evenly. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE chased the pace through the backstretch, drifted on the
turn then flattened stride. LADY REBEL closed to contention and dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, but dropped back midway on the turn
and gave way from the eighth pole.

Footnotes
FONEY took over at the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, widened at the
rail on the far turn and drew off under steady handling. CRYPTOSONDE rated close off the rail then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far near the rail and was not a match in the lane. LIL SILVER FOX settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. CESAR AUGUSTO stalked the early pace two deep then gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, drifted toward the head of the lane and weakened. WEAVING YOU BEHIND was carried wide into the first turn, raced well
off the pace into the backstretch and showed little response. LUCA'S DREAM bore out entering the first turn and raced well back. MY FINAL NINJA became
edgy in the gate, saved ground the first turn and was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
MY EMINENCE saved ground off the early pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in to take the lead later
yards. MEILLEUR stalked the early pace three wide then took the lead two deep at the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure from the seven
sixteenths, drew clear at the five sixteenths and dug in under steady encouragement leaving the far turn, but was caught later yards. THE PREDICTOR set
the early pace inside, was caught at the nine sixteenths pole, returned to challenge leaving the seven sixteenths, but dropped back at the five sixteenths,
raced at the rail through the far turn and weakened. MACANAO settled back off the rail early on then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and flattened stride leaving the turn. ROYAL BLUE stalked the early pace then gave chase leaving the half mile pole, though,
weakened in the four path of the far turn. GLEN'S CASTLE rounded the first turn about the four path and was not a factor. FRENCH'S QUEST raced in the
five path the opening turn and was not a factor.

FIRST FIGHTER angled to the inside to rate the pace, was pressured into the far turn, raced at the rail through the turn then steadily encouraged to widen.
EJE GAMA settled off the pace though raced hemmed in most of the backstretch, bid at the rail leaving the quarter pole, raced off the rail through the far
turn but had to settle for second. LEVEL SEVENTEEN stalked two deep then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in
the three and four paths then flattened later yards. GALLEON LIGHT rounded the opening turn about the four path and picked up the chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. UNCLE JESSIE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths
pole and rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. VIRGINIALOVERS raced well off the pace and showed little response through the
backstretch. LUCKY PARK mostly saved ground. HUNT TWENTY SEVEN stalked three wide on the opening turn then gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, though, weakened on the far turn. SHANGHAI CHORUS raced well back and had no response.

Footnotes
SWEETONTHEGENTS came away a step slow then accelerated to the front inside nearing the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear into the turn and raced at
the rail through the turn and was steadily handled to hold on. PAUL'S PLUNDER raced with the pace three wide then dropped back toward the quarter pole,
rounded the turn still three wide and dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole, while gaining on the winner. HOUSE OF LOVE gave chase outside, raced
in the four path of the turn and finished well at the outside flank of the runner-up. MAMA DUNE raced with the early pace off the rail and continued on evenly
to late stretch before flattening stride. LOVE HAPPY gave chase and rounded the turn five wide then lugged in through the lane while finishing evenly.
YOUR EYES TO MINE gave chase then faded off the rail on the turn. PROMENADE PRINCESS chased the pace outside, rounded the turn about the six
path and was not a factor. HOT POSSEBILITY saved ground.

Footnotes
VERN H settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then bid approaching the three eighths pole, challenged leaving the quarter, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement to take the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear later yards. ASTRO
RIDER stalked the pace two deep while between horses then steadied at the rail off the inside flank of Gattosing nearing the quarter pole, resumed his
efforts past the pole, angled three wide leaving the far turn and dug in to take second later yards while too late to catch the winner. GATTOSING angled to
the inside to rate a slim lead, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn, dug in under
steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened stride. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled off the rail well off the
early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and came through the far turn about the three path, eased to the outside in the upper stretch and finished
evenly. EAGLE PRIDE raced off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn then picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail, though flattened the final furlong. IMPERIAL IVOR stalked three wide the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then
faded in the three path of the far turn. MRHUNTSSILVER rated off the pace the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened
stride at the rail the far turn. RADCLIFFE ROYALE hesitated leaving the gate then stalked four wide the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole
then faded past the five sixteenths. AUTS REVOLUTION broke awkwardly and raced in the five path the first turn, entered the backstretch outside, showed
only mild response through the backstretch and came through the far turn in the six path.
