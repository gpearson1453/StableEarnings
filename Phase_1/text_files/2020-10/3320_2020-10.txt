DOODLE HOPPER settled off the early pace outside, moved three wide into contention around the turn, steadily gained outside, seized command near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. CAUSE HE'S WESTERN saved ground in range, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between rivals to
gain the place late. CREDIT CYCLE lagged well back in the four path early and rallied widest. SOUL P SAY prompted the pace three wide, took the lead
near the five-sixteenths pole, led to the sixteenth marker and weakened late. DRILL'S LI'L MAN set the pace along the rail, was collared near the
five-sixteenths pole, fought on inside to midstretch and weakened late. EARLY ENTRY had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
SOLAR WARMING raced closest to the runaway pacesetter two wide in the clear through the opening half, advanced two wide around the far turn, seized
command near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. STARINTHEMAKING saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the
five-sixteenths pole, bid nearing the lane but was no match for the winner. TIZ SAMURAI sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, was
collared near the five-sixteenths pole but fought on inside to save the show. CHARGING LION chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed
rally. MY FRIEND LINUS failed to menace while racing two wide. BRANDT saved ground well back, angled five wide near the quarter pole and never
threatened. WILD ABOUT DEB played no factor while racing three wide. PER RULING 124-2020 FROM THE DELEWARE RACING COMMISSION,
CHARGING LION WAS DQ DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

KILLER DRESS stalked the pace two wide, finished strongly under moderate urging and was up in deep stretch. BELLA BETTINA set the pace along the
rail, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and led to deep stretch. PUMA PUNKU settled off the pace along the inside, raced two wide around the
far turn, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. MY DESDEMONA chased the top two from the rail and lacked a rally. INANNA'S
QUEST raced off the pace inside, made progress at the rail around the far turn, angled out near the quarter pole and had a mild rally. SIBA steadied getting
out around the first turn, saved ground around the far turn and never threatened. VELADERA was fractious in the gate, chased the pace three wide, lacked
a closing bid and was vanned off. JOYFUL JILL was extremely reluctant to load and played no factor while racing four wide. WORLD PARTY was outrun
three and four wide. VESPER had brief speed four wide. BODACIOUS BLEND trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TRULY RED prompted the pace four wide down the backstretch, bid three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms approaching the quarter pole,
continued on the left lead through much of the lane, switched leads near the sixteenth pole and powered clear. PREMIUM MOTION settled off the pace
outside, raced three wide around the turn and rallied through the lane. DREAMS OF SHIRLEY raced off the pace two wide, angled in in upper stretch,
continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied inside. EIGHTY SIX METS set the pace in the two path, dueled to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished
late. DEIRDRE OF LEGEND bumped twice with NOBODY'S ANGEL in the early strides, had early speed inside, dropped back around the turn, angled
widest near the quarter pole, re-rallied outside and just missed the minor awards. BEACHTREASUREGIRL saved ground off the pace, angled four wide
near the quarter pole and was no threat. NOBODY'S ANGEL bumped twice early, had early speed two wide, stopped and was eased.

Footnotes
DAVID'S PROSPEC set a pressured pace along the rail, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole, regained command in upper stretch and edged ahead
under a drive. WICKED STRONG ALEX steadied along while keyed up just behind the winner around the first turn, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths
pole, rallied outside under a tight right rein while trying to lug in throughout the final furlong. MIAMI STEVE pressed the winner two wide, took a narrow lead
near the five-sixteenths pole, battled on between rivals through midstretch then was outfinished late. SUNDAY CLOTHES hesitated at the start, raced well
back inside, angled five wide approaching the quarter pole and lacked the needed stretch rally. HERCULES HARBOR was fractious in the gate, bobbled at
the start, stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane then weakened. MAMAIGOTTHIS was outrun inside.
