WARRIOR'S REMARK unhurried early drew even three deep outside the quarter pole bearing down to edge clear in the four path late. HARTFORD
THOMAS set a pressured pace being hooked between horses near the quarter pole grudgingly ceding to outside pressure while holding well in the two path.
SWINGABIGSTICK stalked the pace bidding along the inside near the quarter pole extending into upper stretch weakening along the rail. REDS BEST
tracked the pace chasing on the far turn weakening in the seven path upper stretch. LAFLEUR was never involved. BRILLIANT BABY raced mid pack
fading on the far turn. THIRST FOR QUALITY pressed on the backside then flattened out on the far turn.

the winning move when getting up abreast rival at the wire. STORMIN ROSEMARY prompted the pace dueling abreast foe on the far turn losing the outside
position at the head of the stretch battling to the wire gamely. DAISY MAE raced evenly off the pace angling six wide in upper stretch gaining a bit with
