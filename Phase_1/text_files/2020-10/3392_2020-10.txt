Footnotes
DAH PHILLY stalked the pace inside, waited patiently behind a wall of horses around the far turn, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, closed
determinedly outside and was up in deep stretch. LUNA settled off the pace while racing four wide, circled four wide around the far turn, took the lead and
burst clear nearing the quarter pole, finished willingly but was unable to stave off the winner in the final yards. RUBY PUNCH set a pressured pace in the
two path, could not keep pace with the top two leaving the quarter pole but stayed on to save the show. FRENCH NOUGET had early speed between rivals
and faded. CHA CHA HEELS failed to menace while racing two wide early and four wide around the far turn. DON'T FIGHT pressed the pace four wide
around the first turn, bid three wide between rivals around the far turn and retreated rapidly nearing the lane. OLA GATITA had brief speed five wide.

STRIKING CHROME set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive in upper stretch. CHAMPAGNE TOAST stalked the pace from the rail, dropped
back a bit inside around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and stayed on to be clearly second best in the drive. LUCKY LORRAINE raced off the pace
four wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. PRIME COAT failed to menace while
racing two wide. DOWNTOWN KATIE settled off the early pace while racing two wide, made a three wide bid between foes midway around the far turn and
retreated through the lane. GINGERS WISH pressed the winner in the three path and tired. SPRITE'S LADY had some speed three and four wide and was
through after a half.

TRUNK OF MONEY set the pace in the two path, drew off nearing the lane and held clear under a drive. DECO STRONG settled off the pace while racing
two wide and finished willingly to significantly narrow the gap in the final furlong. CAUGHT UP IN YOU lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn
and was along for the show. CHICK'S SHADOW saved ground and failed to menace. SHE'S ACHANCE TOO prompted the winner from the three path and
tired after a half. SETHAMEE STREET stumbled at the start but was still away toward the front of the field, chased four wide and retreated in the lane.

HONOR RUN raced off the inside down the backstretch, angled three wide early on the turn, came four wide into the lane, closed outside, was up near the
sixteenth pole and drew clear late. WELD stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, rallied between foes but was outkicked. FEDERALE set the pace in
the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and lost second late. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) raced off the pace two wide and was one-paced in the lane.
DIAMOND NEWS lagged far back inside and finished with some interest. FRANK'S LEGACY never threatened while racing three wide. DRIVE IN was
reluctant to load then had only brief speed four wide.
