Footnotes
SHY MONEY was off alertly to gain the lead at once, cleared well before the first call, raced in the two path through the turn, came closer to the inside into
the lane, was shook up left-handed at the top of the lane and once more just outside the eighth pole and was ridden out to the end. BIG BLUE EMU chased
the winner while in the two or three path through the turn, was shook up entering the lane, could not gain on the top one and settled for being well clear for
the place spot. VALSHEBA was in the two or three path through the turn when chasing the top two and finished a distant third. BERTIE THE BEAUTY raced
in the for to the two path through the turn and never was a factor. JUJU BUG was well back and never made an impact while in the two path. SHOW EM
HOW chased the pace early while near the rail and steadily faded.

PRIVET MOON vied for the lead while in the three then the two path through the turn, continued on near even terms into the lane, began inching away near
the three-sixteenths pole, cleared with an eighth to go then was kept to the task. BLUEGRASS PHAROAH set the pace while near the inside into the turn,
was joined by another in mid-turn, dueled with that one into the lane and could not keep up while settling for the place spot. ORB OF THE BORO was near
the rail through the turn then stayed one-paced through the lane while a distant third. EL PIQUIN chased the pace from the two path into the turn then
weakened. ROCKET EQUATION was never a factor while in the three path through the turn.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE JUSTICE was unhurried along the inside through the turn, cut the corner when gaining momentum, continued with energy when straightening into
the lane, quickly cleared for the lead, extended to the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task to hold safe. BEAUTILICIOUS void of speed while near the
inside, came into the lane from the three path, angled closer to the rail when gaining momentum outside the eighth pole and closed with a rush. BREWSKY
raced on the outside of the winner through the turn when unrushed, angled to the three path into the lane, had aim on the winner while drifting to the six
path then could not sustain the bid late while well clear for the show spot. MYERS TIGER stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, swung into
the lane from six path and tired after striaghtening. FRENCH VANILLA chased the pace into the lane while in the five path then was empty. SANDY'S
NEWSGIRL set the pace while near the rail, continued on a clear lead into the lane then suddenly gave way.

Footnotes
ZANESVILLE was unhurried while off the inside, continued well off the rail and in the four path through the far turn, began gaining momentum through late
turn, came into the lane from the four path and as a serious threat, continued with good energy and edged up through the final eighth. WITCH DOCTOR
vied for the lead into the far turn, cleared in late turn then was joined by two others, was no match for the winner but kept on determinedly to save the place
spot. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC raced near the rail while unhurried early, bid along the inside through late turn, continued along the inside into the lane,
loomed a threat when straightening in the lane and could not sustain the effort while finishing best of the rest. DOLLAR BLUE was in the three or four path
through the far turn, came into the lane from mid-track and moved up. DOX FOLLY bobbled at the start, racedin the three path through the turns and lacked
a closing response. CACAHUETE was in the two or three path through the turns and tired in the stretch run. WILD ABOUT YOU was in the three or four
path through the turns and made no impact. SURGE PRICING chased the pace from the four path through the backstretch and was empty entering the
lane. BIZERK vied for the lead along the inside and was done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
NOVEL SQUALL vied for the lead from the three path into the turn, shook clear into the lane then extended when asked. NEW BOSS was in the five to the
four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path with aim on the winner, was no match for that one and kept on to save the place spot. MY
MORNING GAL was near the rail through the turn, came further off the rail for the drive and was closing in on the place spot late while not a threat to the top
one. LICHITA was close up down the backstretch, checked sharply entering the turn, dropped back to trail the field, gained momentum into the lane and
moved up while not a threat. TWICE SMITTEN pressed the pace along the inside into the turn then began losing momentum after the three-eighths pole.
SHOWSTOMPER pressed the pace from between rivals into the turn then steadily gave ground. VOODOO JUSTICE was in the four path while chasing the
pace, came into the lane from the four of five path and was empty.

Footnotes
PRETTY BOY DAVE bore out at the start, stalked inside, rallied at the eighth pole and was clear late under mild urging. G AS IN GEORGE dueled inside,
was clear late but couldn't hold off the winner. HOPPED UP bore out at the start, then rallied belatedly outside. EL BOHEMIO bumped with a foe at the start,
stalked four wide, then had no late bid. RUH ROH RAGGY was bumped at the start, then improved position late. TOTALLY dueled outside to the stretch
and gave way. STORMY CACTUSA was bumped at the start, then faded in the stretch. RUSTPROOF lost all chance when he was squeezed back and
checked hard at the start. The Stewards took no action following an inquiry and an objection by the rider of HOPPED UP against the winner.
