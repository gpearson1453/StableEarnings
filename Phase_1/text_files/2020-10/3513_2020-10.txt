Footnotes
HEART RHYTHM pressed the pace early on, was steadied nearing the lane, floated out into the four path entering the lane, continued the bid down the
lane, drove past the leader and drew away in the final stages. SMOOTH MUSIC set the pace early on, wandered into the lane and bothered HEART
RHYTHM in the process, continued on the down the lane with the lead while lugging in and was no match for the winner in the final stages. SOUTHERN
WILL stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. BUMP was bothered at the start and trailed the
field early on, was off the rail into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. SNOWBLIND was in the three path into the lane and had no late bid in the
stretch run. GIANT'S GATEWAY was bumped at the start and through after a half. COACH AWESOME was slow at the start and through early.

Footnotes
LONE ROCK dueled for the lead inside of MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI), put that foe away and drew clear turning for home, then held a clear advantage
through midstretch before drifting out in the final sixteenth, but did not make contact with his outer bidding rival, and safely held. TWO THIRTY FIVE stalked
along the inside before tipping outside of the clear leader turning for home, but drifted out a bit in upper stretch causing him to not keep pace, then
straightened course and kept on through the lane to produce a bid in the late stages, but shied mildly from the inner drifting leader, and just held place.
INTREPID HEART tracked the pace from the two to three paths around the turns, then shifted four wide turning for home, rallied outside of foes with a
grinding charge, but missed place on the wire. MI TRES POR CIENTO (CHI) dueled for the lead outside of LONE ROCK, but proved no match for that foe
with just over a quarter mile to go, and faltered thereafter. HARVEY WALLBANGER saved ground while trailing, advanced mildly inside of foes around the
far turn, but leveled off and failed to threaten. JUNGLE WARFARE raced far off of the pace in the three path around both turns before shifting five wide
turning for home, and failed to factor. STREET TO INDY stalked two wide, but weakened into the far turn, and faded around it.

Footnotes
PASS THE PLATE was off a step slowly, stalked along the inside, saved ground around both turns before tipping outside of the dueling trio turning for
home, then blew past them under confident handily passing the quarter pole, and won going away under his own power. MY HEART SINGS set the pace
along the inside, held an advantage inside of a pair of foes around the far turn, but was headed by those foes passing the three sixteenths pole, dug in and
fought on gamely while exchanging light bumps with his immediate outer counterpart, but was no match for the eventual winner passing the furlong pole
before reclaiming place. NAUGHTY JOKER stalked the leader two wide, vied between horses around the far turn before bidding for the lead at the quarter
pole, dueled between rivals in upper stretch, but proved no match for an outer oncharging foe passing the quarter pole while exchanging light bumps with
his inner counterpart, then got outfinished by that foe for place. CARPE VINUM tracked from midpack three wide and outside of foes, inched closer around
the far turn to produce a bid at the quarter pole, dueled outside of a pair of foes in upper stretch, but proved no match for an outer rallying foe at the furlong
pole, and leveled off. GET REWARDED tracked from off of the pace two wide and between horses, pulled to a stalking position in the early stages of the
backstretch, but got outmoved by an inner tipping foe turning for home, then failed to factor. WILDLIFE was off a step slowly, trailed the field while caught in
the four path around both turns, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
UNION MAIDEN stalked along the inside while in the two path into the turn, loomed in hand while tipping three wide turning for home, bumped AURELIA
GARLAND while splitting foes passing the quarter pole, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, then finished with good courge to seal the deal.
AURELIA GARLAND broke a bit outwards and bumped a foe into another at the start, tracked from midpack three wide around the turn, inched closer
turning for home, but was bumped four wide while getting outkicked by UNION MAIDEN passing the quarter pole, then stayed on well through the lane while
chasing that foe to prove second best. IMPECCABLE STYLE stalked two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole and vied turning for home, but
proved no match for an outer rival approaching the furlong pole, then drifted out a bit through the late, and just held show. BRASSY was bumped by an
inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide before shifting to the four path turning for home, and produced a mild grind, bumped STORIE BLUE
in the late stages, then just missed reaching IMPECABLE STYLE for show. STORIE BLUE was bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, raced
far off of the pace along the inside before tipping two wide turning for home, produced a mild rally while inside of BRASSY through the lane, but bumped
with that foe when put to tight quarters in the final sixteenth, shifted in, but did not make an impact. SAINTSATION bobbled at the start, trailed the field in the
four to five path around the turn, and passed tired foes without threatening. NEVER FORGET set the pace while racing headstrong in the bit, but was
headed by foes in upper stretch, and tired thereafter. O SERAPHINA lied close up to the pace setter along the inside and from the pocket around the turn,
but weakend approaching the quarter pole, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LONGPANTS REQUIRED tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced to stalking position into the far turn, tipped three wide turning for home, then bid
approaching the furlong pole and readily drew off. TAKE CHARGE PATTI dueled for the lead two wide around the first turn before clearing off at the six
furlong pole, then dueled inside of CHAMAGNE DIET around the far turn before repelling that foe in upper stretch, but was headed by the eventual winner at
the furlong pole, and was second best. CHAMPAGNE DIET shifted in after the start and caused PYTHONESS to shy, stalked from the two path before
vying around the far turn, but failed to keep pace between horses in upper stretch. FORTUNA was bumped at the start, tracked from off of the pace in the
three path, advanced to stalking position into the far turn, but failed to keep pace while getting floated four wide turning for home. PYTHONESS broke in and
bumped a foe at the start before shying from an outer foe right after, then trailed early on, and never got involved. SAFARI QUEEN was outrun, then eased
around the far turn. CAPTAIN GINNY B was washed out pre-race, dueled for the lead along the inside around the first turn, but weakened passing the six
furlong pole, and was eased around the far turn.
