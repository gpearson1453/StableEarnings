Footnotes
REGAL LADY pressed the leader two wide to the stretch, pushed up to engage for the lead in mid stretch then edged away under steady urging. THE PET
broke out sharply, crowded CA DREAMER then was corrected and set the pace from the rail to the stretch, was collared by the winner in mid stretch then
not threatened for the place. WICKED SUNSET had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. SITTIN AND THINKIN
was chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but also did not rally. CA DREAMER was crowded by THE PET at the start, took up then was pulling
the rider early and had to check in traffic, raced between rivals and two wide on the turn but came up empty in the drive. GAMBLER'S APPEAL had no
speed and was never a threat. The stewards posted the inquiry sign and the jockey on CA DREAMER lodged an objection against THE PET for alleged
interferenced at the start and THE PET was disqualified and placed fifth in a unanimous decision.

Footnotes
LULUMARU was rated for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn then eased off the rail and bid three wide into the stretch, rallied to catch the leaders
leaving mid stretch and edged clear driving. INDIAN DANCER chased the pace early then pushed up to press the leader two wide to the stretch, responded
to get on terms in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. CHARLOTTE LOUISE sped clear on the first turn then was settled on the front end to the
half, saved ground to the stretch, was collared in mid stretch then outfinished. DREAMING ABOUT YOU had no speed, settled to the second turn, came two
wide to the stretch but was never a serious threat. AROUSE N GO also chased the frontrunner to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch but
weakened in the final furlong. IRISH AFFAIR had no speed and was not a factor.

CARTELLATE prompted the leader two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms leaving the furlong marker then dug in, could not shake loose but inched
away in the final sixteenth. MISTER MCLEAN set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then battled the winner gamely but was
nipped. STRIKE IT LUCKY broke a bit slow and had no speed, was off the rail on the turn then swung out for room and was four wide into the stretch and
finished steadily to the line. ECOLOGIST chased the pace to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the
wire. JEDI KNIGHT checked off heels nearing the half mile pole, saved ground on the turn but weakened in the final furlong. DESERT DUDE was
outsprinted then forced out five wide on the turn and did not threaten.

DESCARTES was patiently handled on the front end, saved ground on the second turn then kicked away to mid stretch and held under steady urging.
PROSPICIENCE walked from the gate and lost about four lengths to begin, trailed to the second turn, was off the rail to the stretch then finished in a rally.
OUTRIGHT had no speed, settled to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch and also finished willingly. SURE ANGEL pressed the winner to the
second turn, raced two wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. MOONOVERTHEBAYOU got outsprinted early, settled on the
backstretch then got fanned four wide while trying to rally on the second turn and came up empty in the stretch. OUR BOLD PRINCE stalked the winner
from the rail for six furlongs then tired. FRIENDLY OUTTHEDOR was settled to the half, saved ground to the stretch and also tired.

MISS GLORIOUS had the best speed, set the pace from the rail, turned back WINNING APPEAL into the stretch, responded to steady urging and was
edging clear late. BACK SLIDER chased the pace to the turn, had to circle four wide to the stretch then was no threat to the winner but gamely bested
SHANGHAI SUNRISE for the place. SHANGHAI SUNRISE also was chasing the winner, shifted off the rail mid turn, made a run to mid stretch then
slackened late. TURA LURA stalked the pace early, was outkicked while three wide on the turn then shifted out for room but lacked a closing response.
MARVELOUS MARVELLA had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then angled out but had no late rally. GOPREACHIT was void of speed and never a
threat. WINNING APPEAL pressed the winner early, tried to engage two wide on turn but was outrun to mid stretch and tired.

pace outside MY FRIEND TONY and two wide to the stretch, responded to pressure to mid stretch but was giving way late. MON CAMO chased the
pacesetters to the turn, raced three wide and made a run to mid stretch to loom a threat but came up empty late. MY FRIEND TONY hustled to contest the

LA GATA ELEGANTE was well placed to the second turn, rallied two wide and got on terms in upper stretch, inched clear to mid stretch then held under
steady urging. TOO HOT FOR CURLIN was settled to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly but too late. DIAMETRIC set the
pace for six furlongs from the rail, could not stall the winner in mid stretch then weakened. OVERWHELMING LOVE had no speed, settled to the half, was
two wide on the far turn but could not make an impact in the drive. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) was away slowly and was rank to the first turn, trailed to the second
turn then saved ground to no avail. LEMON DROP TINI was chasing the leader to the second turn, raced four wide to the stretch then weakened. ZAGRAH
(GB) was tracking the pace for a half mile, made a run three wide to loom a threat on the second turn but could not sustain that bid and flattened. TAKE
CHARGE SISTER tracked the pace also early, got outkicked on the backstretch and stopped after five furlongs.

drive. CONNIE'S PROMISE chased the pace to the turn then was outkicked while three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
LOTSA PEPPER was hustled to the front, eased over and set the pace from the rail to the stretch, kicked away in upper stretch then was tiring but had
enough of a cushion to hold. LA AGUILILLA was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then finished steadily and got the nod for second.
HABOBANERO chased the winner to the turn, was outside a rival to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept on determinedly and just missed
second. DIM LIGHTS was used early to prompt the winner two wide to the stretch, was outrun by that one to mid stretch and finished evenly.
SONGOFTHEDESERT was sent for speed but outsprinted, stalked to the turn then saved ground to no avail. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN lagged well back
from the rail to the stretch and was never a threat. ZELAIA had no speed, got fanned four wide on the turn and was not a factor. DARLING DEMON was
also chasing the winner three wide to the stretch then gave way.
