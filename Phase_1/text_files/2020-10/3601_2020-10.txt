SWING WEST was never far back, rallied four wide on the far and drew close, prevailed after a long stretch battle under left handed urging. MAXIMIZER
dueled on the lead throughout, held grudgingly in a long stretch battle in a game effort. GILES was never far back on the inside, steadied at the three eight
pole, came again late and was gaining. CHEAP SHOT tracked three wide and finished willingly in a good effort. NANTAN set a pressured pace and faltered
in the stretch. FAST FAIRY was unhurried early and was no threat. SANDLOT SAM well placed for three quarters, tired in the lane.
