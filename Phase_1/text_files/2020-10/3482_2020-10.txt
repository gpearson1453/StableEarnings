Footnotes
POWER (BRZ) absorbed a solid bump from NATHAN'S SECRET and steadied at the start, trailed a long way last early, began moving inside after a
half-mile, shifted out three wide into the stretch, split horses rallying past the eighth-pole and collared STOPIT from outside to win going away. JACK EL
BARBARO pressed STOPIT from outside, challenged midway on the turn, could not kick on with the winner into the last furlong but ran on willingly to get
the place. STOPIT set the pace in the two-path, moved inside for the drive, and weakened through the closing stages. BLOKE saved ground to the stretch,
moved off the inside late and was one-paced to the finish. BIG TREASURE was no factor two wide. NATHAN'S SECRET broke in giving POWER a hard
bump, showed early speed outside, gave way abruptly on the turn, jogged in far behind, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
DESCENTE pressed BABIE MONSTER from the start, took over from outside entering the far turn, moved inside at the top of the stretch, and widened
under a drive. ASSUME CONTROL advanced three wide on the far turn, could not seriously menace the top one, and ran on clear of the others. PAYNTER
FEST moved off the inside around the far turn, and lacked a solid rally. NOWITNA RIVER stayed in or near the two-path much of the way, and posed no
threat. GRACE'S DRAMA raced three wide, and faded in the stretch. BABIE MONSTER set the early pace inside, yielded to DESCENTE past the
seven-sixteenths pole, and dropped well back soon after completing six furlongs. SPICY NELLY was always outrun.

Footnotes
MISS AURAMET pressed HEAR MY PRAYER from outside, wrested command entering the final furlong, edged away on her left lead, and was driving to
stay clear. LAGERTHA (CHI) was outrun to the stretch in the two-path, and closed strongly outside the winner. HEAR MY PRAYER set the pace inside,
could not stave off MISS AURAMET past the eighth-pole, and was overhauled late for second. COMPENSATE saved ground off the leaders for
three-eighths of a mile, and lacked a closing bid. NIKEE KAN brushed the right side of the gate coming out, raced two wide to the lane, and tired.
ITSMYLUCKYCHARM dropped back inside around the turn.

Footnotes
GALIT JAK set the pace inside, widened the advantage under pressure through upper stretch, and was hand urged the last 70 yards much the best.
TENERIFE MOON lagged far back for a half-mile, cut the corner into the lane, and rallied along the rail to go clear of the rest. TOO STYLISH was in tight
behind GALIT JAK approaching the turn, moved out three wide near the quarter-pole, and weakened through the late stages. FLORADO bobbled at the
start, chased outside GALIT JAK for a half-mile, and tired in the stretch. FIERY PRINCESS broke out bumping LADY CLOVERLY, and faded inside after a
half. LADY CLOVERLY got bumped by FIERY PRINCESS and steadied at the start, came three wide off the turn and passed tired horses. MUDSLIDE
WICKED was finished early. TRINNI SUNSHINE was outrun three then four wide on the turn. A P GEM bobbled at the start, and was through early. G T'S
BLUE SQUALL was never close.

Footnotes
MYFIRSTEXWIFE was outsprinted early, rallied in the three-path through the stretch, and was up outside near the wire in a blanket finish. COOKIE COVE
tossed her head at the start, rushed up between horses, dueled outside CLASSY BEAST, poked a head in front late, and was nipped at the wire. CLASSY
BEAST dueled inside COOKIE COVE most of the way, yielded on the rail in the last 70 yards and saved a share of third. KATNISS KAN steadied behind the
leaders near the half-mile pole, saved ground into the stretch, came out looking for a way through a sixteenth out, lacked a clear path and steadied between
MYFIRSTEXWIFE and COOKIE COVE coming to the line. MORE DIAMONDS dropped back around the turn three wide, moved in for the drive and made
no headway. DANCINGWITHJIMMIEB tired around the turn four wide. DE PURA SANGRE was outrun three wide. FLYING SOFIA pressed the pace three
wide, and faltered after three-eighths of a mile. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF KATNISS KAN AGAINST COOKIE COVE FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
RUNNING FOR RIZ broke sharply, set the pace slightly off the inside to the stretch, and held firm to preserve the decision. LUSITANO stumbled at the start
and saved ground outrun for a half-mile, moved off the rail with a sixteenth to go, and was slowly gaining outside the winner to the wire. LIFE IN SHAMBLES
broke a step slow, moved in from the three-path turning for home, and rallied mildly on the rail. GEMO tracked inside early, moved two or three paths out
into the lane, and lacked a rally on his left lead. FRONT LOADED shifted out four wide late on the turn, and faded after a half. ROYAL SQUEEZE pursued
RUNNING FOR RIZ from outside early, and was through approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
I GET IT was allowed to settle early inside, moved out four wide rallying around the far turn, reached the front in upper stretch on the far outside, and drove
clear. CASTLE KING shifted out three wide taking closer order approaching the stretch, and rallied with good energy to best the others. FULMINI was never
far back, lodged a bid three wide between horses after six furlongs, and flattened out late. MISTER LEONARDO hit the left side of the gate and came out
slowly, closed the gap saving ground around the far turn, and improved for the last major share. BACH was a step slow to begin, raced two or three wide on
the turns, and failed to menace. TOP BOSS brushed with KING BUDDHA at the start, prompted the pace two wide, reached a short lead between horses a
quarter-mile out, but could not sustain the bid and dropped back. KING BUDDHA brushed with TOP BOSS at the start, sped clear inside, faced a trio of
challengers past the midway point on the far turn, and gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
SHES ALL WOMAN pressed the pace outside ASSAIL, challenged between horses reaching a short lead coming to the quarter-pole, outdueled
BARGAINAIRE through upper stretch and drove clear. BARGAINAIRE ranged up three wide issuing a bid on the turn, could not match strides outside SHES
ALL WOMAN through the furlong grounds, and dug in to hold second. CHUTZPAH stayed in range early inside, came four wide off the turn, did not have
enough to seriously threaten, and just saved the show. FOREVER MARTA dropped back inside around the turn, moved to the far outside in upper stretch,
kicked in belatedly and just missed the show. VICTORY CRUSADE steadied shortly after the start, was outrun to the stretch three wide, moved to the rail
past the eighth-pole and was outfinished. ASSAIL set a pressured early pace, had the rider drop the whip five-sixteenths out, and yielded to multiple
challengers on the rail. SAMMY'S TOWN faded steadily two then three wide approaching the lane.

SHENDAM (FR) stayed in striking distance three wide to the far turn, challenged for command outside SMELL OF ROSES into the stretch, reached the front
with a furlong remaining and kicked away. DEVOTED KITTEN bumped with SMELL OF ROSES at the start, raced near the three-path for six furlongs,
fanned wide into the lane and rallied with good energy outside. SMELL OF ROSES bumped with DEVOTED KITTEN at the start, moved inside coming
away with a clear lead entering the first turn, showed the way to upper stretch, yielded to the winner near the eighth-pole, and was overhauled for second.
TIME FOR TROUBLE checked sharply inside MASON'S SONG heading into the first turn, lagged far back for six furlongs, moved inside and finished with
good courage getting up for the last major share. QUASAR MOON raced three wide around the turns, and lacked the needed late response. MASON'S
SONG moved in tightening things up on TIME FOR TROUBLE into the first turn, went out four wide for the run around the far turn, and had no rally.
UNLIMITED DATA was outrun through a four-wide trip. INDY'S JEWEL was forwardly placed three then two wide to the stretch, and gave way through the
last eighth of a mile. PERFECT BEAM was finished after a half-mile. CHAOS KID raced inside, and faltered after six furlongs. ATAKAN chased the
pacesetter inside early, and had nothing left into the stretch. BUDGET BUSTER trailed from the start, and had no response to urging up the backstretch.
