Footnotes
TWILIGHT GALAXY moved through along the rail to join the leaders around the turn, kicked clear after straightening away for the drive, and kept MIRANDA
SOFIA at bay late. MIRANDA SOFIA bumped with LA GATA NEGRA at the start, advanced in the two-path coming off the turn, and was gaining outside the
winner. LA GATA NEGRA got bumped from both sides at the start, lagged well back for a half-mile, moved out several paths in the stretch and was along
for the show. DREAMINOFDASIES raced three wide around the turn, and improved position without threatening. REVVEDUPLIKEADEUCE vied for
command three wide for a half, and weakened approaching the stretch. BEND THE KNEE was forwardly placed three wide early, and faded after a half.
CLARIST vied inside rivals in the two-path early, and was overhauled from both flanks midway on the turn. MATADOR MOON faded four wide after a half.
VENEZUELANCHAMPION stayed in range early four wide, and tired. SASSY GIDGET was always outrun. HIGHRHYTHMDIXIE bumped with LA GATA
NEGRA at the start, and was outrun inside. SLEW CAT SLEW lost contact with the field after a half, jogged in far behind, and walked off.

Footnotes
TIO WIL lacked early speed despite being under the whip early, saved ground well back, began to advance midway around the turn, cut the corner into the
lane, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole and widened at the rail under a drive. PLENUM raced off the early pace outside, moved into a clear
third perched behind the duel around the turn, angled widest in the lane and rallied outside for the place. CAPTAIN DUKE dueled between rivals down the
backstretch, dueled outside a foe in the three path around the turn, could not match strides with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on to best his pace
rival for the show. BABY BROTHER was hustled from the gate, set a pressured pace in the two path and weakened in the lane. LOGSDON failed to
menace while racing three wide. SEATTLE COUNCIL had early speed three wide, dropped back nearing the turn, angled in to race in the two path around
the bend and continued to fade. The five-eighths fraction was hand-timed.

Footnotes
HAPPY DANZA broke alertly, set the pace in the two-path, and was driving to stay in command. WINTER AT BASTOGNE was never far back, shifted out
four wide with aim at the leader turning for home, stayed on his left lead and came up second best. PROSPECT PROJECT was outsprinted two wide for a
half-mile, and offered a mild response to be along for the show. DRAMATIC KITTEN pressed the early pace between horses, moved to the rail around the
turn, and weakened through the stretch. ALL STARR RUNNER bumped with CHANELIN at the start, raced near the inside and posed no threat. CHANELIN
got bumped from both sides at the start, and was never close. FUTURE PRINCE raced three wide, and tired before reaching the stretch. CUSTOM KAT
bumped with CHANELIN at the start, and was outrun inside. GRAND UNION banged into the right side of the gate at the start, pressed the pace three wide,
and faltered near the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
RAGS FOR BRITCHES tucked in behind the pacesetters at the rail around the first turn, angled three wide to track the duel in the clear around the far turn,
shifted further out in upper stretch, closed down the center of the track, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew off under a drive.
NINETYDAYSOFWINTER was crowded at the start, advanced between rivals entering the first turn, stalked the pace two wide, bid outside of SLIPPY
nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled outside of that foe from there, continued on the left lead in the lane, exchanged several bumps with SLIPPY through
the lane, had no response for winner in the final sixteenth pole but won the duel to hold second. SLIPPY set the pace along the rail, fought on inside of
NINETYDAYSOFWINTER, exchanged several bumps with that foe in the lane and was narrowly outfinished for the place. DR. SAMADI brushed with
COMING UP ROSES at the start, raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. GIMMEABREAK saved ground off the pace, angled out in
midstretch and was one-paced from there. COMING UP ROSES was brushed at the start, saved ground and never threatened. PRIME HOOK played no
factor while racing three and four wide. ALL STAR SEILER was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
IKEISGREAT got off to a flat-footed start, recovered to a contending position saving ground behind the three-way battle up front, shifted out four wide
advancing readily a quarter-mile out, took over and drew clear through upper stretch, and widened under a mild drive. MAN OF VISION pressed the pace
between horses, could not stay with the winner turning for home, and ran on to hold the place. EL PILLO pressed the pace outside rivals, gave way into the
stretch, and had enough to save the show. GEONOSIS bumped with MR. AXEL at the start, advanced mildly three to four wide after a half-mile, but lacked
a solid closing response. BATTALION saved ground outrun to the turn, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, and made no headway. HERO UP set
a pressured early pace hounded by two pursuers, and gave way before reaching the stretch. MR. AXEL bumped with GEONOSIS at the start, raced three
wide and tired after a half. R PRIVATE JET was finished early inside.

JANUARY WON was unhurried while racing two wide early, made progress two wide around the far turn, cut the corner into the lane, burst clear at the rail
leaving the three-sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. REVOLVING STAR was hustled to the front, set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for
home, had no response for the winner in upper stretch, continued to drift out through the lane and lasted for the place. JUPI'S LIGHTNING stalked the pace
two wide, bid nearing the far turn, was turned back by the pacesetter, chased two wide around the bend and lacked a stretch rally. ELITE MISSION tracked
the pace three wide, bid nearing the far turn, continued three wide around the bend and faded. DEERSLAYER failed to menace while racing three and four
wide. SILENT MISCHIEF played no factor while racing two and three wide. PRIZED WARRIOR chased the pace two and three wide and was through after
a half. POINT WINNER was outrun inside. TRIBUTE FLAG went very wide into the clubhouse turn, lost contact down the backstretch, was pulled up around
the far turn and walked.

Footnotes
BRIELLA pressed the pace outside DONT FLOAT THE ICE, took over five-sixteenths out, shifted to the rail drawing clear in upper stretch, and was all out to
hold off HARA to the finish. HARA received a solid bump from TURN IT ON at the start, steadied inside behind DONT FLOAT THE ICE near the half-mile
marker, came three wide rallying off the turn, and was getting to BRIELLA from outside in the closing stages. SISTER AURORA broke in knocking TURN IT
ON into HARA at the start, then bumped solidly with TURN IT ON again a stride later, saved ground outrun to the stretch, and was up for the show on the
rail. TURN IT ON got bumped into HARA by SISTER AURORA at the break, then bumped hard again with the latter, came four wide into the stretch and
was outkicked for third. DONT FLOAT THE ICE set the early pace a bit off the inside, moved to the rail unable to withstand BRIELLA through the latter part
of the turn, and had nothing left for the drive. MAMAS GONE CRAZY raced three wide and was through before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
FLASHY KYEM stalked the pace three wide, seized command approaching the sixteenth pole and quickly drove clear. BLACK PEPPER settled off the pace
while saving ground, angled out leaving the eighth pole and rallied for the place. SILVER DEFENSE set the pace two wide early, cleared and angled in
nearing the far turn, held clear past the eighth pole then weakened late. STONE HANDS was shuffled back early, advanced four wide around the turn but
failed to sustain the bid. CHARGE CARD broke slowly, raced two wide and never threatened. PAPACHO had some early speed between rivals, dropped
back around the turn, came six wide into the lane and continued to fade. DIAMOND MINT had early speed inside SILVER DEFENSE, could not keep pace
nearing the turn, angled two wide nearing the bend, dropped back through the turn, came five wide into the lane and continued to retreat.

Footnotes
D. SILO began to advance after a half-mile four then three wide, challenged for command outside OPTIMISTIC turning for home, reached the front coming
to the eighth-pole and edged away. FARM STRONG brushed with OPTIMISTIC at the start and was outrun early, took closer order four wide into the
stretch, and was along on the far outside for the place. ESTILO PELIGROSO broke slowly and trailed for six furlongs, cut the corner beginning to get going
past the three-sixteenths, moved through into second with 70 yards remaining, then came out under left-hand pressure approaching the finish. KING
ANDRES steadied along the rail first time under the wire, moved out three wide into the first turn, stayed in that path gradually getting closer to the
pacesetter after six furlongs, but had nothing more into the stretch. OPTIMISTIC brushed with FARM STRONG at the start, sped off early in the two-path,
could not hold off D. SILO after straightening away for the drive, gave way a sixteenth out, then took up behind ESTILO PELIGROSO with 50 yards to go.
GUN OF GLORY saved ground in range early, and tired after six furlongs. CASTILLETE raced in the two-path to the far turn, and could not keep pace three
wide approaching the stretch. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF OPTIMISTIC AGAINST ESTILO PELIGROSO, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD POSITION AND PLACED FIFTH FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH.
