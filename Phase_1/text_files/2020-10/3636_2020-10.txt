Footnotes
BUSTIN BUNNY settled close inside then bid approaching the three eighths pole, checked off the heels of Smookie nearing the quarter pole, regained stride
at the rail passing the pole, eased to the three path leaving the far turn and dug in to take over the final yards. OLD LINE MAGIC raced in the four path the
opening turn and started a four wide bid toward the three eighths pole, raced at even terms two deep on the far turn and dug in gamely for second while
nipped for the win late. ANSHI stalked the pace two deep then took the lead approaching the three eighths pole, was met into the far turn and contested the
rail through the turn, dug in gamely to the finish and missed the nod for second while outfinished for the win. SMOOKIE angled in to set the pace, was
caught nearing the three eighths pole, dropped back at the five sixteenths then drifted outward while weakening on the far turn. UNEXPECTEDLY raced in
the five path the first turn and left the turn outside, then showed only mild response. LADY SPARROW steadied into the first turn then picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, but was of little consequence.

Footnotes
BASKET GIRL gave chase and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, took the lead nearing the head of the lane and dug in under determined
handling to inch clear under the wire. QUITE SUGGESTIVE was hustled clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, contested the edge nearest the rail
most of the turn but was caught approaching the head of the lane, continued a close factor in the upper stretch then ceded the final sixteenth. HOPE FOR
THEMONEY came away slowly then picked up the chase inside, steadied at the rail approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail then eased
out past the eighth pole and was along for third later yards. COPELANQUIKZIP gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. MEET
MS BOBBI RAE broke awkwardly then picked up the chase, rounded the turn about the four path but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. MOJO
MATTERS chased the pace through the backstretch, rounded the turn three wide then flattened stride. SHARP'S MISSION proved no factor and rounded
the turn in the five and six paths. WORKPANSOMETHINGS saved ground. RELAUNCHING lacked speed.

Footnotes
DOCTOR MCCOY stalked the pace two deep then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took over past the five sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn
and was steadily handled to hold on well. SPUNMAN rated close inside the opening turn then started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole,
raced in range of the lead in the four path of the far turn, but couldn't improve further and had to settle for second best. SHOWTIME CAT rated a short lead
inside, was caught leaving the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. NAUTICAL
WARRIOR stalked the pace from the three and four paths the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little further, while WARRIOR'S ESTATE and THORN OF ROSE HILL mostly saved
ground.

FIREBIRD chased the early pace outside, raced in the four path of the turn then dug in to get up in late yards. PRIMAL DESTINY pressured the pace
through the backstretch and took the lead approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge two deep on the turn and put READY TO RUN away through
the stretch, but was outfinished later yards, while the latter was reluctant to load and exchanged contact with Binn Good leaving the gate, hustled to the lead
two deep while between horses approaching the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took a slim lead in the
upper stretch but relented the final sixteenth. UNBRIDLED BOND pressured the pace inside most of the backstretch, but steadied at the rail past the five
sixteenths pole and weakened leaving the turn. A IS FOR ARTIST gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the six path of the turn and showed little
further. BINN GOODE exchanged contact with Ready To Run leaving the gate then picked up the chase, was eased to the five path on the turn and showed
little in the lane. GUNTER gave early chase outside then rounded the turn about the three path. BILLYJEANSMYBOY saved ground.

UNBRIDLED gave chase inside and settled for second best. REMYS SHOWTIME chased the pace and rounded the turn about the three path and showed
little more. YESIKNOWWHOIAM chased the pace, raced at the rail on the turn and finished evenly. AUBURN MILL chased the pace then steadied at the
inside flank of Windsor's Fun past the five sixteenths pole, left the turn in the five path and showed little more. SEATTLE SAILAWAY raced well back toward
the outside early and was forced to the eight path nearing the head of the lane. MINDYOURPSANDQS was never a factor and angled to the seven path
approaching the head of the lane. WINDSOR'S FUN saved ground approaching the turn.

SHAMELESS RISK gave chase toward the outside and rounded the turn about the four path then dug in under determined handling to get up the final
yards. RUSTY THE UPS MAN came away sharply and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dueled to the front two deep approaching the head of
the lane, then dug in gamely while grudgingly ceding the final yards. DERBY DAY DREAMS raced boxed in early then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole,
eased to the four path leaving the turn and finished well while gaining on the top two. BE BE BOP broke a step slow and was a bit slow getting into stride
then picked up the chase, angled to the six path toward the head of the lane and closed the gap. RIDING CLOUD NINE chased the pace, raced in the four
path of the turn and showed little more. ROCKET SOUND chased the pace, angled to the eight path approaching the top of the stretch then weakened.
DON'TMESSWITHBULL accelerated to the lead past the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge at the rail to mid turn, was caught nearing the top of
the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
STOWE ANGEL angled to the inside to rate a short lead, came under pressure into the far turn and contested the edge nearest the rail through the turn, dug
in to put Brigintine Island away from the top of the lane then just held off the late arrival of BOUNDTOBEBAD, who settled close inside, bid approaching the
three eighths pole and rounded the turn about the three path, dug in from the head of the lane and just got up for second while also just missing the win.
BRIGINTINE ISLAND stalked the pace two deep then challenged approaching the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn and dug in gamely to the finish, while nipped from second under the wire. LIAM'S LOOKOUT steadied shortly after leaving the gate and rounded the
opening turn about the four path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. OCEAN LILLY saved
ground off the pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved her position in the three path of the far turn, eased out at the head of the lane but
flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. LADY MADISON settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then eased slightly out into the backstretch,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced six wide on the far turn and showed little more. HAPPYCREST stalked three wide the first turn then picked
up the chase from the three eighths pole, was carried to the five path approaching the head of the lane and showed little more. IT'SMYINTENSION rounded
the opening turn in the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and faded.

Footnotes
SOUL MACHEN gave chase and raced in the four and five paths on the turn, dug in for the lead in the upper stretch, raced clear from the sixteenth pole and
held on well. BOUNDTOBEGOOD chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the six path into the stretch, closed
to take second later yards and was gaining. ASONGFORYOU chased the pace toward the inside, rounded the turn off the rail and was along for third later
yards. SHUDDAWUDDACUDDA took the lead past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was caught in the upper stretch
and flattened stride the final sixteenth. COMPOUND INTEREST broke outward then picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the
rail, eased outward into the lane and passed rivals. WIDGET FACTORY pressured the pace and remained a close factor in the three path of the turn, but
flattened out inside the eighth pole. AWESOME BUZZ broke a step slow then picked up the chase toward the outside, rounded the turn about the six path,
raced outside into the stretch and showed little more. BULLGRATS was only briefly close then faded approaching the three eighths pole. PANAMA PRINCE
gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the six path. TRAVELIN GAMBLER broke a step slow and was kept in check near the rail throughout.
