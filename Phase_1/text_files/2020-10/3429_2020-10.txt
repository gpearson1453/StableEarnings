Footnotes
CASPER SLEW prompted the pace five wide down the backstretch, moved to the lead four wide leaving the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew clear, drifted
out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under hand urging in midstretch and widened. FORT ROYAL had early speed three wide
between rivals, dropped back in the two path around most of the turn, angled widest near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. IWISHIWASPECIAL
lacked early speed while racing two wide, split rivals in upper stretch and rallied mildly. WON THE CASE disputed the early pace inside, chased from the rail
around the turn and lacked a closing bid. TISDALE set the pace two wide between rivals and weakened in the lane. OFF DUTY pressed the pace three and
four wide between rivals and faded nearing the lane. HOWBOUTDEMPATS was outrun inside. JAVELIN dwelt and was never close.

Footnotes
FINE N DANDY set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. FUEGO stalked the winner three wide, was no match for that foe in the lane and
just lasted for the place. GOOFY BOY stumbled at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide, rallied outside and just missed second.
MAKEANENTRANCE saved ground well back and improved position. THIN SPACES was reluctant to load, prompted the pace four wide and faded around
the far turn. MONYINTHEBANKSEY was fractious behind the starting gate, was in tight at the start, pulled his way forward inside around the first turn,
chased inside for a half and tired around the far turn. WON THE BYNG played no factor while racing three wide. PROPER HUMOR was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SEBRAY was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide early, advanced three wide around the far turn, closed outside and was up in the final strides.
ALGORIX set the pace two wide, repulsed a bid from the inside in upper stretch and led until the final strides. MONKEY'S MEDAL tracked the pace inside,
dropped back under strong urging around the far turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole, re-rallied outside and was up for the show on the wire. IT'S
FATE stumbled at the start and bumped the winner, stalked the pace three wide around the first turn, two wide around the far turn, angled in in upper
stretch, bid inside approaching the eighth pole, angled out leaving that marker and lacked a further bid. STOLEN LOVE prompted the pace from the rail
around the first turn, three wide around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. SIR DOUGLAS was outrun inside. NORTH DUBAI played no factor
while racing two and three wide. SHOTMASTER had brief speed two wide.

nearing the eighth pole, vied outside to deep stretch and edged ahead late. WOODLAND WALK set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of the winner in
midstretch and gave way grudgingly. ASPECT settled off the pace while racing three wide and rallied outside to gain the show. SOUND OFF raced well
back inside and rallied mildly. DAY BY DAY stalked the pace four wide and was outkicked in the lane. AWESOME D J failed to menace while racing four
wide. HONOR THE FLEET chased the pace three wide and was through after a half. W W SPRINGTIME played no factor while racing five wide.
