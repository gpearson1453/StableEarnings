Footnotes
ANTHONY'S GIRL prompted the pace two wide into the clubhouse turn, dropped back a bit before a half, came on again three then two wide to engage the
leader on the far turn, battled the balance of the trip and proved best in a stretch long drive. SAFFRON GIRL dueled for the lead along the inside the entire
trip and couldn't handle the winner. AND I KNOW trailed, checked repeatedly behind rivals while lacking room and passed tiring rivals through the stretch.
BLU HAWAII stalked the pace three wide into the far turn then lacked the needed response. EOWYN'S PARADISE close up near the inside into the far turn
gave way. LETSBEGREATAGAIN broke slowly, rushed up five wide through the clubhouse turn to make the lead between calls, dueled with the runner up
two wide into the far turn then was used up.

JUNIOR GILLIAM never far back, advanced steadily in the four path through the turn, surged through the final furlong under a strong hand ride and got up in
the final strides. BIG TRIP broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and just missed hanging on. UNTILWEMEETAGAIN went evenly.
SMOKIN HOT ENERGY chased the pace into the stretch then faded late inside. SUNSET SEVEN with the second flight three wide, failed to respond.
MYSTIC TIGER was no factor. LABYRINTH was through early. LOVEATTURKEYCLUB trailed.

CHROMIUM bore in at the start, was outrun into the stretch, closed with a rush under right handed urging in the six path and got up in the final strides, right
urging. PACIFIC IMAGE stalked the dueling leaders into the stretch, rallied late in the five path and just missed. ZOMBIE stalked the pace and went evenly
in the five path. THIRTYSILVERPIECES failed to menace. WIZARD WILLIE pressed a rapid pace from the inside, led late then came up empty in deep
stretch. PEP THE CHAMP was in tight at the start then no threat. CONDUCIVE also in tight at the start, trailed. SOUTHERN SPIRIT broke in full stride to
set a rapid pace under pressure to the top of the stretch, had speed until the final furlong then tired.
