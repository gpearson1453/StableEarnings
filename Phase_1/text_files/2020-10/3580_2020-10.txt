Footnotes
STAR WEAVER set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under moderate stretch urging.
LAST CITY was bumped at the start and shuffled back soon after, saved ground off the pace, rallied inside a rival in the two path in the lane and won the
bob for the place. DILIGENT chased the winner in the three path, lacked a rally and lost second on the wire. KEEP A EYE ON MIKE bumped LAST CITY at
the start, had early speed four wide and faded. REINOANIMAUX was outrun while racing two and three wide. SUBJECT TO CALL played no factor while
racing four wide.

Footnotes
GLITTER BAY sped right to the front, built a lengthy advantage around the turn in the two-path, and was kept to a drive to the finish. BRITISH EDGE was
forced out at the start by V K PRINCESS, moved in around the turn, and rallied to best the others. CAIRO'S HEIRESS raced four wide, and was never a
factor. PANDORICA felt the whip early inside, and was finished after three furlongs. LADY JAE was a step slow at the start, and outrun three wide. SOCIAL
DISCUSSION hit the right side of the gate at the start and was away slowest, and was outrun inside. V K PRINCESS hit the right side of the gate and broke
out, and faltered three wide into the lane.

BOLD PAYNTER dueled inside of SMASH around the first turn, allowed that rival to clear off early on the backstretch, angled out to re-bid two wide,
regained command near the half-mile pole, angled back in entering the turn, dueled inside of MYSTICAL MOON around the far turn and drew off under a
drive in upper stretch. SURF SHACK settled off the early pace inside, advanced outside down the backstretch, loomed three wide nearing the quarter pole
but was no match for the winner in the lane. MYSTICAL MOON settled off the early duel inside rounding the first turn, advanced outside of the winner down
the backstretch, dueled two wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened through the stretch. UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL
was bumped just after the start, raced two and three wide and failed to menace. SMASH dueled outside of the winner around the first turn, drew clear early
on the backstretch but steadily faded after a half. REMEMBER THE MAINE stumbled at the start, was bumped soon after, raced two wide and never
threatened. MR. PAPILLON was outrun inside.

Footnotes
LA TRES JOLIE bumped lightly with VUYELWA at the start, lagged far back for six furlongs, angled out to the four-path coming off the far turn, rallied
steadily and was along late between horses. MIDNIGHT GEM saved ground outrun early, shifted to the far outside turning for home, and finished well to get
up for the place. VUYELWA bumped lightly with LA TRES JOLIE at the start, raced in the second flight two wide to the stretch, shifted out a couple paths
looming a threat between horses into the final furlong, but was outfinished. BROADWAY CAT stayed in range near the inside for six furlongs, reached a
brief lead outside UNION LANE coming to the sixteenth-pole, but yielded inside the top trio to the wire. JUST A BIT SASSY raced four wide early, and
posed no threat. UNION LANE set a brisk pace near the inside, and had nothing left leaving the furlong grounds. JANET B DOESIT ALL pursued the
pacesetter three wide to the end of the far turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
GLADYS tracked the pace two wide for five furlongs, angled four wide nearing the three-eighths pole, advanced outside, seized command nearing the
eighth pole and powered clear under a drive. BEYOND HEAVENLY set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, could not resist the winner in
midstretch but fought on to be a clear second. MY LITTLE MINX settled off the pace along the rail, advanced inside down the backstretch, chased inside
around the far turn, swung out approaching the sixteenth pole and lacked the needed rally. TOOLEGITTOQUIT pressed the pace in the three path, could
not keep pace with the top two in upper stretch, was forced out nearing the sixteenth pole and lacked any further bids. UNSHAKABLE U was bumped at the
start, chased the pace four and five wide and lacked a closing bid. BABY MELISSA was bumped at the start and failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. VILLAGE QUEEN had early speed four wide, retreated around the far turn and was easing through the lane. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE
RIDER OF TOOLEGITTOQUIT AGAINST MY LITTLE MINX FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEARING THE SIXTEENTH POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
DEVOTED KITTEN was never far back while three to four wide, brushed with BACANO turning for home, rallied on the far outside through the stretch,
reached the front a sixteenth out and was going away at the end. NOTSOSUBTLE shifted out a bit awkwardly past the quarter-pole, loomed between horses
through the furlong grounds while attempting to lug in, and went clear for the place near the finish. INDY'S JEWEL rated along on the lead through even
early fractions, brushed with BACANO coming off the far turn, bumped solidly with that foe passing the three-sixteenths, and stayed on stubbornly on the rail
to save the show. BACANO stayed in range to the far turn near the inside, got brushed between DEVOTED KITTEN and INDY'S JEWEL turning for home,
bumped solidly with the latter in upper stretch, bid between horses a furlong out, and was outfinished. DUKE OF MONROE was slow into stride, and saved
ground to no avail. POSITIVE PHIL tired four wide approaching the stretch. SECRET LIFE STYLE prompted the pace outside INDY'S JEWEL, and retired
before completing six furlongs. BUDGET BUSTER got out badly entering the first turn, was pulled up before completing a quarter-mile, and walked off.

IMA DAREDEVIL settled off the early pace scramble five wide, bid four wide around the turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths pole, quickly drew
clear and angled into the two path turning for home then widened through the lane under a drive. TALKTHETALK tracked the pace from the rail, bid inside
nearing the lane, could not keep pace with the winner but finished willingly to be clearly second best. BION MAGIC had early speed between foes, settled
back off the duel two wide around the turn, never threatened but was along for the show. BAHAMIAN GIRL contested the pace four wide, dropped back into
the turn, could not quite match strides while under a drive around the turn, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole, angled wider in upper stretch and passed
tiring rivals. TALE OF V K was fractious behind the gate, hit the gate, saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. REGGAE REVOLUTION pressed the
pace three wide between foes and tired in the lane. ITSENOUGH set a pressured pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR took command at the start, rated along two or three paths off the inside, shook off ROYAL MEGHAN into the stretch, and stayed clear
under a mild drive. INDEPENDENT MISS advanced along the inside leaving the turn, finished willingly but could not seriously menace the winner. DON'T
GET KHOZY saved ground throughout, and offered a mild response to best the others. ROYAL MEGHAN pursued INDEPENDENT MISS from outside,
made no impression being scrubbed along after a half-mile, and weakened through the lane. BIMINI lacked the needed response three wide. WORTH
AVENUE raced two to three wide, and posed no threat. KOZY DREAMS checked between DON'T GET KHOZY and WORTH AVENUE near the
three-quarter pole, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AVANT GARDE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, was urged along entering the turn, edged closers two wide around the far turn, reached
near even terms in upper stretch, put a head in front near the eighth pole, dueled outside of HERO TIGER through the lane and prevailed under left-handed
urging. HERO TIGER moved two wide to the lead, angled in late on the first turn, opened up down the backstretch, continued clear at the rail around the far
turn, dug in inside of the winner in upper stretch, battled on gamely while put in tight between that foe and the rail and gave way grudgingly. FIFTH TITLE
chased the pace three wide and finished evenly to maintain the show. ICONIC saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and was
one-paced in the lane. ED'S DOG had early speed inside and retreated around the far turn.
