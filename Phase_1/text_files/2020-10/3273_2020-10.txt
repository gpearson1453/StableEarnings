ALL ABOUT READY set the pace being passed from the inside to upper stretch, bore out under a drive ending up near the outer fence somehow prevailing
at the end. PENCE tracked through the turn vying willingly from the three path down the lane. AKTABANTAY (GB) stalked the pace rallying clear on the
inside in upper stretch faltering late. FERLIN HUSKY raced evenly traveling inside to upper stretch lacking surge there. MISTERBULLTOYOU slow early
raced eight wide down the lane posing no menace. BIG HUNK was never involved. PAR was always outrun.
