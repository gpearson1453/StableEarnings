Footnotes
BLOOD MOON established the front in short order, cut over to the inside, sailed along in control cutting the pace while being firmly rated, struck the
three-sixteenths marker and was switched over to stronger handling, scampered away. SUPER WICKED CHARM settled into midpack after the field had
been sent off and running, stepped onto the turn three wide but was shortly afterwards in path two, chased the winner while being urged along, went into the
lane and got left far behind. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT off the rail throughout, was put to a drive while mostly pursuing the top one from path three on the bend,
commenced the stretch slightly wider, went on to secure the show. BANK GALA rode the rail until the conclusion of the backstretch, was worked into path
two from the top of the bend to its midway point, swung about three wide into the stretch, backed away readily. KING OF AMERICAN away tardily after
throwing his head at the start, got maneuvered over to the rail, brought up the back of the pake one-paced, strolled three wide into the lane, ventured
onward to the wire having never been involved. REVENIO stalked the winner from path two, got set down at the half mile pole, dropped onto the inside route
a furlong down the road after failing to keep pace, seemed to be on empty by the head of the stretch, was then allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
LADY COMMISSIONER four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to prevail. AIN'T NONE LUCKY three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to just get up for the place honors in the very last jump. MADERA coaxed
from the gate, raced briefly inside before tipping out to the two path as the leader took to the inside, prompted the leader into the turn and took over
command placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was
collared a sixteenth from home and weakened in the late stages while well clear of the rest for the show honors. SANDER'S EMPIRE chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. SHANNY GO NANNY chased four then three
wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide for home and tired.
CANARSIE GIRL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under some pressure from MADERA to the outside,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded command near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. QUEENTIGUA six to
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four to five wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for
home and tired. EMPRESS LUCIANA five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, continued four to five wide into upper
stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SARATOGA LOVE under some light hand encouragement, emerged with the advantage shortly after the start, cut over to the inside route, showed the way,
kept to a mild hand ride, with BEAU ARTS applying pressure out in the two path, came up to the three-sixteenths marker and got turned loose, shifted onto
the left rim of the two path in midstretch, saw the runner up closing in belatedly, but held on well enough long enough to prevail. RISKY MISCHIEF tracked
the pace from the pocket, settled in at the head of the stretch and was called upon for more, flashed some momentum deep into the furlong grounds,
maintained it leaving the eighth pole to close the gap, tipped to be outside of the winner with approximately a sixteenth remaining, finished with solid late
foot, missed. SPEIGHTSTOWN GAL took up residence in the two path after being brushed from both sides at the break, was kept on hold caught in traffic
late on the bend, stepped into the lane and ventured onward under the same predicament until the general area of the three-sixteenths marker, got asked
for a response having secured some rooming room beyond the eighth pole, mustered up a mild kick to be along for the show. MERLINS MUSE made light
contact with SPEIGHTTOWN GAL after coming in a bit due to taking an awkward initial step, departed the backstretch from the three path, commenced the
stretch one path farther off the rail, flattened out. BEAUX ARTS pressed the winner from the two path, challenged in earnest heading home, got staved off,
weakened in the final furlong. JC'S SHOOTING STAR two wide onto the turn, got sent out into path four wide exiting it, failed to menace. THE IMPORTANT
ONE chased the pace from the three path during the run around the bend, went into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
STARFRONT brushed the off side stall at the start and came under brief coaxing to vie briefly with a trio before establishing the front five and a half furlongs
from home, showed the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled safely in front through swift splits, cornered two to three wide into upper
stretch and was roused straightened away, drew off under a light drive and was ridden out to the finish under light urging. BACK CHANNEL led early on
before briefly vying with a trio and then chased along the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. UNDINE coaxed from the gate, vied briefly before chasing
five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. TACTICAL
MOVE brushed the near side stall at the start and got away last, chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper
stretch and improved position in the drive. YES I'M LOOKING hustled from the gate, vied briefly among a trio from the two path, chased two then three wide
coming under a ride at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened. HALO CITY four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BOBBYFROMTHEPALM briefly placed along the inside route, was maneuvered into the three path from the top of the turn to its midway point, angled into
path four for entrance into the stretch and after being given his cue kicked into his best, closed in enough so as to loom boldly by the beginning of the final
furlong, forged his way past a pair to emerge with the advantage approximately a sixteenth later, shook free. SARGEANT DRIVE attained a forward position
along the backstretch, left it from the two path, prompted VENTUS from that opponent's outside, was forced to do so from between rivals after INDIGO
YANKEE arrived on the scene soon after the half had been rattled off, was under a ride spinning into the lane, fended off heavy pressure during the ensuing
to still be leading, albeit by a slim margin, yielded to the winner for good a sixteenth down the road, had enough left late to save second. MR.
SHORTANDSIMPLE off the inside throughout, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, was moved out towards path five entering the top of the lane,
mustered up a mild kick, missed out on the place. INDIGO YANKEE took up position in midpack after the start, flashed interest advancing from path three
into contention after stepping off the backstretch, went on to dispute the pace as one of a threesome by the five-sixteenths pole, at first as the outermost
one, then from between rivals beginning deep into the furlong grounds, was the most confidently-ridden of the front runners turning into the lane on near
even terms with each other, kept up its pursuit with vigour before weakening in the last sixteenth. VENTUS remained stationed along the rai arguing for the
topl, going about the task as the innermost of three beginning from the neighborhood of the five-sixteenths marker, battled onward until leaving the
three-sixteenths pole, steadily backed away afterwards. DADDY KNOWS stalked the pacesetter at or near the two path for a half before giving way.
INVEST parked out four wide on the turn, was under a protective hold entering the stretch. allowed to fade away thereafter.

MALIBU LUNA away in good order, took up the chase three wide on the turn, angled out five wide for the stretch run, settled into stride once straightened
away and readily cut into the deficit, struck the front in the neighborhood of the sixteenth pole and shook free. LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE retained the
advantage after breaking a length the fastest, cut over to the inside route, showed the way on a somewhat loosely-contested lead, coaxed along, made it to
the three-sixteenths marker and got set down, was pounced upon by the winner a sixteenth later, stayed on for second after relinquishing right around the
sixteenth pole. BUSTINMYGROOVE tracked the pace from the pocket, got worked into path two from upper to midlane, with the second of two solid left side
salvos leading the mount to veer out sharply at the eighth pole, corrected course after getting checked, held for the show. MY DELICIOUS hung out four
wide on the turn, shifted over to the two path early during the stretch run, made no impact. FULL OF FIRE stalked LUTESCOOT N BOOGIE towards path
two, commenced the stretch slightly wider, gave way. TAP THE BARREL three wide entering the turn, got steered out into path four exiting it, lacked a
response and backed away.

EVER DANGEROUS established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under pressure near the
five-sixteenths for the initial time, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the
eighth pole, held well to the finish to prevail. BASQUIAT five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home
and offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home. IRISH MIAS brushed the off side stall at the start then got bumped by DANTE'S FIRE breaking
inwards and was behind rivals, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly to get up for the show honors. TURN OF EVENTS attended the leader to the outside four then three wide, began to apply pressure nearing the
five-sixteenths and came under coaxing at that station, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. LIFE ON TOP tracked the pace just off
the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. DANTE'S FIRE
broke in at the start bumping IRISH MIAS, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. PLOT THE DOTS three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs out, cornered four wide at the head of the stretch and
weakened. LAST OPPORTUNITY (IRE) chased four to five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
HOLD THE SALSA put to a firm hold after brushing with EAGLE ORG the start, powered up into a forward position on the backstretch, went about more
professionally after the pilot resorted to a hand ride springing from the half mile pole, closed in on the ones to catch, latching on to them with a few jumps to
spare before the quarter pole, challenged as the widest of three in upper stretch, out-fought the pair to her inside from there until the sixteenth pole, then
edged away under good handling. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE off a half beat the quickest, remained forwardly placed, disputed the pace from path two, was
forced to do so from between opponents late on the bend, got turned loose spinning into the stretch, saw the winner take charge with approximately a
sixteenth to go, stayed on willingly to salvage second. BROOKLYN STRONG broke a half beat slow, rushed up into a prominent position during the opening
phases appearing a bit keen, departed the backstretch, sat parked out four wide during the run around the bend, angled one path farther off the rail for the
stretch run, rallied for the show. HALF RIGHT in sharply as the field was sent on its way, was then coaxed along rushing up to the front end, carved out the
pace accompanied by LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE from the outside, came under heavier pressure when the winner arrived on the scene a little beyond the
five-sixteenths marker, came under a drive a few strides later, relinquished deep into the furlong grounds, fought onward for another sixteenth before
weakening. EAGLE ORB made light contact with the winner in the shadow of the starting gate after losing her footing, got set up in the pocket, was patiently
ridden keeping an eye on a wall of four equines spread out across the oval, went two wide into the lane, got gradually worked into path four afterwards,
made no impact. WINDY NATIONS took up the chase from path two on the bend, came under rousing by the five-sixteenths marker, fanned out six wide
from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, had no rally.

FALSE ALARM six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn, remained in hand spinning just off the inside for
home before being roused straightened away, rallied angling to the rail nearing the eighth pole, rallied up the fence to issue a challenge and take command
nearing the sixteenth marker, then inched clear to the finish kept to task. FRAT broke in at the start brushing the near side stall, vied with a trio briefly before
emerging to duel from the five path with BRICKYARD to his inside, tucked two to three wide through the turn continuing to knock heads placed to coaxing at
the five-sixteenths when taking the advantage, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the inside, got collared nearing the
sixteenth pole, then just last on the wire over a pair to preserve the place honors. BOOM BOOM KABOOM five paths off the inside in pursuit down the
backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, got set down spinning five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to just miss for the place
honors. FREUDIAN ANALYST tossed his head just prior to the start and the latch was sprung, brushed the near side stall then got brushed by BRICKYARD
who broke outwards and was away last, chased four then three wide from near the rear, cornered just off the inside for home let out for the drive, tipped out
two paths near the eighth pole and kicked on belatedly to miss for the place honors. BROADWAY JOE seven to eight paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and passed tired foes. MONEY IN THE
BANK vied from the six path among a quartet early on before chasing in close range of a duel three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SHANDIAN vied briefly seven paths off the inside with a trio to his
inside, tucked four wide through the turn in pursuit in aim of the duelers, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, continued four wide for home and
weakened. BRICKYARD broke out at the start brushing FREUDIAN ANALYST, vied briefly from the three path with a trio before tucking to the two path to
duel with FRAT to his outside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths headed for command, cut the corner into
upper stretch and weakened.
