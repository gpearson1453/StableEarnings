Footnotes
DONNY TIDWELL off slow and recovered well to stalked the pace well off the rail on the backstretch, entered turn three wide, loomed up to leaders at the
three sixteenths pole, continued rally into the stretch and passed rival comfortably late. EVER FOR EVER EVER pressed leader three deep on the
backstretch, entered turn three wide, took second half of the turn two wide, entered stretch in the lead and proved no match for closing rival. FAST GALLITO
stumbled sharply at the start, had to steady at the seven sixteenths pole due to shifting in rival, tracked leaders along the inside, entered turn two wide and
kept on to get up for third late. JAY BOY shifted in early to bother rival at the three sixteenths pole, pressed leader along the inside on the backstretch,
entered turn along the inside pressing the leader, continued bid in upper stretch but failed to maintain bid and weakened late in deep stretch.
UNFLAPPABLE led between rivals through the backstretch, entered turn in front, started to lose lead to outside rival and had to steady out of a tight hole
midway through the turn and lacked any response thereafter.

Footnotes
NUTTY SIERRA tracked leaders along the backstretch off the rail, entered turn two wide, started bid late in the turn and continued bid in the stretch wearing
down rival late for the win. FANCY TERRACE led two wide early in the backstretch, managed to clear inside rival approaching the quarter pole and held
lead through the turn, met bid from outside rival in the stretch and grudgingly gave up lead late. HYDROSTATIC chased leader along the inside, lacked
room approaching the turn and steadied out of position, gamely kept on and finished a well clear third. ZACHIAN stalked leaders along the inside on the
backstretch, failed to threaten thereafter while lacking any bid. MAJESTIC JOURNEY tossed head and came out slow, found himself far back early and
stayed along the inside, finished with some interest and galloped out well. OBJECTOON the rider of HYDROSTATIC lodged an objection on the second
place finisher FANCY TERRRACE for interference at the quarter pole, STEWARDS ruled that HYDROSTATIC tried to get into a hole that did not exist
therefore they feel their was no foul committed, result of the onjection was NO CHANGE
