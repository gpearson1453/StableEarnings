Footnotes
D'S BEN broke alertly, was joined in a duel, gained a short lead midway through the backstretch, shook clear early turn, was pressured approaching the
stretch, drifted out a bit then shook clear turning for home and widened under a drive. SEEMEE was off slow and settled in mid pack, closed three-wide on
the far turn, was lapped onto the pacesetter but was forced out a little near the top of the stretch then was no match but saved the place. TRULY ELITE
raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly through through the stretch. PRISON PADRE settled in mid pack, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out. AM PREPARED stalked the pace, closed along the rail on the
far turn then evened out late. JUST RUN WITH IT settled off the pace, was hustled on the final turn but never reached contention. STREET CAT SAM broke
slowly, moved up quickly to duel, forced the pace from mid backstretch but faded through the turn.

Footnotes
PIPESTONE raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn, launched a determined drive and got up late. SECOND GRACE stalked the pace, chased
three-wide into the stretch, dug in, gained the lead in the final furlong but was headed in the final yards. WIDE AWAKE set a pressured pace, shook clear
into the turn, was all out in the stretch but was caught late nearing mid stretch and gave way. CHERUBIC pressed the early pace, was hustled four and
five-wide on the turn then closed through the stretch. IF SIX WAS NINE forced the pace, chased three and four-wide on the turn but evened out in the
stretch. ECHO STRIKE AGAIN bumped with ELFIN FOREST at the outset, closed to mid pack, was hustled hard on the turn then chased gamely in vain. LA
BESTIA stalked the pace from the rail, chased into the stretch but her rally stalled a 16th out. ELFIN FOREST, bumped at the start and settled off the pace,
rode the rail on the turn but lacked a rally.

LOUIE raced in mid pack, angled from the rail to four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. SAMUEL H had speed, was headed on the 1st turn, stalked
the leader and then the duelers on the far turn, rebid upper stretch, was passed and chased to the end. PRINCE MARTHEUS stalked the pace, bid into the
far turn, dueled, was passed a furlong out and gave way. KUDURO raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but failed to menace
in the stretch. RANGE OF MOTION reared leaving the gate, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn then finished evenly.
ANOTHER BREEZE settled in mid pack, raced three-wide throughout, was shuffled back on the far turn then tendered a mild rally. THE KODIAC KID (IRE)
forced the pace, came three-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a closing response. AMERICAN DRIVEN led midway through the
first turn, set a pressured pace. dueled on the far turn but tired at the top of the stretch. MINT MONSTER was off slowly and settled well back early, trailed
much of the way and never reached contention.
