Footnotes
PERFECTIONISTIC settled off the inside, swung four to five wide entering the stretch and rallied widest in the lane to get up late. MASTER RYAN bumped
by rival at the start, moved up to chased behind the leader from inside, came a bit off the rail into the stretch then moved out further in the lane, bid three
deep and led with a sixteenth to go but got caught in the closing moments. R MATINEIGH IDOL pressed the pace from outside, challenged into the stretch,
fought between foes in the lane and yielded to the top pair. ONE FAST BRO chased three wide around the turn, moved out a bit in the lane and finished
evenly. N. K. ROCKET MAN broke in and bumped rival, traveled a bit off the rail through the turn, finished well but lacked room late. COUNT ALEXEI sped
to the front and angled to the inside, set the pace with pressure to the inside, fought back near the fence in the lane but weakened late. SQUARE ROOT
bumped at the start, raced outside a rival while in range, traveled four then three wide around the turn and weakened. DYNAMIC DUO bumped rival at the
start then took an awkward step crossing from the dirt onto the turf, dropped to the back of the field, saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor.
CIRCLE WEST settled off the pace, entered the turn two wide, shifted out into the stretch and was eased in the drive.

Footnotes
LIONITE allowed to settle in the early going, traveled along the inside then steered out into the stretch, closed through the lane and inhaled the runner-up.
CAPTAIN SCOTTY took control quickly then moved to the inside, led a bit off the rail while clear into the stretch, held command through the final furlong but
was overtaken in the late stages. POSTERIZE chased outside a rival then three wide around the turn, kept on through the final furlong and held the show.
OIL CAN KNIGHT stalked off the rail, raced three wide then four wide into the stretch and failed to produce a bid. LITTLEBITAMEDAL trailed the field up the
backstretch off the inside, raced four wide around the turn then moved out into the lane and showed a mild rally. QUALITY LINE raced off the pace, entered
the turn three wide then angled in some around the bend and never threatened. I BELONG TO BECKY chased outside the leader, two wide into the turn
then moved to the fence, lost ground into the lane and weakened.

dug in for the score. PARNELLI set the pace inside, challenged around the far turn and responded to urging, dueled through the lane and fought gamely to
the wire. BOLU raced four wide into the first turn then angled to the rail around the bend, stalked the pace from inside, drifted in upper lane and bested the
others. SCARY LARRY angled in some on the first turn, unhurried early on, traveled off the rail, raced three then four into the stretch, angled out and was
never a factor. MEGA MISCHIEF stalked off the inside, entered the stretch three wide and tired.

Footnotes
DYLANS WILD CAT stalked the speed off the rail, closed in around the turn, took aim three wide into the stretch, floated out by the leader in the lane, drew
up on even terms at the sixteenth pole and proved best. ALLIE'S PAL sped clear from inside, showed the way along the fence into the drive, resisted when
challenged from the outside, drifted out and was outkicked in the final sixteenth while clearly second best. BLACKJACK BETTY off a bit slow to begin,
tracked from inside, saved ground to the stretch, remained inside through the final furlong and gained the show. COMPLETE CONTROL bumped with
outside rival at the start, chased outside a rival, angled out leaving the turn and flattened in the final furlong. LUXURY LINER tracked off the inside, went
three wide through the turn and failed to rally. SQUARED SHADY traveled near the back of the pack, took the turn four wide then angled out at the top of
the lane and flattened. CARELESS STAR stalked in the two path to the stretch and faded. SUPERNOVA WILDCAT raced two wide into the stretch and had
little left for the late stages. DORITA'S HEART raced off the pace, entered the turn three wide then moved out path and made no impact. PINK PHLOX
bumped leaving the gate, saved ground into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
STELLAR SOUND off a bit slow to begin, between rivals early then stalked off the rail around the first turn, remained off the inside then closed in outside
around the far turn, took a short lead at the quarter pole, kicked clear and drew off under hand urging. VELVET QUEEN cleared early then set the pace
inside, headed by rival at the quarter pole, proved no match for the winner in the lane but held on to the place. STORIE BLUE raced three wide early,
tracked off the rail up the backstretch, raced three wide into the far turn then came five wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. DON'T BLAME JUDY
stumbled badly at the start, trailed the field early, angled five wide into the stretch and improved position. CLASSY RULER off a bit slow, unhurried from off
the inside, angled in entering the backstretch, traveled along the rail then two wide into the stretch and weakened. LAST FIRST KISS chased the pace off
the rail, exited the bend three wide between foes, angled to the inside in the stretch and came up empty. BEGUILED bobbled at the start, chased a bit off
the rail, three wide into the far turn then moved out into the four path and faded.

Footnotes
SHADOW SPHINX stalked a bit off the rail then between runners, went three wide into the stretch then took aim four wide in the lane and proved best late.
FRENCH GETAWAY unhurried in the early going, raced outside a rival then angled out, raced seven wide in upper stretch, rallied widest and earned the
place honors. MITHQAAL up close outside the leader early, pressed the issue near the three-eighths, headed rival around the far turn and took command at
the quarter pole, led into the stretch but was outkicked in the late stages. M TOWN GEM settled near the inside, went three wide into the lane and finished
willingly for a minor award. HONOS MAN tucked inside early, saved ground then tipped out on the far turn, showed some late interest but needed to find
more. MOVE OVER (GB) traveled mid-pack and outside a rival, raced four wide leaving the turn and moved out six wide in upper stretch and never
produced a bid. SOUTHERN KING stalked outside a rival then three deep on the backstretch, went three to four wide into the lane and weakened. OF
GOOD REPORT broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, tracked along the inside then a bit off the rail on the backstretch, angled in on the second
turn, lacked room in upper stretch and flattened. SWAMP SOUFFLE bumped from the inside at the start, trailed the field early, raced a bit off the rail then
angled out into the stretch and further out in the drive and never threatened. SYNTHESIS set the pace from inside, collared around the far turn and folded in
the lane.

Footnotes
BLACK STORM bumped leaving the gate, settled off the pace, raced two wide then angled in around the bend, rallied up the fence and drew clear late.
JAN'S RESERVE tracked a bit off the rail, went three wide into the lane, angled out upper stretch and rallied late to edged FABOZZI for the place. FABOZZI
up close just off the leader while outside a rival, raced three then two wide around the turn, bid outside the leader and took over nearing the furlong grounds
then yielded in the late stages. PAPA TURF set the pace and steered over near the inside, headed by rival in upper stretch and flattened out.
AWHITESPORTSCOAT entered the turn four wide, moved in a bit then angled back out and came five wide into the stretch and finished evenly. LUCKY
ROMANO forwardly place outside the leader, drifted out into the stretch and weakened. ROYAL SEEKER trailed the field in the early going, went three wide
around the turn improved. MORE HONOR tracked outside a right, floated out and was in tight into the stretch and weakened. WRITE ME A SONG saved
ground into the lane and never threatened. AROUND THE DIAL stalked the pace from inside, moved a bit off the rail in the drive and faded. SEVEN OXEN
bumped leaving the gate, chased off the rail then three wide into the lane and was never a factor.
