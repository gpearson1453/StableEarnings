stretch drive to take the nod the final yards. ICE KAUFY pressured the pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn then dug in gamely to the
final yards before yielding the nod; grudgingly. THE GREAT MCHENRY chased the pace, raced off the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for
third. GABBI'S AMOR chased the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for third. GOODBYESEEULATER gave
chase through the backstretch, raced in the five path of the turn and finished evenly. HERE COMES COACH pressured the pace most of the backstretch
then faded on the turn. ROLLING BROOK bore out throughout, was eased on the turn and walked off.

Footnotes
GOT YOUR NUMBER angled toward the inside to set a pressured pace off the rail, moved clear into the turn and dug in under steady encouragement to
hold on well. SPLIT THE CHECK chased the pace and raced near the rail on the turn turn settled for second best. MY PRETTY EYES gave chase through
the backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and finished evenly. CHOPRA gave chase and raced at the rail on the turn then finished evenly. LA
RUFINA chased the pace, raced in the five path of the turn and finished evenly. STROLLING THROUGH chased the pace, raced in the six path of the turn
and finished evenly. TRUENO FUERTE was not a factor. OBSCENE pressured the early pace inside but steadied at the rail approaching the quarter pole,
eased slightly out from that point but steadily faded. WOODSONG'S CASTLE hesitated at the break, raced wide early and was not a factor.

CAYENNE CREEK rated close inside the first turn then eased out entering the backstretch, closed to the front approaching the three eighths pole and was
pressured from that point, dueled clear into the far turn then dug in under steady encouragement to hold off the challenge of SCOTTISH MAN, who settled
off the pace in the three path the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, challenged the winner three wide approaching the head of the stretch
but was turned back in the drive. PAPA RALPH J saved ground off the pace then eased out with a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. BOLD VALOR angled to the inside to rate the pace, though was met at even terms
leaving the nine sixteenths pole, gave up the lead approaching the three eighths, gave chase from that point but dropped back nearing the quarter pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened. K W CAPTAIN FLINT raced off the pace in the three and four paths then picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, though, faded on the far turn. SWEETIN BREAD steadied at the start then closed to contention three wide and was at even terms leaving the
nine sixteenths pole, was caught approaching the three eighths, dropped back past the pole then faded into the far turn. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DIANATHEHUNTRESS was a bit reluctant to load but came away sharply and angled in to set the pace, rounded the turn at the rail then held on under
steady stretch encouragement. BADS LIL LADY steadied through the chute then picked up the chase toward the inside, angled five wide into the stretch,
dug in under steady left hand encouragement while drifting wider and wider through the lane, and was gaining on the winner. WILD CORK pressured the
pace off the rail and remained close two deep on the turn, raced evenly through the stretch but was outfinished for second the final yards.
LILBITSOFDRAMA pressured the pace inside, dropped back at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, though, finished evenly. THREE AFFAIRS engaged
in close chase down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path, drifted into the lane and showed little further. GLOBAL FIRST chased the pace then
saved ground midway on the turn and finished evenly. MEGS SQUIRELLYGIRL gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. ITSI
BITSI hesitated at the break and raced well back lacking speed.

Footnotes
UNCUT took over at the rail past the three quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths and was steadily encouraged to
put further distance between her and RAELYN'S STAR, who raced just off the pace in the three and four paths, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
rounded the turn off the rail, then settled for second best. LIL WATTY saved ground close to the pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride inside the eighth pole. GORGEOUS ROAD raced well back saving early ground, started a bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and closed mostly of her own initiative through the stretch. WALKNTHEPLANK
settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened inside the sixteenth
pole. WHIZ PASS raced outside into the backstretch and showed little response. CALCUTTA settled back toward the inside and showed little response
through the backstretch. BAYOU BOUGIE raced with the early pace two deep then stalked into the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, though, faded on the far turn. ROARING SIDECAR rounded the first turn about the five path and showed little response past the three eighths pole.

TAPTAP saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and loomed close three wide on the far turn, dueled to the front mid-stretch and dug
in determinedly to hold off the game challenge of MISS WAVE who was saving ground off the pace the first turn and eased outward into the backstretch,
started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, circled rivals in the five path of the far turn and had a slim lead nearing the head of the lane, was caught
mid-stretch but dug in gamely to the finish. CASTLE REVIEW rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled off the pace entering the backstretch, bid
toward the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the five path of the far turn and dug in to take third mid-stretch, while finishing evenly. CHEESE LOUISE
tapered toward the inside to rate a slim lead and dueled at even terms to the five sixteenths pole, raced close two deep through the far turn but dropped
back from between horses into the stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. CRUZ IN THE CASTLE raced with the pace inside and dueled at even
terms to the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught toward the head of the lane and weakened leaving the
eighth pole. MASTERDANCER raced in the five path the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch and showed only mild response. BELLA
FEMMINA rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. SINGING HARMONY raced off the pace
toward the inside, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but faded nearing the far turn. PER RULING 75 FROM THE WEST VIRIGINIA

Footnotes
IHEARUKNOCKIN rated close inside then stalked into the backstretch, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep past the
quarter, contested the edge on the far turn then dug in under steady encouragement to draw clear the final yards. BACOLI took over inside to rate the pace,
was prompted from the three eighths pole and gave up the advantage nearest the rail into the far turn, then continued a viable factor to late stretch before
relenting. SET'EM UP JOE saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, proved no
match for the top two in the lane but held on for third. AFFIX raced well back off the rail the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn close to the rail then eased out later yards and was gaining on third. BURNIN RING O FIRE rounded the first turn off the rail then raced outside into
the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn two deep, though weakened inside the eighth pole. JAXBRADENRISHI
stalked the pace from the two and three paths then gave chase, of little consequence, past the seven sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
HEART HERO angled to the inside and took over nearing the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole to
widen on the far turn then extended his lead under steady stretch handling. BOURBON BRYCE stalked from the four path the first turn and raced toward the
outside into the backstretch, gave chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, though had to settle for second. U. S.
MILLENNIUM raced in the seven path the first turn and settled close entering the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn
about the three path then flattened stride in the lane. STEPHANOPOULOS settled off the early pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three
eighths pole and came through the far turn in the four path, then flattened stride. FIRST FIGHTER saved ground early then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased outward in the upper stretch but showed little more. THISISTHETIMETOWIN raced just off the early pace
toward the inside and showed only mild response down the backstretch, then faded on the far turn. EGREGIOUS steadied off the rail past the five eighths
pole and showed little response through the backstretch. RAGING MOON set the pace most of the opening quarter mile then stalked from the nine
sixteenths pole, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths then faded abruptly into the far turn. NOTHING YET raced in the six path the first turn and was
never a factor.
