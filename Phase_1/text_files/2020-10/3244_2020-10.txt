Footnotes
CHURCHILLS VICTORY vied inside CUY for six furlongs, got the best of that dispute in the two-path turning for home, drifted out and in through the stretch,
and fought off ESTILO PELIGROSO to prevail. ESTILO PELIGROSO settled in midpack early, rallied along the rail into the stretch, reached near even
terms with a furlong remaining, but was outfinished. GUACO eyed the batting leaders three wide for six furlongs, and lacked the needed response when
roused on the far turn. POWER (BRZ) stumbled at the start, raced three wide early, and posed no serious threat. CUY got bumped by SUPER EDGAR at
the start, contested the pace outside CHURCHILLS VICTORY to the stretch, and gave way. SUPER EDGAR broke out bumping CUY at the start, and was
finished early. EXPRESS BOY raced three wide early, and was through before reaching the stretch. PRINCE VALESKI was no factor. NOBLE
NEBRASKAN was far back throughout, and eased up in the stretch.

IAMBUTTER pressed the pace from the outset, took over along the inside after six furlongs, and was driving to hold sway. VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ vied
outside WINTER AT BASTOGNE in the four-path, could not go with the winner turning for home, but stayed on well. D. SILO was in the second flight early
near the two-path, saved ground into the stretch and finished willingly on the rail. TONE FEELIN was reserved early inside, came under a ride on the far turn
three wide, and could not seriously threaten. OLD MAIN raced four wide throughout, and lacked the needed rally. FLORIDA EXPRESS was always outrun.
WINTER AT BASTOGNE vied in the three-path inside VOICESINTHEDARKNEZ early, was put to pressure after a half-mile, and gave way.
ULTRACONFIDENT stayed in range three wide for six furlongs, and tired. ANGEL'S ENTRY raced widest into the backstretch, and tired after a half-mile.
Race was hand timed.

Footnotes
FEARLESS IDEAS bumped with TIN ROOF RUSTY at the start, contested the early pace inside that rival, shook clear up the backstretch, settled into the
stretch clear in the two-path, drifted out and remained clear. THE BEST DISTANCE came in sharply bumping GEOMETRICO near the half-mile pole, came
four wide into the stretch and rallied to be clearly second best. EXIT RIGHT raced two wide on the turns, moved inside for the drive and was up for the
show. CON PERMISO raced forwardly for six furlongs, and weakened in the two-path through the late stages. GEOMETRICO received a solid bump from
THE BEST DISTANCE near the half-mile pole, and tired. TIN ROOF RUSTY bumped with FEARLESS IDEAS at the start, argued the pace outside that one
early, and tired after six furlongs. BRO GUN broke slowly, and trailed. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF GEOMETRICO AGAINST THE BEST
DISTANCE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE UP THE BACKSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
UNLOCKTHEPOTENTIAL advanced in the two-path after six furlongs, took over inside SMELL OF ROSES at the top of the stretch, and drove clear.
DEVOTED KITTEN was unhurried early, rallied inside coming off the far turn, and went clear of the others while not a threat to the winner. DEXTER ROAD
raced three to four wide throughout, and lacked a solid bid. SMELL OF ROSES set the pace well removed from the rail, and yielded to the winner soon after
completing six furlongs. BEINFUN bumped with VINTNER at the start, chased outside for six furlongs, and tired. VINTNER bumped with BEINFUN at the
start, and was through early.

Footnotes
TOSS stalked from close range toward the inside, moved out with aim outside ROBINTAKINCHARGE after six furlongs, and wore that rival down through
the closing yards. ROBINTAKINCHARGE vied in the three-path inside MACHO D'ORO early, edged away around the far turn, dug in through a long drive
and yielded grudgingly inside the winner. FIRST AND THREE brushed with MR. CESCO at the start, raced well back to the far turn, and rallied mildly
outside. LONG GRAY LINE was outrun early, and improved position outside without threatening. MACHO D'ORO pressed the pace outside
ROBINTAKINCHARGE to the far turn, and gave way approaching the stretch. SHIDOSHI was never prominent. INSPIRATO (MEX) was no factor.
MAJESTIC LUNA was finished before reaching the stretch. MR. CESCO was always outrun. SON OF OAHU raced forwardly early outside, tired into the far
turn, and was eased up in the stretch.

Footnotes
AEQUOR saved ground beginning to find stride midway on the turn, was guided out to the three-path at the top of the stretch, caught CONGRATS THAT
from outside past the sixteenth-pole and won going away. CONGRATS THAT sped clear early, showed the way to the stretch removed from the rail, could
not withstand the winner in deep stretch but was clear of the rest. BRIDOLOGIST pursued outside CONGRATS THAT for a half-mile, moved inside for the
drive and finished evenly. BAHAMIAN PRINCE got bumped by WHO'S IN CHARGE at the start, came five wide off the turn, and could not threaten.
SANCOCHO (MEX) raced three wide around the turn, and lacked the needed late response. SECRET LIFE STYLE was no factor four wide. WHO'S IN
CHARGE broke in bumping BAHAMIAN PRINCE at the start, showed speed to the turn, and tired after a half-mile.

Footnotes
CAT'S ASTRAY came out awkwardly brushing the right side of the gate and ROYAL MEGHAN as well, rushed up to get the lead, shook clear around the
turn in the two-path, and was driving to keep rivals safe late. ROYAL MEGHAN brushed with CAT'S ASTRAY at the start, moved inside coming off the turn,
rallied into second through upper stretch, then held that spot along the rail. DAHLONEGA pressed CAT'S ASTRAY from outside early, got shaken off on the
turn, ran on willingly and just missed the place. WORTH AVENUE was outrun to the stretch, and improved on the far outside for a share. SAYONARA BABY
hit the right side of the gate at the start, saved ground on the turn, and could not reach contention. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR raced four wide around the turn,
and made no headway in the lane. MISS MIAMI chased in the three-path to the far turn, and tired past the quarter-pole.

Footnotes
SMASH took command early in the two-path, extended the advantage after a half-mile, settled into the stretch with a commanding lead, and was all out to
hang on. JANUARY WON brushed with TRIBUTE FLAG at the start, lagged well back two wide for six furlongs, rallied along the rail through the stretch and
was getting to the winner from inside near the wire. TONY SMALL raced four wide early, moved in a path on the far turn, and rallied mildly. RAGS FOR
BRITCHES advanced four wide on the far turn, and finished evenly. JUPI'S LIGHTNING pressed the early pace outside, and faded before completing six
furlongs. DR. SAMADI saved ground early, went four wide around the far turn, and passed tired horses. STILL SCHEMIN raced in the second flight
throughout, and never factored. SLIPPY raced forwardly outside for six furlongs, and faltered into the stretch. TIZ LUNA steadied toward the inside midway
up the backstretch, and tired. GOOD TIMING MAN had the rider lose the whip near the five-sixteenths pole, and tired. TRIBUTE FLAG lost contact with the
field early, and jogged in far behind.
