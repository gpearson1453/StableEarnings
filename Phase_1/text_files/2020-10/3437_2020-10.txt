Footnotes
HERO'S RETURN came out a bit at the break and was bumped, straightened and was taken to rate well off the inside and in a stalking spot, advanced five
wide under a light hold and engaged rivals entering the lane, struck the top soon after, was roused clear while on his left lead and held sway under a drive.
PRINCE KHOZAN came in at the break bumping with a foe and causing a bit of a jam up, corrected and tracked the leader, came under coaxing mid turn,
bid four wide between runners into the stretch, failed to match strides with the winner but kept on willingly to hold down the place. LECTRIC CHOKE
stumbled at the break, recovered and settled off the pace while saving ground, gained along the rail entering the stretch then steadied off the heels of a
tiring rival near the three sixteenths, shifted out and churned on. GREEK PRINCE , in tight at the break, dropped in early and edged up past the five eighths
pole, angled four wide approaching the stretch, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds but failed to seriously sustain. MAYNOOTH , in close at the break,
lagged off the pace while saving some ground, was put to a drive leaving the half mile marker, worked outward in the lane and had some late life. JUST
CHILL OUT , wide and off the pace, came up empty. G MAN broke sharply then angled in towards the fence, set the pace holding a clear advantage past
the half mile marker, was engaged by a pair of rivals while three wide into the lane, gave little resistance and faltered through the final furlong.

wide, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and failed to rally. GINS AND TINS , fractious in the starting gate, chased the pace in the two path and gave
way on the turn. SMART STEP , unhurried down the babckstretch while outrun, faltered through the stretch.

NOMO RON dropped in early and rated off of a contested pace past the half mile marker, quickly gained approaching the lane, shifted out and rallied to take
command outside the leaders with a furlong to go, wandered out a bit while clear near the sixteenth marker then held firm under steady handling. GIRLS
LOVE ME edged up towards the inside nearing the half mile marker, raced further off the rail while in range mid turn, shifted out near mid stretch and
finished gamely. RAY'SWARRIOR prompted the pace three wide outside SUCCESSFUL ZIP, drew alongside leaving the far turn, dueled from the three
eighths to past the three sixteenths, could not fend off the winner in mid stretch and faded. SUCCESSFUL ZIP , fractious in the gate, sped to the front in the
opening sixteenth, set the pace two wide, was joined past the half mile marker, sparred inside rivals heading to the eighth pole then weakened. MORE
ABUNDANCE , four wide just off the embattled leaders, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on nearing the lane and tired. DAY THE
MUSIC DIED broke a step slow, was taken wide and rated early, gained five wide past the five sixteenths, had aim into the lane, failed to follow through past
the three sixteenths and succumbed.

briefly from left handed asking soon into the lane, was corrected and confronted past the quarter pole, lost command while dueling inside rivals leaving near
the three sixteenths, battled back to regain command a furlong out, kept on tenaciously under solid handling and turned away PLOT THE DOTS. PLOT THE
DOTS rated in mid pack while off the inside, commenced a run between foes mid turn, angled out and circled five wide into the lane, ranged up outside a
pair of foes to threaten near the three sixteenths, fought on outside the winner through the final seventy yards but was kept at bay. MIAMI MUMBLES , in
range while off the inside, advanced four wide mid turn, bid between foes entering the stretch, dueled and gained a slim lead past the three sixteenths, failed
to keep up with the top pair past the sixteenth pole and faded. CROUCHELLI drafted back off the pace while saving ground, cut the corner into the lane,
angled out but only had a mild response. COUSIN JIMMY steadied when in close at the break, settled off the pace, angled three wide making some
progress near the stretch, moved up between runners then angled in for the final furlong but failed to sustain. SEA GHOST , off the pace, raced wide for the
drive but lacked a bid. JOSEF IS REAL had speed the rated back off the leaders to stalk, came back to challenge near the stretch, failed to kick on past the
three sixteenths and weakened. AL BROWN had speed to contest the early pace inside rivals, eased back to track, was under pressure chasing off the rail
mid turn and gave way. OXIDE chased off the rail, was under pressure leaving the far turn and faltered.

worked between horses in upper stretch, failed to be a threat and passed foes. CAN THE QUEEN , three deep on the turn, chased the pace and gave way
in mid stretch. MARGIE'S HEAVEN lacked speed, raced in the three path turning for home and gave way4w. NO VENTI NO WAVY , three wide on the turn,

Footnotes
ZITARROSA broke a bit slow then accelerated inside rivals to go clear early on, set a rated pace two wide into the lane, wandered inward after being roused
right handed inside the three sixteenths, switched over to his left lead with about a sixteenth remaining then maintained a comfortable advantage while kept
to task. DAYSTRIKE chased the winner three wide and held well to be clear of the rest. BOLITA BOYZ , off the pace outside rivals, shifted five wide in upper
stretch and churned on to gain the show. TRICKY LION drifted out at the break and was brushed, chased towards the inside and faded. TIME FLIES BY
lacked speed off the rail, raced well wide in upper stretch and lacked a solid kick. SIDEWALK PROPHET saved ground early, was shuffled back near the
half mile marker, swung wide for the drive and had belated action. CORREJON , bumped and pinched back at the break, moved up off the rail past the five
sixteenths, continued some progression near mid stretch then flattened out. THE FORTY FACTOR chased outside and weakened. GREEK GOD came in at
the break and bumped with CORREJON, chased between rivals and faltered mid turn.
