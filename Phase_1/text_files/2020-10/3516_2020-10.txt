KID MACHO pursued the loose pacesetter, took over midway on the final turn, drifted out through the stretch and was under moderate urging late.
WOODHAVEN KID advanced three wide on the final turn and rallied mildly. MAMAIGOTTHIS lagged far behind, moved wide into the stretch and closed
well while no threat. PARTNER'S POWER quickly sprinted clear, bore out on the lead and gave way. INDIRECTLY offered a menacing move inside after
half a mile then faded badly.

LOAN ME YOUR EAR saved ground throughout, bid to the front in mid stretch then won the head bob in a very tight finish. MR CLASSICAL broke a bit
awkwardly, raced wide, led at the quarter pole, dropped back briefly but came again just missing. EASTPORT saved ground just off the leaders and
flattened out in the stretch. SHOELESS vied early, moved inside, alternated for the lead and proved empty in the stretch. JONES TAXI trailed for half a mile,
moved wide on the final turn and was no threat. LEGACY'S PRINCE dropped back early and was never in contention. AMI'S ARTIE was urged close up
very wide for half a mile and gave way. VOCAB hustled to the lead inside and stopped after half a mile.

AFRICAN SONG raced along the rail early, split foes on the backstretch, eased out entering the stretch, shook loose to a clear lead mid stretch, drifted in
and held on. OUI MADAME was bothered leaving the gate, saved ground early, split foes rallying, also drifted in through stretch and missed. PRINCESS
MARISOL came out at the start causing crowding, raced in the five path on the backstretch, remained wide and flattened out. MISS JASSER, very wide
while not far back, held on well. START NOTIZING saved ground throughout and was too late. LEFTATTHEALTAR set the early pace along the rail then
faded through the stretch. BELLA LUCIA, very wide, failed to menace. ALL RIGHT GIRL, racing outside winner early, tired. WHEREWITHAL was fanned out
into QUI MADAME leaving the gate, stopped badly and was eased. AZLYNN'S DREAMER stumbled badly leaving the gate and unseated her rider.

Footnotes
ISABELLAALEXA controlled the pace, repelled a challenge after half a mile then pulled away under mild urging and was taken in hand late. LIGHT UP
NIGHT settled inside, advanced on the final turn then flattened out late while easily second best. WOOD BEE prompted the pace outside then began fading
after five furlongs. LULA'S ROADRUNNER saved ground just off the leaders and lacked a solid rally. GYPSY WIFE trailed along the rail and was never in
contention. ROCKSTAR GIRL dropped back early and was never a factor. CARMELTINI chased wide and gave way readily.

late. ASSET ALLOCATION, three wide and just off the pace, tired badly. ONAROCK, just off the rai while well place, tired badly. Fractional times were

CHILLY IN CHARGE settled at the back of the field; made a strong circling move on the turn, led in mid stretch and held on in a determined score.
SHANGHAI SUPERFLY raced in traffic on the turn, swung wide to secure room into the stretch and rallied gamely too late. WAR TOCSIN vied inside under
constant pressure and battled gamely to the finish. ARK IN THE DARK dueled outside, led narrowly on the turn then weakened in the stretch. MR.
ROUNDTREE eased back in the opening quarter, moved wide in the stretch and was no threat. BRIGHT DAWN split rivals advancing into the far turn and
faltered after half a mile. MANOLITO saved ground just off the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. DOUBLE CHUBBLE dueled three wide down the
backstretch then gave way readily.

Footnotes
DONNYBROOK GIRL set the pace in the four path, shook loose to open a long lead mid stretch then was under strong left handed rousing to maintain a
clear margin. PIE KILLER saved ground advancing, moved out through stretch and was gaining. CHARGE THROUGH broke slowly, raced very wide and
passed faders. KIRTAN, who needed a shoe repair in the paddock, was well placed between foes then tired. CELESTIAL PRIDE broke slowly then never
threatened racing well off the rail. JOYFUL JILL was outrun to stretch, split foes and failed to menace. MARIAH ALYVIA, between foes, moved out through
stretch and tired. CONFIRMED GENIUS broke slowly, saved ground, moved out in early stretch and was never a factor. BLISSFUL BEHAVIOR raced wide
and dropped back steadily. EASY ON THE SUGAR saved ground and lost action near mid stretch.

DREAMS UNTOLD vied briefly inside, moved clear before half a mile, drew off in the stretch and lasted while tiring and being kept to his task. SEMI
EXCITED broke slowly, advanced inside and closed well too late. THISCATCANJUMP pursued the winner gamely to the final stages and continued
willingly. FLAT OUT BEAUTIFUL trailed for half a mile then split rivals in the stretch with late energy. SIR BACK IN BLACK dropped well behind, advanced
wide and finished well while no threat. RUBY BLEU stumbled at the break, rushed to contention then flattened out. NEW COMMISSION urged close up for
half a mile and came up empty. FINAL SHOT chased wide just off the leaders and gave way readily. D T GOODIE raced in mid pack and began faltering on
the turn.

KINGSVILLE dueled for command in the three path and pulled away late. TOWN JAK set the pace in the four path but was no match. ROAN MOUNTAIN
was very wide and was just up for show. NAUGHTY PRINCE, wide and outrun early, found best stride too late. VERO SUN saved ground and wasn't a
serious threat. YOUR AWESOME BOSS stalked from the five path then tired. GRAND OASIS was never a serious threat. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN),
between foes and just off the pace, tired. THUNDER DAY was four wide and just off the pace then dropped back. EXTRA MEDIUM was never a factor.

Footnotes
SILVER EXCESS moved clear early, widened in the stretch and remained safe while kept to a drive. VOLODINA chased off the pace between foes, bid
wide on the final turn but was no threat to the winner. FINISHING SCHOOL pressed the winner to mid-stretch and gradually weakened. DESCARADO
saved ground close up and came again to pass fading rivals. YES MZ ADAH raced just off the pace outside and faltered after half a mile. FLEUR DE
FORCE saved ground well back early, moved wide in the stretch. PRETTY COOL CAT lagged far behind then passed tiring rivals. DRIVEN BY SPEED
dropped back early and was always outrun. TRAPPE ME LATER chased four wide close up, two path into the far turn then gave way. CHANCEE fanned
very wide into the first turn, remained wide and stopped. MISS AL DILA moved closer wide after half a mile but had no further response.
