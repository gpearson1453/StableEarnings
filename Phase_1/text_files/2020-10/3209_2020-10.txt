Footnotes
MUHLENBERG was unhurried while racing three wide early, raced two wide into the far turn, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths pole, closed widest,
seized command nearing the sixteenth pole and powered clear under a drive. GOLAZO set the pace in the two path, kicked clear around the far turn, held
clear past the eighth pole, could not resist the winner nearing the sixteenth marker but stayed on well to hold second. HOLY SAINT stumbled at the start,
raced off the pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, rallied inside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out late. HANDSOME BOY
never threatened while racing two wide. JUNIOR BUG stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. CONFUSION BABY BOY prompted the
pace two and three wide and faded around the far turn. VERN H had early speed two wide and was through after a half.
