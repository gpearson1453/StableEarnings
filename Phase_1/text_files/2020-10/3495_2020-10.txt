ONLY REWARD'S vied for the lead while near the two path through the turn, shook away from challenger straightening in the lane then was ridden out to
the end while extending the advantage. CAFE MISCHIEF was unhurried while having a view of the only other contestants dueling for the lead through the
turn, was asked for more near the five-sixteenths pole and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. MAJESTIC CLIMB vied for the lead
with the winner through the turn while on that one's outside, began losing contact entering the lane and weakened through the final eighth when losing the
place spot.

Footnotes
LET IT B was away alertly to gain the lead at once, raced on a clear advantage through the turn and into the lane, was asked in upper stretch for more,
responded accordingly and was never seriously threatened to the end while being kept to the task. EL SOBREVIVIENTE was four of five wide through the
turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path and chased the winner home while clearly second best. CHICKEN TRUCK was unhurried
while in the two path through the turn, angled into the seven path entering the lane and chased the top two from mid-track and settled for best of the rest. IN
THE ARCH was four wide through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a closing bid. STEAMBOAT WILLY was in the two path through
the turn then passed tired ones through the lane. IMTHEPRINCE chased the winner through the turn while in the two path then faded after entering the lane.
LEMME C UR VOUCHER chased the winner into the turn while in the three path then steadily faded. PASION AZTECA was along the inside through the
turn when in position and was empty turning into the lane. BAD NEWS was outrun while in the two or three path through the turn. TREE GENIUSES made
no impact while in the three path through the turn.

Footnotes
GOLDENPENCE gained a clear lead soon after the start, raced in the two path while maintaining a comfortable advantage, continued off the inside into the
lane, widened the lead with an eighth to go then was under a hand ride late while drifting out a couple of paths. GOOD GOOD trailed early then raced along
the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and was steadily gaining to the end while being guided into the five path. STEEL SHOT
was in the four path through the turn when in mid-pack, swung into the lane from the seven path and offered a mild rally. RUSHED chased the pace from
the two path through the turn and into the lane then lacked a closing response. POLO ART chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, had
aim on the top one into the lane and weakened. TWIN FARMS was along the inside and tired. RUNMALIBURUN never a factor while in the two path. EASY
DOER was never involved while racing in the two path.

KINZEA STONE set the pace on a clear lead into the far turn while racing in the two path, was challenged in late turn and into the lane, repelled that
challenger outside the eighth pole then held to the wire. RELMBUNKUS SYR moved into the far turn from the three path, continued with good momentum in
late turn, bid int the lane and loomed a serious threat then could not sustain the effort while keeping on well for the place spot. DRAW THE LINE chased the
winner into the lane, was asked for more into the lane and could not gain on the top one while keeping on well. MAJESTIC MR. JONES stalked the winner
while entering the far turn on the inside then was no longer a factor after mid-turn.

Footnotes
PABLO'S MINX raced in the four path through the turn when never far back, swung four wide into the lane, gained more momentum when straightening,
caught the leader near the eighth pole and cleared. GLORIOUS TAPIZAR set the pace from the outset while dropping to the inside, raced into the lane from
the three path then could not hold off the winner while keeping on to save the place spot. WATERLOO SUNSET saved ground through the turn, cut the
corner into the lane and became a serious threat along the inside, continued with clear running into the final eighth and did not have more while saving the
show spot. OSPREY COURT was unrushed while off the inside, angled into mid-track for the drive and finished with good energy to just miss the show and
place spots. BOO'S GAL chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane then weakened in the drive. IZZY B was two wide and
between rivals through the turn when well placed then lacked a response. TETON THAI was in the three path through the turn and never was a factor.
SLOVAK made little impact while in the three path through the turn.
