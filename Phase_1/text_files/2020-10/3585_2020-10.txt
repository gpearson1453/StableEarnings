Footnotes
FORT LEWIS RIVERS broke well and assumed command outside of rival on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, coaxed late in the turn to maintain
lead, responded to urging and inched clear from rival late. MYSTIC GREY pressed inside of rival along the backstretch, maintained position into the turn and
into the stretch, responded and battled gamely to the wire while giving way late. IRISH JACK bumped by rivals at the start, found a stalking position along
the inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, launched bid late in the turn and kept to task to get up for third. EDDIE EAGLE tracked leaders
two wide on the backstretch, came in on rival at the three eighths pole causing rival to steady, came in again at the quarter pole causing another rival to
steady, kept to task in the stretch and edged late for third. MELCHIOR broke in and bumped rival at the start, crowded by rivals at the three eighths pole and
had to steady, lacked any bid thereafter after losing all position and momentumn. FANCY TERRACE chased leader along the inside on the backstretch, had
to steady at the quarter pole due to rival drifting in and lacked any response thereafter. STEWARDS INQUIRY, THERE WAS AN INQUIRY ON EDDIE
EAGLE FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE WHEN COMING AND AND CAUSING FANCY TERRACE TO STEADY OUT OF POSITION,
AFTER A BRIEF REVIEW IT WAS RULED THAT EDDIE EAGLE BE DISQUALIFED AND PLACED BEHIND FANCY TERRACE

Footnotes
CHROMES LIL SIS quickly opened up a wide margin on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, lost some of the margin on the turn but still clear or
rival entering the stretch, responded to urging and held sway in the stretch. THICK SMOKE tracked lone leader on the backstretch two wide, made up
ground on rival on the turn and into the stretch, responded to urging but lacked needed extra punch late. DERBY LADY stalked lone leader along the inside,
stayed along the inside on the turn and eased out into the stretch and finished well clear of next rival. ROBBERYINPROGRESS tracked leader along the
inside on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside and lacked needed response in the lane to prove a threat. MY BELLA CHICK off very slow and far
off the pace on backstretch, passed rival entering turn and showed some late run in the stretch. MY BELLA GRAY off slow and far back early, lacked any
response and never threatened throughout.
