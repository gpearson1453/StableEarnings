Footnotes
TIZ THE STANDARD was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then was full of run but caught behind SPICEY N HAPPY and had no room
from the three sixteenths to the furlong pole, rallied between rivals and closed steadily to win going away. CROOKHAVEN LASS was sent for speed, set the
pace from the rail to the stretch, responded when challenged in mid stretch then could not stall the winner but gamely saved second. FOXY CARMELA
pressed CROOKHAVEN LASS two wide to the stretch, pushed up to get on terms in mid stretch then was outfinished for the win and missed second.
KENNA IS SPICY chased the leaders two wide to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then did not offer the needed late response. CAIRO KISS
also was chasing the pace, offered a bid three wide to get on terms into the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then tired. SPICEY N HAPPY tracked the pace
two wide to the stretch, was also a factor to mid stretch then weakened. SWEET RYAN had no speed, was two wide on the turn and not a threat. PERFECT
MOOD got outrun to the turn, came three wide to the stretch then weakened. SPIRIT LAKE had no speed, raced four wide to the stretch but failed to
menace in the drive. WEST CORK LASS trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RISEN LADY was rank to the first turn, pressed the leader to the half, pushed up to engage for the lead on the second turn, pushed away to mid stretch and
was clear under steady urging. LADY OF THE HOUSE stalked the leaders to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch
then finished willingly for the place. LA REINE'S LEGACY set the pace to the backstretch, ducked inward leaving the five eighths, was corrected then saved
ground to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and tired. BIG CHICK had no speed, settled to the second turn, shifted off the rail to the stretch then
showed a bit of interest but did not threaten. SHE'S A LIL FLIRT settled mid pack for a half mile, was outrun on the second turn then also was gaining
ground belatedly. COLD BREW KELLY had no speed, also was settled to the second turn, came three then four wide to the stretch but did not threaten in
the drive. SANDY SUNSHINE saved ground to the backstretch, settled to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch and did not rally. EMBODIED was
chasing the leaders for a half mile then was outrun on the second turn and weakened. The half mile split was 0.51.91.

Footnotes
JAZZ STREET had the best speed, set the pace in the two path to the stretch then responded determinedly to hold. RUN HEAT was rank in the early stages
and hard to place, pressed the winner three wide to the stretch then could not impact that one while saving the place. NORTH CROSS chased the top two
to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but could not threaten late. WONDER OF AUTISM was also chasing the pace from the rail to the stretch and lacked
the needed late response. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE got outsprinted early, came three wide to the stretch and did not rally. SOUTHEAST ASIA had no speed,
raced two deep on the turn and finished evenly. HAWK'S RISING had no speed and was not a factor. GOT TOBE AWESOME was always outrun.

Footnotes
CARTOONIST was on the pace from the outset, saved ground to the stretch, dug in bravely through a long drive and prevailed gamely. WHOA BUDDY
attended the pace outside the winner, responded in the stretch, was on terms at the sixteenth pole then was bested late. REGAL BORN chased the top two
three wide to the stretch but was outkicked and did not rally. PURE COMEDY had no speed, trailed from the rail to the stretch and did not threaten.
FOSTER BOI was chasing the leaders from the rail to the stretch then weakened. SIZZLING JAMIE had no speed and was never a threat.
