Footnotes
FLUFFY SOCKS , patiently rated, saved ground around both turns, remained along the rail in the stretch, found room inside INVINCIBLE GAL to take
command approaching the sixteenth pole then eagerly drew off. INVINCIBLE GAL (GB) disputed the pace with DOMAIN EXPERTISE, while racing along
the inner rail, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and faded late. TIC TIC TIC BOOM lacked speed behind horses, swung out leaving the far turn, angled to the six
path in mid stretch, moved up then hung late. ZEYARAAT , under some urging three wide leaving the far turn, encountered traffic in mid stretch, swung to
the six path approaching the sixteenth pole, raced on her left lead and gained late. GOLDEN VOICE , steadied about a furlong after the break, raced two
wide on both turns, angled out a bit in upper stretch then checked and brushed with LINE DANCING when caught in tight quarters in mid stretch. LINE
DANCING , three wide both turns stalking the pace, lacked the needed late effort and brushed with GOLDEN VOICE in mid stretch. DOMAIN EXPERTISE
disputed the pace two wide and gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
JULIET FOXTROT (GB) came away well then was angled out after about a furlong to prompt the pace, measured the leader into the far turn, went after that
one while still in hand past the three furlong pole, secured command with a quarter to go, kicked clear after being set down soon after, widened in mid
stretch then kept on under repeated left handed asking to prevail. VARENKA , off a bit slow after breaking outward, settled off the pace and outside a rival,
came under ride mid way on the final turn, swung five wide for the drive and closed gamely to gain. NO MO LADY , unhurried early while saving ground,
angled three wide in upper stretch, dropped back in towards the rail, was blocked behind a tiring rival, found room near the sixteenth marker and rallied.
SHE'SONTHEWARPATH , well placed tracking towards the rail, eased out three wide into the lane, made a bit of a run to have aim but flattened out.
STORM THE HILL bobbled at the break, recovered and moved up to be in range while off the rail early on, was under a solid ride four wide into the stretch
then faded. JABUTICABA cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by the winner exiting the far turn, fought on to the head of the lane then
succumbed.

hand urging. BRONX BEAUTY , three wide on the turn while chasing the pace, lacked the necessary rally and gained late. BYE BYE J saved ground around
the turn, raced along the inner rail in the stretch, angled to the two path near the sixteenth pole and finished willing. S W BRIAR ROSE , along the inner rail
entering the turn, angled out leaving the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and rallied mildly. LIZA STAR , two wide on the turn chasing the
winner, failed to keep up in the drive and steadied when shuffled back near the sixteenth pole. LAST TRUE LOVE , three deep entering the turn, failed to

Footnotes
EVIL LYN , five wide into the first turn, raced under a snug hold while about four wide outside rivals past the five eighths, quickly moved up and bid three
deep nearing the quarter pole, emerged in a duel outside CARAVEL past the three sixteenths, gained command a furlong out, kicked clear with about
seventy yards remaining then was fully extended to hold off VIGILANTES WAY. VIGILANTES WAY settled off the pace while saving ground, crept closer
past the five sixteenths, swung out from behind rivals and straightened to be about four wide in upper stretch, closed gamely on her left lead and was getting
to the winner. CARAVEL broke sharply, showed speed then steadied when taking back off the leader nearing the first turn, eased out and stalked, bid
between foes to gain a slim lead near the quarter pole, battled inside the winner past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. LUCKY JINGLE lacked
speed, came wide for the drive and closed steadily. SECRET TIME (GER) dropped in soon after the break, steadied near the three quarter pole, checked off
the heels of a tiring rival near the three eighths, recovered and advanced off the rail in upper stretch, shifted out and kept on with interest. YLIKEDIS , four
wide early, made a three wide into the lane then failed to seriously sustain. AMERICAN GIANT , three wide while in range, was under pressure pursuing
between foes into the stretch and faded. SHIMMERING (IRE) broke a step slow and failed to menace. HOLLYWOOD HOOPLA rushed clear into the first
turn, dropped in to set the pace, was joined mid way on the final turn, stayed willingly to the three sixteenths then tired. CHART , in range two wide, steadied
briefly near the three eighths and faltered. MADAM MACLEAN saved ground stalking the pace, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and tired.

FACTOR THIS cleared into the first turn and angled in to set a rated pace, responded when set down past the three sixteenths, turned away a threat in mid
stretch and widened late under a drive. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN had speed to the inside of the winner then checked hard entering the first turn, recovered
to stalk inside, angled out when advancing into the stretch, took aim on the leader, drifted in a bit near the furlong grounds, flattened out but was well clear
of the rest. HEMBREE settled off the rail, was under pressure four wide nearing the lane, moved up some past mid stretch but lacked a serious finish.
DOCTOR MOUNTY , off the pace and to the outside of a rival, angled five wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. TRUE VALOUR (IRE) stumbled at the
break, edged up into the first turn to gain a forward position, chased two to three wide into the lane and faded. O DIONYSUS , off the pace, saved ground
into the far turn but failed to respond. IRISH STRAIT prompted the pace outside the winner, was under a ride past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about the
three sixteenths then faltered.

Footnotes
LAKI , checked in tight quarters between horses leaving the backstretch, circled the turn four deep, closed steadily outside horses and got up late.
EASTERN BAY lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch and closed late outside rivals. NITROUS stalked the pace, raced three wide on the
turn, challenged for the lead between horses inside the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. KRSTO SKYE accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along
the rail, remained clear to mid stretch and weakened late. ADMIRAL LYNCH saved ground around the turn and failed to rally. LANDESKOG chased the
pace two wide around the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CATMAN came in at the break tightening rivals, prompted the pace two wide, moved to engage the leader after a half mile, dueled from the three eighths to
upper stretch, shook clear under a drive with a furlong to go then had just enough left to fend off WOOTTON ASSET (FR). WOOTTON ASSET (FR) broke
outward then was bumped and checked, regrouped and moved up early to stalk three wide, took closer order near the five sixteenths, gave hard chase into
the lane, kept grinding through the final furlong and had his surge just fall short. KIDNAPPED , fractious behind the starting gate, was forced in by the winner
at the break then was bumped and in tight, gathered himself then settled off the pace while saving ground, altered out for room near the three sixteenths
and rallied. PIVOTAL MISSION was jostled at the break, stalked the pace while saving ground, was under urging to hold position past the five sixteenths,
eased out, edged up between foes near the sixteenth marker then hung late. HIDDEN ENEMY (IRE) , forced in at the break, raced off the pace and outside
a rival near the half mile pole, was under pressure three wide into the lane but failed to generate a solid finish. NAUTILUS drifted in at the break, quickly
went clear and set the pace towards the inside, was joined after a half mile, dueled from the three eighths to the three sixteenths then gave in through the
last eighth.

Footnotes
DON JUAN KITTEN , three wide the first turn, moved up to gain a two wide lead near the half mile pole, opened up on the turn, was challenged approaching
the wire and got the good bob at the finish. BYE BYE MELVIN , five wide and eager to run entering the first turn, remained outside horses down the
backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, closed strongly, gained a slim lead approaching the wire and just missed in a game performance. RECONVENE
, bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, raced along the rail into the far turn, awaited room mid way on the bend, swung outside in upper stretch
and closed nicely. VANZZY , checked in traffic about a furlong after the break, raced four wide turning for home and rallied mildly. JOLTING JOE lacked
speed, swung to the five path turning for home, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. JACK THE UMPIRE bumped with RECONVENE leaving the
starting gate, raced in the four path on the far turn and failed to be a factor. ANDESITE , four wide the first turn, chased the pace two wide around the far
turn and gave way in mid stretch. SUNSATION bumped and forced out RECONVENE leaving the starting gate, steadied behind the leader on the first turn,
raced along the rail and was done on the far turn. CHOCOLATE BAR stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the far turn and weakened
entering the stretch. PARADISE PRIDE , wide the far turn, was outrun. MONDAY MORNING QB , a forward factor between horses for six furlongs, gave
way in the stretch. OCEANS MAP broke well, angled in early, set the pace along the rail, gave way on the far turn and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
MISS MARISSA prompted the pace outside MIZZEN BEAU, moved to engage that one into the far turn, dueled then gained a short lead while three wide
into the lane, opened up under a strong drive in mid stretch, kept on while shown the whip inside the sixteenth marker and prevailed. BONNY SOUTH broke
a bit awkwardly then was pinched back soon after, found herself well back in the opening stages, edged up while saving ground into the far turn, eased out
progressing mid way on the final turn, angled further out to be six wide into the stretch, leveled off under left handed encouragement, closed with a flourish
but just couldn't quite get up. HOPEFUL GROWTH , exchanged a bump with SO DARN HOT near the seven eighths, stalked inside, angled out past the five
sixteenths, came four wide to chase the leaders in upper stretch and continued willingly. MIZZEN BEAU sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was
hooked nearing the far turn, sparred into the lane, kept on willingly past mid stretch then faded. DREAM MARIE lost ground four wide, moved up under a
strong ride past the five sixteenths, gave hard pursuit into the lane and churned on. PROJECT WHISKEY saved ground, made a mild run nearing the
quarter pole but failed to sustain from there. SHARP STARR , bumped early and a bit rank while three deep nearing the seven furlong pole, chased off the
rail, stayed in range to about the quarter pole then gave way. TRUTH HURTS , off the pace, raced wide leaving the far turn and failed to respond.
PERFECT ALIBI , rank outside foes near the wire the first time, settled in mid pack past the five eighths, was under pressure five wide near the quarter pole
and gave way. SO DARN HOT bobbled at the break, bumped between runners nearing the first turn, failed to keep pace into the far turn and dropped back.

the inner rail on the far turn and lacked a rally. QUICK SAND AA , four deep the far turn, failed to rally. BELLFASTT , outrun, passed tired foes. KISSOUUR
was no factor. DANCE WITH ME BW briefly chased the pace. RB RICH LYKE ME chased the pace and gave way. IRIDESSE was outrun. LAZUR HESS
was not a factor. COLORS IN MOTION was outrun.
