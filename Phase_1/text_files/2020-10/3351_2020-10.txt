Footnotes
SUPER CHOCOLATE moved up quickly to press the pace, bid early turn, dueled, shook clear approaching the final 16th and held under a hand ride.
STORMY SUMMER forced the pace, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the turn, launched a determined stretch drive, gained steadily but missed.
BLONDE ATTITUDE broke outward and settled off the pace, closed along the rail late turn then finished gamely, but missed. ZYANZA forced the pace,
dropped back early turn, closed from two to four-wide from mid turn, drifted out a bit at the top of the stretch then rallied gamely from the outside. SUGATI
gained a short early lead, was engaged at the turn, dueled from the rail, yielded well into the final furlong and gave way. SNELL FLICKA was herded
outward leaving the gate, closed into the turn, was hustled four to three-wide then chased through the stretch.

Footnotes
ORAZIO was unhurried to the far turn then closed easily angling from two to four-wide, had command upper stretch and finished under light handling.
PERFECT REVENGE raced in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide through the far turn then bid upper stretch but was outkicked. EXECUTIVE
RETREAT stalked the pace, bid early on the far turn, drew clear quickly but was passed a furlong out, chased to the late stages and flattened out. GREEN
GROWTH, bumped at the start, pressed the pace, closed into the far turn, was no match for EXECUTIVE RETREAT at that point but kept on gamely to
deep stretch then evened out. THE NEWFIE EXPRESS, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn but failed to
menace. CASH ADVANCE stalked the pace, dropped back on the backstretch, was hustled from the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but lacked a
rally. HUNGARY broke inwards and bumped GREEN GROWTH, showed speed and set a reserved pace, was headed early on the far turn, chased to the
late stages and evened out.

Footnotes
DONT GET SMART forced the pace, took command early backstretch, set the pace, was pressured into the far turn, shook clear then widened in the stretch
and held sway under a hand ride. SING YOUR LIFE stalked the pace, was hustled from two-wide to the rail on the far turn, rallied in the stretch and was
gaining late. TOTALLY PERFECT stalked the pace, chased three-wide on the far turn then finished evenly. STORMY VISION settled in mid pack, closed
three and four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but offered no late response. FINE LADY settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail and
two-wide on the far turn then rallied mildly. SICK SOCIETY showed speed, was headed early on the backstretch, forced the pace into the turn then dropped
back and evened out in the stretch. PRESSURE FRONT settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but failed to menace.
CICIBONNE broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled on the far turn but lacked a rally. PETITE AMIE hesitated at the break then came out very
rank, trailed throughout, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
HITTERS PARK, in striking range, came through the turn along the rail and two-wide, chased into the stretch, took command in the final furlong and drove
clear. WESTERN TROUBLE bumped with PINK LEMONADE at the outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then rallied
gamely but was out kicked. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI forced the pace on the backstretch and turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined
drive. HE'S MEANT TO BE set a pressured pace, shook clear into the stretch, ducked in a bit a furlong out, was passed in the final 16th and gave way.
PINK LEMONADE exchanged bumps with WESTERN TROUBLE at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then evened out mid
stretch. SUMERIAN BELL, in range early, was hustled along the rail from mid pack on the turn then finished evenly. SENT FROM HEAVEN settled off the
pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch but was never contentious.
