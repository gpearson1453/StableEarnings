along the three path, eased out in the lane and finished well. TAX ME NAUGHT Tracked along the rail, altered out nearing the furlong marker for room,
asked, and then was in tight at the sixteenths pole and took up sharply. QUALITY STONES Set the pace along the two path, was hooked and faded.
CITIZEN MATZO Two path into the turn, four wide out of it and failed to threaten. A Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in no
change. Also a claim of foul was lodged by the rider of TAX ME NAUGHT against OUCH THAT HURT for interference at the sixteenths pole, was not
allowed. FRENCH CRULLER Took back at the start, two path on the turn, was outrun.
