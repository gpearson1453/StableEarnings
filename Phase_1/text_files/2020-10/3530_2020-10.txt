Footnotes
MIZZEN AIR set the pace from the outset, was off the rail into the lane then drew off down the lane under a brisk drive. SHEESA PONTIAC tracked the
pace early, was in the three path into the lane, no match for the winner in the stretch but was second best. FUN SUCKER came in at the start, chased the
pace early, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. WAR EAGLE'S LOVE stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane
and faded in the stretch drive. LUCKY BE A LADY chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and empty down the lane. LADY BLUE was
never a factor. REWARDED came out at the start and was through after a half. SHE WANTS MORE was bumped and bothered at the start then was
steadied off heels shortly after leaving the gate, was pulled up into the backstretch and walked off after the race.

ARTIE'S RUMOR leaned in and brushed the gate at the start, saved ground around both turns from midpack, advanced to be behind the leader in upper
stretch, tipped two wide to split the leaders at the furlong pole, surged through to forge an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and held on from outer rallying
foes. FIGHTING SEABEE was forwardly placed along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, shifted to the three path turning for
home, but found traffic behind foes in upper stretch while inside of HIGH PROMISE, brushed that foe while tipping out at the three sixteenths pole, then
produced a rally to bid inside the final furlong, but was outfinished by an inner foe and just missed. SILVER N LAI set a pressured pace along the inside, dug
in to hold an advantage in upper stretch, clung to it through midstrech, but was surpassed at the sixteenth pole, then just held show. BUNDIBUNAN was off
half of a step slowly and got bumped by an outer rival at the start, then saved ground far off of the pace into the far turn, swung to the six path exiting that
bend, and rallied belatedly to just miss show. BY YOUR SIDE advanced in the four to five path and outside of foes around the far turn, but leveled off after
getting outkicked in upper stretch. KAZIRANGA lied forwardly placed two wide, inched closer three wide turning for home to vie while hanging on his left
lead in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace between rivals at the furlong pole, and got outfinished for minor rewards. CURRENT was off a step slowly,
saved ground off of the pace, then two wide and between horses around the far turn but found traffic after shifting four wide turning for home, then chased
the leaders while failing to menace. STAGE READY threw his head at the start, trailed the field in the two path before swinging to the eight path turning for
home, but failed to factor. DUNE OF PILAT (FR) raced far off of the pace in the three to four path around the far turn, then in the six to seven path in upper
stretch, and never got involved. HIGH PROMISE tracked from midpack in the three to four path around the far turn, but was brushed by an inner foe while
getting outkicked passing the three sixteenths pole, and weakened thereafter. SABADOR (FR) prompted the pace two wide, then between horses around
the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. FLAP JACK vied between horses early on, but got rank between them into the first turn, stalked from the two
path thereafter, but failed to produce a bid before weakening in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GRAYSONSMACHO GAL quickly cleared, held a wide margin under her own power through the far turn, then widened her advantage under driving
pressure through upper stretch before being geared down approaching the sixteenth pole. LEMON CHILL saved ground off of the pace before shifting three
wide turning for home, then stayed on to prove second best without threatening the leader. MY BETS threw her head at the start and bumped with a foe
right after, then trailed the field around both turns, and passed tired foes in the final furlong. FLOWER HOUSE broke outwardly and was off poorly, then
raced off of the pace in the three path around both turns before coming into the lane in the four path, but failed to factor. SUGAR LOVE stalked two wide,
but weakened through the lane. KISS MORE stalked along the inside around the first turn, then from the three path around the far turn, forged place turning
for home, but stopped through the final furlong, and was eased while drifting outwards.

Footnotes
SILVER STATE lightly bumped an outer foe at the start, then tracked from midpack along the inside, inched closer under his own power turning for home
while shifting outwards, split the leaders four wide passing the quarter pole, quickly asserted command by kicking clear approaching the furlong pole, and
finished strong under vigorous hand urging to the wire. TRIDENT HIT trailed the field in the two to three path around the turn before swinging to the six path
turning for home, tipped out a path further outwards passing the three sixteenths pole, and rallied outside of foes to reach place in the late stages. UBER
KIRK raced far off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, and rallied through the lane, but was outfinished by
an outer foe for place. STAGE LEFT chased the pace three wide, took the turn in the five path while inching closer turning for home, but was outkicked by
an inner foe in upper stretch, kept on through the lane, but was outfinished by multiple foes for minor rewards. JULIUS dueled for the lead two wide while in
the three path, led turning for home, but was no match for an outer foe in upper stretch, and tired. BRANCO MARIA raced far off of the pace along the
inside, and passed tired without threatening. SANTOS DUMONT tracked from midpack two wide, advanced to striking range between horses into the turn,
tipped to the four path outside of the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened between horses after being outkicked by them in upper stretch.
ATONE saved ground close to the pace, produced a bid passing the quarter pole, but was quickly no match for an outer foe at the three sixteenths pole,
then weakened thereafter. BLACKBERRY WINE dueled for the lead inside of a rival while staying a path off of the rail, but gave way between horses
passing the quarter pole. CHASE TRACKER raced off of the pace three wide, but was done early. IADANZA stalked from the three path, but weakened in
the four path passing the three furlong pole, and wilted turning for home.

ETHICAL JUDGEMENT tracked from midpack, advanced to stalking position four wide into the far turn, then swept past the leaders on his own power
approaching the quarter pole, and drew off under driving pressure while hanging on his left lead. BURROW set the pace along the inside, but was headed
by the eventual winner turning for home, and was second best. FIGHTING FORCE stalked along the inside, tipped three wide turning for home, but chased
the leaders while proving no match for them, and held show. HARD RYE GUY raced off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, came into the lane
four wide, and failed to make an impact. TAMANRASSETT raced forwardly placed three wide, then between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep
pace with those rivals turning for home, and tired. WENTRU got rank into the first turn, pulled to prompt the pace two wide, but weakened between horses
into the far turn. AMERICAN TRYST broke outwards and was off a step slowly, then raced far off of the pace three wide and never got involved.
LOUISVILLE LEGEND trailed throughout, got outrun, then was eased through the lane and jogged across the wire.
