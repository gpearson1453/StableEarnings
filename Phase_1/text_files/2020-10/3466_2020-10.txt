GREAT ISLAND came out at the start, was bothered into the first turn, raced along the second flight down the backstretch and in the far turn, was in the four
path into lane, moved out for room once in the stretch, made a bid four wide from the three sixteenths pole to the eighth pole and edged clear in the final
stages. MORE THAN UNUSUAL stalked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid while three wide from the three-sixteenths pole to the
eighth pole and finished willingly in the late stages but no match for the winner. WOODFIN trailed to the stretch, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in
the stretch and was gaining in the late stages. HAT TIP was bumped at the start and bothered into the first turn, raced back along the backstretch, was in
the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch five wide but hung in the late stages. MORE GOOD TIMES was bumped at the start and raced back
early on, was in the five path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run. AUDREY'S TIME chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane
and flattened out late in the stretch drive. SUNSET PROMISE was bumped at the start, raced along the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the
stretch. DEVIOUS CHARM wandered into the first turn and bothered multiple foes, set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faltered in the stretch
run. I HEAR YOU tracked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, inched ahead near the eighth pole but was swallowed up in the final stages.
LEMON POPPER was done early. SIAMESE was never a threat. TURNSTONE was through early.

Footnotes
SENOR JOBIM stalked three wide outside of the vying leaders, inched forward turning for home to take aim on JESSUP in upper stretch as that foe dug in,
forged an advantage from that foe at the furlong pole, then drew off under driving pressure while shifting a bit outwards with his ears pricked. MISTER K
raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, came into the lane five wide and outside of rivals, then produced a mild grind through the lane
on his left lead, got up for place approaching the wire and was gaining on the leader despite needing correction as that foe drifted across his path. JESSUP
set the pace along the inside, dug in while shifting outwards in upper stretch, but was bested by the eventual winner passing the furlong pole, then got
outfinished by a rallying foe for place. BOX OF CHOCOLATES tracked the pace two wide and between horses, shifted four wide passing the quarter pole
but lacked a kick to produce a bid, and leveled off through the lane. COOL BOBBY chased the pace from along the inside, but failed to keep pace with the
leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane, but was outfinished for minor rewards. LONELY PRIVATE vied two wide around the
turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. YANKEE SEVEN trailed the field throughout while saving ground around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
THINKING stalked three wide, crept forward in hand around the turn to produce a confident bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, took over from her
inner foes passing that marker, then responded willingly to driving pressure in upper stretch, kicked clear, then held safely as THREE TIPSY CHIX managed
to narrow her margin late. THREE TIPSY CHIX lied forwardly placed two wide and between horses, eased back down the backstretch to rate in midpack
around the turn, then shifted to the six path turning for home, produced a rally through the lane with a good kick, but was second best. WILLFUL WOMAN
stalked along the inside in about the two path, shifted four wide at the five sixteenths pole as THINKING took over, inched closer to that foe turning for
home, but failed to keep pace with her at the quarter pole, then kept on after being surpassed by THREE TIPSY CHIX in the final furlong. DOTTIE raced off
of the pace three wide around the turn, and improved past tired foes in the final furlong to achieve fourth at the wire. WICKED BISOU advanced four and
outside of foes down the backstretch to a stalking position into the turn, but was floated five wide at the five sixteenths pole, then flattened out in upper
stretch. BEL FIORE was bumped mildly between horses at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, and improved in the lane to miss fourth. MINER'S
QUEEN prompted the pace setter two wide, but was no match for an outer foe turning for home, then weakened through the lane. CAUGHT LOOKING set
the pace along the inside, but was no match for the eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened in upper stretch. MIA AT MIDNIGHT steadied
mildly early on, then raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and was no factor. MISS DIAL was in bit tight of quarters early on, saved
ground far off of the pace, but was done early. RAINBOW BELLE was outrun, pulled up in the vicinity of the furlong pole but walked off.

Footnotes
SUGOI vied two wide into the first turn before clearing off from his inner counterpart into the backstretch, nursed a clear advantage down the backstretch,
clung to that margin in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire under driving pressure. TEMPLE tracked from midpack two wide, then from the four path
around the far turn, chased on his left lead in upper stretch without making much progress, but changed leads at the furlong pole, quickened willingly to
produce a late bid, but was fended off by the leader. BIZZEE CHANNEL set the pace into the first turn while inside of SUGOI, but allowed that foe to clear
off into the backstretch, stalked from the pocket thereafter, attempted to shift outside of the leader in upper stretch, but was hemmed in by RITZY A. P.,
failed to split those foes before shifting in at the furlong pole to commence a rail bid, but failed to make late headway and was outfinished for place.
APRECIADO stalked two to three wide around the turns, advanced to be in range of the leader in upper stretch TEMPLE rallied along side, but was
outkicked by that foe passing the furlong pole, then chased the leaders home. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME saved ground off of the pace into the far turn, then
tipped to the four path around that bend before staying on for a minor reward with a mild late kick. RITZY A. P. stalked along the inside before shifting two
wide into the backstretch, held vying position in upper stretch between horses, but gave way passing the furlong pole. CORELLI was off a bit slowly, raced
off of the pace three wide, then in the four to five path while being floated out by MIDNIGHT TEA TIME around the far turn, but failed to match staying
strides with that foe in midstretch, and was no menace. NET GAIN reared in the gate pre-race, then saved ground far off of the pace, but never got involved.
COUNTER OFFER raced far off of the pace along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, but failed to factor. HIERARCHY
trailed three wide around the far turn, and never got involved. TROUBLING MOON tracked from midpack along the inside, but failed to produce a bid before
weakening through the final furlong.

VENETIAN HARBOR set a pressured pace along the inside, shook free of those pressing foes and kicked clear at the quarter pole, then shifted out while
holding her margin through midstretch, then denied FINITE's late rail surge at the wire. FINITE tracked from off of the pace three wide, then two wide and
between horses around the turn, loomed in hand behind the leader turning for home, chased that rival through midstretch while advancing inside of a pair of
foes, then surged along the rail in the final sixteenth to produce a late bid, but was denied. GRAND CRU CLASSE prompted the pace three wide, got kept in
the four path around the turn by her inner counterpart, then chased the clear leader through the lane, and prevailed for show while making mild late
headway on the winner. REAGAN'S EDGE pressed the pace two wide and between horses, stayed in the three path around the turn, but failed to make
progress while chasing the leader between foes through the lane, then got outfinished by an inner and an outer foe for minor placings. TONALIST'S SHAPE
was off a step slowly and trailed the field while in the three to four path around the turn, came into the lane five wide, and stayed on without menacing.
SECONDARY MARKET tracked the leaders from off of the pace two wide and between horses, then far off of the pace along the inside around the turn
before shifting four wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. FOUR GRACES stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid, and weakened turning for
home. SECRET KEEPER stumbled at the start, then tracked from midpack four wide, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MONEY FOR MISCHIEF was jostled between horses and squeezed back at the start, trailed the field before rallying five wide around the far turn, bid
turning for home outside of foes, and held WHY WHY PAUL WHY at bay under driving pressure. WHY WHY PAUL WHY tracked from midpack along the
inside, rallied three wide around the far turn to bid between horses turning for home, dug in inside of MONEY FOR MISCHIEF in upper stretch, but failed to
regain even terms with that foe. QUARTERBACK DAK saved ground far off of the pace, then swung out and rallied stoutly three wide around the far turn,
but was stymied behind foes through upper stretch, found clear racing room approaching the furlong pole, then kept on for a minor reward. FAST
RECOVERY tracked from midpack three to two wide, inched closer in the four path around the far turn to bid for the lead between horses turning for home,
but flattened out in upper stretch. EL SUPREMO raced forwardly placed three wide, bid for the lead into the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. WIND
TWIST raced far off of the pace two wide, and passed tired foes without threatening. DRINK stalked two wide, bid for the lead inside of EL SUPREMO into
the far turn, then weakened in upper stretch. REVENIO stalked along the inside, but was shuffled back around the far turn behind the tiring early pace
setter. TIZ MCNAMARA raced off of the pace in the two path, and never got involved. CZECHMIGHT set the pace along the inside, but was headed into the
far turn, and wilted around that bend.
