MR CLASSICAL settled outside, bid wide on the final turn, led into the stretch and edged away under mild pressure. VERO SUN lacked speed, raced wide
throughout and closed well. TOWN JAK saved ground just off the leaders and gradually weakened in the stretch. GRAND OASIS dropped far behind then
passed fading rivals. WEST FORK hustled to a narrow lead inside, moved clear before the half and came up empty. DOOLEY chased wide and was
finished after half a mile. BOAT OVER THE HILL dropped far behind and was never in contention. OVERBOLD forced the pace outside for half a mile then
stopped abruptly.

DISCREETLY TOUGH broke slowly, moved up between foes, eased out through the stretch, took the lead deep stretch. OUR DIXIE BLUE set the pace just
off the rail, shook loose and was clear with a furlong to run but couldn't last. JUMPINTOACTION, two wide early, went between rivals on the turn, swung out
and gained. RUN FLORENCE RUN saved ground and failed to be a serious threat. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC broke slowly then failed to threaten. THREE
POTATOE FOUR was three wide and just off the pace then tired. RISQUE'S JEWEL saved ground disputing the pace then gave way. GLOSSY MADRINA
broke slowly then showed nothing. CORBALLY dueled for the early lead two wide then stopped.

ATINA SALSA, three wide dueling, relinquished the lead deep stretch but came back and got the nod. PROSPECTIVE BELLE, between dueling, stuck her
head in front deep stretch but couldn't hang on. DOUBLE THE BET saved ground and rallied too late. KAREN'S GEM raced wide and wasn't a serious
threat. RUMOR RIDGE vied for command inside and faded. SOLD ON SALSA ducked out leaving the gate, raced widest and was no factor.

Footnotes
ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR saved ground early, split foes and then was left with rail on the final turn, split rivals again near stretch, was bumped by DOCTOR
DOOM at the head of the stretch, was brushed and carried out through the stretch by that rival and got the decision. PRINCIPINO bore out on the first turn,
remained wide, drifted out through stretch and finished past the crown of the track. DOCTOR DOOM, outside, was gunned to the lead after a qurter mile,
bore out and bumped winner near stretch, continued to drift out when roused left handed and faded late. GO LIME raced outside, moved in near the stretch
and had no late kick. DEMOCRATIC NORMS saved ground and showed nothing. IMMINENT DANGER, two wide and just off pace, took up leaving half
mile marker then fell back. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN dueled for lead inside, stopped suddenly and was eased. THE STEWARDS LITE THE INQUIRY SIGN
AND THE RIDER OF PRINCIPINO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH BUT
THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CALL WIL settled outside the pacesetters, bid on the turn then edged away late in a steady drive. I GOT A ROCK dueled along the inside, led into the
stretch and continued gamely while steadying behind the winner late. STORM FACTOR urged close up in the two path, faded a bit on the turn then came
again for the show award. THEY SHOT SONNY dropped back outside, remained wide and lacked sufficient kick. AMBLIN MAN rushed inside, made a brief
bid on the turn then weakened in the stretch. STREET TAIL earned a narrow lead outside, dueled to the stretch and yielded. PSYCHIC ENERGY broke
sluggishly, was put to the whip early and never a factor. SARATOGA WILDCAT dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

IMPERIAL LADY was wide and just off pace, moved in near stretch but then went back outside, took the lead deep stretch and quickly drew off. WHAT
ABOUT TONIGHT was very wide, drifted wider through the stretch and gained place. GIRL POWDER saved ground early, moved out and lacked a rally. TO
THE FLAG saved ground, moved out through stretch but was too late. LA PURISSIMA was fanned in as the horses left the starting gate thirty one minutes
past scheduled post time, was quickly gunned to lead, widen in mid stretch then faltered. CONGRESSIONALSTORM raced wide and failed to be a serious
threat. ELISSAS SECRET came in leaving the gate then showed little. RISQUE EXPRESS, squeezed leaving the gate, was steered very wide and never
threatened. ENIGMATICA saved ground disputing the pace but then had nothing left. WOMAN FLYER was inside and just off the pace then gave way on
the turn. MISSES KNIGHT stalked from the five path then stopped.
