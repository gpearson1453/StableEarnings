Footnotes
EFFIEMEISTER skimmed the rail heading into the turn, moved two or three paths out with aim outside SEATTLE BAY at the top of the stretch, reached the
lead a sixteenth out and won going away. SEATTLE BAY took the early lead inside, shook off MY LITTLE ROSE and CAMELLIA GAL after three furlongs,
could not withstand the winner and was clearly second best. TENERIFE MOON was outsprinted early two wide, moved in rallying into the stretch, and
finished up evenly. CAMELLIA GAL bobbled at the start, chased outside the leaders three wide to the stretch, and weakened. MY LITTLE ROSE pressed
SEATTLE BAY from outside to the top of the lane, and gave way. STEPHANIE'S MELODY unseated the rider and ran off briefly prior to the start, was
apprehended and returned to the gate, steadied off CAMELLIA GAL a stride out, moved inside and could not reach contention.

Footnotes
MISS ITALY sprinted to the lead inside after the start, moved clear on the turn, stayed on her left lead through the stretch in the two-path, and had enough
to hang on. PRETTY RACHEL pursued the leaders three wide for a half-mile, finished determinedly and was gaining outside the winner. WORDS OF
ADVICE was never far back, lodged a bid outside MISS ITALY turning for home, but did not have enough and was outkicked for second. FACTS ONLY was
outrun to the stretch, gained ground into the final furlong, and lacked a clear path behind the leaders approaching the finish. SAMURAI FIGHTER broke
slowly and was outrun for a half-mile, and gained some ground belatedly without threatening. AUDREY broke out at the start, fanned four or five wide into
the lane, and posed no threat. MUSETTA was bothered outside STRUTTIN at the start, and never reached contention. STRUTTIN got pushed out by
AUDREY at the start, chased outside MISS ITALY into the turn, and gave way after a half-mile.

Footnotes
DRINKS ON ME pressed ZODIAC PRINCESS from outside early, poked a head in front after six furlongs, drew clear into the stretch and widened under
pressure. QUEEN OF CAUSE saved ground on the turns, rallied on the rail through the lane but could not seriously menace the top one. MARIES MELODY
raced forwardly from the start, shifted out slightly behind ZODIAC PRINCESS at the top of the stretch, and had no solid bid. ZODIAC PRINCESS set the
pace inside, lost the advantage to DRINKS ON ME on the far turn, and shifted out in front of MARIES MELODY past the three-sixteenths while weakening.
ELUSIVE RYDER steadied off MARIES MELODY three-sixteenths out, and made no headway. PASSION PLUS stayed in range for six furlongs, and tired.
SASSY MISS MARGIE trailed throughout and was eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
APACHE moved through between horses to join the leaders entering the turn, outdueled HARD ASTRAY around the turn, and drew off under a drive.
EXTRA DOUGH pressed the pace outside rivals from the start, battled outside APACHE around the turn, could not match strides into the lane, and was
much best of the rest. MAKINALEGACY hit the left side of the gate and was off slowly, began to advance after a half-mile, and rallied outside to go clear for
the show. SULTANNES CROWN raced four wide, passed tired horses and was never a factor. ALL STARR RUNNER was slow into stride, advanced inside
turning for home, but flattened out. ADIOS SEE YA contested the early pace inside several foes, and was through after a half-mile. PACHANGA PATROL
was outrun throughout. SMARTY J AND B was never close. MATCH RUNNER raced five to six wide around the turn, and made no impact. HARD ASTRAY
was finished early three wide. NATHAN'S SECRET showed early speed between horses, and faltered. ROMARIO showed speed to the turn three wide, and
had nothing left.

CURTIN'S UP dashed clear early, responded when challenged on the turn by CAPTAIN DUKE, and finished gamely on the rail to get the decision.
CAPTAIN DUKE pursued CURTIN'S UP from outside into the turn, bid five-sixteenths out, could not get past through the lane, and saved the place. BABY
BROTHER had aim outside the leaders throughout, and finished willingly. FRIENDLY FELLA raced three wide on the turn, and could not threaten.
AWESOME ENOUGH saved ground in range to the stretch, and lacked the needed rally. SHANGHAI LEVI was no factor. FELON broke awkwardly to the
left, and tired after a half-mile. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) saved ground to no avail. SEATBELT raced two wide on the turn, and made no impact.
WHISKEY BENT lunged at the start, and was never close.

AWESOME GERRY was a step slow to begin, moved up inside through the early going, came through an ample opening on the fence to take over from
CARSON CITY KID turning for home, and drew well clear. CARSON CITY KID vied in the two-path outside TIGER around the turn, could not hold off
AWESOME GERRY at the top of the stretch, and ran on best of the rest. TIGER pressed the pace outside CARSON CITY KID for a half-mile, and gave
way. PALADIO raced three wide around the turn, and had no rally. FITZ'S MO was always outrun. MR TINGLES steadied behind horses approaching the
turn, and tired.

Footnotes
TARA was never far back, challenged outside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL entering the turn, edged away at the head of the stretch, and stayed clear under a mild
drive. DON'T GET KHOZY hit the right side of the gate and was slow to begin, saved ground advancing after a half-mile, angled to the four-path into the
stretch, and rallied outside to go clear for the place. INDEPENDENT MISS raced three wide in striking distance to the stretch, and lacked the needed late
bid. MARKISTAN was outrun early, came five wide off the turn, and improved on the far outside for the last major share. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL vied outside
BION MAGIC early, briefly went clear into the turn but was soon hooked from outside by TARA, could not match strides with that rival by the top of the
stretch, and gave way on the rail. TIZ ENOUGH was a step slow at the start, raced four wide around the turn, and failed to menace. BION MAGIC dueled
inside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL early, and gave way into the turn. FAITH N HOPE dropped far back after a half, and jogged in.

Footnotes
CORY GAL put a length on the field with a sharp break, set the pace inside, shook off a bid from MY SARASOTA STAR leaving the quarter-pole, and
stayed in command on her left lead. MY SARASOTA STAR broke out bumping FUJAIRAH at the start, chased outside CORY GAL under an early hold,
challenged around the turn, was repelled into the stretch and ran on second best. MANE ATTRACTION saved ground around the turn and into the stretch,
and was just up for the show on the rail. NIKEE KAN broke in bumping FUJAIRAH, raced two wide closest to the leaders, and was outfinished for third.
FUJAIRAH got sandwiched between MY SARASOTA STAR and NIKEE KAN at the start, felt the whip early, and was outrun. STARSHIP NALA hit the left
side of the gate and bobbled at the start, and tired after a half-mile three wide. VINYARDNINA was put to pressure early inside, and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MONEY COME set the pace inside, got clear after a half-mile, and widened under a drive. JACK B WINKLE came through rallying between horses near the
quarter-pole, shifted out and was up outside for the place near the wire. SUNDOWN KID hit the left side of the gate and was off slowest, saved ground
advancing into upper stretch, and was nipped for the runner-up spot. CAPITAN FOFO raced two wide, stayed on his left lead in the stretch and was
outfinished between horses. HARD WEST loomed a threat three wide near the quarter-pole, but flattened out. THE SPIDER pressed the pace between
horses early, stayed on to upper stretch, and gave way. YES FOR LESS was no factor in the second flight throughout. DEERSLAYER was always outrun.
EXATLON felt the whip early, and could not gain late on the far outside. HE HAD A SECRET checked off heels behind JACK B WINKLE at the start, and
was never close. MALETTA stumbled at the start, pressed the early pace outside, and was finished on the turn. ACASEADAY retired early.
