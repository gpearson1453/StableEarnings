Footnotes
TRAUMARAMA tracked from second, rallied on the far turn in the three path to readily lead mid turn and drew off as best. MOMENTA KAT pulled inside to
track the leader, angled outside for room entering the far turn, moved up in the four path to chase the winner, but was no match. ABOGADA was last early,
on the move in the far turn, came widest into the stretch and gained. SOUR PEACH brushed a horse at the start, settled off the pace and was no threat.
SAMOA brushed a horse at the start, had a clear lead to the far turn and lacked a rally there.

Footnotes
STORMY PACIFIC ranged up on the turn, led at the top of the stretch, dueled a foe down the stretch and prevailed late. TOP CREDENTIALS prompted the
pace, led clear on the turn, lost the lead at the top of the stretch, fought back in a head to head duel and yielded late. RUSHED was bumped at the start,
pulled on the turn, picked off foes from the six path, chased close to the lead down the stretch and was edging closer at the wire while just missing the place
spot. TRIPLE DELIGHT bounced between foes at the start, pressed the pace, dropped off the pace on the turn and raced evenly in the stretch.
JENNYSREGALMAN was bumped at the start, prompted the early pace, dropped back on the turn and ran evenly from there. A BIT QUICK got to
contention mid stretch and flattened out. ST. RONANS bumped a foe at the start, angled outside on the backstretch and was no threat. NUMBERS NEVER
LIE was involved to the turn and faded.

Footnotes
HALF TRICK sat perfect to far turn, rallied into the stretch to go clear. SWING WEST tardy start, rushed between horses to lead, held well for place.
AGAINST THE LINE broke sharp with no speed to far turn, rallied strong late going. ALLGRIT up close from inside to far turn, no late kick and leveled off.
NEW YEAR'S LUCK raced evenly with no late response when called upon. BRODYTHEOXMAN raced along with no late interest turning for home inside.
STACK EM HIGH failed to menace. WANNAPLAYBIGCHIEF within striking distance to far turn, backed up readily. WHO'SYOURFAVORITE shuffled back
from the start, never a factor. IT'S GAME TIME saved ground with no response when needed. RANCHO BARGO stayed with pace to the half and backed
up badly from the turn.

WINE ME UP BABY led clear and was never threatened. MISS MAGDALENA lunged and bobbled at the start, gradually got closer, came five wide into the
stretch, chased and gained to pass foes in the stretch but was no match for the winner and second best. PASSIONATE HEART tracked from second and
evened out in the final furlong to settle for show. JANE'S GOLD TOUR had no rally on the turn and held position down the stretch. ULTRA CORDIAL had no
response to urging on the turn and came wide into the stretch. SUMMER WAR was involved to the turn but empty in the stretch. INCA ANGEL was no

Footnotes
CAROLINA AIRNESS broke flatfooted, regrouped to advance and run up rail to the lead, galloped along with no pressure from the turn to the wire in
impressive fashion, went well clear. AMIGO MIKE good speed to the front, quickly overtaken by the winner while proving no match and bested the rest.
REAGANIZE off rail to turn, rallied outside for the show spot while never a threat to the top pair. HOLY BOLY raced evenly with no late gain from the quarter
pole. KALAMA broke slow from outside and never reached contention. CINCINN never a menace. SCOTCH chased the pace to quarter pole and gave in
readily through the stretch run. NIT PICK good position to quarter pole but backed up from there. ENGLISH TOFFE ROSE always outrun. WARRIOR
SPIRIT broke sharp outside with a steady fade quickly to the turn. BIG BAD SHACK broke slow and never menaced throughout.
