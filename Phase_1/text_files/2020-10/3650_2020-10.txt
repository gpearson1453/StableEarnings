Footnotes
DEBONNAIRE DUDE tracked the pace between horses, put WILD HERCULES in a bit tight as he rallied between horses near the half mile mark, bid inside
of NORTHERN THRILL into the turn, led at the seven sixteenths and carried a narrow lead through the far turn, took command in the lane and held sway.
IZZY IN A TIZZY was hard to settle between horses early, raced at the inside of the chasing flight, steadied slightly and lost position near the half mile mark
after being put in a little tight by WILD HERCULES, was pushed along and taken off the inside near the seven sixteenths, rallied, but proved no match for
DEBONNAIRE DUDE in the lane. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE was lightly bumped by WILD HERCULES in the opening strides, chased between horses, was
pushed along between horses into the far turn, saved ground through that bend, was put in tight in upper stretch as DANCINGINTODARK dropped inside
just in front of him, altered three wide, rallied under a drive and proved best of the rest. DANCINGINTODARK chased three wide early, was keen five wide
down the backstretch, dropped in to chase the leading pair in the two path on the far turn, put CAPTAIN CARNEGIE in tight in upper stretch, when dropping
toward the rail, chased on inside but was outfinished for show. OFF TO THE BEACH settled at the rear, rallied two to three wide on the far turn, was taken
six wide into the lane, and kept on mildly outside. BERACUDA HEART tracked three wide, inched forward to attend the pace outside of NORTHERN
THRILL past the five eighths, continued three wide in the leading flight on the turn, wad driven three wide in upper stretch, and flattened. NORTHERN
THRILL was pushed to the lead, took token pressure past the five eighths, lost the lead to DEBONNAIRE DUDE inside of him near the seven sixteenths,
kept on between horses in the leading flight through most of the far turn but emptied out at the five sixteenths. BE YOUR OWN HERO was in tight into the
first turn, continued to race rank in second last into the backstretch, was hard urged past the half but came up empty. WILD HERCULES broke inward,
tracked the pace inside, was put in a little tight near the half as DEBONNAIRE DUDE rallied between horses, stopped, and was not persevered with in the
lane. THE RIDER OF IZZY IN A TIZZY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DEBONNAIRE DUDE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF
MILE MARK. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
GET NONE broke readily to gain terms with the leaders attending the pace between rivals on her own courage racing into the bend, edged forward nearing
upper stretch and maintained the advantage to the end under some right handed pressure. HEY HEY angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight
racing to the turn, shifted out three deep in upper stretch and advanced between foes to prevail for the place honors. TINDERELLA settled last while angling
to the rail in the opening quarter, swung out six wide entering the lane and found her best stride late to close the gap on the top pair. TAYLOR'S BEAUTY, in
touch three wide prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. FORT MARSH broke inwards bumping WHO'S THE
DIVA NOW, was righted to track off the first flight four wide in the opening stages while pulling against restraint drifting out on the turn, then continued
evenly between foes in that path five wide to late stages. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the lane, gave
way leaving midstretch. SHE'S NO DRAMA broke outwards brushing TINDERELLA, was righted to track off the first flight between foes racing to the turn
but faded early. WHO'S THE DIVA NOW, bumped at the start, shifted inwards clipping heels just after the break, was settled off the second flight while
angling to the inside racing into the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
FORT RIDGE chased inside through the first turn, pulled at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, continued to track the pace in the two to
three path on the far turn, cruised to the lead inside of ZANFORCE and STORMINSIDE when given his head into the lane, and drew off without being
asked. ZANFORCE tracked the pace between horses bid outside of STORMINSIDE past the seven sixteenths, pressed outside that foe in the four path
around that turn, was no match for FORT RIDGE past the quarter, but chased on best of the rest. BOXER BOY tracked three wide, began to lose ground in
the five to six path on the far turn, chased on mildly in the lane and regained third position late. STORMINSIDE was keen to the lead, inched clear into the
backstretch, set a pressured paced in the three path on the second turn as ZANFORCE gave him pressure, could not match FORT RIDGE as he bid inside
near the quarter, and weakened in the final sixteenth. MUSIAL broke slowly, hit the gate on the way out, floated four wide at the rear on the first turn,
continued at the outside of the rear flight for the backstretch run, raced in the seven path on the far turn, and passed tired horses in the lane. BEHIND
ENEMY LINES settled toward the rear, was driven between horses in the four path on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally. SATURDAYS HANGOVER
settled between horses into the first turn, continued inside of MUSIAL in the rear flight down the backstretch, raced at the inside of the rear group around the
far turn, and offered no bid. PISTOL BOX raced three wide near the rear on the first turn, continued two wide down the backstretch, raced in the six path

Footnotes
GIVEITSOMEWELLIE angled to the rail in early stages while being firmly rated off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted a bit off the inside on
the far turn briefly awaiting an opening, was guided back to the rail racing into upper stretch, came through inside the leader to wrest command leaving
midstretch and went clear under firm handling. STACK SHACK, urged to dictate the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage racing to the backstretch,
shifted out racing into upper stretch and gamely turned back a rival's challenge to prevail for the place honors while failing to contain the winner.
SOMTHINGSCANDALOUS, forwardly placed inside foes tracking just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, shifted out to bid between foes racing into
upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. MELISSANI settled outside foes in the opening stages, raced off the second flight racing to the far turn,
shifted out three deep to split foes nearing midstretch and continued with interest to gain position to the end. IRISH HALO tracked just off the second flight
outside foes to the far turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with a mild bid. SEVEN SEVENTEEN settled between foes in the opening
stages, split rivals just off the inside racing into the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. WILDWOOD MAGGIE was rated
outside foes just off the first flight, angled to the inside after a half, saved ground to the lane but lacked a closing response. HOOK HER UP settled along the
inside in the opening half, then angled seven wide nearing midstretch while proving no threat. RISKY RISKY RISKY tracked off the second flight between
foes to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. HERECITYKITTY tracked off the first flight between foes in early stages, shifted out four wide nearing the
lane making brief progress but emptied out in upper stretch. POLAR'S GRACE settled between foes in the opening half, then angled six wide racing through
the lane but proved no threat. U. S. CURRENCY, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, lodged a brief bid three deep between
foes nearing the lane but quickly came up empty.

MEMORY BANK, unhurried while angling to the inside tracking off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch to advance four
wide between foes, altered course when caught in tight quarters in upper stretch to bid five deep between foes in the closing stages and wrested the
advantage in time under right handed encouragement. BATTLE CREEK angled to the rail tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, shifted a
bit off the rail nearing upper stretch, came through close quarters splitting rivals three deep leaving midstretch to challenge for command, couldn't contain
the winner but held a rival narrowly for the place honors. AND WON, carried wide avoiding some traffic racing into the first turn, settled well off the second
flight to the backstretch, gathered momentum outside foes racing into the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and continued willingly to finish on
terms with the top pair. DOMIKATE, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to improve
position. HAMAZING VISION settled last to the far turn, shifted out racing into the lane and made some belated progress four wide between foes. THE
GREEN MO'STER tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half and continued evenly between foes to late stages. GLACKEN'S GHOST, in
touch with the pacesetter between rivals prompting the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into
upper stretch but faltered leaving midstretch. HONEST TO GOODNESS, pulling between foes in early stages while shifting momentarily into the path of
AND WON, switched outside foes racing to the backstretch, advanced with a sharp move to bid four wide racing into upper stretch but flattened out in the
last furlong. FULL OF RUN broke slowly, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. A P IS LOOSE, urged four
wide, then three deep into the first turn prompting the pace, continued to press the issue to the far turn and gave way into the lane. WAR CHEST, caught in
close quarters three deep between foes, then held up off the first flight racing into the first turn, tracked off the first flight between foes to the far turn, but
came up empty while being taken up avoiding tight quarters racing into the lane. CANDY PRINCE, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals from the outset to
the far turn, gave way abruptly racing into upper stretch.

SPLASH FOR GOLD tracked the pace down the backstretch, advanced to press outside of RED WHITE AND LOUD in the five path on the turn, was floated
six wide into the lane by the pacesetter, kept on unrelentingly under a drive despite being carried further out and wrested the lead in the final strides. RED
WHITE AND LOUD cleared to the lead, was pressed by SPLASH FOR GOLD while setting the pace in the four path on the turn, floated five wide to upper
stretch, continued to drift further out despite right handed urging, kept on but lost the lead in the final strides. LEMON BLITZ chased well off the inside early,
continued midpack in the three to four path on the the turn, was taken out and driven seven wide in upper stretch, and kept on mildly for show. FORT
RAMSEY tracked the leading pair outside of DANCIN NICKY, remained in range while driven in the five path on the turn, proved no match four wide in the
lane, and lost the show approaching the sixteenth mark. COOL AMBITION settled near the rear outside of OFFLEE FUN, was pushed along in the four path
on the turn and briefly bid three wide near the five sixteenths, but couldn't sustain a rally three wide in the lane. OUR THOMAS settled at the rear, raced in
the four path on the turn, lacked the needed rally but passed a pair of tiring horses late. OFFLEE FUN settled near the rear, raced in the three path between
horses on the turn, had no rally inside in upper stretch, and drifted out a few paths late. DANCIN NICKY tracked the leading pair, began to weaken in the
two path on the turn and came up empty inside in the lane.

Footnotes
WHITE LIES was prompted to gain a forward placing between foes in the opening quarter, angled to the inside conceding some position tracking just off the
pacesetter racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong marker and produced a solid late response to wrest the
advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement. PRANCIPANTS broke sharply to gain a narrow advantage outside foes dictating the pace in the
three path through the backstretch, angled in racing into the turn while moving away to a clear advantage, held sway past midstretch but couldn't fend off
the winner. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN settled last while angling inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out splitting foes leaving the midway point of the
turn, angled three deep racing past midstretch and continued with interest to gain a share. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE, prompted to a forward placing along
the rail in the opening stages, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the bend and steadily faded into the stretch. PALAGO was settled
inside foes in early stages, switched out after the opening quarter, was fanned five wide racing into the lane to gain some position but made no real impact.
HOT PEPPER SUZIE ducked out at the start, was collected, then pulled his between foes tracking just off the leaders into the turn, shifted four wide racing
into upper stretch and came up empty in late stages. TAP'S LULLABY tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening quarter, was prompted to lodge
a brief bid three deep nearing upper stretch but quickly flattened out.

Footnotes
RIPE ATTACK, off a step behind the leaders, responded to sprint clear of the field while angling to the inside after the opening three sixteenths, set the pace
on a clear margin into upper stretch and was kept to pressure. TWO PAIR broke slowly, was urged to gain position inside foes just off the second flight
racing into the turn, shifted out three deep racing through the lane and proved best of the others. GONZO settled between foes in the last flight racing into
the turn, split foes racing into upper stretch, then angled to the five path in the last furlong while finding his best stride late. STUMP, urged to forward placing
three deep between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, continued in that path into the lane but had no final kick. BUDDY BUD, pulling between foes
against firm rating in early stages, split foes just off the inside racing into the stretch to gain some position in a belated effort. PEACOCK MAN, urged along
the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way in the drive. UNCLE NEARIS tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening quarter,
angled to the inside on the turn and faded in the drive. MY CURBY tracked off the second flight three deep between foes and steadily faded into the lane.
TRE LEE DIVINE, urged to brief contention four wide in second flight, emptied out early. TIMINGISEVERYTHING dropped out last early and failed to
menace thereafter. PETEIZUM shifted out well wide racing into the turn and proved no threat. EXPECT ELPRADA brushed the gate while breaking a bit
awkwardly and dropped out early.
