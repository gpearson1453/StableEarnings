hand ride. HEEHAA, in range, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but was outkicked. SUMMER LOAD was herded inward at the

narrow lead into the stretch but was passed a 16th out and lost positions late. ROYAL BOURBON, in range, rode the rail on the turn, chased in the stretch
but needed more room along the fence then rallied fast when he got it. MUSIC TRIBUTE showed early speed, forced the duelers into the turn, kept after the
leader in the stretch but was in traffic in the late stages. DANCING ZAZINGA broke inward and was steadied, settled off the pace, came two and three-wide
through the turn then closed with some interest in the stretch. FORGOTTEN TREASURE was steadied mid backstretch and settled off the pace, was
hustled three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. ROYAL FANFARE broke inward, moved up the rail to force the pace, bid into the turn, battled,

CANADIAN PHAROAH stalked the pacesetter, closed on the far turn then angled late out two to four-wide, bid a furlong out and drew clear. VIATURE raced
in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn then rallied gamely. IRVING pressed then forced the pace, bid midway of the far turn, dueled, led at the
top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and chased to the end. GRAZELY broke outward and bumped UNION APPRECIATION, stalked the pace,
was hustled four and five-wide on the far turn then tendered a mild rally. DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES, bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled
from the rail on the turn then finished evenly. UNION APPRECIATION, bumped at the outset, raced in mid pack, chased three-wide on the far turn but
lacked a closing response. BLUE SNOW broke outward and bumped DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES, set a pressured pace, dueled from midway of the far turn
but gave way at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. OWEN'S SOUPER MOON settled off the pace, closed angling from two to five-wide through the far
turn, chased into the stretch but evened out late. BIG TIME GIZMO stalked the pace, was hustled three to five-wide on the far turn then dropped back at the

Footnotes
THEREGOESJOJO bobbled leaving the gate, pressed the pace, forced the issue on the far turn, took command at the top of the stretch and held sway
under a drive. PEACE SEEKER stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely. ENGLISH
ILLUSION settled in mid pack, chased hard angling from the rail to three-wide on the final turn then kept the rally going through the stretch. ENGLISH
CLASSIC set the pace, was pressured on the backstretch and was engaged mid turn, dueled, then yielded at the top of the stretch but gave way only
grudgingly through the final stages. INSIDER TRADING was away slowly and off the pace, saved ground throughout but flattened out in the final furlong.
ARTISTICO was off slowly and settled in mid pack, closed on the backstretch and stalked two to four-wide through the far turn but lacked a response in the
stretch.

led upper stretch, was passed a 16th out and chased to the end. NIGHT WATCHMAN stalked the pace, forced the issue two and three-wide on the turn,
chased in the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. FLORIDA WON raced in mid pack early, stalked from the rail on the turn then finished evenly through
the stretch. FRANKIE BARONE settled in mid pack, came three and four-wide through the turn then failed to menace. KING AND HIS COURT settled off
the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn but offered no response in the stretch. OTHER THINGS EQUAL dueled two-wide, gave way at the top of the
stretch, ducked in a bit and was through. FIRST SPRING showed early speed, was joined by duelers and dropped back at the turn, stalked three and
