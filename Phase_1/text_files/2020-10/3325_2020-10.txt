Footnotes
SAVAGERY came away a bit awkwardly but took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and
steadily handled to hold on well. DEDICATED settled off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, started a
bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through later yards for second. MEILLEUR dropped well off the pace while
saving ground the opening turn then started an outside bid into the backstretch, steadily improved and raced three wide the far turn and was along for third
later yards. SCHLOSSER settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride later yards.
ONCE MORE EH rounded the first turn about the three path and raced outside into the backstretch, angled back to the inside through the backstretch,
raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. STEPS TO GLORY raced well back off the rail. BEARCAT KITTEN settled off the pace and off the
rail then faded past the seven sixteenths pole. BOLT rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then
faded approaching the far turn.

SHE GIVES ME FITS rated the pace inside and rounded the far turn at the rail, then widened down the lane to win handily. CANDYFORACAUSE saved
ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths and rounded the far turn at the rail, eased slightly outward into the lane and held on well for second.
COMPLETE SURPRISE settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn four wide then raced evenly to late stretch before
flattening stride. MABEL steadied near the rail into the first turn and saved ground, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the
rail but flattened stride the final furlong. DEVILISH BEAUTY raced off the pace about the three path then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn three wide, though, showed little further. UNA BUENA MAMACITA stalked the pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase
approaching the three eighths pole then faded in the three path of the far turn.

NAZCA MYSTERY took the lead at the three quarter pole and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn at the rail and dug in under steady encouragement to just last. LET'S GET PHYSICAL settled off the pace in the two and three paths then bid toward
the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dug in near the rail through the stretch and just missed. RUM RUNNER RED saved ground well
off the pace the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced five wide on the far turn then finished well to duel for third later yards. BOP MARLEY
settled off the early pace about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close still in the four path of the far turn, but was outfinished for
third later yards. SLEW THE TURN raced off the pace inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the three path, angled to the
five path leaving the turn and finished evenly. LUCKY PENGUIN stalked the pace from the two and three paths then challenged toward the three eighths
pole, but dropped back at the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened. WISH IN THE CASTLE raced well off the pace and showed
little response through the backstretch. BE BE BOP saved ground racing well back and showed little response from the three eighths pole.
I'MOVERTHEMOON rated close to the pace inside the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on
the far turn.

Footnotes
DIXIE'S CROSSING stalked the earlier pace from the three and four paths, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead approaching the
five sixteenths pole, contested the edge in the three path on the far turn, had her heels clipped by Lil Mr Matt midway on the turn, but, drifted a bit into the
lane and dug in under steady handling to hold on well. PROVIDENCE R V F stalked the pace off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then
eased to the four path nearing the head of the lane, dueled for second through the final sixteenth but couldn't improve on the winner. CASTLE ONE saved
ground racing well back the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, eased outward then checked and angled further outward to avoid a fallen rival
midway through the far turn, entered the stretch about the six path and finished evenly outside. BRO LATTE saved ground off the pace the opening turn
then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. W V ROCKET MAN rated a
short lead inside, came under pressure into the backstretch and was caught approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled close nearest the rail on the far
turn but dropped back into the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. BRILLIANT IDEAS rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled off the
pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, started to fade in the three path of the far turn and leapt a fallen rival midway
through the turn. BRUTUS BRAE steadied while in tight into the first turn and raced toward the outside leaving the turn, gave chase through the backstretch,
appeared to not be a factor and was checked midway on the far turn. STERLING CANYON raced well off the pace in the three and four paths, left the first
turn toward the outside and showed little response. DEPUTY BEE drifted to the seven path into the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, bid
nearing the three eighths pole but faded while bearing outward on the far turn. LIL MR MATT raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid nearing
the three eighths pole and raced close in the three path on the far turn, but ran up on, and clipped the heels of Dixie's Crossing, and fell, though got up and
walked off afterward. The Stewards posted the inquiry and reviewed a claim of foul against Dixie's Crossing, by the rider of Lil Mr Matt, though found no foul.
