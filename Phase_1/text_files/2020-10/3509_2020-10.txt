MITCH AND JOHN E was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and was ridden out to the wire. EMILY'S
GOLD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on to save the place.

STANDING was forwardly placed from the inside and stayed on well in the drive to finish willingly. DUDLEY STUDLEY broke sharply to press the pace from

ALWAYS WORKING was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and held off the
closing VICENTE'S SHADOW to prevail. VICENTE'S SHADOW was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and finished with good late energy. TUMAC MOUNTAIN settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out
nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with late interest. CODE CHARLIE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, was in complete
control through mid-stretch and tired through the final sixteenth. PAMPER ME NOW broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way

DONTKISSNTELL was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, forged to the front with a sixteenth to run and
quickly drew off. FOR YOU ONLY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged nearing the quarter, vied
but could not match strides with the winner through the final sixteenth. PADDY'S SECRET showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and
finished with a late bid. WINDY POINT pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage FOR YOU ONLY nearing the quarter, gave way, was
eased and vanned off. DIAMONDS R was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. FORTUNE'S FREUDE
pressed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and weakened.

CLASSIC LEAH sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the
winner late. CONSTANT CRAVING lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid.
LOOKOUT TAYLOR lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a late bid. LITTLE
DANCER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. CHEROKEE LOUISE chased the leaders while racing
