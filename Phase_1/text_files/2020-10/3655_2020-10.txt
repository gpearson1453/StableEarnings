EL MARRO set the early pace, repulsed a bid in mid stretch, drew clear late under left handed urging. POWERS OUT had good position early, rallied at the
quarter pole and drew even, dueled through the stretch, was outfinished late but held place. RIDGE WEST contended throughout and finished willingly in a
good effort. JEDI TEMPLE had good position throughout and went evenly. MUSTANG WILLIE raced wide and was no threat. CANDY'S REVENGE raced
mid pack and was no menace. PRIMARY APPEAL was no factor. BUCKEYE KITTEN broke slowly, rushed up down the backside on the rail and tired in the
lane. OUR PETITION was outrun.

veered in, dueled for the lead along the inside, drifted out when struck with a left handed whip near the sixteenth pole bumping UPTOWN and gamely
gained second. UPTOWN went up to battle for the lead two wide before a half, drifted in slight nearing the sixteenth pole, was bumped by the runner up
then outfinished despite a determined effort. BRIG well placed, lacked the needed response. HISTORICALLY trailed. THE RIDER OF UPTOWN LODGED

ALEXANDRIA with the second flight two wide, rallied to make the lead at the top of the stretch, dropped to the rail, shook clear under left handed urging and
won as much the best under a strong hand ride. SHEZ SHACKED UP away alertly, set the pace near the inside into the stretch, the rider lost his whip past
the quarter pole, altered course outside the winner past the furlong marker and finished second best. BALLROOM BLITZ was in tight entering the clubhouse
turn, always within striking distance, angled inside the runner up a furlong out and finished with good courage. LEMON DEELITE failed to menace. HAPPY
AS YOU GO with the second flight inside, weakened in the stretch. GONNABEGOOD was no threat. SOMUCHSUGAR was never involved, stopped on the
far turn and jogged to the wire.

CHIEF RANDEL unhurried early, closed swiftly in the five path through the stretch and was along in time. MO DONT NO settled mid pack, rallied late in the
six path and got up for second. BUCKEYE BULLET was bumped at the start, dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, drifted to the three path,
shook clear before the furlong marker, remained in charge until deep stretch then was outfinished. GOING WITH STYLE unhurried early, finished with good
courage in the seven path. MIDNITE THUNDER stalked the pace into the turn, loomed boldly three wide midway on the turn, had speed into the stretch then
came up empty. DIAMOND DUST dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch then weakened. DIRECT DECEIT saved ground to no avail. BLACK LIGHT
stumbled out of the gate bumping BUCKEYE BULLET at the start then was outrun. ALTISSIMO had speed into the turn then wilted. CANDY EXCHANGE
had brief speed. PRIVATE DRIVE was always outrun.

DRILLIT trailed for a half, circled her field on the far turn and through upper stretch, made the lead past the furlong marker and surged clear late under right
handed urging. MOONLIT MISSION unhurried early, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and finished second best. CIRCUS RINGS never far back,
rallied four wide on the far turn, made the lead in upper stretch then was outfinished. STAR MABEE chased the pace two wide into the far turn, drifted in
near the five sixteenths pole, had speed into the stretch along the inside then faded late. MARKET SUCCESS was no factor. REAL FANCY close up along
the inside into the far turn, lacked racing room past the five sixteenths pole then gave way. CALI DREAM stalked the pace three wide for six furlongs then
weakened. TOTALLY OBSESSED broke in front, set the pace along the inside into the far turn, was in tight past the five sixteenths pole causing her rider to
check and dropped out of it. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
FOREWARNED allowed to settle, closed three wide on the far turn, was carried out to the seven path entering the stretch, battled with the runner up the
balance of the trip and proved best under left handed urging. WICKED WARRIOR stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, made the lead, drifted to the
six path nearing the top of the stretch, was righted and dropped back to the rail, dug in determinedly but finished second best. GOLDEN MONEY set the
pace through the clubhouse turn, chased the leader into the far turn, had speed into the stretch then faded. VISUAL MISSION unhurried early, passed tiring
rivals two wide through the stretch. MANGA MAN was no factor. I WANNA WIN had speed for five furlongs then gave way. MOBIL SOLUTION was no
threat. DR. ZARNETT prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the tempo into the far turn then came up empty. LET'SCALLITEVEN had
speed for six furlongs then flattened out. DANEFIELD with the second flight two wide into the far turn, faltered.
