Footnotes
BOLD QUEST , four wide between rivals early, moved up under rating while four wide past the half mile marker, bid to engage the leader in upper stretch,
dueled then gained a slim lead soon past the furlong grounds, kept on under solid handling and was clear at the line. GALILEAN MOON secured the inside
soon into the backstretch, edged closer under rating into the far turn, had aim on the leaders while remaining inside into the stretch, altered out inside the
furlong grounds and came back gamely. PRINCE PERE , keen to go, went clear heading into the first turn, set the pace under rating, dug in while two wide
into the stretch, dueled inside the winner leaving mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. RIPKEN , a bit washy pre race, lost ground five wide outside rivals
nearing the three quarter pole, raced three deep leaving the far turn, shifted out to be well wide into the lane, straightened to close the gap and continued
with interest through the gallop out. NICKY BEAR , off the pace, raced between runners leaving the five sixteenths, waited for some room into the lane then
finished willingly once clear. SURVEY (IRE) rated forwardly while about two wide past the five eighths, dropped in leaving the far turn, moved back out while
making some progress into the lane but failed to sustain. DESHACKLED eased out early and moved up between foes, stalked the leader two wide, was
under pressure after five furlongs and dropped back. SANTO saved ground and failed to menace. MO AMERICAN was rated back off the pace, lagged well
back, came four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. HAIR OF THE DOG stalked three wide, moved up some into the far turn, chased past the five sixteenths
then faltered through the drive.

Footnotes
MALIBU MISCHIEF , off slow when bobbling in behind, recovered and accelerated outside rivals to take command after a furlong, dropped in some when
clearing into the turn, set a rated pace off the inside, responded when put to solid hand encouragement in mid stretch and widened as much the best.
CHIEFS KINGDOM saved ground advancing into the turn, shifted out past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from the top of the lane and kept on willingly
to be second best. MONEY FROMHEAVEN , off the pace, raced two wide between rivals mid turn, edged up slightly past the three sixteenths but lacked a
solid finish. TOO MUCH TIP rushed up between rivals to show the early way, chased around the turn, raced four wide into the stretch and faded.
HOLLYWOOD HOOPLA saved ground without threatening. WHY NOW flashed speed, failed to keep pace into the turn, circled four to five wide nearing the
lane and gave way.

Footnotes
DEGAS stalked the pace racing behind three rivals, angled to the four path leaving the turn, gained the lead outside BACK CHARGE in mid stretch, drifted
in a bit and prevailed. CRYING FOR MORE saved ground on the turn, eased out to the three path to navigate tiring horses entering the stretch, was taken
back to the inner rail in mid stretch and rallied. ROOF TOP BAR saved ground on the turn, worked between horses in the drive, raced on his left lead and
passed faders. JOHNG lacked speed, circled foes on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home and passed tired rivals. BACK CHARGE prompted
the pace three deep around the turn, gained the lead entering the stretch and gave way the final furlong. RIGHTEOUSNESS raced in the two path on the
turn and was not a factor. MALIBU HEAVEN prompted the pace two wide and faltered. CALL ME LATER set a pressured pace along the rail and stopped.

Footnotes
MY CANDY GIRL vied outside a rival before going clear around the far turn, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, battled nose to nose while racing to the
inside of BECKON, kept on tenaciously under left handed rousing and got the good bob. BECKON rated behind the embattled leaders, eased out around
the final turn, was under heavy pressure chasing the winner into the lane, moved alongside with a furlong to go, fought on gamely and just missed.
AWESOME JAZZ , off last when hesitating, settled well back while saving some ground, eased out moved up between foes heading to the turn, checked off
the heels of a tiring rival soon after, regrouped to make a bold four wide run past the five sixteenths and into the lane, ranged up to have aim but flattened
out. M. J.'S LADY , firmly rated back off the leaders early on, saved ground within range past the five eighths, angled out after six furlongs but lacked a
stretch kick. WOLVERETTE broke sharply, disputed the pace to the inside of the winner, saw that one get away leaving the far turn, pursued past the five
sixteenths then faded. IT'S TIMELESS saved ground and lacked a bid. LA LIMONADA lost ground four wide outside rivals heading to the half mile pole,
made a mild run mid way on the final turn but retreated through the drive. SKOL CHANT rated between runners near the five eighths and faded.
DELANCEY'S PHILLY lagged off the pace, raced wide leaving the far turn and failed to generate a rally. MAGDALENA tracked the dueling leaders three
wide then dropped back around the far turn.

Footnotes
CHARGE TO VICTORY disputed the pace outside STROLL SMOKIN while under a rating hold, moved to a short leaving the far turn, continued the scrum
into the lane, responded when roused and shook clear past the three sixteenths, opened up under strong handling and kept on eagerly to the line. STROLL
SMOKIN sped to short lead inside, dueled from the far turn to upper stretch, drifted out in the final furlong, gave way grudgingly and just saved the place.
THE CAIRO KID rated inside off the dueling leaders, commenced a run past the five sixteenths, eased out for the drive and continued with good energy.
BUDDY'S RUN , well back off the contested pace, was under pressure circling wide for the drive and lacked a rally. SARATOGA BOB , sluggish from the
gate, was outrun. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) broke awkwardly, rushed up, chased the leaders two wide to the quarter pole and tired.
