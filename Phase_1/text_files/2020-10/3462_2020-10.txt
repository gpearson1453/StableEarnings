Footnotes
TWILIGHT RIDER was outrun to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then eased out for room, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch and dug in
determinedly to hold. ROUSING SLAMMER had good speed, dueled between, was two wide to the stretch, stayed on in the final furlong and was second
best. WALKING WITH DINO hustled to contest the pace outside two others, was three wide and also stayed on to the furlong marker then was tiring. MR.
ARTISTIC hesitated and broke about three lengths last, hustled to chase the pace two wide, made a run to mid stretch then flattened in the late stages.
SLEEP OVER was also chasing to the turn, saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. KODIACTION got outsprinted early, came
three wide to the stretch but also did not rally. TRIUNFADOR had no speed and was never a factor. SOUL PRODIGY dueled inside two others to the turn
then dropped back to the stretch and gave out in the drive.

Footnotes
LINFIELD never far back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, rallied inside rivals in the drive, led late and held ofrf ONE EYED ROBIN
determinedly. ONE EYED ROBIN hesitated at the break then brushed the gate and lost five lengths to the field, trailed to the second turn, circled four wide
to the stretch and closed steadily but too late in a very good effort. GOOCH EXPRESS had the best speed, set the pace off the rail to the stretch, was
overtaken leaving mid stretch and finished evenly. TIZ EMMA prompted the pace to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then got outkicked to mid
stretch and did not rally.

Footnotes
SOUND JUDGMENT prompted the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, collared STONE GROOVE a furlong out, inched away then hung on
determinedly. CANNONBALL COMIN was chasing to the turn, circled four wide to the stretch then closed steadily but too late. ELECTORAL also chased
the pace, was two then three wide on the turn, shifted in nearing mid stretch and finished in a rally. MISTER MOJO tracked the action to the turn, rallied four
wide to the stretch, got on terms in mid stretch but could not sustain the needed bid. STONE GROOVE hustled to the front, set the pace two wide to the
stretch then was collared in mid stretch and weakened. UNBRIDLED'S SKYE was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and could not make an
impact in the drive. SIERRA MELODY pressed the leader from the rail to the stretch then tired. SHARP WARNING was stalking the pace inside to the
stretch but also tired.

NATHANSMIMSY was outsprinted to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed up to get on terms in mid stretch and battled on to prevail. HOT
SOCKS was awkward to begin and was outrun to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, dueled the winner in mid stretch then was outkicked but
second best. NEWELL had no speed, saved ground to the stretch, rallied to loom a threat in mid stretch but could not sustain the needed bid. SHINER'S
CODE also was outrun to the turn, circled five wide to the stretch and finished willingly. SEVENTH WAVE tracked the leaders mid pack, was three wide to
the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. DESERT MOVIE trailed to the stretch then picked off rivals in the drive. NEAH BAY contested
the pace two wide to the stretch then tired. DUTCH COLONEL hustled but was outsprinted, pressed from off the rail to the stretch then also weakened. UP
TIME was used to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch but gave out in the drive.

GIVE ME THE LUTE was rated on the front end to the second turn, saved ground and responded to edge clear to mid stretch then held on stubbornly.
FUENTE (GB) stalked the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner but bested the others. MANILA
MISCHIEF trailed to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then finished in a rally. AMERICAN FARMER had no speed, settled to the second turn,
was fanned four wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. BUILDER pressed the winner for six furlongs while two wide, was
outkicked by that one to mid stretch and weakened. HARMON was settled to the second turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch but lacked the
needed late response. MORE POWER TO HIM was chasing to the second turn then saved ground but came up empty.

ROCKTILLYOUDROP had the best speed, set the pace from the rail, turned back SMOKE STACK on the turn, kicked away to mid stretch then held on
despite tiring. ENDLESS SUNSET was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then shifted in and was gaining steadily to the line.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS chased the winner to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly.
RUNAWAY KRISTIN had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. TWICE THE PRICE was also outrun to the
turn, raced three deep to the stretch but did not rally. EDINBURGH EXPRESS pinched between rivals at the start, raced greenly to the turn, came three
wide to the stretch and was showing some interest in the final furlong. SMOKE STACK pressed the pace two wide, pushed up to try to challenge the winner
mid turn but was outrun to the stretch and weakened. FROST WARNING tracked the pace from the rail to the stretch then stopped.

HECK YEAH was on the pace dueling MANY ROSES while well clear of the rest, saved ground on the second turn, kicked away to mid stretch and held
driving. ARCH PRINCE was settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then closed steadily and tagged PREMIUM FOREST for second.
PREMIUM FOREST was outrun to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished willingly but could not hold the place. SUNSET DRAGUNN
had no speed, raced three wide on the second turn and was making up ground belatedly. RIVER ROSE chased the leaders to the second turn, was two
wide to the stretch then could not make an impact. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY got outsprinted to the backstretch, settled to the second turn then saved ground to
no avail. SIX POINT RACK had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch but failed to threaten in the drive. HARVEST A
STORM was four wide to the backstretch, chased to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but flattened in the final furlong. MANY ROSES had
good speed, dueled outside the winner for six furlongs then was outrun to mid stretch and tired. ANGELO'S PRIDE had no speed and was never a factor.
