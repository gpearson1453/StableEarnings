Footnotes
MALIBU MAMBO led the way from the break and set a slow first quarter, was pressured on the far turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, widened when
asked and finished under a hand ride. SPEEDY HANS was off slowly and settled at the back of the pack, was hustled on the far turn, angled out
approaching the stretch then posted a steady gain although unable to catch the leader. STRIKING MOON pressed the pace, forced the issue on the far turn,
chased into the stretch but evened out with a 16th to run. CHAMPIT stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, launched an
all out stretch drive but failed to sustain the rally. DESOLATOR, off slowly, drifted out entering the first turn, settled off the pace and never reached
contention. AWESOME TIGER raced off the pace, closed a bit on the backstretch, was hustled three then two-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing
response.

NASHTRICK settled in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the turn, rallied, was lugging in early stretch, bid a 16th out and finished best under a hand
ride. SUNSPEAR stalked the pace, chased four-wide late turn, bid upper stretch, took command, was engaged mid stretch and was outgunned. COPINSAY
stalked the pace, raced three-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. COHIBA GHOST stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the
turn, was game in the stretch but evened out late. MISTER OAKLEY stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn the finished gamely in vain.
SECRET PATH settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. MUSKOKA SON set a pressured pace in hand, drove
clear briefly at the top of the stretch, was passed quickly and gave way. KINLEE'S SONG was rated in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn, was
blocked at the top of the stretch and lacked a closing response. ZEPHAN broke sharply to the inside and settled well off the pace, was hustled along the rail
on the turn and passed a tiring foe. LAKESIDE PARK forced the pace, was cleared at the top of the stretch and tired.

BRITISH ROYALTY was pinched back at the start and settled off the pace, closed on the far turn, rallied gamely and got up late under a hand ride.
CURLIN'S CATCH was also pinched back at the outset, raced in striking range, chase three to five-wide on the turn, bid a 16th out but was outkicked.
PERFECT CRIME broke outward, forced the duel four-wide on the first turn, forced the issue through the backstretch and three-wide through the far turn,
bid at the top of the stretch, drove clear but failed to hold off the top two in the late stages. KEEP GRINDING dueled early, stalked on the backstretch, was
under a drive and moved to the rail near the eighth pole shutting off the early leader then evened out. FLEX stalked the pace, raced two and three-wide on
the far turn then finished gamely. BEYOND BORDERS dueled early then stalked on the backstretch, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but
evened out mid stretch. RUNNINFORCOVER was close early then settled in mid pack on the backstretch, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn
but lacked a rally. READY HERO dueled, gained a short lead on the backstretch, set a pressured pace, was engaged at the top of the stretch, was giving
way but was closed off at the furlong marker and faded. DRONE SWARM broke inward and settled off the pace, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a
rally. THE RIDER ON READY HERO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST KEEP GRINDING FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE FURLONG MARKER.
AFTER REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED KEEP GRINDING AND PLACED HER EIGHTH.

THERE'S NO JOE chased the leaders inside sitting on tilt, tipped out late on the turn and bid in upper stretch, rolled by nearing the eighth pole and widened.
UNION COLONEL broke on top and was allowed to settle in the two path, was outside the winner on the turn and followed that one into the lane, tried to
advance by the eighth pole but was no match, a clear second best. STRIKE THE TOP came from off the pace into range on the turn between rivals when
steadied, regrouped and came six wide late on the bend and in the seven or eight path turning for home, levelling off by the eighth pole but still inching up
and a clear third at the wire. BURNING LOVE had only one rival beat by midway on the turn before advancing off the rail to three wide into the stretch,
shifted out widest in upper stretch and closed well to best the balance in the final sixteenth. WAVE BABY sat three wide throughout in mid pack, drifted in
while looking for a seam in upper stretch and ended up near the inside, a mild run his only response when clear. SILENT RISK was four wide rallying into
range on the turn before being fanned out into the six or seven path turning for home, drifted in upper stretch and his rally stalled in the final furlong. SEA
SCOUT sped to an open length advantage into the turn, still had a clear lead turning for home but the winner went by at the eighth pole and he faded from
that point. SHARP'S RIVER chased three wide and came into the five path to loom turning for home but was outkicked down the lane. I SEE THE STARS
was well back, came into the stretch still behind and was erratic in upper stretch, ducking in and out but did pass a few stragglers late. OVER THE HILLS
sat inside in mid pack, looked somewhat tentative midway on the turn while still on the rail and a mild rally stalled in mid stretch. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE was
between rivals vying for the front when taken back and allowed to chase, stayed in contention until the top of the lane but had nothing left in the final furlong.

under a brisk hand ride. COMBATIVE set a reserved pace, quickened under pressure on the far turn, was passed a furlong out and chased hard to save
place. BLOCKBUSTER stalked the pace, chased four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. KING
CAUSEWAY broke in the air, was rated in striking range along the rail, closed late turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages.
DOOBIEDOOBIEDOOBIE stalked early, forced the issue on the far turn, was hustled three-wide, launched a bid upper stretch but failed to draw even and
gave way after a brief chase. NESTLETON HUSH settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn then rallied belatedly. SHOW ME
YOUR SPOTS got away slowly, settled in mid pack, dropped back under a ride early on the far turn, was roused late turn but failed to menace.

SALUTE WITH HONOR led into the first turn, se4t a reserved pace, dashed away at the head of the stretch and held sway under a hand ride. SKYWIRE
settled in mid pack, closed two-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and unleashed a strong late run. TIMESKIP off slowly and well back early, was hustled
two to four-wide through the far turn then closed gamely in stretch. PIONEER MAN raced in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide in the far turn then
finished under a determined drive from the outside. ROARING FORTIES stalked the pacesetter, made a concerted effort to run down the leader on the far
turn but couldn't catch him and was left behind in the stretch. ARMISTICE DAY settled in mid pack, was hustled four then three-wide on the final turn but
lacked a closing response. INVENTING BLAME broke sharply and settled in to stalk the pace, chased from the rail on the far turn then evened out in the
final furlong.
