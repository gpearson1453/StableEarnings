Footnotes
HOKKAIDO dueled outside V K PRINCESS for a half-mile, edged away through the latter part of the turn and moved inside, and was driving to stay well
clear. MY GLORY stayed close in the two-path to the top of the stretch, and could not menace the top one while much best of the others. INDY FRONT
broke slowly, saved ground outrun to the end of the turn, moved out to the three-path for the drive and rallied mildly. MISBEHAVING LADY chased the
leaders three wide for a half, and faded in the stretch. TONALA bumped with MELANIE'S PRIDE at the start, went along between horses in the middle of
the pack early, and had no rally. ABUELA CORI raced widest throughout, and posed no threat. LUCI BREEZE saved ground outrun to the turn, angled out
for the drive and could not gain. ALLIE AND JAZZY got bounced around between V K PRINCESS and MY GLORY a couple strides out, and tired after a
half. SHAKEM raced three wide between horses to the turn, and tired after a half. V K PRINCESS broke out bumping ALLIE AND JAZZY into MY GLORY,
dueled inside the eventual winner for a half, and stopped. MELANIE'S PRIDE bumped with TONALA at the start, raced four wide and stopped into the
stretch.

THE DISTRACTOR sprinted to the front at once, built a lengthy advantage into the turn inside, was roused far in front after a sharp half-mile, and was kept
driving to the finish. MACHO REAL saved ground moving into second around the turn, and ran on clearly best of the others. EL AFORTUNADO raced three
wide, and was never close. PELUCHIN CHIN entered the turn inside and well back, moved out in the stretch and remained outrun. TRUE IDENTITY chased
after the winner to the turn two wide, and tired. HARD GAME was always outrun. SARATOGA DANCER dropped far back early.

Footnotes
GIBBERISH was removed from the rail dueling inside DANCE D'ORO early, moved clear after a half-mile, faced a challenge from BELLA CIAO coming to
the eighth-pole, battled outside that foe to the wire and gamely prevailed. BELLA CIAO saved ground allowed to settle for a half, took closer order around
the far turn, slipped through on the rail to confront GIBBERISH in upper stretch, dueled to the finish and just missed. SKY CHASER rallied around the far
turn in the two-path, and ran on willingly through the lane just outside the top two. HELPING LISA D raced two wide for nearly six furlongs, moved out to the
four-path turning for home, and weakened on her left lead. DANCE D'ORO vied outside the winner for nearly a half-mile, yielded into the turn and dropped
back steadily.

Footnotes
LAW OF THE LAND advanced to contention after a half-mile, challenged for command outside ROBIN TEAM SHOW around the far turn, poked a head in
front with a quarter-mile remaining, shifted in putting a shoulder into ROBIN TEAM SHOW outside the sixteenth-pole, and prevailed narrowly. ROBIN TEAM
SHOW set the pace inside, lost the advantage to LAW OF THE LAND shortly after completing six furlongs, dug in battling on the rail with that rival through
the stretch, was impeded leaving the furlong grounds and stayed on with good courage. SAFE AND SOUND raced two wide most of the way, and lacked a
solid response in the stretch. PERFECT ENOUGH saved ground throughout, and weakened after six furlongs. FARM STRONG raced two to three wide,
and posed no threat. IN HONOR OF ARTIE took the first turn three wide, and tired after a half. PRECISE saved ground early, and never factored. FIRST
SALVO prompted the early pace outside, and faltered around the far turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF ROBIN TEAM SHOW AGAINST LAW OF THE LAND, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST POSITION AND PLACED SECOND FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
ARRIVEDERLA pressed the pace outside NORTHERN, gained the upper hand past the eighth-pole, and withstood a late bid from DR HARLAN to take a
hard-fought decision. DR HARLAN stalked from close range for a half-mile, had aim at the leaders in the four-path turning for home, loomed through the last
sixteenth of a mile outside ARRIVEDERLA, but did not have quite enough. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA saved ground never far back, finished willingly inside
the leaders but was outkicked. NORTHERN bumped with KRAMMY BOY at the start, set a pressured pace slightly off the rail, and weakened into the final
furlong on his left lead. FRANK FIRST had the three-path into the stretch, and lacked the needed response. HALCON (MEX) was outrun early, made up
some ground on the rail through upper stretch, but could not seriously menace. KRAMMY BOY bumped with NORTHERN at the start, raced three to four
wide, and tired.

Footnotes
SWEET PEARL steadied lacking room near the quarter-pole, cut the corner advancing into the stretch, tipped outside with a furlong remaining, and
overhauled SMARTY QUEEN under hand urging. SMARTY QUEEN set the pace inside, was no match for the winner into the last eighth of a mile, and held
to stay clear of the rest. TAP TAP BIRDIE raced three wide around the turns, and stayed on outside to land the show. SUM NATION saved ground to the
stretch at the back, moved out a couple paths and found her best stride belatedly. TIME SENSITIVE prompted the pace outside SMARTY QUEEN to the
stretch, and tired. SHANG'S SISTER checked sharply behind horses at the top of the stretch, and could not recover. JULIE BIRD (IRE) stayed in range to
the stretch, and tired through the late stages. SISTER IS DEVIL was forwardly placed inside for six furlongs, and tired. TEN PIN ALLY was no factor through
a four-wide journey. BEAUTIFUL TIZ was outrun throughout. PRETTY PRINCESS raced three wide early, and faltered after six furlongs.

UNPUBLISHED eased back off the leaders after an alert start, tracked outside a speed duel early, ranged up to bid three wide on the turn, gained control
into the final furlong and drew clear. COUNTRY SINGER dueled inside ONE FAST into the turn, reached the lead coming to the three-sixteenths pole,
drifted out yielding to the winner leaving the furlong grounds, and had enough to hold second. ELLAS MY LOVE raced two wide to the stretch, finished
willingly but needed more. ONE FAST vied outside COUNTRY SINGER early, battled on between horses around the turn, weakened through upper stretch
and drifted out coming to the sixteenth-pole. LIZ MORE BOY was outrun while racing well out in the track. GNARLY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
AGUAS COLORADAS worked her way inside before reaching the first turn, shifted out to the three-path brushing into QUEEN FIELD while getting in gear at
the top of the stretch, rallied to the front coming to the eighth-pole, and bested MONEY FACTOR to the wire. MONEY FACTOR advanced four wide after six
furlongs, loomed outside AGUAS COLORADAS through the furlong grounds, and could not get by while clearly second best. TOO MUCH WAR was mostly
three wide for six furlongs, encountered traffic around the far turn, and was up outside for the show in deep stretch. MISS MY MACHO raced three wide,
lodged a mild bid between horses in upper stretch, and was outfinished. MOMENTS TO SAVER was outrun for six furlongs, swung four wide into the lane,
and improved past tired horses. QUEEN FIELD had aim three wide off the leaders leaving the backstretch, got brushed by AGUAS COLORADAS and took
up in tight quarters at the top of the stretch, and could not recover. ITS ABOUT ME set a pressured early pace inside, and gave way on the rail into the
stretch. MY MASTERPIECE pressed ITS ABOUT ME from outside early, reached a short lead on the far turn, got overhauled in upper stretch, and drifted
out while tiring. MOTHERWELL was outrun throughout. SUBTLE JOY was outrun. TEACHER DRAMA raced close up inside to the far turn, and tired.

Footnotes
ITSMYLUCKYGIRL brushed with MISS DAWN at the start, stayed close early, went after the leaders three wide into the turn, took over outside SAY ADIOS
at the top of the stretch and drove clear. SAY ADIOS vied for the early lead between rivals, could not match strides with ITSMYLUCKYGIRL turning for
home, and ran on clearly second best. TALE OF V K dueled inside rivals up the backstretch, yielded to the top two around the turn, and saved the show on
the rail. BLESSED BEAST was outrun to the stretch two wide, and offered a mild response between horses to get the last major share. CHIQUI THE GRAY
vied for command outside TALE OF V K and SAY ADIOS early, and gave way on the turn. MIDNIGHT GEM tired four wide after a half-mile. VARSOVIA
tired after a half, pulled up in distress after the finish and was vanned off. MISS DAWN brushed with ITSMYLUCKYGIRL at the start and was slow to begin,
and saved ground far back. MISS MAC tired after a half four wide. ADONAI BLESS was outrun three wide.
