Footnotes
BROADWAY LADY stalked while forwardly placed in the three path, inched closer around the far turn to produce a bid outside of STAR COMMAND turning
for home, dueled outside of that foe in upper stretch before spurting away passing the furlong pole, then widened her advantage under driving pressure.
RED LIGHT RACER was off slowly, settled off of the pace two wide, but came under a drive to commence a rally at the three furlong pole, failed to respond
around the far turn before swinging to the six path in upper stretch, then quickened passing the furlong pole to produce a late kick to reach place
approaching the wire. EMPRESS ELEANOR tracked from midpack two wide, inched closer to striking range three wide around the far turn, but only
sustained a mild grind while chasing the leaders, then got outfinished by an outer surging foe for place in the final sixteenth. STAR COMMAND stalked the
loose leader two wide, inched closer into the far turn to forge an advantage at the three furlong pole, then clung to the lead inside of BROADWAY LADY in
upper stretch, but proved no match for that foe passing the furlong pole, and weakened late. MADISON PARC raced far off of the pace two wide around the
first turn, advanced subtly four wide around the far turn, then kept on mildly through the lane. DINN RIGH stalked along the inside and from the pocket,
shifted off of the rail turning for home, but lacked a kick to make a bid, chased the leaders through upper stretch, then weakened late. CONOLOWAY saved
ground off of the pace, but never got involved. BETTER WITH AGE tracked from midpack along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but failed to
factor. TANZERIN (GER) brushed the gate at the start, then trailed throughout and was outrun. SHELL SHOCK tugged clear into the first turn, opened up
into the backstretch, but tired into the far turn, got headed at the three fulong pole, and wilted through the lane.

Footnotes
ROC'S PRINCESS dueled for the lead along the inside, spurted clear from outer bidding foes passing the quarter pole, widened her advantage in upper
stretch under driving pressure, and safely held EASY TO BLESS at bay through the late stages. EASY TO BLESS was bumped by an outer foe at the start,
stalked along the inside, rated under a firm hold from the pocket around the turn, slipped through inside of rivals passing the quarter pole to forge place as
the leader kicked away, shifted two wide passing the three sixteenths pole to take aim on that clear leader, then produced a grinding rally through the late
stages to cut the gap. PEACE BROKER raced forwardly placed three to two wide, held position in the two path behind the leaders turning for home, but
found traffic passing the quarter pole, shifted in in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly for a minor reward. TABOR HALL rallied four wide and outside of foes
around the turn to produce a bid passing the quarter pole, but flattened out. BINGE WATCH broke inwards and bumped EASY TO BLESS at the start,
saved ground off of the pace around the turn before shifting five wide in upper stretch, then leveled off through the lane before threatening.
MAKEAJOYFULNOISE got rank while far off of the pace and behind foes early on due to fighting restraint from the rider, saved ground while trailing around
the turn, shifted to the three path passing the quarter pole, but found traffic, then clipped heels approaching the furlong pole. MAKING PROGRESS took the
turn in the three to six path and failed to factor. COCKTAILS ON TAP was off slowly, then raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, but was done
early. ONE FAST ORB prompted the pace four to three wide, produced a bid turning for home, but weakend between horses in uppers tretch. DELTA
TRAVELER dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MR FREEZE raced forwardly placed four wide, bid outside of a trio of foes approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, vied outside of a pair of rivals into the far
turn, drew clear approaching the five sixteenths pole, then dug in gamely through midstretch as AURELIUS MAXIMUS menaced, but firmly held an
advantage to the wire. AURELIUS MAXIMUS stalked two wide early on, inched forward when his hand was forced to vie between horses approaching the
nine sixteenths pole, smartly eased back at the half mile pole to stalk his counterparts from the three to four path around the far turn, then ranged up turning
for home outside of MR FREEZE, produced a bid and dueled through the lane, but was denied. TITLE READY advanced four wide outside of COASTAL
DEFENSE around the far turn, bumped with that foe while holding his path passing the quarter pole, then sustained his grinding rally through the lane, but
ran out of ground. COASTAL DEFENSE stalked along the inside, then two to three wide and between horses around the far turn, but was bumped on both
sides passing the quarter pole before sustaining a chasing rally through the lane to gain along the rail in the final sixteenth. CAPTIVATING MOON saved
ground far off of the pace, then produced a mild rally between horses through the lane. RATED R SUPERSTAR raced far off of the pace in about the three
to four path around the turns, shifted six wide turning for home, then stayed on mildly without threatening. CRAFTY DADDY tracked from midpack in the two
path, then bid for the lead three wide and between horses at the nine sixteenths, vied into the far turn, but weakened passing the three furlong pole.
MIRINAQUE (ARG) raced far off of the pace along the inside, and failed to factor. MO MOSA set the pace, then met bids from a trio of foes at the nine
sixteenths pole before weakening passing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
HARVEY'S LIL GOIL allowed SWEET MELANIA to clear off in the early stages in order to shift outside of that foe, prompted that rival two wide thereafter,
forged an advantage from that foe passing the quarter pole and quickly assumed command, drew clear in upper stretch, then held under driving pressure to
the wire. MICHELINE stalked two wide while in the three path to be outside of the leaders, lied in range around the far turn, but was floated to the five path
turning for home by an inner rival, got outpaced by the leader due to the incident, then sustained a grinding rally outside of foes through the lane to reach
place. MAGIC ATTITUDE (GB) settled far off of the pace along the inside, advanced while saving ground around the far turn, tipped three wide passing the
three sixteenths pole, and produced a mild kick, but failed to reach the clear leader before being outfinished by an outer oncharging foe for place. RED
LARK (IRE) trailed the field in the three to two paths around the turns, rallied inside of foes through the lane before splitting foes a the furlong pole, and
produced a mild rail bid, but flattened out in the final sixteenth. CALIFORNIA KOOK raced off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, shifted to the
three to four path around the far turn before coming into the lane in the five path, but failed to factor. HENDY WOODS stalked along the inside, rated along
in the pocket in the two path around the far turn, then shifted to the four path passing the quarter pole, but lacked a kick to make a bid, and faded through
the lane. SWEET MELANIA set the pace along the inside, but was headed by her pressing counterpart turning for home, gave way with little resistance in
upper stretch, and caved.

CRITICAL THREAT raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses, shifted four wide passing the three sixteenths pole to take aim on the clear
leader, then sustained a rally late to get up approaching the wrie. OUTLIER stalked three wide, bid turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, but was
caught by a surging foe in the final sixteenth. ESCAPE ROUTE tracked from midpack in the four path, inched forward outside of foes to bid turning for
home, but flattened out five wide in uppers stretch. LOVE MY JIMMY dueled for the lead along the inside, but gave way in upper stretch. COPLEY dueled
for the lead two wide, but gave way after being headed passing the quarter pole. KICK SOME TALE saved ground off of the pace, but failed to factor.
ASSUMPTION was bumped between horses at the stat, trailed around the turn, and was no factor. ETU BABOU never got invovled. BEAU BOOK was
outrun. HILLBILLY chased along the inside, but weakened into the turn, and stopped through the lane.
