remaining and passed tiring inside rival late. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY grabbed the early lead from the four path, saw margins diminish quickly near the three
sixteenth pole and gave way inside. IGNITE THE MOON was outrun throughout.

COMMON KNOWLEDGE tracked outside then was brushed, fanned four wide into the far turn, caught SHOTTHRUTHEHEART with a furlong remaining
and drew off under handling. SHOTTHRUTHEHEART rider lost iron leaving the gate then quickly recovered before leaving the chute, set the pace from the
two path, took pressure through the final turn inside of COMMON KNOWLEDGE, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed through the stretch and
held on for place. BANG ON sat just off the pace while four wide, fanned three wide through the far turn and kept on evenly. JIMMY FLASH away alertly,
prompted the pace from the three path, lost ground through the final turn and chased to no avail. OLD DOUBLE DIAMOND saved ground inside and lacked
a serious bid. JUST CLYDE brushed inside rival in the backstretch, sat in range while six wide and retired early.

CYCLONE DAN raced at the back of the pack, angled out three wide into the final turn, drifted in under right-handed encouragement, took the lead outside
and won driving. STAPLETON raced four wide leaving the backstretch, responded to handling into the lane and earned place. NORM'S PLACE saved
ground from just off the rail, advanced inside on the final turn, angled out to the two path after the three sixteenth pole and weakened inside late. SERAPPY
G broke alertly then contended the early pace inside of MAKEOURDAY, disposed of rival after the five sixteenth marker, was overtaken at the head of the
stretch and gave way. ROCK STEADY failed to menace. LONG TIME DON chased the pacesetters while three wide and faded in stretch. MAKEOURDAY
pressed the early pace from the four path, was unable to move on with rival with two and half furlongs remaining and quickly yielded.

Footnotes
SALTY O'DAY sat off the early pace, found running room after the five eighths then rushed to the lead leaving the backstretch, drew away through the final
turn and stayed clear. PUDDLES chased three wide leaving the backstretch, gained closer order then rallied gradually to get up in time for place. SECRET
PROPOSAL attended the pace while five wide entering the backstretch, went in pursuit of the SALT O'DAY from the five sixteenth pole, loomed boldly but
lacked the kick needed and was caught late. CAGEY took back leaving the chute, stalked inside, lodged a bid from the three eighths pole and had nothing
left in reserve for the drive. PLAY FOR HONOR trailed the field and showed a mild interest late. ROLL WITH ME offered little. BETTY DO IT vied four wide
leaving the chute and was done early.

Footnotes
COMMISSION MAN dueled outside of OSO BRAVE to the quarter pole then disposed of rival, responded to challenge from EASTER HALO at the head of
the stretch and won the nod under steady urging. EASTER HALO stalked the pacesetters from the two path, swung out three wide into the lane, moved up
alongside COMMISSION MAN with a furlong remaining, rallied determinedly under steady urging and was out nodded. IMPERIAL WOOD lagged early then
trailed into the final turn, was gaining on the leaders but was unable to improve position late. CHAIRMAN FIFTYFIVE tracked four wide early and offered a
late mild rally. FINALLY FAMOUS lacked early speed and lodged a late mild bid. MARIA'S MAGIC raced six wide and failed to threaten. OSO BRAVE
dueled inside of COMMISSION MAN but was unable to move on with the eventual winner near the quarter pole and wilted abruptly early stretch. ARCTIC
REIGN chased the pacesetters while three wide and tired.

PARKING PERMIT raced three wide through the opening turn, tracked outside through the backstretch, rallied steadily and edged away deep stretch.
BACKSTREET BOBBY stalked the pacesetters, rallied four wide at the head of the stretch and was out finished. RACING RIVER rated off the pace while
three wide, fanned four wide into the stretch, lacked clear running room then brushed TIGER BY HIS TAIL, angled out five to six wide and rallied
determinedly outside and earned show. TIGER BY HIS TAIL emerged the leader entering the backstretch, dueled inside of MR.KALYPSO to the three
eighths pole, dropped back into the lane, was brushed in traffic and was bested deep stretch. EDDYSHAK saved ground inside, found running room along
the rail into the lane, shifted out mid stretch and passed tiring rival. MR. KALYPSO hustled away, pressured the pace outside of TIGER BY HIS TAIL, gained
advantage nearing the quarter pole, was under attack at the head of the stretch and gave way. ALL UNDER CONTROL failed to threaten in drive. INTENT
TO STRIKE raced four wide into the opening turn, tracked outside and had no response when called upon. UNCLE KIMO never reached contention.
