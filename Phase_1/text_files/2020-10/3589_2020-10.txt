Footnotes
EASY TIME, in range, was hustled two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, bid a 16th out and went on by under a brisk hand ride. LENNY K dueled
briefly then forced the pace, bid early turn and drew clear, had command until engaged a 16th out and failed to hold while best of the rest. UPSTART
GENTLEMAN, in touch, was hustled along the rail then two-wide, chased into the stretch and rallied in vain. POLTERER vied briefly then forced the pace,
chased three-wide on the turn but evened out in the late stages. MAVERICK MAN was away slowly and settled off the pace, chased two and three-wide on
the turn but never reached contention. LIL BIT GANGSTA stalked early, dropped back under a ride on the turn but failed to menace. EASTWIND dueled
briefly and gained a short lead, was engaged early turn, was headed and faded. ADELAIDE COURT, off slowly, closed quickly outside rivals on the
backstretch, stalked four-wide into the turn, backed away from mid turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
VICTOR'S DYNASTY sat in mid pack while the front four sorted themselves out, angled out two to four wide as the field turned into the stretch, closed
resolutely to get up in the shadow of the wire. MISS ARIEL was inside the four going for the early lead, settled back to stalk the two in front, came out in
upper stretch with dead aim on those two, led inside the eighth pole but couldn't hold the rallying winner late. AWESOME MINER stalked inside the early
leader, came up the rail to challenge and lead turning for home, was headed at the eighth pole but managed to hang onto the show spot. YZERMAN was
run into at the start and near the rear, rallied gradually up the inside and bested the balance, continuing his run in the two path in the final furlong. MONEY
MATTERS had one beat on the turn when four to three wide, angled out in upper stretch but lost his path by the three sixteenths, tipped out widest and
closed with a spurt in the final sixteenth. WE TAKE CHECKS settled in mid pack, four wide throughout the turn and closed mildly down the lane while still in
that four or five path. ROBUSTO rallied into mid pack on the turn when four and five wide, drifted in upper stretch and ran on evenly to the wire. HARD
N'SWEET settled off the pace, advanced three wide on the turn while under a hold, then mildly rallied in upper stretch but levelled off the final furlong.
JAMMIN STILL trailed the field while three to five wide on the bend, came out into the seven or eight path in upper stretch but a mild rally stalled midway
through the lane. WHITE WEDDING sat on the rail in mid pack inside the eventual winner on the turn, into range in upper stretch but lost ground and
positions the final sixteenth. HANDSOME LIKE ME took and early lead and held it until headed turning for home, then backed up through them down the
lane. BARILKO was three wide stalking the early leaders, began to fade late on the turn and the rider was up down the lane when backing through the field.
DISCREET BEAR broke in at the start, move up to four wide loom on the turn, drift into six path turning for home and dropped back. PER RULING FROM
THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, VICTOR'S DYNASTY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

AWESOME TIGER was off slowly, stalked the pace, closed two and three-wide on the far turn, bid a 16th out and prevailed under a drive. RON'S GIZMO
forced the pace, bid early on the far turn, drew clear then was all out in the stretch but failed to hold the winner safe. GREEK GEEK, in range, was hustled
from the rail on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and finished with a determined drive. UNILATERAL settled off the pace, chased from the rail and
two-wide on the far turn then rallied from the outside. LION'S GOLDENHEART bumped with DANCERS GHOST leaving the gate, raced in mid pack on the
second path, closed late on the far turn but was lugging in through the stretch then finished gamely in the late stages. PREACHER POWER set a pressured
pace in hand, was headed early on the far turn, chased, then flattened out in the final 16th. DANCERS GHOST, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, was
hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th. PERFECT REVENGE settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide
on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

speed, stalked the pace, was steadied at the top of the stretch, split foes, bid a furlong out but gave way late. FORESTER'S FORTUNE was steadied late
backstretch, settled in mid pack, was steadied again late turn, ran into the stretch and was blocked and failed to menace. RECONFIGURE stalked the pace,
closed four-wide late turn, bid upper stretch but evened out in the final furlong. SABLE ISLAND dueled, was two-wide between foes on the turn, battled into
the stretch but was headed a furlong out and gave way. CLEAR DESTINATION raced in mid pack, angled from three to five-wide on the turn, chased
through the stretch but did not menace. SILENT FLASH dueled into the turn, remained three-wide then tired in the final furlong. STONE CARVER hopped at

Footnotes
DESOLATOR trailed throughout, caught up to the pack nearing the turn for home, tipped out in upper stretch, laying in behind the eventual place finisher,
dragged out from behind that one and drove by in the final strides. NATIVE PRINCE had only the winner beat midway on the far turn, angled out three wide
to grind down the leaders inside the sixteenth pole, only to be run down in the final forty yards, the race being dominated by closers. STRIKING MOON
chased a trio of duelers along the inside, came three wide on the final turn to bid in upper stretch, got the front inside the eighth pole but was immediately
challenged and headed by the eventual place finisher, staying on gamely to hold the show. TOWN CRUISE pressed the front three wide around the first turn
and down the backside, pressed two wide around the far turn and grinded it out into the lead in midstretch, but tired and was headed inside the eighth pole,
falling back as the closers went by. WHEAT KING was two wide throughout chasing the trio of duelers around for the first five furlongs, still in range in upper
stretch but levelled off in the final furlong. AUBURN HILLS was inside a three horse duel throughout, still had a short lead turning for home but retreated
down the lane. PALACE COUP was between rivals dueling for the lead around the first turn and down the backstretch, the first of the three to crack and
drop back from the far turn to the wire. PER RULING FROM THE ONTARIO RACING COMMISSION, DESOLATOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
SILENT SPARKLE was three wide pressing the pace early, took on the leader into the turn and eased by to a clear advantage midway on the turn, opened
up in upper stretch and widened, kept to her task to the finish. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG was herded a tad at the start and settled off the pace, rallied smartly
two to four wide on the turn and continued her move to nail the place spot late. ROSA'S SOUL chased wide, stayed three wide moving up on the turn and
into second as they turned for home, losing the place spot late to a closing foe. LEAVE IT WITH ME lost her footing at the start and bore in, advanced to mid
pack and steadied inside for a sixteenth of a mile, angled off the rail in traffic mid turn into the three path, tipping out in upper stretch and finding her best
stride late with a solid run. HAUTE was herded at the beginning and settled off the pace, came forward gradually into range two to four wide around the turn
but did not change leads in the stretch while still inching up late to best the balance. TWOCANKEEPASECRET trailed by a good margin before rallying
inside on the turn, coming between tiring rivals down the lane with a non threatening closing run. KEYED UP bumped a rival slightly at the start, closed from
off the pace into mid pack on the turn and continued to inch up down the lane without entering contention. WHATSWRONGWITHYOU was taken out of an
early duel to stalk, in range at the top of the stretch but faded in the final furlong. LET'S GET IT DID took back out of an early four horse scramble for the
lead to rail chase the leaders, came off the inside and in between rivals turning for home but stalled in the final sixteenth. NICE COMPANY along the rail in
mid pack early, moved into range still inside late on the turn but was high headed and erratic giving the rider trouble in upper stretch, never turned loose
down the lane. RECKLESS REDHEAD had the lead inside rivals early, was pressed and headed midway on the turn and retreated along the fence down
the stretch. SPARKISHA was off the pace and moved up three to four wide on the turn but drifted out and lost interest.

Footnotes
PATROL settled in mid pack, closed five-wide on the turn, rallied gamely and was up just in time, driving. THE REIGN MAN stalked the pacesetters, raced
two-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, led in the final furlong, was all out but was caught on the wire. SILENCIUM, away alertly, was quickly headed,
rebid into the turn, dueled, was passed in the final furlong and chased to the end. ACT OF BOB held a short lead on the main track, dueled through the turn,
was passed in the final furlong and continued the battle with SILENCIUM to the end. BET ALPHA raced from off the pace, closed along the rail on the turn
then finished gamely. ZOOMER MUSIC stalked the leaders, was hustled three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. MUSKOKA STORM forced
the issue on the backstretch, backed away early turn and settled in mid pack, remained in a striking position to the stretch but lacked a rally. AGNELLI raced
from off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but never reached contention. LILLZ NOT CRYING settled off the pace, closed angling inward
from three-wide to the rail on the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. BYEBYE BYEBYE settled off the pace, came four-wide through the turn
but lacked a closing response. FRANCO'S HONOUR showed brief speed but was taken back to mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the turn but lacked a
rally.
