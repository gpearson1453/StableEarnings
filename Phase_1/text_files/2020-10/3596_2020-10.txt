Footnotes
MOE TROUBLE stalked the pace two wide, rallied to the lead leaving the turn, edged clear in mid stretch and won under strong handling. TRULY A MOON
SHOT was just off the rail, fell back, moved out leaving. KING'S HOUSE set the pace in the three path, resisted when challenged but weakened late.
MONTELEONE, off slow and outrun early, rallied very on the wide turn, moved to rail through the stretch but was too late. THESE BLUES raced between
foes, dropped back last near stretch and then passed faders while being throttled down late. BRIO MAN, between foes and just off the pace, tired. SMART
ROYAL T was three wide and not far back, dropped back. DOWN WITH THE KING was well placed between foes and was finished on the turn.

entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside of that rival and yielded. JUSTIN TIME tracked inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, finished evenly and held
third. JANELLE DREAMS raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. MIJA BELLA raced off the pace, went three

Footnotes
POWERFULLY BUILT set the pace in the five path early, moved in on the far turn, drifted out racing into and through stretch and won driving. OUR PHILLY
SPECIAL saved ground just off the pace but lacked a rally. TONKA FLOWER raced three wide in second flight, drifted out through stretch and made up
some ground late. SKIPIN ON ORCHARD saved ground and found best stride too late. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO, two wide on the turn, failed to be a
factor. GEEBERT raced very wide and failed to menace. FROST'S SONG broke slowly, saved ground then split foes near quarter pole but was never a
factor. JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF stumbled leaving the gate, recovered and was sent up between foes to race just off the pace, steadied on the far turn then
fell back. BANO SOLO, never a factor, stopped.

clear and was ridden out. CHEVY TO THE LEVY raced off the pace between horses, steadied when lacking room around the turn, got clear, closed well
inside and was gaining late. RISQUE EXPRESS steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the turn, angled out for the drive and
rallied mildly outside. BON HEIR raced three wide off the pace, came seven wide into the stretch and closed belatedly outside. TO THE FLAG vied three
wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, led into the stretch and weakened. MARY COSTA stalked outside, chased on the turn and failed to rally. GIRL
POWDER was outrun early and passed tired ones. BEACH TAG was off a bit slow, rushed up inside to contest the pace, dueled on the rail and faded.
