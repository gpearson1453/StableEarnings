Footnotes
SHERM raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the second turn, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and drew off. MENSCH was reserved
just off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive, could not match strides with the winner late but finished well to gain the place. GOBOLDLY
broke sharply to press the pace of DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened
a clear lead soon after and gave way through the final furlong. HOSS broke slow and outward then was allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the
second turn, reached a striking position approaching the stretch and gave way soon after. AMANDA'S BEACH BOY settled off the leaders from between
foes, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and did not menace. DOWNTHEMIDDLE DAN was away in good order to set a
pressured pace, weakened after going five furlongs, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole and continued to retreat.

Footnotes
COASTAL JAZZ was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside with FRISCO FRILLS, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and gamely
prevailed. FRISCO FRILLS broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide, vied into deep stretch but could not get by that foe.
FRANKS FIX IT was reserved just off the leaders from off the rail, angled out into the stretch and was gaining on the top pair late. IMA RUMBLER lacked
early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy. HEFTY GARCIA lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. OUR HY ROLLER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. ZANOS was void
of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. MARCH ON LINCH dwelt, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.
HAYNESFIELD HIT pressed the pace from between foes for the opening quarter and weakened.

BABY ROCKS was off a step slow, raced just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the half and drew off through the lane with
complete authority. SALSA VERDE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished
well to hold the place. MISS CALCULATION appeared rank to placed, pressed the pace from between foes, checked nearing the three-eighths marker,
angled out into the stretch and did not threaten. COMRADERY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch
and finished evenly. SECRETS OF MY SOUL sprinted clear soon after the start, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going a half.
LADY IN GREEN lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. CLOCKER'S CHOICE settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
CONSTANT CRAVING broke sharply to stalk the pace of CLASSIC LEAH while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and
drew off. CLASSIC LEAH sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way to the winner through the final furlong. SHE
BEGAN AGAIN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position but failed to sustain her rally. IF YOU
WANT IT lagged early, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. LITTLE DANCER was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. TESLA chased the leaders while racing five-wide, lugged out through the
second turn and weakened. ANNA LEE ENCORE was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
URBAN DIVA lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a clear margin and
was ridden out to be kept to task. SHELBY R. was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing four-wide, was no match for the winner but finished
well to hold the place. LIRIO TIGRADO lacked early foot, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, waited for racing room nearing the quarter, remained
inside and finished with good courage. BESOS FOR LILY was bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. GOLDEN DELIGHT steadied from the inside nearing the half mile pole, angled out into the stretch and was not a factor. FULL SPEED AHEAD
pressed the pace from between foes for the opening quarter and weakened. FRIENDSWITHBOURBON was away alertly to set a pressured pace from the
inside and weakened after going a half.
