FIRENZE FREEDOM away without apparent mishap, took up residence in the two path, was well rated stalking the front-running trio during the run around
the bend, was forced to idle behind them as three-quarters was being completed, got steered out towards path four early during the stretch run, made some
headway, was in the process of altering off the heels of another and farther to the outside when forced to shy out six to seven wide by an errant BLICHTON
LADY in midlane, kicked into her best once in the clear to get up in the final strides. BLITCHTON LADY underwent a two wide pursuit, pulling on the bit for a
good portion of the opening six furlongs, angled three wide into the lane, closed in, as did a host of others, during the ensuing furlong, came out a bit after
some left side pressure in the general area of the eighth pole, inducing a couple of others to go wider themselves, forged to an abbreviated and slim lead in
deep stretch only to prove no match once the top one arrived on the scene late. CHEATHAM HILL guided into the three path on the backstretch, contended
for the top as the widest of three from the half mile pole to the sixteenth marker, stayed on after the top twosome went by to secure the show. LEM ME
HAVE IT cut over to the rail after stumbling at the break, closed the gap during the run around the bend, angled towards path three stepping into the stretch,
continued to narrow in, altered course back to the inside at the furlong marker for better racing room, loomed for the next several jumps before flattening out.
MISS JIMMY off the inside throughout, chased the pace three wide on the turn, swung out about six wide for the drive, shied nearer to the middle of the strip
in midlane, made no late headway. COURAGEOUS GIRL argued for control from path two, in between rivals from the top of the turn until midstretch,
weakened after leaving the eighth pole. ELLARELLA ducked in towards the gap at the start, recovered in short order and rushed up to the front end,
disputed the pace as the innermost of three from the half mile pole to upper stretch, backed away steadily afterwards. FIRST DAWN three wide on the turn,
was never involved.

and slipped away nearing the quarter pole, swung three then two wide into upper stretch straightened away, drew off in hand to the eighth pole, got roused
inside that station and finished clear and holding well under a light drive to the wire. VIOLENT POINT coaxed from the gate, chased forwardly placed seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch before angling in to the two path just inside the half mile pole, remained patiently handled until called upon
spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive running on willingly to the finish to secure the place honors. SUMMER AT THE SPA two to three
wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. JEN'S
BATTLE broke in at the start bumping CITY TEMPER in concert with SHESASUPERFREAK, chased six paths off the inside from mid pack down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing five-sixteenths from home, swung seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick. SCREAMIN' BY chased five paths off the inside before tucking three wide through the turn, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide

inwards, chased four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took the inside
route into upper stretch and weakened. CITY TEMPER got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.

HIGH OPINION brought up the back of the pack on the backstretch, rode the rail from the half mile pole to the three-eighths pole, departed the latter station
from path two, came under urging going three wide into the lane, closed the gap, gained a wide open corridor with which to work with in the general area of
the sixteenth pole, courtesy of an errant ZACCAPA, charged towards the runner up with a strong run, deftly tipped to be outside TRANSLATE after coming
up into close proximity to that one's heels in deep stretch, then maintaining its momentum, gamely got the job done. TRANSLATE placed towards the inside
after the start, went at it early matched up with M IS FOR MAGIC to her outside, shook free after the first fraction had been finalized and got maneuvered
into a snugger fit along the inside route, sailed along, coaxed along on a loosely-pressed lead making her way on the bend, got cued up right around the
three-sixteenths marker, was in possession of what turned out to be her largest advantage a sixteenth down the road, was still a good two and half body
lengths to the good with a sixteenth remaining, tried to dig in late as the winner loomed up boldly, got nailed in the final jump. ZACCAPA (FR) tracked
TRANSLATE within striking distance from between the path two and the inside route, was more in path two going after the one to catch in earnest at the
three-sixteenths marker, came out a few paths after some left side stick work between midlane and the sixteenth pole, flattened out and had to settle for the
show. COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) mostly two wide in pursuit of the pace up to the quarter pole, fanned out towards path five from upper to midstretch,
rallied mildly for the last major check. NUBIAN took up position in midpack, travelled three wide on the turn, got roused at the five-sixteenths marker,
commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, made no late headway. THE GIRL HERSELF parked out three wide on the turn, lacked the necessary
stretcjh response. ALEMIA saved ground until the five-sixteenths marker, got ridden four wide into the stretch, had no rally. VIENNA CODE made contact
with M IN FOR MAGIC after scraping the side of the gate, was two wide entering the turn and sent out three wide exiting it, made no impact. PINCH OF
GRACE (GB) saved ground for the opening half, got spotted two wide at the top of the lane, faltered. SLIP SLIDING AWAY strung out four wide on the turn,
was through after going a half. M IS FOR MAGIC bumped with its next stall neighbor after coming out at the start, vied to the outside of the second place
finisher in the early stages, departed the backstretch from path two, went three wide into the stretch, folded.

JACKIE'S WARRIOR bumped at the start by REINVESTMENT RISK who broke inwards, established the front and showed the way in hand five then four
paths off the inside, tucked three wide through the turn, floated out five wide into upper stretch, carrying REINVESTMENT RISK six wide, got roused
straightened away, drew off under a drive and was geared down inside the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably at the end. REINVESTMENT RISK broke in
at the start bumping JACKIE'S WARRIOR and continued inwards uncorrected, raced five to six paths off the inside in closest aim of the leader down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got carried out and swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive unable to match the top one through the stretch while along well clear of the rest and second best. MIDNIGHT BOURBON six to seven paths off the
inside down the backstretch in range of the leader, tucked five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the drive while well clear of the rest. CIVIL WAR steadied at the start when JACKIE'S WARRIOR was bumped in front by
REINVESTMENT RISK, chased four to five down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide for home and tired. RUN CASPER RUN brushed the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home placed

Footnotes
With this sextet sent onto the track at 2MTP, DAYOUTOFTHEOFFICE assumed a prominent position after the field had been sent off and running, rated
kindly prompting the pacesetter from the two path, moved when ready to take charge as three-quarters was being completed, got set down stepping onto
the top of the lane three wide, protected her advantage during the ensuing furlong, came out slightly from some left side pressure thereafter, but held sway.
VEQUIST kept watch on the front runners within striking distance, spaced just off the rail, was set down to a hard drive coming approximately four wide into
the lane, got staved off. CILLA off the inside throughout, underwent a three wide pursuit on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, proved no
match. JOY'S ROCKET established the top after some light hand urging on the chute, cut over to the inside, showed the way, with the winner in attendance
from the outside, got overpowered by that opponent as the third fraction was about to be posted, stepped into the lane and backed away readily. CANTATA
guided onto the inside route coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, tipped towards path two for entrance into the lane, never made her presence
felt. GET ON THE BUS settled at the back of the pack, departed the backstretch from path two, was still in it heading home, had no offering.

NOVA RAGS broke in at the start bobbling and brushed with KID CASH, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch, closed well on the top pair as the early stages began to take its toll and overhauled the leader in the last jumps to the wire to score.
NEWBOMB broke in at the start under coaxing and bumped JAILBREAKER, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure form KID CASH,
tucked inside through the turn and clung to the lead being pressured every step of the way, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive shaking
off his main pace rival and was overhauled in the final jumps to the finish. KID CASH got brushed at the start by NOVA RAGS and came under hustling to
press the pace three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive latched on to the outside
through to the sixteenth marker before weakening in the late stages while well clear of the rest. OVERTOOK four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and improved position for the last major share. WEYBURN six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide for home and weakened. ENOUGH

Footnotes
HARD LOVE remained forwardly placed after an alert beginning, rated kind in the two path prompting the pacesetter, responded when let out a notch poking
a head down in front a short distance from the quarter pole, slid over to the inside route in time to cut the corner into the lane under a drive, dug in with good
determination to turn back a stiff challenge from BIG EVEREST, then edged away leaving the sixteenth marker. BIG EVEREST (GB) three wide on the first
turn, took up the chase mainly from path three on the backstretch, gradually inched his way back into the three path after entering the far turn, crept up to
the winner after that one had assumed control, challenged in earnest as the top twosome stepped onto the head of the stretch with each latched on to the
other, vied with vigour but couldn't go by. HARDISON underwent a two to three wide trip to the quarter pole, got set down right around the five-sixteenths
pole, angled four wide into the lane, made no headway on the first two finishers, stayed on for the show. MIRA MISSION strung out four to three wide on the
opening bend, made it over to the inside route by the subsequent one, was put to some hand urging racing from the top of it to the quarter pole, moved out
three wide for the drive, failed to gain ground appreciably in the final furlong. RIVER REDEMPTION off a half beat the slowest, raced three wide on the first
turn, was towards path two by the top of turn two, came under a drive as six furlongs was being reached, was back in path three for the stretch run, made no
impact. COLLISION COURSE lost its footing in the shadow of the starting gate, went over to the rail, appeared unsettled coming up to the half mile pole,
tipped three wide and went thereafter more professionally spun slightly wider into the lane,, mustered up a mild response. HOUDINI'S AWESOME quickly
spotted along the rail, went on to save ground to no avail. STAND WITH MO pocketed, faltered. CONNAGH'S QUAY along the inside for nearly
three-quarters, got maneuvered two wide into the lane, had no closing punch. CRACKER BOX PALACE was rated along showing the way from the rail, got
displaced by HARD LOVE shortly after three-quarters had been rattled off, backed away down the stretch. BLU GROTTO three wide on the first turn, was
one path closer to the rail on the next one, strolled back into the three path entering the stretch, then while being coaxed along, was allowed to fade away.

CIVIL UNION settled along the inside near the rear through the opening bend before tipping to track from the two path down the backstretch, remained just
off the inside on hold through the far turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper stretch bumping LA SIGNARE to the
four path to further open her seam, then shouldered her lightly once more straightened away roused rallying to issue a challenge and take command just
inside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive under threat from a pair brushing with NAY LADY NAY a sixteenth from home and under growing threat from MY
SISTER NAT and held gamely to victory by a head on the wire. MY SISTER NAT (FR) along the inside at the tail of the field through the first turn, tracked
two then three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole tipping out to swing six wide into upper
stretch set down for the drive, closed well outside through the final furlong threatening for it all late but was ultimately rebuffed at the finish. NAY LADY NAY
(IRE) just off the inside through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, got brushed straightened away by LA SIGNARE due to pressure from CIVIL UNION, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final
furlong, got brushed lightly near the sixteenth marker as CIVIL UNION came out slightly as MY SISTER NAT joined the fray to the outside, fought on
willingly loosely between foes to the finish to secure the show honors clear of the rest. CAMBIER PARC led early on inside before being displaced on the
front by LOVELY LUCKY into the first turn and tipped to the two path midway on that bend tracking in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled
down the backstretch and into the far turn just off the inside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole taking closer order, got set down spinning just off
the inside for home and seized command straightened away, dug in under a drive under threat, got collared just inside the eighth pole and weakened in the
late stages. LA SIGNARE (FR) tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out near the quarter pole and was
bumped four wide into upper stretch as CIVIL UNION tipped out along her inside, got brushed by that rival straightened away and in turn brushed NAY
LADY NAY to her outside, then weakened through the final furlong. BEAU BELLE tracked from just off the pace two to three wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch in behind foes outsprinted and offered no response. LOVELY LUCKY forwardly placed from the
start, tucked to the two path past the stands for the first time and advanced to take over command into the first turn tucking to the inside once safely clear
midway on that bend, showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits, came under
light coaxing nearing the quarter pole when under pressure for the initial time, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away
and weakened.

Footnotes
HAPPY SAVER remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent on its way, was lightly hand urged keeping pace with the front
runners, found himself stuck behind TACITUS during the final stages of the run around the far turn, turned into the lane and came upon a freshly-created
open rail corridor, made when the earlier-mentioned foe shifted over towards path two when called upon for a response himself, battled valiantly inside a
pair of opponents during the ensuing furlong, eventually poking a down in front with just under an eighth to go, gamely edged away, kept busy to the end.
MYSTIC GUIDE broke about a length the tardiest, worked out a tuck into the two path proceeding along the backstretch after being three wide prior, kept up
with the leader from the top of the second bend until its end, settled onto the head of the lane and was given his cue, in the neighborhood of path three by
this juncture, forged to a slim and abbreviated lead during the run through the furlong grounds, saw the top one take over springing from the furlong marker,
fought on with determination but had to settle for the place. TACITUS took a three wide stroll around the first turn en route to establishing the top, got
positioned in the two path just before entering the backstretch, rated well showing the way on it throwing down fractions somewhat on the moderate side,
was guided over to the rail by the half mile pole, continued on the front end, tailed by the second place finisher one path farther off the inside, shifted into the
two path when put to the test at the top of the lane, opening up a sufficient amount of wiggle space for the winner in the process, was forced to defend the
lead wedged in between the top twosome, yielded deep into the furlong grounds, weakened into the show slot. PRIORITIZE two wide on the bends, got set
down a furlong later, proved no match. NAME CHANGER took up the chase three wide, got roused shortly after leaving the backstretch, proved no match,
backed away into last down the stretch.

Footnotes
TAMAHERE (FR) a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, was allowed to settle two to three wide near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled and
was given some rein to work with nearing the quarter pole, began to circle rivals and swung five wide into upper stretch, got a tap to the right the shoulder
straightened away and accelerated to the front to take command a furlong from home receiving two to three intermittent taps to the right shoulder and
coming inwards safely clear to near the rail while edging away to the finish in hand. SPEAKTOMEOFSUMMER tracked just off the inside from mid pack,
came under coaxing two to three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and was steadied in traffic in behind the pair of
DROP A HINT and GIACOSA, awaited clearance and was re-roused a furlong from home, then kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors. DROP A
HINT four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. PURE WOW established the front after a brief tussle with MISS J MCKAY and showed
the way in hand four then three wide, tucked to the two path half a mile from home before taking to the inside three furlongs out, came under coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive in command nearing the eighth pole when overhauled at that station,
then weakened in the late stages. SELFLESSLY two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got set down angled four to five wide into upper stretch, stayed
on one paced to the finish and improved position to the wire. GIACOSA three to four wide in pursuit, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home and weakened in the late going. MISS J MCKAY forwardly placed tracking along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper
stretch, weakened in the final furlong. POSITIVE POWER coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide from the tail of the field, tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HERALD ANGEL was gathered after breaking to the outside, but not before making contact with its next stall neighbor, recovered in short order and went on
to establish the top, rated kind showing the way from path two for the opening half, came up to the three-sixteenths marker and was switched to stronger
handling, offered up the effort required to stay in the clear. VIOLENTIAM rated in the pocket, came under a ride angling three wide into the lane, showed
some willingness, but got staved off by an opponent equal to the task at hand. STELLA MARS took up the chase three wide on the turn, got roused by the
five-sixteenths pole, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, made no headway. KREESA LA WROTE grabbed hold after breaking a bit to the
outside, was four wide entering the turn and in path five exiting it, had no punch. MON CHERIE nudged inward by AMITY ISLAND, brushed with DANCE
HALL QUEEN in the shadow of the starting gate, departed the backstretch from the two path, swung out five wide for the drive, made no impact. DANCE
HALL QUEEN brushed from both sides shortly after the start, travelled three wide on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, becoming
the widest of all, had no rally. BIG STAR pursued the pace from path two in midpack, was about as wide stepping into the lane, lacked the necessary
response. AMITY ISLAND drifted inward springing from the gate, putting abbreviated pressure on MON CHERIE as a result, was sighted three to four wide
on the turn, was more the latter at the head of the stretch, lugged in after a right side shot in midlane, made no headway afterwards. THE PROMISED
ROAD pinched right after the start, cut over to the rail, went on to save ground to no avail. ADRIATIC ROSE brushed with the winner, got set up along the
inside route, faltered off the ground-saving journey that followed. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE two wide and being pushed along the the bend, tipped into three
path heading home, gave way. ROCK N WARRIOR lost her footing early on the backstretch, saw the rider lose his balance as a result and come off, was
subsequently apprehended by an outrider and walked off the course. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the incident on the backstretch, the result
was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.
