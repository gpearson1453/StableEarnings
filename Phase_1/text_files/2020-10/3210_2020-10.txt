Footnotes
CANDIED LUTE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear.
WILSON TO LOCKETT raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and was up for the place. VROYSKY sprinted
clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO was away in good order to chase
the pace of VROYSKY while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. SIX BLESSINGS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. THE METAL MAN hopped at the start, rushed to contend, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

in the drive. EXCESSIVE BELIEF was forwardly placed early, moved six-wide through the turn and gave way gradually. THECHAMPISFLORING was off
slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DATCAT raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
turn and failed to rally. TIZ LUCY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace.

UNMACHABLE raced unhurried early, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole, reached the fore nearing mid-stretch and quickly drew off. ELLIOTT BAY
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, was bumped into the stretch and finished with good energy when clear. MAKAH LANE was
never far back, raced five-wide through the second turn, clipped heels nearing the three-sixteenth pole, stumbled and finished with good courage when
straighten away. THE PRESS raced off the pacesetters throughout, saved ground through the second turn and finished evenly. GOLD CRUSHER appeared
rank to rate, chased the pace of PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY while racing three-wide, angled outside that drifting rival into the stretch and bumped with ELLIOT
BAY then retreated. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, drifted out into the stretch while weakening and
continued to give way. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE BUMPING AND STUMBLING INCIDENT NEARING THE
THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY HAD CAUSED THE INCIDENT BY DRIFTING

Footnotes
GENTLE PRINCE dueled for the early advantage with RONTON while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and held
sway to the wire. ITS ALLABOUT JERRY settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, could not reach the winner but finished with a
steady bid. RONTON disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, angled out nearing the three-eighths pole and failed to gain late. DEPUTY'S
COMMAND lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished with late energy.
ONE TUFF MINISTER lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out into the lane and finished evenly. LONG GAME was forwardly
placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. JACKSON TELLER was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second
turn and was not a factor. STYLE DADDY showed brief speed and weakened.

REMEMBERTOBREATHE raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew
off as a handy winner. PAPA DO RUN was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, angled out through the second turn and finished well
to re-gain the place. CANDY'S MARTINI was off as step slow then allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid.
THIS GREAT NATION broke sharply to duel for the early advantage from off the rail and weakened after going three-quarters. DOUBLE A. PROSPECT
raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. INDYGO BO lagged early, raced six-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. GENOA BAY pressed the pace from between foes for six furlongs and weakened.

ALITTLELESSTALK stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear lead with a furlong to run,
responded when challenged by FORTUNE'S FREUDE nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with that rival and held gamely. FORTUNE'S FREUDE settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch, offered a bid with a sixteenth to run, vied and just missed.
DONTKISSNTELL was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and failed to gain late. DISCREET DEMONS raced unhurried early,
raced off the rail through the second turn and finished with some late run. MAGICAL SPELL showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second
turn and failed to menace. WINDY POINT broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up for a slight advantage nearing the quarter and
weakened in the drive. FOR YOU ONLY was away alertly then hustled along to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
DUTTON sprinted to a long lead, raced three-wide while setting the pace, responded when challenged by COASTAL KID in mid-stretch and held EASY
SILENCE at bay to the wire. EASY SILENCE settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with a steady bid to be clearly
second best. COASTAL KID was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, offered a bid in mid-stretch, veered out
suddenly and rider lost irons, was straightened away and finished with good energy. NAVAL ESCORT lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and failed to threaten. MYUDDERMAMASAPAINT was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out into the
stretch and finished evenly. MS LYNN showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and was not a factor. WHISKEY NOT WINE lacked
early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and failed to menace. PERFECT D raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second
turn and weakened. LIBERTY'S FINALE broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
SMASHING SUCCESS was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter and drew
off through the final furlong with complete authority. MERRY MARIE chased the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
finished willingly. A GOOD SNICKER sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. MAYBEE A
DIVA settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to sustain her bid. APPLESATFOUR was off
slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ON YOUR TOES showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn
and weakened. BEAZEE BOLT lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace.
