Footnotes
FOREVER GOLD set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, increased her advantage into the stretch
and held sway to the wire. JOHN'S ON POINT was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not reach the winner in the
drive but finished with a steady gain. DAVID NOSE BEST lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished evenly late. PERFECT D veered in at the start, settled off the leaders from the inside and failed to gain late. COASTAL JAZZ was away alertly then
hustled along to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. LIBERTY'S FINALE was void of early speed,
raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to menace.

BUCKLEY BAY was away in good order to duel for the lead with SO LUCKY from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole and drew
off through the lane with complete authority. WHEEL RALLY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the
winner in the drive but finished well to save the place. LEGITIMATE CAUSE lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid.
SO LUCKY broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FUZZY DOLPHIN chased the
leaders from the inside for a half and weakened.

Footnotes
VERAAJ was away alertly to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter and was fully extended to prevail. EARLY
MORN tracked the winner from the inside, remained inside for the drive, lacked room late and finished willingly. TAPTOO was bumped at the start, then
forwardly placed, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. CLOCKER'S CHOICE lacked early speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and finished evenly late. THECHAMPISFLORING broke awkwardly, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and
failed to rally. COLOUR OF MONEY was bumped at the break, pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. SALTY
NUGGET was bumped at the start and steadied, lagged far back, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

LADY CAMPBELL sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her margin into the stretch and was ridden out. ABRAA
JABRAA was away alertly to chase the winner while racing four-wide, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to be up for the place.
SIGRID'S GOLD raced closest to the winner throughout, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. PERFECT BLOSSOM
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. GRAZEN VALOR raced off the pacesetters throughout and did not reach
contention. TRAFFICISKILLINGME lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. MAGICAL SPELL was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
GABBA GABBA HAY tracked the pace of MADIGAN SQUEEZE from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up with a late rush.
MADIGAN SQUEEZE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, widened into the stretch but could not resist the winner from over the
top. HOUSE OF LORDS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished willingly in the drive.
UNCOMMONBLESSING lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. FIRING DEMONS was forwardly placed early, moved
three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. ZOEY EMERY broke awkwardly, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. LOOSE BALL lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. WHOOP THERE IT IS raced off the pacesetters from
the inside and gradually weakened.

mid-stretch and finished willingly. PEPPERED APPEAL lagged early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished with good late energy. IRISH SWING raced four-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and finished evenly late. ZIPPIN WINE was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and failed to menace. TIGER ON YOUR SIX broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going six furlongs.

Footnotes
ETHAN'S ANIMAL was off a step slow, rushed to vie, dueled with FRISCO FRILLS from the inside, opened a clear margin inside the furlong marker and
held WHISKEY NOT WINE safe late. WHISKEY NOT WINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a
steady rally. FRISCO FRILLS was away alertly to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. FALSELY
ACCUSED lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. CAPTAIN DASHI broke
sharply to chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. MYUDDERMAMASAPAINT lacked early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and did not threaten. ALPINE HYPNOSIS raced off the leaders early, checked nearing the five-eighths pole, moved four-wide through the
turn and weakened. WHIDBEY PRINCE broke awkwardly, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. DOUBLE PERFECTION
was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
TIMBERLAKE GAGE stalked the pace of DOUBLESHOTOFHEAVEN while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained
a brief lead, relinquished that advantage and came back to prove best in the closing yards. DOUBLESHOTOFHEAVEN sprinted clear at once, raced off the
rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, came back to open a clear lead in mid-stretch but
could not hold that rival safe late. SHE BEGAN AGAIN showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished with good late energy. INDIAN POWER was bumped at the break, tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to gain
late. YOU GOT THIS was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. STREETLIGHTROMANCE
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SASSY EDIE raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the
turn and was not a factor. ROSIES BABY raced off the pacesetters early from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed
closing response. BEAU ROCKET stumbled at the start, raced just off the leaders and gradually weakened. SADIE SUE showed no early speed, saved
ground throughout and did not threaten.

STAND TO broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with SPITTIN IMAGE from the inside, vied with that rival through a vigorous drive and gamely
prevailed. SPITTIN IMAGE was away alertly to dispute the early fractions with the winner, vied with that rival through a prolonged drive but could not match
strides in the final yards. MUNCEY was reserved just off the leaders, moved five-wide through the turn, stayed on well and finished willingly. AERO STREET
settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. LOLO PANIOLO broke in the air
then was allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. HARBORS RULE was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened in the drive. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT FEISTY broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by GOBODLY nearing the three-sixteenths
pole, vied with that rival and proved best in a stiff drive. GOBOLDLY was away in good order to press the pace of the winner from the inside, moved up to
offer a bid into the stretch, vied with that rival and just missed. HE'S BANDIDO chased the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and failed to gain on
the top pair in the drive. BARABBAS settled off the leaders throughout and lacked the needed rally. LITTLE HOUSE was off slow, lagged early, raced
three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. MY FIRST TRIP was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out further into the
stretch and did not menace. HALO HERO lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten.
