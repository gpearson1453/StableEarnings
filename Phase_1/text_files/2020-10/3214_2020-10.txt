Footnotes
DARK TRICKS showed good early speed, raced well clear through the drive under a steady hand ride. UNKISS ME stalked the early pace, raced four wide
through the lane and was no match for the winner. NANCYSAIDSO stalked the leaders, raced along the inside through the lane and had not enough.
SILENT NOTION dropped back early, raced four wide at the eighth pole and had no final winning bid. WAY AHEAD OF YOU saved ground and never was a
factor. MEEMAW'S HEART raced evenly and had no response. SHANGHAI MISTRESS was fanned seven wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. GLORIOUS MYSTERY was hustled along from the inside and tired. BRASS MAGNOLIA was slow early, raced six wide through the lane and
never was a factor. ZIRCON ZLOTY was hustled and tired readily.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL IVOR stalked the pace, made a quick move down the backstretch to take command, raced three wide through the stretch and held gamely under
strong encouragement. THISISTHETIMETOWIN showed good early speed, raced along the inside through the stretch and kept on to the wire. U. S.
MILLENNIUM was slow in the early stages, raced four wide nearing the eighth pole and made a good late bid. HOMEMADE MOONSHINE was bumped at
the break, raced three wide through the stretch and had not enough. GALLEON LIGHT dropped back early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had
no rally. UNCLE JESSIE settled off the early pace and failed to have a response. UNBELIEVABLE STORY stumbled at the break and never was a factor.
BALT'MORE FOREVER was hustled along and failed to sustain a bid. OVER SALTY was bumped at the break and never threatened. DUSKY stalked the
pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and tired.
