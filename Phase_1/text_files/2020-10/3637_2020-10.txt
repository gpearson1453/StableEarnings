Footnotes
AWESOME PAL broke alertly and dropped down to secure the inside while setting a pressured pace, came under coaxing past the five sixteenths, edged
clear after a half mile, opened up after being put to a strong drive past the three sixteenths then held firm while kept to task. ASPEN ROSE , brushed at the
break, edged up three deep heading towards the turn, was under a ride pursuing the winner from the quarter pole, switched to her correct lead past the
furlong grounds and stayed willingly to hold down the place. RAN CHAR , in close while between rivals near the half mile marker, shifted out four wide for
the drive, straightened away and closed willngly. THEA'S THEME , away well, forced the pace outside the winner, had that one get away past the quarter
pole, gave futile chase in mid stretch and faded. IN CLASS broke a step slow, pulled her way forward to gain inside foes near the turn, angled out
approaching the quarter pole and weakened.

LUGAMO , lightly bumped by ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR leaving the starting gate, showed speed inside horses down the backstretch, opened a clear lead on
the turn, remained near the rail through the stretch and drew off. NO ONE TO BLAME , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, failed to menace the
winner and finished willingly. PLAMEN , behind horses mid way on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch, raced outside horses and
flattened out while attempting to get in. OMATI saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and finished willingly. TWITTY CITY ,
along the inner rail throughout, failed to be a factor. ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR came in on the winner when breaking awkwardly then raced in the two path
around the turn while outrun. NICE ACE stumbled leaving the starting gate, rushed up two wide down the backstretch and faltered turning for home.

three sixteenths, kicked clear under a drive soon after, wandered outward from left handed stick work when clear in deep stretch and held sway. POSITIVE
FORCE , three wide stalking the pace, moved up in mid stretch, steadied as the winner drifted late, altered in and finished gamely. LOOKIN FOR CANDY
was sent to the front, cleared and set the pace towards the rail, was joined entering the lane, gave brief resistance then weakened in the final furlong. VICS
COOL CAT broke a step slow, edged up four wide nearing the turn, remained well wide around the turn, chased and came up empty. There was a stewards'

Footnotes
MARKET CAP stalked the pace two wide around the turn, split horses inside the three sixteenths pole, was kept to his business and drew out. GOLD
FELLOW prompted the pace three wide around the turn, bid for the lead near the quarter pole, weakened and brushed with TALES OF SARATOGA inside
the three sixteenths pole. TALES OF SARATOGA , four deep around the turn, moved up outside horses in upper stretch, brushed inside the three
sixteenths pole and weakened. ROMP lacked speed, floated to the six path turning for home and passed tired foes. CAMP PENDLETON , outrun, swung to
the seven path entering the stretch, raced on his left lead and failed to be a factor. ERIC'S EMPIRE bore in sharply leaving the starting gate, raced along the
inner rail much of the trip and was not a factor. GUN LAW stalked the pace racing along the inner rail and gae way on the turn. T MINUS TEN ,a forward
factor in the three path leaving the turn, gave way. SAM IN STYLE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail to the stretch then faltered.
PAUPING was outrun.

Footnotes
FRANCATELLI took over soon after the start, set a rated pace in the two path while handling some inside pressure, edged away a bit leaving the far turn,
met the challenge of TACO SUPREAM after a half mile, responded when put to stronger asking and kicked away leaving the three sixteenths, drifted in
when switching to his left lead leaving the eighth pole then held sway while kept to encouragement. TACO SUPREAM settled off the rail, edged up four wide
around the far turn, bid to engage the winner past the five sixteenths, forced the issue into the lane, failed to match strides heading to the furlong marker but
stayed on well to be clear for the place. FORTUNATE FRIENDS edged up three wide and tracked the winner into the turn, came under heavy pressure past
the three eighths, pursued into the lane and kept on with interest. OLDIES BUT GOODIES , under firm hold inside while prompting the pace, came under a
ride nearing the lane and faded. HOLD ME BLACK , off slow when rank, regrouped to make a four wide run under a ride mid turn, chased into the lane but
came up empty. ZOOMER drafted back off the pace, circled four wide into the stretch, altered in under pressure in upper stretch but failed to fire.

Footnotes
STONE COURAGEOUS broke a bit inward and brushed with a rival, was straightened and gunned to the front, went clear after a furlong, set the pace under
good rating and towards the rail, came under a solid ride leaving the quarter pole and kept on under energetic handling to turn away any threats. ABUELO
PAPS edged up inside rivals early on and garnered a stalking spot, was patiently handled into the turn, eased out three wide past the three sixteenths with
his sights set on the winner, moved up into the stretch, gave game pursuit from there and slowly bridged the gap while claiming the place. ABSOLVED
stalked the winner two wide, was under pressure into the lane but failed to muster up a legitimate late kick. PAUL THE WAITER settled off the rail,
advanced four wide into the lane and churned on. CROUCHELLI , off the pace, advanced between runners near the quarter pole, shifted out in the drive
and had a belated kick. SASSY KING , brushed at the break, was not a factor. START WITH YES saved ground without threatening. ROYAL CRUSADER ,
away alertly, stalked the winner three wide, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and retreated. BETTS , fractious pre race, saved ground into the turn
and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DOUBLEOSEVEN stalked the duel, moved up three wide leaving the turn, took command in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and dug in
late. HELLO HOT ROD , slow to begin, hugged the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch, raced on his left lead in the
stretch, switched to his right lead near the sixteenth pole and rallied. IN THE TOP TEN saved ground on the turn stalking the duel, eased off the rail
approaching the stretch, failed to be a threat and passed a tired rival in the drive. ESCAPABILITY disputed the early pace two wide, sprinted clear leaving
the turn and weakened the final furlong. BIG CYPRESS , three deep on the turn, was outrun. CLEVER AND GREAT was outrun. IT'S SIZZLING TIME sped
to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and faltered before going a half mile.
