Footnotes
HIGH SPIRITS was rated outside rivals tracking the leaders out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, angled inside after a half steadily gaining
position racing into the far turn, shifted out near midstretch to bid for command between rivals, then met the challenge of SEMI CHARMED DAY through the
last furlong to prevail under firm handling. The latter, reserved along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced to contention along the rail to
loom inside the eventual winner leaving midstretch but was just outkicked. DOUBLE ONE SHOT, urged along prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn,
pressed the issue on the far turn to midstretch while striking the front but proved no match for the top pair late. ZARMAE, forwardly placed three wide
tracking just off the leaders to the far turn, drifted out nearing the lane and gave way. TO THE BANK was hustled to the lead while angling to the rail setting
the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command into the far turn and gave way abruptly leaving midstretch. ROCKTHEPULPIT settled between foes in
the opening stages but dropped out after a half. FINISH MARGINS WERE PROVIDED BY EQUIBASE.

Footnotes
DISCREET TIGER was sent for speed inside, vied inside of PARLAY PETE early, tracked the pace as that one edged clear near the half, continued to track
in the three path on the turn, bid outside him near the five sixteenths, took the lead near the quarter pole, and held sway under a drive in the lane.
VERRAZANO FIRST tracked the leading pair outside of BAUDETTE BLIZZARD, tracked the leading trio in the four path on the turn, rallied under a drive
five wide in the lane, and missed. HERZEN settled at the rear outside of CLEAR TO CLOSE early, was pushed along into the turn, rallied three to four wide,
sustained his bid six wide into the lane, kept on with good interest but missed. BAUDETTE BLIZZARD tracked the leading pair inside of VERRAZANO
FIRST, was pushed along to improve inside of that foe while saving ground on the turn, rallied inside in the lane, but was outkicked. BABA LOU chased
inside of VIOLATOR and YOU'RE IN COREY early, was relegated to the rear flight while saving ground on the turn, turned for home at the inside of the rear
flight, improved two wide in upper stretch, but proved no match for the leading line. VIOLATOR chased between horses down the backstretch, raced at the
inside of the second-last flight in the two path on the turn, came into the lane between horses and lacked the needed kick. YOU'RE IN COREY chased three
wide early, raced between horses in the second-last flight on the turn, and made no bid in the lane. CLEAR TO CLOSE hopped at the start, settled at the
rear, raced two to three wide in the rear flight on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and had no response. PARLAY PETE vied inside of DISCREET
TIGER early, edged to a clear lead approaching the half mile mark, saved ground while leading on the turn, was headed near the quarter pole, proved
empty under a drive in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SEQUINS STORM was hustled to the lead outside foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail once gaining a clear advantage racing into the turn, then
held sway to the end under firm encouragement. VINCENT WILLIAM, urged to a forward placing along the rail, tracked the leader inside foes as part of the
second flight racing into the bend, shifted out late while moving to close the gap and edged rivals for the place honors. BUSHROD, reluctant to load, threw
his head at the start, tracked just off the second flight four wide racing into the turn, then shifted inwards in the final three sixteenths while gaining position
between foes while prevailing for a share. RUN AWAY BETT angled inwards in the opening stages while prompted to a forward placing tracking just off the
pacesetter between foes racing into the turn and continued evenly late while finishing on even terms with a rival for fourth. BIG SPORT angled inwards to
track off the second flight between foes racing into the turn, shifted out five wide in the closing stages and gained some position between foes to finish on
even terms with a rival for fourth. HE'S DANN GOOD tracked off the second flight outside foes racing into the bend, angled six wide racing through the lane
but made no impact. KYZAN came through close close quarters at the start to track off the second flight inside foes, dropped back avoiding traffic nearing
the turn, then swung out seven wide in the lane to make some belated progress while no real threat. BOOM BOX angled inwards to track off the second
flight along the inside racing into the turn but faded early. ELUSIVE FORCE bobbled at the start, settled in the last flight and failed to menace.
JEGGYJEGGY settled outside a rival in the last flight, was fanned eight wide racing into the stretch and proved no real threat. EASTER MUSIC, urged to
brief contention three wide between racing into the bend, faded early.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS was anxious in the gate, vied inside of WAKE UP JOE early, edged to the lead approaching the turn, saved ground through the
bend, cleared into the lane, and held sway under a drive. TABIA tracked the leading pair early, raced in the pocket on the turn, chased the pacesetter down
the lane, gained slightly late but was unable to reel him in. WHENTHEDOVESCRY settled in second last, was urged in the two path on the turn, and kept on
mildly inside while no match. SHMILY tracked the leading pair outside of TABIA, chased the leading trio three wide on the turn, was driven four wide in
upper stretch, and was outfinished for the show. WAKE UP JOE vied outside of MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS early, tracked two wide on the turn, and weakened
between horses in the lane. GORGEOUS GEORGE was slow into stride, settled at the rear, was urged in the four path on the turn and put to a drive in
upper stretch, but offered no rally.

Footnotes
SANTINO was rated off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, steadily advanced four wide, then five wide between foes racing into upper stretch,
found a seam near midstretch to advance sharply under pressure between foes, then went clear nearing the wire while being taken in hand once the issue
was decided. WINDY CITY GIRL angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking just off the first flight into the backstretch, came through inside foes
when presented an opening to wrest a clear advantage between calls late but proved no match when confronted by the winner. FALL MOON shifted off the
inside racing to the backstretch while reserved between foes off the second flight, shifted out four wide nearing the lane, lost some momentum when racing
through traffic in upper stretch, then shifted inwards to split foes three deep in the closing stages while prevailing for a share. SUMMER DAY tracked off the
second flight while switching outside foes on the backstretch, was fanned five wide, then six wide racing into upper stretch while moving to striking distance
but was outkicked in the drive. TIZ LITTLE BULL, forwardly placed three deep attending the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn while
shifting to the five path in upper stretch but came up empty in late stages. FASHION ISLAND, reserved along the inside racing to the far turn, shifted out
while being urged to split foes just off the inside, was bumped while advancing in traffic midstretch but continued to make some belated progress inside
rivals. SUPERSTAR BEA broke slowly, was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide racing through the far turn and offered no
rally. LAUNCH AWAY, reserved last to the far turn, shifted out to split foes three wide into tne lane, shifted in bumping a rival in upper stretch and was taken
in hand avoiding tight quarters late. MOON OVER CABO pulled her way to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn
and gave way. PRINCESS CORA tracked off the second flight between foes to the far turn and came up empty racing into the lane. IMMINENT THREAT
tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening half and steadily faded racing into the far turn. RENTAL POOL, urged between foes prompting the
pace for six furlongs, gave way abruptly into the stretch.

Footnotes
IOWA NATIVE cleared to the lead, took mild pressure from SPEARED into the backstretch, set the pace through the far turn, cleared the rest of the field
along with CUT TO ORDER in the lane, began to drift out midstretch despite a right-handed crop, drifted out more under left handed urging, bumped CUT
TO ORDER past the furlong mark, continued to carry that foe out, bumped him again inside the sixteenth, and prevailed. CUT TO ORDER settled midpack
outside of SWITHERAL, rallied three to four wide on the far turn, engaged outside of IOWA NATIVE in upper stretch, kept pace with him as they drew clear
from the rest of the field, was carried out by IOWA NATIVE near the furlong mark as that one drifted out, then soundly bumped by that foe, and then carried
further out and bumped again in the final sixteenth, kept on chasing gamely but could not get past. SWITHERAL settled midpack, chased three wide on the
far turn, and ran on five wide in the lane to prove best of the rest. HIDE THE EVIDENCE settled at the rear, improved four wide on the far turn, and
sustained a mild rally four wide in the lane. KELA BREW tracked the leading pair inside, raced between horses in the tracking flight around the far turn, was
driven three wide into the lane, could not match IOWA NATIVE and CUT TO ORDER late and weakened in the final furlong. FORGOT TO FORGET settled
in second last inside, took closer order while saving ground through the far turn, kept on inside down the lane but lacked the needed kick to improve
position. SINGLE GEM tracked the leading trio, raced three wide between horses in the tracking flight into the far turn, began to weaken four wide from the
seven sixteenths, and was no further factor in the lane. SPEARED tracked the pacesetter early, pressed inside the leader into the backstretch, tracked the
pace while saving ground on the far turn, and weakened inside in the lane. ANGELINO settled toward the rear of midpack, began to lose ground near the
five eighths, raced in second last in the four to five path on the far turn, and had no response when driven. MIDNIGHT JOKER settled two wide near the
rear, began to weaken past the five eighths, lost ground in the five to six path on the far turn and continued to fade in the lane. THE RIDER OF CUT TO
ORDER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF IOWA NATIVE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE LANE. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED IOWA NATIVE FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
TRIVIAL tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady advance in that path on the far turn, was fanned
four wide in late stages but prevailed in time under firm left handed encouragement. CLOSE TO ME angled to the inside racing into the first turn while being
rated just off the second flight, steadily gained position along the rail racing through the far turn into the lane, then split foes just off the inside late to
challenge inside the winner but came up second best. KARA'S ANGEL tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight to the backstretch,
shifted out on the far turn to bid between foes racing into upper stretch, contested the issue to late stages but was outkicked by the top pair. KALISPELL
sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, resisted a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch but yielded to the
top trio late. LITTLE CHICK, reserved last to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the lane carrying out WOOD NOT MIND slightly in late stages
and made some belated progress. WOOD NOT MIND, very reluctant to load in the gate, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was
fanned four, then five wide in the closing stages and never proved a serious threat. REAL DE JALPA tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the
far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. HAVE THE FACTS, urged four wide through the first turn making brief pursuit of the leader, emptied out early.
MY IDOL tracked the pace between foes in second flight to the backstretch but was through after a half.

Footnotes
THEALLIGATORHUNTER was bumped lightly by RIDE RICHIE RIDE in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and while
positioned three wide around the far turn, was driven four wide into the lane, drifted out near midstretch, drifted back inward inside the furlong mark yet
found his best stride, and led past the sixteenth mark. CARBON STRYKER came out in the opening strides, dueled inside of RIDE RICHIE RIDE, cleared
into the lane and remained in command past midstretch, but was caught past the sixteenth mark. LAWLESSNESS settled toward the rear, rallied when
urged three wide on the turn, was taken four wide in upper stretch, and continued to gain, proving best of the rest. MOLLY'S ANGEL chased inside of
TEMPER TANTRUM early, tracked the leading pair inside of THEALLIGATORHUNTER while saving ground around the turn, kept on inside under a drive in
the lane but was outkicked for the show. TEMPER TANTRUM chased outside of MOLLY'S ANGEL early, continued midfield in the three path on the turn,
kept on near the center of the track down the lane but was outfinished for the show. MY BOSS LADY was fractious in the gate, hit the gate on the way out,
settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the far turn, and passed tired horses without ultimately proving a threat. EVEN PANDURA settled in second
last, chased in the four path on the turn, and lacked a rally. RIDE RICHIE RIDE broke out and bumped THEALLIGATORHUNTER lightly in the opening
strides, dueled two wide down the backstretch and through the turn, emptied out into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
MUWAAN MAT was rated tracking just off the dueling leaders a bit off the inside in the opening quarter, steadily moved to terms with those rivals three deep
between foes when presented an opening nearing upper stretch and went clear under right handed pressure. THE MORE I BURN broke inwards bumping
MIDNIGHT FROST, was settled well off the leaders between foes racing to the turn, then split rivals three deep in the closing stages to edge a rival for the
place honors nearing the wire. DRIVE LINE tracked just off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out briefly awaiting an opening
nearing upper stretch, steadily gained position between foes racing into the lane to bid inside the winner but lacked the needed final kick. GRADED
ATTITUDE settled in the last flight along the inside racing to the turn, angled out eight wide nearing midstretch and made a belated effort to improve
position. STOLEN GLANCE tracked off the second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four, then five wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed
late bid. LYNNE T ducked out at the start, was righted to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the leaders, shifted four wide nearing upper
stretch and soon emptied out. SUNDANCE CHICK tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
MIDNIGHT FROST, bumped, then pinched back at the start, proved no threat. HERO'S JEWEL settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace.
AMERICAN COUNTESS, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. COOKIN ROSES broke through
the gate prior to the start, was urged to terms with the leader forcing the pace through the backstretch into the turn but was spent after a half.
