Footnotes
SHIPPINGPORT bobbled at the start, stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, altered out near the three sixteenths pole, rallied down the
lane, drove past the leader inside the sixteenth pole and cleared the field in the final stages. SEMINOLE WARRIOR tracked the pace early, made a three
wide bid nearing the lane, was in the five path into the lane, wandered to the rail down the lane, took over command near the three sixteenths pole, inched
clear near the sixteenth pole but yielded in the final stages. FAST CASH trailed the field early on, was in the six path into the lane with a belated gain in the
stretch run. WYOMING CONQUEST pressed the pace early two wide, was in the four path into the lane, led the field briefly in the upper stretch and faltered
late in the drive. IT'S SUMMER was in the five path into the lane and lacked any kind of rally down the lane. BEVERLY PARK bobbled at the start, set the
pace early along the inside, was off the rail into the lane and gave way in the stretch drive.

CLARO QUE SI stalked four wide and outside of rivals, took over from inner foes turning for home, and widened her advantage through the lane under
driving pressure. SHIP'S CREEK chased the leaders from midpack in the two path, advanced inside of foes passing the quarter pole before bidding for
place two wide in upper stretch, and secured it late to prove second best. ORENCIA raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, then
produced a mild rally outside of foes through the lane to edge place in the final sixteenth. MICROCAP hopped at the start, saved ground off of the pace
before swinging out to be three wide and between horses passing the quarter pole, then commenced a mild rally, but was outfinished by an outer foe for
minor rewards. TREATY OF PARIS was off a step slow, pressed the leader two wide while inside of a pair of foes, but tired turning for home. HARBOR
SUNSET set the pace along the inside, but was no match for the eventual winner passing the quarter pole, and subsequently weakened. GOOD NEWS
failed to factor in the two path. PRADO AMORE trailed along the inside and was outrun. AMERICA'S GIRL chased three wide and between horses, but
weakened passing the five sixteenths pole, then slightly steadied between horses at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SMOOTH WITH A KICK saved ground off of the pace before advancing into the far turn, produced a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole, took over
quickly passing that marker, widened her advantage in upper stretch, and was geared down through the late stages. LUNA FORTIS trailed along the inside,
shifted three wide turning for home to bid for place, and was second best. RESURRECTION ROAD dueled for the lead two wide, but proved no match for
an outer bidding foe at the five sixteenths pole, then kept on through the lane for a minor reward. BEAUTIFUL TRAUMA dueled for the lead along the inside,
but was no match for the eventual winner turning for home, and weakened on his left lead through the lane. EXTRA EFFORT stumbled at the start without
being cost position, stalked the dueling leaders from the three path, but failed to keep pace aorund the far turn. SHACKLETTE was reluctant to load, tracked
from midpack in the four path, and failed to factor. OFFSPRING was outrun.

COUSIN LARRY lied just behind the pace setter along the inside, attempted to shift off of the rail passing the quarter pole, bumped TAP GOLD in the
process before shifting back inside to dedicate to a rail rally, slipped inside of the leader at the furlong pole, then dueled inside of the bidding HOLY
REDEEMER through the final furlong, and prevailed. HOLY REDEEMER stalked from midpack four wide, inched closer outside of the leaders around the
turn, produced a bid approaching the furlong pole as COUSIN LARRY surged along the rail, dueled with that foe through the final furlong, but was denied.
DIVINIUM bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace along the inside of foes around the turn, shifted to the two path in upper stretch, but allowed
for racing room for the eventual winner in the process, then was headed by that foe and an outer rival at the furlong pole. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM prompted the
pace three wide and between horses around the turn, but was outkicked by his outer foe in upper stretch, then kept on through the late stages, and just
missed show. TAP GOLD was squeezed and pinched between horses at the start, raced forwardly placed three wide and between horses, pulled and got
rank from restraint down the backstretch, tracked from midpack two wide and outside of COUSIN LARRY around the turn, came into the lane behind just
behind the leaders, but was bumped by the aforementioned foe, steadied, then failed to rerally. TWO PRINCES trailed the field two to three wide around the
turn, then stayed on mildly along the inside through the lane. NAKODA was off slowly, tracked from off of the pace in the five path around the turn, and
failed to factor. SAMURAI SAINT was off slowly, swung to the six path turning for home, but failed to menace. MEAN MACHINE broke outwardly causing a
foe to be squeezed, pressed the pace two wide and between horses, vied around the turn, but was brushed by an inner foe while tiring passing the quarter
pole. BENIAH saved ground far off of the pace and never got involved. HIGH PRESS tracked from midpack along the inside, but stopped through the lane.
Followonv the race, the rider of TAP GOLD claimed foul against the rider of COUSIN LARRY for interference in upper stretch, but it was disallowed by the
stewards.

Footnotes
A BIT OF BOTH prompted the pace two wide, inched closer to reach even terms with the leader in upper stretch, kicked clear of that foe passing the furlong
pole, then met DIXIEINCANDYLAND's stretch bid, but safely fended that foe off to the wire. DIXIEINCANDYLAND tracked from midpack two wide and
between horses, tipped three wide turning for home, then sustained a grinding rally through the late to produce a bid outside of A BIT OF BOTH through the
final furlong, but was fended off. ESCAPADE stalked along the inside around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders through upper stretch, shifted
two wide through midstretch, then kept on to pass the tiring early pace setter for a minor reward. TOMLIN set the pace along the inside, dug in to hold an
advantage from A BIT OF BOTH in upper stretch, but yielded passing the furlong pole. MISS GOSSIP (IRE) saved ground around the turn in midpack,
shifted three to four wide in upper stretch, but failed to rally. QUEBEC tracked the pace well off of it in the three path around the turn, swung five wide
turning for home, but failed to menace. BYE BYE BERTIE tracked from midpack three wide and outside of a pair of foes around the turn, but tired when
floated four wide in upper stretch. SUMMER'S INDY trailed throughout, and was overmatched.

SAFFA'S DAY dueled for the lead three to two wide, took over from his inner counterpart passing the quarter pole, and widened his advantage under driving
pressure. SOUND MONEY was off multiple lengths slowly due to a gate malfunction when his stall opened after the rest of the field, then rallied five wide
around the turn to forge place passing the furlong pole while no threat to the winner. ALL BODES WELL hopped a bit at the start, saved ground far off of the
pace before swinging five wide turning for home, and produced a late rally outside of tiring foes. RICOCHET advanced mildly from midpack in the four path
around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch. HARD ASSET stalked the leading duelers, loomed large from the three path turning for home, but failed
to match strides with the leader passing the quarter pole, and tired. HOLD TIGHT raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted six wide in midstretch, and
passed tired foes. ABSOLUTE CHAOS lunged inwards at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, then along the inside around the turn,
but was no match for his outer counterpart passing the quarter pole, and weakened. BOURBON THUNDER took the turn in the three to four path, and failed
to factor. PELOTA tracked from midpack tow wide around the turn, but weakened through the final furlong. DR. DUKE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of
foes, but weakened passing the half mile pole, and wilted thereafter. NEW DICE was off slowly and got outrun. Following a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, it
was deemed that SOUND MONEY received an unfair disadvantage, and was declared a non-starter. PER RULING #21-0002 FROM THE KENTUCKY
RACING COMMISSION, SAFFA'S DAY WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST. AS A RESULT OF THE RULING
ALL BODES WELL WAS PLACED 1ST AHEAD OF SOUND MONEY, WHO WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.
