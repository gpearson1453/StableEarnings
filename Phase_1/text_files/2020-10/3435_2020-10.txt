continued with a short lead with an eighth to go then held. ST. LOUISE was unhurried while just off the inside into the far turn, bid three wide and in the four
path near the three-eighths pole, continued on near even terms with the leader when being floated to the seven path near the eighth pole, continued on with
determination to the end and just missed. DIXIELAND TRAFFIC set the pace into the turn, was joined from both sides near the three-eighths pole,
continued on near even terms while angling to the six path into the lane then could not keep up with the top two late. MESANGE stumbled at the start, raced
in the three path into the far turn, was asked for more through mid-turn then flattened. LADY ELSA raced along the inside into the far turn, was asked for
more after mid-turn an tired through the lane. SORORITY GAL chased the pace from the three to the two path into the far turn and was done in late turn.
IRREVOCABLE TRUST chased the pace from the four path and steadily faded and was done entering the far turn.Per Stewards, due to COVID-19

Footnotes
PRETTY BOY ELM pressed the pace four wide through the turn, lost ground entering the lane while in the four path, continued with steady pace through the
lane and was up in time. EL CASADORA vied inside of three others through the turn, cleared straightening in the lane, opened his largest advantage with an
eighth to go then could not hold the winner safe. CEE DEE vied for the lead from between rivals through turn, could not keep up and finished evenly to just
last for the show spot. HANDSOME EFFORT was in the three or four path into the lane, gained momentum inside the sixteenth pole and just missed the
show spot. RUN RABBIT was in the two path through the turn then was evenly through the lane while skimming the rail. HAGANS MARKET raced in the
two path through the turn while near the back then offered a belated gain. CAVATINA in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from mid-track
and lacked a finishing kick. SEATTLE SEE YA was never a factor while along the inside. GOT IT ALL was never a menace while in the two path. DOESN'T
MAKE CENTS vied for the early lead three wide into the turn then steadily faded. TAPIN THE ROCK leaned back at the start spotting the field some seven
lengths and was never in it. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
CUTIE PIE chased the pacesetters while near the inside through the turn, bid two wide approaching the quarter pole, was clear when straightened in the
lane then extended the advantage while under a hand ride through the final sixteenth. WICKED WAYS was in the three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the four path with aim on the top two, continued with momentum inside the eighth pole and ran down the place rival late and cleared for that spot.
BROOKVILLE STORM set the pace from the inside through late turn, was put under pressure entering the lane and then was no match for the winner and
lost the place spot late. QUITE WHIMSICAL was well back and trailing the field into the lane then showed good energy although too late. JUST HUMMING
was in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. EXPLOSIVE JUSTICE was near the
rail into the lane and never was a factor. JOKINGLY was away alertly, settled to the inside up the backstretch and steadily faded. Per Stewards, due to
COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
POLE SETTER made the lead from the outset, raced on a clear lead from the two path, continued well clear into the lane, was asked for more when lead
began to vanish, surged further clear then was kept to intermittent urging inside the eighth pole. NEVER EVEN CALLED chased the winner while near the
inside into the far turn, gained momentum in late turn, was under a drive entering the lane to get closer to the winner then could not sustain the bid and
settled for second best. VOLUBILE was in the three path through the first turn, continued in the four path into the far turn when not far back, was asked for
more entering the lane from the four or five path and could not make headway into the disadvantage while finishing clear for the show spot. EVIL EYE
chased the winner into the far turn while in the three path then lacked a response. FADE AWAY was along the inside into the lane and tired. RHINESTONE
ROMEO was done entering the far turn while in the three path. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
WORKING TITLE was unhurried while never far off the inside, began gaining momentum after the three-eighths pole, angled three wide and into the four
path in late turn, continued in the four path into the lane and continued to steadily gain through the final eighth and was up in time. DODGER set the pace
while off the inside, continued with a clear lead into the late turn, shook off one challenger entering the lane but could not hold the winner safe while finishing
second best. FIFTYFIVE STRONG was bumped and bobbled soon after the start, hustled up to chase the pace from the two then the three path through the
far turn, came into the lane with aim on the winner, was bothered and floated in a path near the eighth pole when the winner stepped in a bit, angled into the
five path and finished evenly to be well clear of the next rival. DEO VOLENTE bobbled at the start, moved to stalk the pacesetter from along the inside, was
still a contender into the lane then weakened. DREAM HIGH was along the inside then not far back through mid-turn then was empty after entering the lane.
KENNEDY'S BEAU was done entering the far turn. SIN CITY SLICK was in the four path through the first and was outrun. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19
protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON FOR A CHANGE
OF ORDER.
