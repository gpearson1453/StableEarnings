Footnotes
MY LITTLE ROSE bumped with TWINKIESANDTURNIPS at the start, hustled up to vie early between that rival and NY BETH GETSITDONE, dueled inside
the latter around the turn and into the stretch, and dug in gamely on the rail for the decision. NY BETH GETSITDONE bumped with KAYLA'S TUNE at the
start, contested the pace outside rivals early, poked a head in front of MY LITTLE ROSE a quarter-mile out, but was bested through a long drive.
TWINKIESANDTURNIPS bumped with MY LITTLE ROSE at the start, briefly contested the pace inside before taking back, shifted out three wide to loom a
threat turning for home, but flattened out. DRILLZILLA raced in the two-path on the turn, and lacked a rally. KAYLA'S TUNE bumped with NY BETH
GETSITDONE at the start, trailed early near the inside, and never factored. SAUCY TUNE broke slowly and was outrun four wide. NANIE'S TREASURE
saved ground and was never close. MAKELELE tired three wide after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
TIMEWON'TLETMEGO dueled two wide, drew clear nearing the lane, angled in in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane and widened
under a drive. MASTER OF DISASTER bumped with RESTITUTION at the start and with TRUE IDENTITY just after the break, saved off the pace two wide
and rallied for the place. TRUE IDENTITY was bumped after the start, saved ground chasing the pace, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed
rally. PELUCHIN CHIN dueled inside of the winner for a half, could not keep pace from the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and tired.
DREAM OF ANFIELD had early speed three wide and faded under urging around the turn. RESTITUTION came in and bumped at the start, raced off the
pace outside down the backstretch, angled to the rail near the three-eighths pole and never threatened. GRAY SOL was fractious in the gate, lacked speed
while racing four wide, angled in near the five-sixteenths pole and retreated further. TRINNI SUMMER had brief speed four wide.

Footnotes
CAT'S J N J lagged far back for a half-mile, began taking closer order after six furlongs while shifting out four wide, angled to the middle of the track rallying
into the stretch, reached the front outside rivals a sixteenth out and was going away at the finish. OMNIA saved ground reserved early in easy striking range,
moved out three wide getting her cue approaching the quarter-pole, bid outside EMOLGA through the furlong grounds, could not match the winner's late
kick but went clear for the place. EMOLGA broke alertly, established an even pace inside to the far turn, and stayed on to mid stretch before weakening.
JEANIE'S ANGEL raced four wide into the first turn, challenged outside EMOLGA around the far turn, but faltered into the stretch. NOBLE MARIA was three
wide early, moved inside going to the far turn, and was no factor. R SEA SMOKE prompted the pace outside to the far turn, and drifted out with nothing left
into the lane. DE PURA SANGRE raced two wide and retired after six furlongs. BATI BATI became unruly tossing her head as the gates opened, dwelt
spotting the field 10 lengths or so, and remained far back. BABY ALIDETT showed brief speed three to four wide, stopped before completing six furlongs,
and jogged in far behind. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

ROCKET BLAST bumped with FLAMING HOT at the start, raced a bit off the rail setting the early pace inside, edged away from several pursuers around
the turn, and widened through the stretch under pressure. SMALL REASON saved ground toward the rear of a tightly-knit group up the backstretch,
advanced under a drive getting closest to the pacesetter approaching the stretch, and ran on to hold the place. SUN SQUALL stumbled badly at the start,
fanned five wide leaving the turn, and finished evenly outside the runner-up. MR. WHO pressed the pace three wide into the turn, and tired after a half-mile.
LIGHT FURY broke in and was off slowly, moved inside around the turn, and faded in the drive. FLAMING HOT pressed the eventual winner from outside
early, and faltered before reaching the stretch. ROBIN TEAM SHOW tired four wide after a half.

DRAIN THE CLOCK was forced out at the start, stalked the pace three deep, inched closer while continuing on the left lead through midstretch, switched to
the right lead past the eighth pole and edged ahead under a drive. WORLDS ON HIGH dueled in the three path to upper stretch, took the lead leaving the
quarter pole, vied between rivals past the eighth pole and was outfinished. THE DISTRACTOR brushed with TIGER at the start, steadied off heels soon
after, was keen to advance inside down the backstretch, steadied along while boxed in to upper stretch, angled four wide near the three-sixteenths pole and
kept plugging away outside. TIGER dueled inside of foes in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch and weakened. HERCULES broke awkwardly,
saved ground and failed to menace. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX was outrun while racing two wide.

whip while drawing off through the last eighth of a mile. DANCE TILL DAWN set an easy early pace, could not withstand JOST SAYIN past the midway
point of the far turn, and ran on second best. DONNAMEUP stumbled at the start, stayed in range for six furlongs, and could not keep pace into the stretch
under heavy pressure.

Footnotes
DESERT GENERAL raced off the early pace three wide, had the rider lose the left iron midway around the first turn, regained balance soon after, angled in
early on the backstretch, advanced between rivals around the far turn, tipped back out in upper stretch, closed outside under left-handed urging and was up
in deep stretch. MONMOUTH DR pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths, dueled two wide through much of the lane, steadied
while trying to lug in late and was run down late. DOCTOR D J was pinched back at the start, lagged far back inside, made progress inside around the far
turn and closed stoutly between rivals through the stretch. STARSHIP ARAMIS set a pressured pace inside, fought on inside through most of the lane and
was outfinished. HALCON (MEX) was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the
needed rally. CHASE RUNNER chased the pace inside and faded in the lane. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was bumped at the start and never involved while
racing two wide. DIZZY GILLESPIE broke out and bumped DOCTOR D J at the start, stalked the pace three wide and tired. GREAT KAHUNA had brief
speed three wide. BLAZING DESIRE had some speed between rivals but was through after a half. KRAMMY BOY was outrun while racing four wide.

SUNSET EMPIRE pressed TRUE HEIRESS from outside, wrested command entering the final furlong, and drove clear. PROSPECTIVE DIVA broke slowly
and was outrun inside to the stretch, rallied with good courage between horses and was up for the place. MISS MIAMI raced two to three wide around the
turn, and finished evenly outside rivals. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed late response. LA INCONDICIONAL
raced wide and was never prominent. TRUE HEIRESS set the pace inside, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. NONCENTS raced three to four
wide around the turn, and faded in the stretch. DIXIE PRINCESS steadied soon after the start, dropped far back on the turn, pulled up in the stretch and
walked off.
