Footnotes
JOEYVILLE set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. LAUGHINAGAIN mid pack,
looped up three wide through he turn, bid on that path into the lane and closed well for the place. ROBERTOS TICKET well placed and inside, saved ground
through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, weakened late and held the show. PLEASANT WISH allowed to settle, moved up two and
three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and got up for a share. SECOND ENCORE mid pack, looped three and four wide through the turn,
bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. PRETTY CHARLEE never far back, lost some ground three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into
the lane and weakened in the drive. JUST A JOKER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and
weakened the final furlong. HOUSE KEY showed little, outside. BACKCOUNTRY vied for the early lead from between rivals, bid outside the leader into the
stretch and faded. STORMBIRD'S SONG ran evenly for a half and had no stretch rally. BROWN CHOCOLATE was no factor. K'S FUNHOUSE veered in
after the start, having the rider loose the irons, then lost contact with the field and was outrun.

wide into the lane and had a mild gain. MY FRIEND FRANK allowed to settle, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals into the
stretch and flattened out. VISKI JONES allowed to settle, moved up four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and weakened.
LAWN DART sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his margin to the stretch, then faded the final furlong. STORM ADVISORY mid pack,
saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path and had no stretch rally. AFTERBURNER was no factor. TUDOX
EXPECTATIONS showed little.

LATE ACT JONES hard to rate in the early going, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew
off late. FUDGE tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then was no
match for the winner late and held the place. WATCH THE DIP sprinted to a clear lead off the rail, held that margin to the lane, then weakened late and held
the show. MOTATAN allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the land and got up for a share. JINGLE BELLS never far
back, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. TRI TRY COLORS stalked the pace on the
outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, then had no rally. AFTER THE MONEY was no factor. CENTRIST hopped at the start and ran
evenly.
