TIME 'N TIME AGAIN stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off with complete authority.
CRITERION was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive and held on well to save the
place. ALOTMOREACTION was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing the half, angled out into the stretch and finished with a
steady bid. JACANA broke out to bump rival, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DISCREET DEMONS was bumped
at the break, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. MONARCH WOODS was bumped at the start, disputed the pace
from the inside for a half and weakened.

some late run. NATIONAL HEROINE hopped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not

GENERAL MACH FOUR was hustled along at the break to open a clear lead before going a quarter, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off
through the lane with complete authority. DEPUTY'S COMMAND lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and finished with good late energy. RONTON was reserved just off the leaders from the inside throughout and failed to gain on the
winner in the drive. LONG GAME raced four-wide through the first turn, chased the winner while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
ONE TUFF MINISTER lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. LOOK AT MY STAR settled off the leaders
early, angled out into the lane and failed to menace. ZIPPIN WINE chased the leaders while racing three-wide for six furlongs and weakened.

Footnotes
LOBANESS sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and was ridden out to the wire. CATS
TOUCH settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and was up for the place. DALLON'S GOLD was reserved just off the leaders from
the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive and was caught late for the place. IF I HAD A NICKEL lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. EMPIRE RULER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled
in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a belated bid. SEATTLE SMOKE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to
rally. BROMANCE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. TRUST N LIBERTY was off slow then unhurried
early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid. DAYTONA BEACH broke sharply to chase the
leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.

reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not match strides with her stable-mate late but finished well to gain the place.

HELEN FIRE broke sharply to dispute the pace with BLUE BUTTERFLY from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. A GOOD SNICKER settled
off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. PAJAMA QUEEN raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the
turn and finished evenly late. ROI OUI was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. QUEEN BREEZY was off slow, raced
