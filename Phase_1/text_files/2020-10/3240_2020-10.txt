HEATHER HILLS had early speed inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole surged to the front three wide near the five-sixteenths marker and
widened under a steady drive. SPLENDOR GAL settled off the pace outside, chased four wide around the turn, was no match for the winner but finished
willingly to gain the place. PATTY MAC'S GIRL prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch and two wide around the turn, could not keep pace with
the winner approaching the lane and was outfinished for second. JAZZY JUDER failed to menace while racing four and five wide. TIKA was outrun well
racing well off the rail. HEIDI'S WISH set the early pace two wide, angled in nearing the turn and retreated.

TRAPPE ME LATER settled off the early pace three wide, cruised up three wide around the far turn, blew by the tiring pacesetter nearing the quarter pole,
quickly drew clear, held clear past the sixteenth pole and lasted over a hard charging runner-up. QUEEN OF MUSKOKA raced off the pace four wide,
advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied outside and was gaining fast late. LUNA was bumped at the start, chased the pace inside, lacked a rally and
held for the show. DON'T FIGHT was bumped at the start, raced two wide around the turns, angled out in upper stretch and never threatened. HASHTAG
SELFIE set the pace in the two path and faltered nearing the lane. MY CANDY FOREST had some speed inside, stopped, was pulled up around the far turn
and walked. ANA LASS bolted around the first turn, lost the rider and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT
AROUND THE FIRST TURN AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

BRUTUS settled off the pace along the inside, angled out late on the first turn, made progress outside down the backstretch, bid in the three path around the
far turn, seized command near the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear turning for home, had the lead dwindle alarmingly leaving the sixteenth pole, angled
out late and dug in to hold. LECTRIC CHOKE raced off the pace three wide, closed outside, reached the winner's throatlatch in deep stretch but could not
get past. BAYOU JAM chased the pace inside and was one-paced in the lane. APPRAISED never threatened while racing three wide. MAYNOOTH failed to
menace while racing two and three wide. TAPPAHANNOCK set the pace well off the rail and retreated nearing the lane. GENGHIS chased the pace three
wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
BAMBINO settled off the pace while racing two wide, split rivals near the quarter pole, closed strongly under left-handed urging, was up near the sixteenth
pole and quickly drew clear. BAD SUENO saved ground in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place late. BIG BAD BUD
prompted the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and lost second in the final
strides. MR. HAND FULL set the pace in the two path, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, fought on inside to midstretch then weakened late.
BILETNIKOFF lagged well back inside, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and never threatened. SMART WARRIOR chased the pace three wide
between foes, made some progress under a drive around the turn but came up empty in the lane. THE EXCEPTION chased four and five wide and
retreated nearing the lane. LETHAL LEVY had brief speed four wide. HIGH THRESHOLD trailed throughout.
