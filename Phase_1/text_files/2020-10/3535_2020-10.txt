Footnotes
MILLEFEUILLE remained along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, inched up with eagerness during the early stages of the run on
the backstretch, saw the pilot take hold after becoming a bit too keen in the general area of the five-eighths marker, tracked more professionally thereafter,
was forced to draft behind the runner starting from the five-sixteenths marker, moving with interest, shifted to the outside stepping onto the top of the lane,
beat JAMSSTAR for position and wrested away the two path, was given her cue, responded, emerging at the eighth pole as the new leader, kicked clear,
kept to some encouragement until the final few jumps. WEDDING BAND broke on top, despite coming out a bit after losing her footing at the start and
making light contact with JAMSSTAR, made it over to the rail prior to departing the backstretch, continued along being well held fending off a pair of
opponents out in paths two and three on the turn, settled in and was got called upon for more right around the three-sixteenths marker, just as the top one
was making her bid, got collared deep into the furlong grounds, held well to secure second. PLUM AWESOME off the rail throughout, vied from path three
as the widest of a trio for command during the run around the bend, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, under a ride by this juncture, got
outfinished. MO DEAN unhurried two to three wide on the turn, got ridden into path five for entrance into the lane, becoming the widest of all, lacked the
necessary response. JAMSSTAR brushed with the second place finisher in the shadow of the starting gate, prompted that rival from path two, went about at
the task from between opponents from the top of the bend to its end, swung three wide into the lane having its path to the winner and readily gave way.

came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive and held well to the finish. LADY FATIMA
broke out at the start and was corrected, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home and ran on to chase the winner home and secure the place honors. MIRABELL MEI chased along the inside, got set down spinning just off
the inside into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. R V TREASURE chased two to three wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, weakened in the late stages. LEEWAY got brushed between foes after the start, chased two to three wide, got
let out angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. SKY KITTEN forwardly placed, tracked the front just off the inside and lost position to mid pack,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. LITTLE RED FROG bobbled at the break under coaxing
from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch in behind the leader, dug
in under a drive and bobbled near the eighth pole, got placed quickly to a protective hold and was eased through to the finish.

KEPT WAITING came away in good order, was on hold stalking the front runners from the two path, angled one wider coming into the stretch, took off with
good energy when asked for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths marker, had built up a comfortable advantage when put back on hold for much of the
final sixteenth. LUCKY LATKES got guided over to the rail, sat well rated along travelling on the turn, came into some traffic approaching the five-sixteenths
marker, was gradually worked to the outside after entering the stretch, finally attaining racing clearance right around the three-sixteenths marker, launched a
four wide rally to procure the place. DANCING KIKI took up the chase from the two path, was already being roused by the five-sixteenths pole, got sent out
six wide from upper to midlane, mustered up a mild kick sufficient to claim the show award. LOOKIN TO FLY prompted HOMERUN HONEY from the two
path, going about the task from between rivals from the top of the bend until the five-sixteenths pole, sprung from that station under a drive, turned into the
lane, keep up its pursuit in earnest until deep into the furlong grounds before weakening to finish out of the money. FAVORITE IMPULSE tracked the pace
from just off the rail, got worked into path five during the first half of the stretch run, made no headway after completing the maneuver. EQUANT within range
two wide, commenced the stretch one path father off the rail, backed away. MOON SWEEPER settled near the back of the pack, raced two to three wide on
the turn, was idling along behind others while being steered out approximately five wide onto the head of the stretch, failed to make any impact, lugging in at
spots during the stretch run. VIENNA CODE in the three path, pressed the pace as the outermost of three from the half mile pole until the near the end of
the bend, folded. HOMERUN HONEY was kept along the inside after the start, showed the way being rated during the opening phases, staved off a pair of
foes to her outside for most of the trip on the turn, stepped into the lane, succumbed soon afterwards and retreated to last.

TILL THEN took up residence in midpack after the start, pursued the front runners from the two path, got called upon for more as three-quarters was being
completed, swung out a path wider entering the stretch and took off in earnest after the ones to catch, steadily gained ground, finally overhauling a stubborn
foe with a few jumps to spare before the finish line. POOL SHARK launched itself onto the lead on the clubhouse turn while primarily three wide, tucked over
to the inside, raced on even terms with LOADED JOE in attendance in the two path, was put to a drive for the drive as their battle heated up late on the far
turn, staved off the aforementioned foe during the ensuing furlong only to come under aim by the winner shortly afterwards, dug in with good determination
but couldn't preserve the decision. LOKOYA ROAD bumped with FEELING DANGEROUS at the start, got guided over to the rail and kept watch on the
pace from midpack, angled four wide spinning into the stretch, straightened away and rallied for the show. ACCESSIBLE rode the rail for the opening six
furlongs, was asked to pick up interest proceeding to the outside from the five-sixteenths marker, wound up in the neighborhood of path six a furlong down
the road, had a good finish down the center of course en route for the final significant slice of the purse. FEELING DANGEROUS bumped at the start, took
up the chase from path two, went into the stretch, narrowed in, fell short. VICARAGE pinched at the start, loped along in path two towards the back of the
pack, travelled four wide, the widest of all on the second bend, tipped out into path five for the stretch run, rallied mildly. LOADED JOE three to two wide on
the clubhouse bend, was more the latter prompting the pace afterwards, pulling a bit on the right side, unleashed its bid approaching the quarter pole, wasn't
up to the task at hand and gave way. ON DUTY underwent a ground-saving journey, got set down as the third fraction was being finalized, cut the corner
into the lane and faltered. HOLY EMPEROR strung out three wide on each of the bends, commenced the stretch slightly, had no offering. BALLYDOOLEY
(GB) forwardly placed in the three path until the quarter pole, got moved out into path four entering the stretch, folded.

ALLEY OOP JOHNNY established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide, tucked inside into the far turn, came under pressure to the
outside from CHOCOLATE BAR through the latter portion of the turn and got placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch,
dug in under threat, repelled the challenge to inch away inside the eighth pole, then held gamely to the finish under tepid late threat from another surging
rival. OUR COUNTRY tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive surging late to latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the wire. CHOCOLATE BAR inside early on down along the rail, tipped to the two path
midway down the backstretch, advanced on the leader just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and getting on near
even terms before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latching on a furlong from home before ultimately being repelled
through the final furlong while along safe for the show honors. MORE LIKE IT saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. SIDD FINCH got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his
way, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. NO SALT broke in at the
start bumping IMPLIED VOLATILITY, chased four then three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no
headway. KNOCKOUT PUNCH broke out at the start bumping SIDD FINCH in tandem with SNEAKINESS, who broke inwards, chased along the inside,
came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun two to three wide for home and offered no response. IMPLIED VOLATILITY bumped at the start by NO SALT
who broke inwards, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the late stages. SNEAKINESS broke in at the start bumping SIDD FINCH in concert with KNOCKOUT PUNCH, who broke outwards,
chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled out four to five wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FORT WORTH remained stationed along the rail after appearing to get off to a clean start, patiently kept watch on the front runners until the end of the
bend, got worked towards the outside after stepping into the lane, eventually shoe-horning itself into the three path by the furlong grounds, came out a bit
after a light left shot, brushing with a non-rallying BUILT TO SUIT and leading the runner up to temporarily shy out into path five, met up with that foe a
sixteenth later, with each pilot having applied the stick from the wrong side, resulting in a light bump between them, suffered a loss of momentum for a
couple of jumps, regained it and inched up towards the ones to catch, split them in deep stretch and got the job done. CELTIC CHAOS tracked the front
runners from the inside, got taken to the outside after the half had been rattled off, was driven four wide into the lane, shied out one path after the winner
briefly came out himself in midstretch, was then worked back into path four through use of the right whip, brushed with the top one with approximately a
sixteenth to go, forged on ahead with good courage only to see FORT WORTH emerge as the victor. CHARLIE MCCOY went on to assume a prominent
position after brushing with another in the shadow of the starting gate, stalked the pace three wide on the backstretch and then from path two during the run
around the bend, putting only mild pressure on the leader, spun into the lane, fought its way to a narrow lead, came under heavy pressure late and got
reeled in. RUNAWAY LUTE established the top after brushing with BUILD TO SUIT at the start, showed the way well rated in the two path on the
backstretch, cut over to the rail at the top of the turn, finished the run to its end and was turned loose, got collared in midstretch, battled onward until deep
stretch before weakening. ZONIC three wide onto the turn, got sent out into path six from upper to midlane, rallied mildly but without any impact. FREAKY
STYLEY sighted three wide at the top of the turn, fanned out into path seven during the drive, was never involved. BUILD TO SUIT brush between at the
start, took up the chase three wide on the turn, was in the same one entering the stretch, wasn't making any discernable headway when brushed into by the
winner in midlane, fell back steadily afterwards. KAZMANIA corrected after breaking to the outside, raced three wide on the turn, tipped out into path four at
the top of the lane, came up empty. Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the first two finishers in the stretch, in addition to a claim of foul lodged by the
trainer of CELTIC CHAOS against the rider of FORT WORTH alleging interference, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

through the final furlong to take command in the final strides, then prevailed inching away at the end. MOPOLKA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under threat clinging to the lead until caught in the last jumps to the finish. COME STORMING three wide in the first turn, chased four then three wide from
just off the pace, advanced on the leader through the latter portion of the turn and swung four wide into upper stretch, got set down straightened away, dug

aforementioned foe. MORE MANGO four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. STERLING BEAUTY broke out at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home

Footnotes
MONEY MOVES sparred for command primarily from the two path on the turn, was forced to do so from between rivals on the turn, saw the rider go to work
leaving the five-sixteenths marker, wandered into the three path spinning onto the top of the lane, still locked in a three-way tussle, desperately clung to the
slimmest of leads, had AMERICANUS drop out of the fight with approximately a sixteenth remaining, dueled eye to eye with TECHNIQUE the rest of the
way home, proved game to the end and would not be denied. THREE TECHNIQUE tracked the front runners from along the rail, abandoned it after crossing
the midway point on the turn, got maneuvered into path four by the five-sixteenths pole, crept up menacingly towards the ones to catch, challenged from
path five, as the outermost of three from the head of the stretch until the sixteenth pole, tenaciously went at it one on one with MONEY MOVES from that
station onward, got denied. AMERICANUS remained in the three path after the start, vied as the widest of three for control on the turn, shifted into the four
path turning into the lane, battled wedged in between foes until around the sixteenth pole before weakening into the show slot. EXPERT three wide onto the
turn, swung into path five into the lane, lacked the needed response. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS two wide onto the turn, was four wide exiting it, never made
its presence felt. DARK STORM went over to the rail, was forced to fend off heavy pressure from a pair of opponents to the outside, got shaken off as
three-quarters was being completed and faltered.

Footnotes
SCARLETT SKY forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, grew a bit keen and pulled on the bit against the restraint of the rider before
settling better nearing the far turn, got joined to the outside by SECRET POTION and advanced to prompt the front between rivals through the latter portion
of the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to take command with about three-sixteenths to go,
then drew clear under a drive to prevail. ENGRAVE broke out a step at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket
behind the cover of the leader, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch into daylight, proved no match for the
top one while running on to secure the place honors. GIRL DAD established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside
through sensible splits and facing little pressure early on, had a pair of rivals advance outside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths
in response, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was displaced from the front with three-sixteenths to run, dug in under a drive and
weakened in the very late stages while preserving the show honors. IRON PEARLS bumped at the start by WORLD CRUISER who broke outwards, raced
just off the pace two to three wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
improved position to the finish. CHARLESTON STRONG saved ground in pursuit from mid pack being briefly taken in hand midway down the backstretch,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and improved some position to the wire. SECRET POTION four
then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced three wide into the far turn to stack outside the top pair three furlongs from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths and offered up a mild bid swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and flattened out inside the final
furlong. HIGH KNUCKLES just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. WORLD CRUISER broke out at the start and got shouldered stoutly by IRON PEARLS
when running into that rival, came under coaxing briefly before settling three wide down the backstretch near the rear of the field, got bumped by PRIVATE
CODE due to pressure from HACHURE with five and a half furlongs remaining, tipped four wide through the far turn and got placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. GHOST STALKER three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked to
the two path through the turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in retreat, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. PRIVATE CODE just
off the inside near the rear of the field early on, got bumped by HACHURE with five and a half furlongs remaining and in turn bumped WORLD CRUISER to
his outside, went three wide through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. SIMOVITCH three
wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. HACHURE brushed the near side stall
at the start, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, got taken in hand slightly off a rivals heels and tipped out bumping PRIVATE CODE into
WORLD CRUISER with five and a half furlongs remaining, came under coaxing just off the inside at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide for home
and made no impact.
