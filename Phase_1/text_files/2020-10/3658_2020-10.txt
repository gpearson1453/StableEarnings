three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely. COMIC KITTEN showed brief speed, pressed the early pace, was hustled from the rail o the far turn but
finished evenly. SAYSO raced in mid pack, chased two-wide on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. RAPUNZEL'S DREAM raced in mid pack
while enjoying a trip along the rail but failed to menace. SEA ANNA DREAM was rated off the pace, came four-wide through the first turn and was hustled
four and five-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. CALAIS COVE lost her path at the start, trailed to the top of the stretch showed a mild rally.

Footnotes
LA BONITA raced in mid pack, chased angling from the rail to three-wide on the far turn, took command upper stretch and held sway under a hand ride.
SAN NICOLA STAR led quickly, set a reserved pace, widened on the backstretch but began to shorten strides approaching the stretch, was passed a
furlong out but gamely held place. DAMA ELEGANTE, rated off the pace, closed fast two to four-wide on the far turn then continued her rally through the
stretch. TYPICALLY settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the far turn then finished gamely. L'AMOUR TOUJOURS settled in mid pack,
was hustled four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. QUEEN ANDHER COURT raced in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns, was hustled
on the far turn but failed to menace. LEAN ON E stalked the pace, chased two and three-wide on the far turn but evened out in the stretch. DOODLE
DANDY broke outward and was steadied, raced from off the pace, was hustled angling in from three-wide to the rail on the far turn but failed to threaten.
PLAYING SMART pressed the pace, dropped back on the backstretch and lacked a rally. THATS BOMB, in range, faded three and four-wide on the far turn
and tired.

OUR LITTLE JEWEL stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, rallied smartly and was up late under a drive. TWIRLING FAITH
set a pressured pace, widened upper stretch but was caught in the late stages. TRADING BAY lost her path early, moved to the rail, closed into the stretch
and finished gamely. SILENT CAUSEWAY pressed the pace, was hustled late turn, chased in the stretch with the leader in her sights but failed to sustain
the drive. VESPOLINA raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely. HELLO FRIENDS settled in mid pack, was hustled
four and five-wide on the turn then closed willingly from the outside. APPELLA settled off the pace, closed along the rail late turn and rallied belatedly
between foes. LET'S HAVE FUN settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. GEORGIAN DANCER
stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then tired in the final furlong. COOL SOCIETY raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on
the turn but evened out in the final 16th. NONIOBUSINESS was up close early then stalked briefly, faded three-wide on the turn but had no closing

Footnotes
MRS FRANKEL (IRE) was in behind the leaders early, three wide on hold into the turn, waited for room behind the two pace runners late on the turn and got
a seam as they came into the stretch, drove by near the eighth pole and held her stablemate safe late. JUNGLE CAT off the pace early, circled two to four
wide on the turn outside the eventual winner nearing the turn for home, getting by the show finisher while inching up on her stablemate late but unable to
close the gap. ADMIRING led quickly, allowed a rival to go so as to stalk her, regained the front midway on the turn and held until the eighth pole, then
dropping back to third inside the seventy yard pole. MIA AT MIDNIGHT off the pace early, followed the winner two to four wide around the turn, was in range
turning for home but drifted in down the stretch, settling for a minor award. OSTRACIZE stalked in behind the leaders early, dropped back into the turn, was
roused two to three wide in behind the winner into the stretch but went over to the rail near the eighth pole, levelling off. HI HONEY tapped on the brakes
when between runners and off the pace just before the turn, tipped out in upper stretch and put in a mild run to best the balance. FLAXEN trailed after
breaking with her head in the air at the start, angled out in upper stretch and passed a few tired foes with a mild rally. SECRETS TOLD was outside the
winner late on the backstretch, came four to three wide to bid for the front late on the turn, drifted out giving the victor a clear path turning for home and
retreated down the lane. TOTAL BETTY along the rail in mid pack, began to fall back midway on the turn and retreated in the stretch. EASY ACCESS
chased along the inside, was steadied when a stopping rival backed into her mid turn, went around that one but levelled off in upper stretch. SHE TAKES
FLIGHT up inside rival to lead, dropping back from mid turn after being headed to the wire.

NOT SO QUIET had the lead and the rail into the first turn, would not give up his inside position despite being pressured and headed in the backstretch,
drove on to open a clear advantage in upper stretch and held determinedly despite drifting out late. ROYAL LASER was off the pace and steadied
momentarily into the first turn, got up the rail into the second turn and was in behind the leaders in upper stretch, came out at the sixteenth pole and was
gaining, but seemed to hang in the final few strides, the winner drifting a tad. RED CABERNET was hard to hold three wide stalking in the first turn, ranged
up to make it three in a line for the lead down the backside, appeared to be weakening at the top of the stretch and falling back but came on again in the
final sixteenth to nail the show. DUN DRUM was on heels in the two path off the pace into the first turn, advanced from mid backstretch to get up outside the
two rivals in behind the three pace setters coming out of the far turn, staying in contention but losing a show photo late. DIXIE'S GAMBLE had a nice gap
trip behind the three dueling leaders, came off the rail allowing the eventual second place finisher to get inside of him on the second turn, rallied nicely into
range but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. SILENT JIMMIE off the pace and three wide to the rail in the first turn, rallied rail to three wide on the second
turn but could not reach contention finding his best stride too late. THOR'S ROCKET off the pace and four to three wide around the first turn, moved into mid
pack while four wide down the backstretch and continued with a mild rally down the stretch without threatening. ROYAL WEDDING lost his path when
crossing the wire for the first time, settled in mid pack rallied mildly three wide around the far turn but could not sustain his bid. ESKIMINZIN dueled between
rivals throughout, falling back and steadying when faltering by the sixteenth pole, tired from the battle. FORESTER'S TURN steadied along the rail
throughout the first turn, losing ground from the far turn to the wire.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF DREW led early, set a reserved pace, was pressured on the far turn, widened in the stretch and held sway under a brisk hand ride. IL
MALOCCHIO raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and was going after the leader under a determined drive.
EMMELINE stalked the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and finished all out along the rail. BODACIOUS MISS had brief
speed, stalked the pace, lapped onto the leader on the far turn, chased into the stretch but was left behind by the pacesetter and evened out in the final
16th. CURLIN'S CATCH settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but had no response in the stretch. BEQUIA settled off the pace, was
hustled angling in from three-wide to the rail through the far turn but lacked a closing response. DANCE WITH DESTINY was off slowly and taken in hand,
chased from mid pack on the far turn but flattened out in the stretch. EL BAYERN bobbled leaving the gate, was rank in the early running as well as on the
backstretch, dropped to the back of the pack on the far turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
SPUN GLASS lost her path leaving the gate, moved up the rail to stalk the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch, led in the final furlong and finished under
a hand ride. SYSTEMIC RISK led quickly, set a pressured pace, was engaged in the final furlong, yielded but gamely held place. HAI BOBBI broke outward
and was steadied, settled well off the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn, tipped out wide at the top of the stretch and rallied with good energy.
FAIRYWREN was involved in some bumping at the start which included four fillies, raced in mid pack, came three to five-wide through the turn then rallied
from the outside. PATTON'S GIRL settled off the pace, was hustled angling in from the fourth path to two-wide on the turn then rallied along the rail.
GELATO AMORE was in the bumping at the start, settled in mid pack, maneuvered through traffic two to four-wide late turn then finished gamely. AUNT
TILLIE raced in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn then finished evenly. LADY KRATOS was bumped at the start, stalked the pace three-wide then evened
out with a 16th still on tap. JUMPING JILL FLASH settled off the pace, was hustled five then four-wide on the turn, but lacked a closing response.
ISHIYAYA, the final member of the starting gate bumpers, raced in striking range, closed four-wide late turn then flattened out in the final 16th. STOKES
settled in mid pack, was hustled five and six-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SHORT SUMMER DRESS stalked the pace two and
three-wide, dropped back late turn and lacked a rally.
