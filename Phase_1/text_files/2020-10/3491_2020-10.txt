Footnotes
TAPITLIKEITSHOT stalked the pace, closed two-wide late turn, bid a 16th out and prevailed under a brisk hand drive. YES TO MISCHIEF forced the pace
from the rail, bid into the turn, dueled, gained command mid turn and moved clear but was collared a 16th out and gave way grudgingly. GOOD
ALTERNATIVE broke in the air and settled off the pace, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. NEPTUNE'S PEARL
stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but lost a position late. BUNCHKINS raced in mid pack, was hustled
three and four-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail late turn, was not a
threat but showed interest through the stretch. LACOUGRA set a pressured pace in hand, dueled early turn, was headed mid turn, chased into the stretch
and tired.

ROYAL LASER settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide through the turn, had the lead a furlong out and held under a drive.
VIEWFINDER settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied determinedly. STRIKE ME DOWN was
steadied early, closed up and stalked the pace, closed three and four-wide late turn, gained the lead upper stretch but was headed a furlong out and chased
to the late stages. MAGIC TAPIT forced the pace, stalked two and three-wide on the turn but evened out in deep stretch. MALIBU UPROAR raced in mid
pack, chased hard four-wide late turn, chased into the stretch and closed belatedly. OSAGE MOON led early, dueled through the turn, was headed upper
stretch, chased briefly and tired in the late stages. FARAWAY KITTEN forced the issue, dueled on the turn, was headed upper stretch, chased briefly and
tired in the late stages, much like his dueling rival.

Footnotes
MIA'S EXTORTIONIST was rated off the early pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, rallied and was up in deep stretch
under a drive. GOOGLE IT showed brief speed, stalked the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn, bid upper stretch, dueled, was passed late but
held place. CHASING VINNY settled off the pace, angled from two to four-wide through the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and rallied gamely, but
late. YOLA forced the pace, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch, dueled but was passed late by a late runner.
CANADIAN SECRET had brief speed, settled in mid pack, was hustled two-wide to the rail on the turn then rallied gamely between rivals. STORMY
EGBERT had early speed, chased four and five-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. TORAH'S BLESSING was used early, then hustled
from mid pack on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. TORPEDO MAX broke through the gate early and unseated his rider,
was brought back quickly and reloaded, showed speed at the real break, held a short lead on the turn, was engaged at the head of the stretch and gave
way grudgingly in the stretch. CHARLES STREET was off slowly, raced in striking range, came five and six-wide through the turn, was roused at the top of
the stretch but lacked a response. CRYPTIC GRIP had brief speed, dropped back at the turn and lacked a rally.

SAY THE WORD dropped back to trail the field in the early stages, saved ground on the opening turn, came off of the hedge down the backstretch but
maintained cover, raced two-wide on the far turn where he began to kick into gear, angled into the four-path turning for home and finished best. SIR SAHIB
was in midpack in the early stages while saving ground, raced near the back down the backside while racing near the hedge, trailed late on the far turn and
into the stretch, angled to the outside at the head of the lane, tried to launch a rally between foes but lost the path past the 3/16ths pole then switched to the
outside and finished gamely. ADMIRALTY PIER broke sharp and got out to set the pace while saving ground, took light pressure into the far turn, was
headed near the 5/16ths pole, dueled in the stretch but gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. COUNT AGAIN hit the gate at the start, was three-wide in
midpack early, advanced on the outside to stalk the pace on the backstretch, continued to race three-wide on the far turn, made a bid for the lead turning for
home, dueled down the lane, briefly took the lead near the 1/8th pole but was outfinished. WOODBRIDGE raced in midpack between foes for most of the
running, was two-wide on the far turn, was in range in early stretch, switched to the rail 1/16th out and chased to the wide. NAKAMURA was near the back
while racing two-wide early, gained position while racing widest down the backstretch, stalked the pace while racing three-wide on the far turn, was in range
in early stretch but finished evenly. JUNGLE FIGHTER had good early position, dove towards the rail after a 1/4 mile, stalked the pacesetter while racing on
the inside, tracked the dueling trio from a garden spot on the far turn but offered no kick when asked in the stretch. PEACE OF EKATI tracked the
pacesetter, came off of the rail early, pressed the leader while racing two-wide on the far turn then faded in the stretch.

HELIUM settled in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn, swept to the lead a furlong out and widened under a drive. GOSPEL WAY moved up to duel on the
main track, chased three then two-wide on the turn then finished under a determined drive. DECIMATOR got away slowly then was rated off the pace, was
hustled two and three-wide on the turn then rallied from the outside. EXCEED settled off the pace, chased hard along the rail and two-wide through the turn,
cut back to the rail in the final furlong and finished gamely. MACLEAN'S POSSE broke outward, held a short early lead, dueled on the main track, gained a
narrow advantage on the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and gave way. KNIGHT KINGDOM raced in mid pack, was
hustled along the rail on the turn but retreated in the final furlong. SOUPER CLASSY broke outward, was up close on the backstretch, dueled briefly then
forced the pace on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.
