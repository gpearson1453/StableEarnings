Footnotes
TRACI'S GREELEY was hustled clear at the start, widened through the first turn, continued on a comfortable lead into the far turn, was shook up into the
lane and opened her largest advantage then was ridden out to the end. ALLOUTPATRICIA hopped at the start, raced well back while in the two path, bid
into the lane and was closing in on the ridden out winner. LADY SPIDUTES was along the inside through the far turn, asked for more into the lane and
moved up for the minor share while not a threat. OVER THE BLUES chased the winner from the three path through the far turn then faded through the lane.
B DEB'S FORTUNE was never a factor while in the two or three path through the turns. HER GOLD MINE was off the rail through the turns when in touch
with the field then was empty through the lane.Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
DILLSBORO DEVIL was fractious loading resulting in loading sans jockey, pressed the pace from along the inside through the turn, remained along the
inside into the lane when quickly gaining the lead, cleared once straightened then drew away under intermittent urging. SUDDEN SHIFT was in the two path
through the turn and into the lane, gained energy inside the eighth pole and just got up for the place spot. GOOSING vied for the lead while in the two path
through the turn, came into the lane from the four path while relinquishing the lead, continued on in the runner-up spot then could not hold that position late.
JEFF THE RUNNER vied for the early lead then settled back to chase the top rivals, came into the lane from the four or five path then lacked a response,
weakening late. SHA KON O HEY was bumped twice at the start, raced in the four or five path through the turn then moved up while not a threat. BENNY
BOO BOO was close up early while in the four path, settled back through the turn and finished tired. RED PROMISE was never a factor while in the two
path. BOOK OF ROMEO was along the inside throughout and steadily lost ground. ALIAS REX stepped in at the start bumping inside rival two times, raced
in the three path while near the back and never was a factor. UNRAVELED was outrun while along the inside. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all
starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
RAINBOW JUSTICE chased the pacesetter from the four path, swung into the lane from the four or five path, gained momentum outside the eighth pole
then steadily drove past and cleared late. KEE SHE tracked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid with the winner from the three or four path in
the lane then was outfinished by that one. FEARLESS ANNA tracked three others through the turn while in the two path, continued in the two path into the
lane, shifted into the five path nearing the eighth pole then could not gain on the top two while gaining the minor share. EUROPUNKSTAR set the pace
while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane with a clear advantage then was suddenly done just after the eighth pole. GLOWED was along the
inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor. FLAT TIRE FAYE was in the two path through the turn when near the back and never had
an impact. PROPER SHE IS was done after a half while racing in the four to the three path through the turn. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all
starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
HERE COMES TREY set the pace from the outset, cleared into the backstretch, remained clear through the far turn and into the lane, was shook up when
straightening in the lane then held while remaining clear to the wire. STARSPANGLEDXPRESS was in the two path through the turns when never far back,
bid through the final eighth from the two path and was up for the place spot. MOONSHINE JUSTICE chased the winner from the three path through the turn,
continued closest to the winner with an eighth to go then could not gain while losing the place spot late. EXPRESSED raced in the three path through the
turns, was asked for more in late turn, came into the lane from the three or four path while under a drive then could not gain further while losing the show
spot late. PURPLE SHIRT was along the inside through the turns then offered a belated gain. NATES HEARTTHROB was along the inside through the
turns, cut the corner and had aim on the winner then lacked the needed kick while close to the rail. NUTTY TRAIN was in the two path through the turns and
never was a serious threat. OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS hopped and was bothered at the start, raced well back while saving ground then was indifferent during
the stretch run. THE STORY BEGINS raced in the two path through the far turn and never made an impact. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all
starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
GET ALONG pressed the pace three wide through the turn, bid entering the lane and slowly drew clear while in control. DEACON vied for the lead while
racing between rivals through the turn, was not a match for the winner near the eighth pole but kept on well to be clear for the place spot. BOO REID
bumped at the start, raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and finished evenly while best of the rest. GOLDEN
NOTION was near the rail through the turn when chasing the dueling rivals, continued into the lane from the two path and was never a serious threat.
ROYAL LEIGE vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane then weakened. NOT AGAIN JACKIE was in the two path through the
turn, angled widest into the lane and was never in it. AUSTIN RAY raced in good position early then steadily faded. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19
protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds. Per ruling dated 11/6/20 received from the Indiana Horse Racing Commission (ruling #2225), Get
Along was DQ?D due to a positive test.

IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME stalked in the four path, rallied at the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. ROCK OUT raced inside, bid at the
eighth pole but was no match for the winner. APSARA stalked the pace, faded but gained the show late. TYLER'S TYRONZA was off awkwardly, then
improved position late. COUGER saved ground to no avail. VARTON led to the stretch before giving way. LINK IN FRONT was through early. LA TAPATIA
pressed in the three path and gave way in the stretch. MARGARET DRIVE passed tired horses. SELENA KAN pressed the pace between foes before giving
