altered course to the inside of the runner up nearing the wire. POWERS OUT dueled between horses into the stretch then weakened. JUST CHESTER
failed to respond. TROMBONE EASTON was forced out at the start then never involved. REGAL CROSS bore out at the start then was no threat.

GOOD pressed the pace three wide, loomed boldly on the far turn then came up empty. GUCCISSIMO well placed, failed to respond. WYATTS WARRIOR
was no factor. MURTAGH contested the lead with the winner two wide into the stretch then folded.

Footnotes
BRIG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set all the pace and finished full of run under left handed urging to win going away. DOCSLUCKYCAT
chased the winner from the four path and finished clear for second. BISCUITS AND GRITS ran off in the post parade, was returned for a change in rider
then went evenly. TALE OF LACEY chased the winner from the inside and faded in the stretch. TO WIN failed to menace. OHIO CAUSE was no factor.
PEANUT POWER bore in at the start, was outrun and jogged to the wire.
