Footnotes
ON MARS settled early off the rail, went three wide into the first turn then got fanned five wide around the bend, moved forward and took command on the
backstretch, cleared past the half-mile marker, widened around the far turn and stayed clear ridden out to the wire. EMPRESS OF FIRE vied for inside a
pair of rivals through the first turn, lost the lead into the backstretch, chased inside a rival and saved ground into the lane, failed to make an impact on the
winner but was clearly second best. WARRIOR'S MOON vied three deep early, chased outside a rival then two wide into the stretch and proved no match.
PUSHING SIXTY stumbled leaving the gate, pulled early first time past the finish line through the clubhouse turn while moving out four wide, tracked three
wide around the far turn and weakened in the drive. KLEEN KARMA up close early between rivals, dropped back a bit on the backstretch, saved ground into
the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
MYSTERY MAN sped to the front to gain command, inched away around the far turn, then held off the late rally from CHARLITO in deep stretch.
CHARLITO bumped from the inside into the first turn, angled to the rail on the backstretch, traveled along the inside then angled three wide leaving the turn,
closed outside the leader but lacked the needed final kick. A. P. PHAROAH bumped rival into the first turn, stalked from the inside then moved a bit off the
rail, raced between rivals then entered the turn in the two path, steered out three wide around the turn and got up for the show. BIG MEL raced five wide into
the first turn then moved in a path around that turn, tracked off the inside up the backstretch, went three wide around the far turn then got floated out into the
stretch, could not find the needed rally but saved the show. SEICHE raced four then three wide around the first turn, stalked outside a rival then two wide
into the far turn and was through after six furlongs.

PSYCHO DAR sprinted clear from the inside, saved ground around the turn and cut the corner into the stretch, then held well in the late stages. VIA
EGNATIA angled into the two path while in range behind the leader, raced a bit off the rail in the stretch and took aim two wide in the drive, finished well and
kept gaining to the wire. MYSTERY MESSENGER stalked the lone leader from between rivals then two wide into the stretch, moved three wide in upper
stretch and finished evenly. SEVEN SCENTS chased from inside to the stretch and never produced a bid. PORTANDO off slowly, trailed the field off the rail
then moved into the two path entering the turn, angled out entering the stretch and failed to threaten. CONTAGION broke well then dropped back into a
stalking position, traveled three deep into and around the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
CONSTANTIA unhurried early on, advanced four wide around the far turn, had aim on the leader into the stretch, rallied to the front at the eighth pole and
held COVER VERSION at bay. COVER VERSION brushed with rival at the start, tracked outside a rival, in a bit tight between past the three-eighths pole,
rallied along the inside in the late stages but could not get by. UNBREAKABLE stalked the leader from inside, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out then
angled back to the inside near the sixteenth pole and gained the show. STARSHIP SKY off a bit slow from the inside, settled off the pace, angled four wide
around the second turn and showed a mild rally. SIENA SILK in range to the outside of the leader, took aim midway around the far turn, gained command
then kicked clear at the quarter pole, overtaken nearing the eighth pole and weakened. I GIVE UP tucked inside early, swung out into the stretch and never
threatened. SHE LOVES KARAOKE stumbled and brushed leaving the gate, recovered quickly to move to the front, set the pace inside up the backstretch,
headed at the five-sixteenths pole and folded in the lane. STAR KISSED stalked off the rail, raced three wide and between rivals into the stretch, shifted
inward in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
FIRST EMPRESS dueled outside of SAPPHIRE SILK, inched ahead past the half-mile point, pressure from both sides into the far turn, cleared rivals at the
quarter pole and powered away in the final furlong. SAMANDAH stalked off the rail, three wide into the far turn, lost ground around the bend and came
entered the stretch four wide, then came back with a mild response to earn the place. PASITO stalked along the inside, two wide around the far turn, angled
in at the eighth pole and got outkicked for second. SAPPHIRE SILK dueled for the lead from inside, pressed FIRST EMPRESS around the far turn then lost
contact approaching the quarter pole, drifted out at the eighth pole and weakened. APACHE PASS came away awkwardly at the start, raced three wide into
the first turn then tipped out a path nearing the backstretch, bid outside the top pair but could not keep pace with the winner at the quarter pole and faded in
the lane. MANRESA bobbled at the start, raced off the rail then angled in on the second turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GALILEAN stalked outside the leader, went three wide around the turn then floated out a path into the drive, drifted inward in the lane, closed in on the
ULTIMATE BANGO and got up. ULTIMATE BANGO shifted in at the start, dropped back and angled to the inside, remained along the rail and gained
command in upper stretch, led through the drive, battled with GALILEAN in deep stretch and was nailed at the wire. ROOKIE MISTAKE bumped both sides
at the start, stalked outside a rival then two wide around the turn, chased along the inside in the drive, lacked room and steadied inside the eighth pole,
angled out with a sixteenth to go and stayed on for the show. BAJA SUR stumbled and bumped with inside rival at the start, trailed along the inside, came
off the rail in the lane and passed a tired rival. MIKES TIZNOW broke out and bumped rival in the beginning, sped to the front, set the pace in the two path
into the turn then three wide into the lane, floated in by GALILEAN in the stretch and checked past the eighth pole and weakened after. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH GALILEAN DRIFTED IN AND CAUSED MIKES TIZNOW TO CHECK PAST THE EIGHTH POLE,
IT DID NOT COST HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
WEDDING GROOM away quickly from the far outside, moved clear and angled to the rail, widened around the turn and opened up under some asking and
was geared down late. COZY BEAR came in at the start, close early then dropped back to stalk off the rail, raced three wide around the turn then entered
the stretch four wide and edged rival for the place. INVESTMENT ACCOUNT tracked off the rail, came off the turn three wide and was edged for the place
honors. COJO forced in and bumped rival at the start, chased outside a rival then two wide through the turn and weakened. RED HOT CAT bumped leaving
the gate, taken back early, angled over near the inside, steered out around the turn and came four wide into the stretch, angled inward in upper stretch and
proved no menace. DETECTIVE BERNARDO off a bit slow to begin, moved up to chase just off the leader, dropped back on the turn, angled out into the
stretch and further out in the lane and weakened. LOVESICK BLUES off a bit slow and bumped both sides at the start, trailed the field into the turn, traveled
three then four wide on the turn and had little left.

Footnotes
I WILL NOT stalked a bit off the rail, angled three wide into the stretch and reeled in the runner-up. ZIPPER MISCHIEF up close early from inside, took a
short lead then cleared at the five-sixteenths pole, inched away leaving the turn, opened up in upper stretch but could not fend off the winner in the closing
moments. BRIX tracked off the rail, angled in on the turn, back out in upper stretch, came in some late and finished well along the inside for the show.
COALINGA ROAD stumbled badly leaving the gate, rushed up and vied between for command, lost ground around the turn but kept on and outfinished FLY
TO MARS for a minor award. FLY TO MARS chased outside a rival then between foes, went three wide around the bend and was outkicked for a minor
placing. CLAYTON DELANEY sandwiched between rivals leaving the gate, trailed early, angled out into the stretch and finished with late run. DREAMER'S
REALITY tracked thee deep, moved into the two path on the turn, angled to the inside in the stretch and lacked a rally. SHORT OF EZ vied four deep for
command, dropped back around the turn and weakened. GOLDIE'S HILLS shifted in and bumped rival leaving the gate, went three wide into the stretch and
was never a factor. GOLDEN DOUGHNUT tracked outside a rival, came off the turn five wide and weakened. SEE THROUGH IT broke out and bumped
rival in the beginning, sent for the lead and vied between for command, lost contact with the leader midway around the turn, chased two wide into the drive
and faded.
