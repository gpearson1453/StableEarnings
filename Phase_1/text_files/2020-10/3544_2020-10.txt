the lane but shortened in the final sixteenths pole and was caught at the wire. BLISSFUL CHANGE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the
lane and moved up in the stretch run. LONG MONDAY was steadied along the first turn, chased the pace, was on the inside into the lane with no final gain
in the stretch drive. FAST N FINE WORKER tracked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and tired down the lane. BETCHA BY GOLLY stalked

Footnotes
COLOR OF DAWN set the pace two wide down the backstretch before clearing an inner foe into the turn, showed the way along the inside around the bend,
held an advantage turning for home, but greenly tossed her head when the rider flipped up his stick approaching the three sixteenths pole, quickly regained
stride though and dug in to hold a lead from LATTE DOLCE passing the furlong pole, shifted a bit outwards passing that marker, brushed with that foe while
sharing the blame, and repelled her thereafter to win going away. LATTE DOLCE hesitated at the start, pulled to rush through the opening furlong to a
forwardly placed position by the five furlong pole, stalked from midpack in the two path around the turn before tipping four wide turning for home, grinded
away on her left lead in upper stretch to make a bid for the lead approaching the furlong pole while outside of a pair of foes, but drifted in subtly while just
clearing her immediate inner foe, brushed with COLOR OF DAWN with offsetting bumps inside the furlong grounds, and got repelled by that rival in the late
stages. ZOOM UP tracked from midpack four to three wide, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, vied between horses in
upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with those foes approaching the furlong pole, steadied when put to tight quarters passing that marker, then kept on to
secure show. TROUBLE MAKING vied along the inside of the eventual winner early on, took back to stalk from the pocket into the turn, saved ground right
behind the leader around the bend, but failed to keep pace with leading foes through the final furlong. LA PULCINELA tracked from midpack in the three
path, and failed to menace. CLASSIC TALE SAVER raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, and failed to factor. BLARNEY GIRL stalked three
to two wide, then between horses around the turn, but tired turning for home. PAPPY'S BEST GIRL was off slowly, trailed the field throughout, and got
outrun. Following the race, the rider of LATTE DOLCE claimed foul against the rider of COLOR OF DAWN, and the rider of ZOOM UP claimed foul against
the rider of LATTE DOLCE; both for interference in the stretch, but both were disallowed by the Stewards

AUNT NADINE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked from the two path while inside of a rival around the turn, forged place inside of SUGAR AND
SASS passing the quarter pole as that foe drifted out, then sustained a determined grind through the lane to wear down the clear leader approaching the
wire. SEQUIN dueled for the lead along the inside of SUGAR AND SASS while staying in the two path, drew clear from that foe passing the three furlong
pole, widened her advantage turning for home under her own power, responded to coaxing passing the three sixteenths pole and held her clear margin
through midstretch, but tired late, and was worn down by an oncharging foe in the final sixteenth. FIRST WAVE saved ground from midpack, then chased
the clear leaders through the lane without threatening them. SUGAR AND SASS bumped with an outer foe at the start, dueled for the lead two wide and
between horses down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart passing the three furlong pole, stayed in the three path around the
turn before drifting to the five path at the quarter pole, then subsequently tired. MORAVIA (GB) trailed the field, swung to the five path turning for home, and
passed tired foes without menacing. JADES GELLY raced off of the pace in the two path around the turn, but failed to make an impact. SENSE YOU LEFT
raced off of the pace outside of JADES GELLY around the turn while in the three path, and failed to factor. LEA'S PRINCESS vied outside of a pair of foes
early on, but chased them from the four path around the turn, and weakened turning for home.

BACKSHOT perched himself outside of the pair of leaders while racing in the bit, inched closer to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, shifted five wide
while forging an advantage passing the quarter pole, and gamely held sway under driving pressure through the lane. TAKAFUMI (BRZ) stalked along the
inside, waited racing room along the rail turning for home, then produced a mild kick to surge inside of foes in upper stretch once the rail opened, then
grinded away at the outer leader's margin through the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch him. FIRE MARSHALL BILL stalked the pace two wide
and between horses, shifted four wide turning for home, and produced a grinding rally between horses to reach show approaching the wire. MARKET
ANALYSIS was crowded between horses at the start, advanced from off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn to produce a bid for the lead
while being floated six wide passing the quarter pole, sustained a bid through midstretch while chasing the leader, but flattened out in the final sixteenth.
DUST DEVIL tracked from off of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, shifted five wide turning for home, and chased the leading group through
the lane without menacing. AND SEEK broke inwards, vied for the lead two wide and between horses around the turn, but failed to keep pace with outer
foes passing the quarter pole, and subsequently tired. PRIORITIZER set the pace along the inside, but shifted off of the rail turning for home, and was
swallowed up between horses in upper stretch. BOATING PARTY broke outwards, then trailed the field down the backstretch, was driven to advance in the
four to five path around the turn, but failed to do so and was outrun.

Footnotes
LADY LAWYER set the pace along the inside, spurted clear from a pressing foe passing the quarter pole, held a clear margin through midstretch, then
determinedly fended off QUICK WITTED in the final sixteenth. QUICK WITTED settled off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, then in the three
to four path around the far turn, produced a rally outside of foes through the lane to bid outside of LADY LAWYER in the final sixteenth, but was fended off
and denied. MY GAL BETTY stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader while trying to shift outside of that foe through midstretch, and sustained a
grind while getting outkicked by QUICK WITTED in the final furlong. SPEEDY SOLUTION stalked two to three wide, forged place at the three sixteenths
pole while the leader cleared off, but was outkicked by an inner and an outer foe for minor rewards passing the furlong pole. LESSONS FROM AVERY
saved ground far off of the pace, maneuvered to the five path through midstretch, but failed to menace. COMPLICIT trailed to midstretch, and was outrun.
WINTER SUNSET pressed the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, caved between horses at the three
sixteenths pole before the rider could move to driving pressure, and was eased thereafter. PER RULING# 20-0079 FROM THE KENTUCKY RACING

MAXINE'S TAP ROOM dueled for the lead three wide, cleared away from foes passing the quarter pole, widened her advantage under driving pressure
through midstretch, and was kept to task to the wire. HINDSIGHT hopped a bit at the start, stalked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, and
rallied on her left lead to claim place approaching the sixteenth pole. FOOLERY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked from midpack in the four path
and outside of foes around the turn, then stayed on through the lane to catch a tiring foe for show at the wire. MUCHO MACHO MOMMA dueled for the lead
two wide and between horses, but proved no match for her outer companion passing the quarter pole, then yielded through the final furlong and was nailed
on the wire for show. DEVILISH WIT dueled for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but gave way to them passing the five sixteenths pole. GENERAL GINNY
bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed the field in the three path before swinging to the five path turning for home, but failed to factor. GOLDIE'S
DELIGHT saved ground off of the pace and never got involved. CELESTIAL SPIN raced close to the pace two wide and between horses, but weakened
turning for home.
