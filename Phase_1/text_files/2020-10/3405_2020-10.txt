lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. LETSGOANDGETTHEDO chased the pace near the inside and weakened in
the final furlong. SKY had good early speed then faded. BELLA'S CHOICE was outrun. FAMILIA VIRTUAL was no threat.

PEARLS IN CHARGE prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, assumed command, set the balance of the pace and drew clear under right handed
urging. SWEET CHELSEA unhurried early, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished second best. BAY JA VU bumped at the start, trailed into
the far turn, entering the stretch in the four path, dropped inside past the furlong marker and was steadily gaining ground along the rail. HIGH CUPPER
failed to menace. SHACK'S HAREM drifted in entering the clubhouse turn bumping with DELIGHTFUL PRIDE, checked on heels, stalked the pace into the
stretch then gave way. DELIGHTFUL PRIDE bumped at the start, was hustled along the rail into the first turn, was bumped then in tight past the seven
eighths pole, had speed into the stretch then weakened. NUNS ISLAND broke in front, set the pace into the far turn along the inside then flattened out late.

SPIN DOCTOR dueled for the lead along the inside into the stretch, edged clear, drifted to the four path and lasted under left handed urging. CITY VOLUME
stalked the pace four wide and was steadily gaining on the winner late in the five path. DOC'S GOIN MOBIL saved ground and finished determinedly along
the rail. KOLE MAN CAN was in tight at the start, unhurried, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. PRADO COLORS dueled for the lead two wide into the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. NEVANS stalked the pace three wide and was through after a half. CELTIC LINE trailed, stopped at the head of
the stretch and was eased to the wire.

broke inward bumping the runner up, set the pace into the stretch near the inside then weakened. TOM T had good early speed along the rail, was bumped
nearing the turn then faded. EDGE prompted the pace into the turn then wilted. BELTON AVE was no factor. THE GOSPEL OF MARK failed to menace.
