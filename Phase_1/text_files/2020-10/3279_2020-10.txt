Footnotes
BEST OF YOU raced unhurried, saved ground on the turn, steadily gained up the rail in the stretch, angled out a bit late and passed the tired leader for the
win. LOVE YOU GOODBYE was sharp to the front, set a fast pace, held a long lead, was roused and kept busy in the stretch, shortened strides at the
sixteenth pole and had no resistance for the winner. MISS ELIANA was well back to the turn, got underway there, made up ground in the stretch and only
had enough to last for third. POWER BANKER chased from well back and managed a mild gain late. CACKI chased closest to the leader until the eighth
pole and faded. KAYLEE'S HOPE was always back.

last early, made an inside move on the turn, came up the rail in the stretch and outfinished a foe for the place spot. BAILESTON LASSIE held a clear early
lead, led to mid stretch, drifted out and was outfinished for the place spot, settling for show. PRINCESS ATHENA stayed well back and raced evenly.
AWESOME ONE tracked early but lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
QUIET NO MORE was last early, steadily advanced outside foes to the turn, moved quicker to lead at the quarter pole, was urged in upper stretch and drew
off as best. SANCTUAIRE SPOT was bothered after the start, stalked to the turn, moved well in the three path in tandem with the winner, was no match for
that one and just lasted for second. JIMA'S GOLD tracked from inside early, moved out for the stretch run, missed place and just lasted for show. PROM
THEME settled off the pace, gained in the lane but was kept from reaching show late. TANAGER raced mid pack, steadied in late stretch and lost position.
ROSEBUD'S TIGER led to the turn and faded at the rail down the stretch. LIL POM POM chased up close to the turn and faded. The rider of TANAGER
lodged an objection against PROM THEME and JIMA"S GOLD alledging interference in the stretch but it was disallowed by the stewards and no change
was made.
