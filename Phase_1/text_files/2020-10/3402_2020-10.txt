BANG THE DRUM, three wide, was carried wider into stretch, drifted wider under left handed pressure, was straightened and held on. DON'T MAKE IT
EASY, between foes dueling, fought gamely to the wire, just missing. STILL CHIEF eased to the outside, drifted wider through stretch and gained slightly.
THESE BLUES broke slowly, saved ground and tired. FIFTY was just off the rail setting the pace then tired.

willingly. MARKOFTHEMAKER forced the pace outside to the three eighths pole and faltered. GRANDFIRE broke alertly and was hustled to the front inside

Footnotes
MUNTAHEZ was off slow and then fanned out, raced along the rail, split foes on the final turn then went six wide into stretch and was just up. CURLIN'S
KNIGHT, three wide, moved closer to the rail edging away leaving the final turn, was clear mid stretch but was outfinished in a game try. MOUNTAIN TREE
came out after the start, raced wide, then was very wide into stretch and had no kick. ROYAL COUP, outrun early, raced and rallied wide but was too late.
ASBURY AVE, just off the rail, dropped back steadily. TRAFFIC TROUBLE saved ground just off the pace then tired. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN was very wide
and drifted wider under left handed pressure into and through stretch. BRILLIANT WORTH dueled for command between foes then tired. BREW DOG
showed nothing. YES IT'S BONIFIDE ran as fast and as far as he could then stopped.

KING'S HOUSE quickly took control, remained clear throughout while under a drive to the finish. BRIO MAN chased in the two path and closed the gap too
late. PEGASUS RED hustled in mid pack, raced wide in the stretch and finished well. BLINDING pursued the winner to the final furlong and came up empty.
KID MAC COOL saved ground off the pace, made a brief bid on the turn then flattened out. MY BERNIE broke sluggishly and lacked a solid rally. LUNAR
ROVER was urged just off the leaders wide and and faded on the turn. SUNRISE SATURDAY dropped back early and was never a factor. THE MONEY
TRAIN raced very wide and was always outrun. SMART RAGS was steadied and jostled in the opening quarter and gave way. NOT FAKE NEWS chased
far behind throughout.

FIRE'S FINALE raced between second flight, took up chase on the turn, drifted out under left handed pressure and was just up. GARBAN bobbled then
came in and bumped VOY A TI leaving the gate, recovered and was sent up to set the pace just off the rail, drifted in and out through the stretch and just
failed to last. CELTIC HEART, outside second flight, dropped back steadily. VOY A TI, bumped and forced in leaving the gate, saved ground and just lasted
for fourth place monies. GO SKIPPY GO, fanned in leaving the gate falling far back, was no factor.

Footnotes
KOAN eased back off duel after the quarter, rated, bid turn, rated, bid strongly on the final turn and drew off handily. QUALITY CHOICE trailed early,
advanced inside, swung wide in the stretch and closed well. IN EQUALITY settled off the leaders, moved very wide on the final turn and just up for the show
award. FLAT BILL lagged far behind inside, remained on the rail closing the gap. INFORMATIVE vied wide, led midway on the final turn then proved empty
in the stretch. SPEED SYNDROME dropped back early outside and lacked a rally. HAZ A NOTION earned a narrow lead inside for five furlongs and
stopped. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE dueled between rivals for half a mile and gave way.

Footnotes
I'M BUSY took the lead at once as the field left the starting gate twenty five minutes past scheduled post time, set the pace in the three path, repulsed rivals
and was was under strong handling to hang on. TRUE BOLDNESS saved ground to quarter pole, began to move outside winner entering the stretch but
then was steered back to the rail, closed gamely to just miss. SOLOMONIC raced widest and finished with good energy. HE IZ GONE was between second
flight, remained a factor to deep stretch then weakened late. MOON GATE WARRIOR, four wide and just off the pace, dropped back. CAPE MAY STYLE
was wide and never a serious threat. DELINQUENT showed nothing racing off the rail. GET THE W raced just off the rail and failed to menace.
