Footnotes
PUB raced close to the pace while saving ground, bid inside, dueled late and proved best. SILVER PONZI set a pressured pace, responded to duel late and
was outfinished in a game effort. STORMIN TEXASON got away well, stalked the pace, rallied three wide on the turn to loom a threat, leveled off and
settled for show. COMING ABSTRACTION was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a mild bid to improve position. FRED was never far
back, raced outside, bid five wide and came up empty. IRISH RHYME was reluctant to load, showed speed to the turn and stopped. JOHNNY'S BANDIT
failed to menace in an even effort. GOLDEN FLAME was reluctant to load, raced in the back and showed little. HUMBLE JUAN was off very slowly and
trailed the field.

QUATRO vied inside, drew clear into the turn and extended her lead under urging. ZIVA DA'VID pressed the pace while racing three wide, fell back into the
turn, continued willingly, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. BOSSY BABY held a good position while racing outside, rallied four wide on
the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, fell back and leveled off. STORM N GOLD raced in the back, offered a mild bid towards the inside and improved
position. NOTHIN BUT CLASS vied between horses, fell back into the turn, bid and came up empty. ALL STEAMED UP raced close to the pace along the
inside, fell back into the turn and lacked a stretch response. CARMON'S DANCE was not a factor. RUN LIKE KATE failed to respond. PARADISE N
REACH was off very slowly and failed to contend. SKY TWO NINE showed little.

Footnotes
DIVINE FAVOR raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn, bid six wide, was in tight and exchanged bumps in the drive, dueled late and prevailed.
LINEMANS CHECK raced inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, was in tight and exchanged bumps in the drive, dueled late and was outfinished. G M
GAGE was unhurried early, saved ground, closed steadily inside and gained late to get up for show. WILL TELL vied to mid stretch, inched away for a short
lead, was unable to sustain his bid and lost position late. DEVIL'S TEETH stalked the pace, was impeded and steadied at the top of the stretch, continued
willingly to the wire and didn't have enough late. MEMORY TAKER vied to the mid stretch, weakened and hung late. ABIQUIU was rated into the
backstretch and failed to threaten in an even effort. HOLY FRAZIER broke slowly, was unhurried early and raced far back early and passed tiring rivals.
MUSIC GIANT was not a factor. JUST PLUMB BOB failed to respond. The rider of LINEMANS CHECK claimed foul against the rider of DIVINE FAVOR for
alleged interference in the stretch. No change was made.

BENJAMIN WHO challenged three wide on the turn, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a long drive. CHEESE TRAY was roused into the turn, bid
five wide, dueled late and was outnodded in a game effort. ALVIS raced close to the pace inside, awaited room on the turn, bid willingly once clear, dueled
late and was outfinished in a good effort. WATFORD lagged early, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well. WHO'S LAUGHIN NOW was never far
back, advanced to the turn, closed well and didn't have enough late. ALEXANDER WHO was hustled along, led early, bid between horses on the turn to
duel for the lead, faltered late and lost position. A B LOOKER was never far back, saved ground and failed to rally. KEY TO THE CITY moved up inside to

Footnotes
ATHENA'S STORM showed good early speed, fell back and settled behind the pace, rallied on the turn, dueled three across through the stretch and proved
best. BAND OF GLORY vied inside, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. TAYLOR RAIN led early, vied two across, dueled
between horses through the stretch and yielded late, grudgingly. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was off a step slowly, advanced to the turn and lacked the
needed rally despite steady left handed urging. MISS EASYGO broke slowly, saved ground, lacked room in the upper stretch and came up empty once
clear. LAUGHING ROCKETT failed to threaten in an even effort. LUCKY T was outrun. ISABELLA WHO trailed the field.
