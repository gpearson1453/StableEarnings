early, went four wide into the turn, was no match and finished second best. POP QUIZ was allowed to settle early, raced seven wide and was along for the
show position. ALL CHROME was reserved early, made a three wide middle move and flattened out. SPINNING BLACK was unhurried early, raced six wide
into the turn, angled out and finished evenly. VALUE N FAITH raced in mid pack early, advanced between rivals and faded. MAGIC JOURNEY was taken
back early, went five wide into the turn and offered no late rally. PULPITS PHANTOM forced the pace from the inside and tired. SNOW IN THE NORTH was
void of speed and was no threat. TORRIE THE RAPPER was outrun early and was no factor. ELIAS CHOICE tracked the early pace, went six wide and
was empty.

Footnotes
IMPEACHING tracked the early pace, went five wide, took control at the eighth pole and drew off as an easy winner. JUSTANOTHERLOVE stalked the
early pace, raced along the inside, was no match late and finished second best. TIZ MY HOUR was not far back early, went six wide and was empty late.
RECOMPENSE set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail and tired. ZOE'S GOLDLADY raced in mid pack early from between rivals and faded. RUN
AND TELL DAT was taken back early, angled out seven wide and offered no late rally. LITTLE MISS MAGIC was unhurried early, raced between rivals and
never fired. MIND CHANGER was reserved early, circled eight wide and had no impact. ELECTRICK COUNTY was outrun early, went six wide and was no
factor. LETHAL ENTITY was void of any speed, circled nine wide and was no threat. MISS SPANKEY was allowed to settle early and flattened out. SALLYS
DANCER was finished early.
