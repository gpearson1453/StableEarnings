FLAT OUT BEAUTY was well back, whip urged early, chased in earnest from the quarter pole and closed well late to pass several foes for the win. SWEET
EVY GRACE veered out at the start, settled off the pace, chased from the three path on the turn and had late gain to take the place spot. CONJURING
stumbled at the start, vied outside a foe, led entering the stretch, vied that foe again and was edged for second by another foe. DOLLY DEAR showed inside
speed, vied a foe, dropped back on the turn, re-rallied to engage that foe again down the stretch and was edged late for show and settled for fourth.
GRADUATEWITHHONORS tracked from off the pace, got closer on the turn in the four path and lacked a late rally.

COUNTRY TAKE OUT had good speed and a clear lead, raced on the three path in the turn, was urged home and clearly best. JUST TAPIT IN brushed a
foe at the start, tracked well off the lead, made a run inside on the turn, gained on the rail in the stretch for place while no match for the wiinner. ENEMY
RUNNER bore out early, chased from off the lead in second, could not hold position in the stretch and settled for show. SHINE ON was unhurried, roused
on the turn and held position in the stretch. ONE CRAZY RIDE was brushed at the start and never close. TRUST AND OBEY was no factor.

Footnotes
NANO tracked, ranged up in the three path on the turn and grinded away down the stretch to get up for a late win. ZAFIR settled in second, vied the leader
on the turn, put that one away in the stretch but lacked fight nearing the wire. MAJESTIC VALLEY was off a step slow, gradually advanced, rallied on the
turn and drifted out late while holding the show spot. TWELVE ROCKS raced evenly and angled out for room in the stretch. UNCOMMON FACTOR led
under some restraint and needed more fight when challenged by a foe on the turn.

Footnotes
THE BIG GAMBLER bumped at the start, stayed back, rallied on the turn in the six path and had enough to push by late for the win. PLATE IT UP was in
range, on the move in the five path on the turn, got to second by mid stretch and kept on just enough to hold that position late. RIDGE WEST brushed a foe
at the start, raced off the pace, made a quick move on the turn, came widest into the stretch and emerged from outside a herd to take the show. ROAD OF
DIAMONDS was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, took the rail on the turn, loomed a threat mid stretch and leveled. BUCKEYE WARRIOR was last
to the stretch and had a good late gain. HEIDI'S SINATRA brushed a foe at the start, raced well back and improved position down the stretch. EL CHEAPO
was brushed by a foe at the start, widest on the backstretch, angled in to the rail down the stretch and lacked room. NAMBITI tracked just behind the leader,
was up close to the eighth pole and faded. ENTICING SHAQ showed good speed but ran out of gas at the eighth pole.

Footnotes
PERSONAL SERVER stalked three wide around the first turn before vying outside of FINAL TRUTH down the backstretch, took over passing the five
sixteenths pole, widened his advantage in upper stretch under driving pressure, then was kept to task to the wire. MESANGE tracked from midpack, closed
in on the leaders three wide around the far turn to produce a bid for the lead outside of PERSONAL SERVER at the five sixteenths pole, but proved no
match for that foe approaching the quarter pole, then held place from FIVE O'CLOCK through the lane. FIVE O'CLOCK raced far off of of the pace three
wide around the first turn, rallied four wide around the far turn to range up outside of MESANGE turning for home, then chased the loose leader through the
stretch, and failed to catch MESANGE for place. FINAL TRUTH set the pace inside of PERSONAL SERVER into the far turn, but weakened passing the five
sixteenths pole, and faded through the lane. LAST BRIDLE was off slowly, advanced inside of foes into the first turn, but steadied without incident at the
seven furlong pole, then was done early. GEN Z stumbled at the start, stalked close to the pace in the two path, but weakened after a half mile.

Footnotes
HERO OF THE BEST vied along the inside around the first turn before allowing FUN SUCKER to clear off into the backstretch, stalked that foe before
rebidding inside of that rival at the half mile pole as LUCKY BE A LADY forced his hand, held an advantage from multiple foes around the far turn, then
kicked clear in upper stretch, and held safely through the lane. LADY BLUE was brushed by LUCKY BE A LADY at the start, trailed the field before rallying
five wide around the far turn, circled foes turning for home to forge place approaching the furlong pole with multiple lengths to find on the clear leader, then
grinded away mildly at the that foes margin through the late stages. SHEESA PONTIAC vied two wide into the first turn, but came under a drive to keep
pace with FUN SUCKER and HERO OF THE BEST in the latter half of that bend, failed to do so and faded down the backstretch to be far off of the pace
around the far turn, then swung five wide turning for home while attempting a rerally, but was outkicked and shut off in upper stretch, then kept on to pass
tired foes in the late stages for a minor reward. FUN SUCKER rushed three wide around the first turn to clear off into the backstretch, but stayed off of the
rail, then was headed between horses approaching the nine sixteenth pole, chased around the far turn, and weakened in upper stretch. LUCKY BE A LADY
brushed an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack before making a three wide bid for the lead with a half mile to go, but was outmoved by wider foes
around the far turn, and tired therafter. SIERRITA ranged up four wide into the far turn to bid for the lead outside of a trio of foes at the five sixteenths pole,
but flattened out while getting outkicked by outer foes in upper stretch.

TURN TO ME SUCREE cleared off and set the pace in hand, got a breather down the backstretch before kicking away again from the chasing MACHINE
GUN MARRY passing the five sixteenths pole, then widened her advantage in upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire. MACHINE GUN MERRY
stalked the loose leader while consistently flagging her tail every few strides, inched forward into the far turn to produce a bid, but proved no match while
chasing at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out turning for home, and held place to prove second best. OSPREY COURT trailed four wide around the first
turns, advanced around the far turn to forge show passing the furlong pole, and leveled off without threatening. CANDY BIZZNESS raced off of the pace
three wide around the first turn, then saved ground around the far turn, but failed to factor. SMARTY ARTIE was forwardly placed three wide, tracked the
loose leader down the backstretch, but proved no match for the top two around the far turn before tiring through the lane. THROMBOCYTOPENIA wasn't a
factor. DELANEY FERRY was outrun.

Footnotes
ZOMBIE stalked four to three wide, bid for the lead turning for home, and drew off under driving pressure. RIDE INTO THE SKY lied close up to the pace
along the inside, and kept on to prove second best. SUMMERDUCK vied three wide early on, but took back into the turn, stalked along the inside around
the bend, shifted four wide turning for home, then chased on his wrong lead. UNCLE HAL set the pace two wide, but weakened through the final furlong.
STAY IN YO LANE was reluctant to load, then failed to make an impact. TRIPLE DELIGHT saved ground to no avail. HUGH B. tracked from midpack two to
four wide, but weakened turning for home. LIMEHOUSEGAS and. SEVENTYSEVENWILOW were outrun.
