Footnotes
ODIN'S STEED Stalked along the rail, responded inside, battled and under pressure got the job done. THERISASTORMBREWIN Set the pace along the
three path, two path on the last turn, left the rail open in the lane and was bested from the inside but finished clearly second best. BETA Well placed four
wide, three path on the last turn, tracked into the lane and weakened. COLORMEPAZZI Well placed along the three path, two path on the last turn and then
finished inside. DR. MARBOOZ Checked at the start, lagged back, three path on the last turn and failed to take part. SNEADS Four wide early, took the rail
up the backstretch to the quarter pole, eased out and tired. SOUL FIGHT Lagged back, two path on the final turn, was not a factor. TRY'N SMART'N UP
Well placed along the three path early, four wide on the last turn and tired. BUC'S INVESTMINT Four wide on the turns and tired.
