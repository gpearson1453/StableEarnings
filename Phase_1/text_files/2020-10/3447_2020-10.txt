Footnotes
RECKLESSNESS tracked the leading trio inside of BEE HAPPY ATTACK early, chased midpack three wide on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch,
rallied under a drive and got up in time. POCHO'S DREAM was slow into stride, settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, rallied inside in the
stretch and narrowly missed. LASTEN IMPRESSION came out at the start, disputed the early pace inside of FIGHT ON PENN, continued to dispute the
pace outside of DISTINCT THUNDER past the five eighths, edged clear past the three eighths, went to a drive in upper stretch, remained clear past
midstretch, but was caught in the final strides. ROCKET RIDE was bumped by LASTEN IMPRESSION in the opening strides, settled near the rear, was
urged between horses on the turn, came three wide into the lane, altered out near the three sixteenths after being bumped by WAR TRAIL, and rallied mildly
four wide. DISTINCT THUNDER tracked the leading pair in the opening furlong, came through to dispute the pace inside of LASTEN IMPRESSION past the
five eighths, was outpaced by that foe from the three eighths, and chased evenly late. PUNCHNGO chased midpack on the outside, came five wide into the
lane, and lacked the needed rally. BEE HAPPY ATTACK tracked the leading trio outside of RECKLESSNESS early, was pushed along two wide on the turn
to keep pace, proved no match for LASTEN IMPRESSION into the lane, and weakened in the final furlong. WAR TRAIL settled near the rear of the main
pack, was pushed along inside on the turn, came into the lane under a drive between horses, came out and bumped ROCKET RIDE near the three
sixteenths, and came up empty. FIGHT ON PENN disputed the pace two wide early, settled back to track the leading pair past the five eighths, lost ground
under a drive inside on the turn, and was no further factor in the lane.

Footnotes
BE AUTHENTIC broke readily, tracked just off the first flight outside a rival under light rating racing to the backstretch, angled inwards entering the far turn
while being prompted to gain some position, split foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch continued with a steady late response to wear down VEGAS
VIXEN in time under firm hand urging. The latter was urged to the lead while angling inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, resisted
the winner's challenge racing through the stretch but proved only second best. HUNTER'S HELLCAT tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the
opening half, swung out four wide racing into the far turn and continued to make mild progress to close the gap on the top pair. BROADWAY DUCHESS
settled last to the backstretch, angled outside foes nearing the lane and made an effort to improve position while no real threat. BIG LUCK tracked just off
the second flight to the backstretch, continued three deep to the lane but lacked a closing bid. SHES GOT ME GOING, held up between foes in the opening
stages, switched outside rivals on the backstretch to make brief progress three deep racing into the far turn but gave way nearing the lane. BURKHART,
reserved along the inside early, shifted out racing to the lane but failed to menace. HOLD THE SPENDING, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter in the
opening half, gave way racing through the far turn.

WAKE UP JOE cleared to the lead, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, raced clear through midstretch, and held sway under a drive. NYOMAN
settled three wide near the rear, was pushed along on the turn while still three wide, rallied outside under a drive in the lane and was gaining to the wire. BIG
SPORT tracked the leading pair early, pulled inside of GONEGHOST near the half, continued to track the leading pair while saving ground through the turn,
chased the leader into the lane while proving no match, and finished evenly. FORT RAMSEY settled near the rear while saving ground, and chased inside
down the stretch while no match for the top three. ANDREW THE GIANT settled at the rear, took closer order in the three path on the turn, and kept on
mildly three wide under a drive in the lane. GONEGHOST tracked the leader, was driven two wide from the three eighths to keep pace, proved no match for
the pacesetter into the stretch, and weakened between. JIMMY AT LAST chased the leading trio early, kept on midfield between horses around the bend,
came into the lane under a drive between horses, and faded. DURANGO KID settled near the rear between horses early, weakened between horses on the
turn and was no factor in the lane.

Footnotes
SIERRA HOTEL sprinted clear of the field along the rail racing to the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin past midstretch and just held the late
challenge of ALWAYS COOL under firm encouragement. The latter was rated inside foes just off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out in
upper stretch and continued willingly between foes to close the gap on the winner to the end. BIG MAN BOB, reserved off the second flight outside foes
racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort inside the top pair to gain position to the end. HIGH
HEATER, forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter from out of striking distance near the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the
leader racing into the far turn, drifted out racing through the stretch and faded in late stages. TORNADO BOY tracked the pacesetter between rivals in
second flight racing to the far turn and continued evenly into the stretch. GOOD INTENT, reserved last in early stages, swung six wide racing into the lane to
gain some position but made no real impression. LOST IN MANHATTAN settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and never mounted a
serious challenge. ROAR OF THE LION, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a
serious challenge. DONIVAN MY BOY was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch but faded early. OVERPRAISE
tracked the pacesetter three wide as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way on the far turn.

MEDAL OF FACT soon led, set the pace in the two path on the turn, and held safe under a drive in the lane. RAG TAG settled midpack, rallied four wide on
the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, switched inside of MEDAL OF FACT midstretch, continued his pursuit all the way to the wire but was held at
bay. FLORIDA TWO STEP tracked the leading pair inside of CLYDE'S GREEN GO, saved ground through the turn and into the stretch, switched three wide
midstretch, and chased on earnestly while no match for the top two. CLYDE'S GREEN GO tracked the leading pair outside of FLORIDA TWO STEP,
continued in range three wide on the turn, switched four wide into the lane behind the tracking flight, and kept on mildly three wide late. COCO BRAVADO
chased inside toward the rear early, kept on inside horses in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and kept on mildly inside

the lane, and flattened between horses in the final furlong. SPECIAL PRYCE settled inside in the rear group early, continued near the rear in the three path
on the turn, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. DEORA STORE settled toward the rear outside of COCO BRAVADO early, continued between horses
on the turn, and mustered no rally. SMART TRIAL broke out and bumped with FINAL CALL in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the three
path on the turn and made no bid. FINAL CALL broke in and bumped with SMART TRIAL in the opening strides, raced three wide toward the rear early, was

MIZ BLUE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the inside racing to upper stretch, drifted out despite firm right handed pressure in late
stages but maintained the advantage under pressure. WINNAGER tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, was held up avoiding tight quarters
entering the bend, continued in close quarters under reserve on the turn, came through inside foes midstretch, shifted out while moving to terms with the
winner late but was just outkicked. CHROME ATTACK tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, angled out four wide racing through
the stretch and prevailed for a share. GUEST IN MY HEART broke awkwardly, angled to the inside settling in last, saved ground on the turn, shifted out to
split rivals three deep and displayed some late interest while racing in traffic late. WILLOW MOON tracked just off the pacesetter between foes in second
flight, angled inwards a bit racing into the turn momentarily impeding WINNAGER, continued between foes past midstretch but faded late. RANK AND FILE,
raced three deep between foes in the last flight in the opening stages, angled to the rail entering the turn, was prompted to advance foes entering the lane,
was bumped while being carried in late and had no final kick. MOON OVER CABO settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, drifted while
avoiding some traffic near midstretch bumping RANK AND FILE and quickly came up empty. SUPERSTAR DIVA settled outside foes racing to the turn and
never gained contention. SWEET PRAYERS tracked the pacesetter three wide in second flight racing to the turn and faded between foes in that path late.
HONEY MUG tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was fanned five nearing the lane and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
TALES OF WAR broke tardily to race well off the field to the first turn while settling into stride, shifted outside rivals racing to the backstretch, gathered some
momentum while angling out seven wide racing into upper stretch and produced a stout rally through the final furlong to wrest the advantage in time under
firm left handed encouragement. BOXER BOY settled off the second flight while racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the
far turn, angled five wide racing into upper stretch steadily advancing on the leaders, struck the front between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner.
MUSIAL settled between foes near the back racing to the backstretch, angled six wide racing into the lane and continued with interest to gain position while
no match for the top pair. ITSALLABOUTYOU broke inwards bumping SATURDAYS HANGOVER, was righted to track just off the first flight to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide between foes racing into the lane but lacked the needed late kick. SATURDAYS HANGOVER, bumped at
the start, settled well off the field, raced last to the stretch and passed outside some tiring foes. HINTON, urged between foes pressing the pace into the
backstretch, dueled to midstretch and, gave out. ANGELINO broke in the air, then angled to the inside racing to the first turn, saved ground to the second
bend and lacked a rally. SIRCORRI, urged to dispute the pace inside foes on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, contested the lead grudgingly into the
lane and gave out in late stages. FORT RIDGE, caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked just off the leaders for a half, was urged to challenge three
deep nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. BUDDY BUD flashed brief pace between foes racing to the backstretch but faded early. SEBA'S
DANCER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch and came up empty nearing upper stretch.

HURTS SO GOOD set a pressured pace down the backstretch, led in the two path on the turn, went clear when asked into the lane, and drew off while kept
to the task. LUDINGTON settled in second last, rallied between horses on the turn, swung three wide in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, proved no
match for the winner but kept on best of the rest. JUST RUN broke inward, settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path on the turn, was taken four wide
in upper stretch, rallied but was outkicked for the place. MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH tracked the leading pair inside of DARK NINJA early, saved ground through
the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, and outpaced by the leading trio in the final furlong. VINCENT WILLIAM grazed the gate, broke outward,
pressed the pace outside of HURTS SO GOOD, tracked him two wide on the turn, proved no match under a drive in upper stretch, and weakened two wide.
DARK NINJA was pinched back in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, was urged while chasing three wide on the
turn, and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
BINDING TIME tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, advanced on those rivals racing four deep into the turn, went clear racing
into upper stretch while angling to the inside and widened the margin under pressure. SAINT ALEXIUS tracked just off the first flight along the inside through
the backstretch, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to prove best of the others. TRANS MISSISSIPPI, unhurried along the rail
in early stages, angled out racing three deep between foes entering upper stretch and improved position outside rivals prevailing for a share. LIPLINER
tracked off the first flight outside foes in early stages, raced five wide into the turn, then to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. AMAZING ANNIE
broke slowly, angled to the inside on the turn but passed only tiring rivals. I DON'T WANT TO GO, caught in close quarters just after the start, tracked off the
first flight between foes into the bend, was shuffled avoiding REND LAKE BABY racing into upper stretch and offered no rally. JAM UP angled inwards to
prompt the pace three deep racing to the turn, dueled between foes in that path on the bend and gave way in upper stretch. WARY CARRIE broke sharply,
forced the pace between foes on a narrow advantage racing into the turn and gave way into the lane. REND LAKE BABY tracked off the second flight
between foes in early stages, swung six wide into upper stretch, drifted inwards while going erratically entering the lane impeding I DON'T WANT TO GO
and had no closing bid. MINGO MAGIC hit the gate at the start while breaking awkwardly, raced well wide of the field to the turn and never seriously
menaced. TANGO'S KITTY, urged inside foes pressing the pace into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch.
