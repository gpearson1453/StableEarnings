Footnotes
I'M MACHEN TOO set a pressured pace to the far turn saving ground to clear along the inside in upper stretch digging in from the two path hanging on at
the end. GREAT PLAN tracked evenly to upper stretch firing a sixteenth out surging boldly in the three path. RED ALERT prompted from the outset chasing
into upper stretch hanging late in the two path. TARNISHED JUSTICE slow early rallied into the far turn swinging out into upper stretch bidding all out in the
five and six paths. BIBBO bobbled as the rider lost his irons near the eleven sixteenths pole, regained shortly after chasing to upper stretch finishing evenly
on the rail. CONFECTION FORTUNE stalked close up to the far turn then weakened in the four path in upper stretch. JOYEUX was never involved. MY
TOMMY BOY gave early retreat. BALTIMORE COUNTY was always outrun.
