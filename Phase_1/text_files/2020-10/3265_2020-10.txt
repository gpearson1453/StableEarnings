MY THREE KIDS was never too far back, rallied around rivals on the turn to take a clear lead past the furlong pole but was all out to hold. BEE EINSTEIN
dueled early from off the rail, was outrun by the winner into the lane but kept to her task to the line. UNUSUAL DANCER settled early, came in the three
path to the stretch and went evenly. HOLA CHICA raced unhurried early, was two wide on the turn then lacked the needed rally. SALONIKA'S BABE dueled
from the inside and gave way nearing the stretch. WOMEN BEHIND RACIN failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LE MAJESTIC broke in stride and dueled from the inside to mid turn, edged clear and held his advantage gamely. LEMON DROP SHOT broke sharp and
was allowed to slip back, loomed three wide on the turn and upper stretch but hung in the lane. GALLANT GUY pressed the pace three wide and weakened.
FATHER O'FLAHERTY showed good speed to the stretch but lacked a closing response. STALKING SHADOW was never a factor. LIGHT MY TIGER was
a brief factor from the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
EXHALTING broke alertly and made the lead without need of urging, drew off on her own into the lane and extended her advantage as much the best.
JOYMAKER showed speed from the outset but could make no impact on the winner. KITTY'S CANDY settled early, saved some ground on the turn but had
no rally. FLOAT ON prompted the winner early but came up empty. SEA SAILOR was off slow and never a factor. GARDEN IN THE SKY broke slow,
showed some early speed from the inside but was through on the turn. THEYREMINISCEOVERU settled early, raced three wide and faltered.

Footnotes
BABY FRANKIE was permitted to settle early, came three wide on the second turn, rallied with determination and was up in the final stride. NOWHERE
MAN raced close up throughout, rallied to lead in the deep stretch but could not hold the winner. STONE GROOVE pressed the pace two wide and was
outfinished. MOST DETERMINED saved ground but did not rally. MAD AT MONEY lagged early, came three wide on the second turn but lacked the
needed rally. REY COLIMAN showed little. TREASURE HUNTER set the pace from the inside to the stretch and gave out.
