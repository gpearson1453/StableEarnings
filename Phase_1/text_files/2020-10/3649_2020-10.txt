Footnotes
LONG BEACH KID set the pace a bit off the rail, received a bump from DASSULT MIRAGE in deep stretch, stayed on his left lead and held firm for the
decision. DASSULT MIRAGE pressed LONG BEACH KID from outside, came in bumping that rival just past the sixteenth-pole, and settled for second best.
PARTY OF NO broke slowly, saved ground on the turn, shifted out in the stretch and offered a mild response. THE WILD FLYER raced two to three wide,
and lacked the needed rally. THE CAPTURED STAR saved ground and could not menace on his left lead. NINJA raced two to three wide, and made no
impact. REMENDADOR stayed in range four wide for a half-mile, and tired. THIRSTY'S PRIDE was always outrun. LITTLE STORM GODS broke slowest,
and showed little. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF DASSULT MIRAGE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH
WAS NOT ALLOWED.

inside of the pacesetter near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL set the pace in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane,
yielded near the sixteenth pole and held well clear of the rest. PLATINUM FROLIC was bumped just after the start, raced off the pace two and three wide,
angled to the rail in midstretch and was along for the show. MAKE ME LAUGH broke out and bumped CAJUN LADY at the start, chased the pace three
wide and lacked a rally. ICY KISS stalked the pace three wide, bid nearing the lane then weakened through the stretch. COMPETITIVE SPEED played no
factor while racing four wide. DANCING EMPRESS was bumped soon after the start, chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. CAJUN LADY

Footnotes
STARSHIP BLANCA bumped with MISS WROTE at the start, advanced three wide after a half-mile, took over from outside passing the quarter-pole, drove
well clear, and kept LA GATA NEGRA at bay late. LA GATA NEGRA broke inward and was off three lengths or so behind the field, circled five wide
beginning to get in gear through the latter part of the turn, closed with good energy but could not reach the winner. TERRIBLE TARA raced three wide
around the turn in the middle of the field, rallied mildly and was well clear of the rest. MISS WROTE bumped with STARSHIP BLANCA at the start, vied
inside for a half-mile, and weakened through the lane on her left lead. MYSTIC MOON contested the pace outside MISS WROTE into the turn, reached a
short lead near the three-eighths pole, but tired into the lane. LOOKN FINE AS WINE hit the right side of the gate at the start, lagged well back early, and
improved past tired horses. MYSTICAL CHARGE made no impact two wide. JEANIE VEE was outrun inside. HONOLUA BAY raced forwardly three to four
wide early, and tired through the stretch. BETTIN ONNA KITTEN showed brief speed, and was through before going a half.

Footnotes
HARD WEST settled off the pace along the inside, cut the corner into the lane, reached near even terms approaching the eighth pole and drove clear late.
DECKOLOGY stalked the pace three wide and finished willingly to get up for the place in the final strides. MONEY COME pressed the pace two wide
between foes, took the lead near the quarter pole, battled between rivals through the lane and was outfinished. YOUNG RAYMOND settled off the early
pace while racing two wide, angled out near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. STEADILY failed to menace while racing four wide. LONDON
WEREWOLF chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. MR. CESCO was bumped at the start, raced three wide and played no further factor.
BAHAMIAN PRINCE was outrun while racing three wide. CONGRATS THAT set the pace along the rail and tired after a half. RED NATION was bumped at
the start, chased the pace four wide and was through after a half. WHO'S IN CHARGE played no factor while racing three wide. IBERICO hit the gate, raced
four wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
AYCAPOTE set a pressured pace inside, responded well through a long drive and edged away late. SENZAZIONE pressed AYCAPOTE from between
horses to the stretch, could not get by, and held the place. YADI worked his way inside on the first turn, shifted back out three wide with aim at the leaders
nearing the top of the stretch, and was outkicked. IMA COALMAN went along in the second flight for six furlongs, saved ground into the stretch and finished
evenly. POWER (BRZ) raced four wide around the far turn, and lacked the needed bid. MIKE IS READY pressed the pace three wide, and gave way soon
after going six furlongs. GIMMEABREAK was never prominent. ALRAHAAL lacked room and steadied entering the first turn, moved out four wide on the far
turn, and could not gain. JUAN BOLY was finished after a half-mile inside. EXATLON was always outrun. ROAD TO PEACE raced four to five wide, and
tired after six furlongs.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY FELLA stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under a drive.
HANDSOME PRINCE lacked early speed, made steady progress four wide around the turn, loomed outside of the winner in upper stretch but was no match
for that foe in the final furlong. HARPER GO LUCKY settled off the pace while racing two wide, swung to the far outside in upper stretch and was along for
the show. TRIBUTE FLAG broke slowly, rushed up inside down the backstretch, chased from the rail around the turn and weakened in the lane. VALID
EXCHANGE saved ground off the pace, angled out in midstretch and never threatened. EL ZEUS chased the pace two wide and came up empty in the
lane. HAPPY DANZA set the pace in the two path and gave way near the quarter pole. AT THE BEACH hit the starting gate and was never involved while
racing in the three path. RODEO RED was outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
FRONT LOADED advanced two to three wide approaching the stretch, challenged for command outside TOWN CLASSIC through the furlong grounds, and
edged clear after a late duel. TOWN CLASSIC brushed with INDIMAAJ near the three-quarter pole, vied outside GETTHE MUNY BERNIE up the
backstretch, drew clear midway on the turn, fought back when confronted by the winner coming to the eighth-pole, and yielded grudgingly. ALEJANDRO'S
TEAM broke two or three lengths slow, moved inside rallying in upper stretch, but could not sustain the bid. INDIMAAJ got jostled around between TOWN
CLASSIC and AFRICAN HERITAGE leaving the chute, tracked three wide to the end of the turn, and faded. SEMPER FI reared at the start spotting the field
four lengths or so, and never recovered. AFRICAN HERITAGE brushed with INDIMAAJ for a few strides after about a quarter-mile, and tired three wide
after a half. GETTHE MUNY BERNIE vied early inside TOWN CLASSIC, and retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
VICTORY CRUSADE was bumped hard at the start, dropped well back inside, angled out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up in deep stretch.
REAGAN'S ROSE stalked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied between foes, took a brief lead late but was overhauled in the final
strides. ADDILYN set the pace in the two path, drew well clear around the turn, held clear to the sixteenth pole then just lasted for the show. SAMMIE
SUNSHINE stalked the pace three wide, bid between rivals nearing the midstretch and was outkicked. BARGAINAIRE failed to menace while racing four
and five wide. CHEZ PAREE was shut off at the start, dropped well back, raced off the rail and played no factor. FURIA VIKINGA (CHI) stumbled, bumped a
foe and lost the rider at the start, galloped ahead of the field through the wire and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE
START AND TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
SENSE A MILLION bumped with AUBURN after the start, advanced around the turn three wide, bid outside REITERATE and NENITA into the stretch and
drove clear through the final furlong. NENITA bumped lightly with MYSTIC COMIN HOME at the start, pressed REITERATE from outside early, reached a
short lead in mid stretch, could not match strides with the winner and barely held second. AUBURN bumped with WILD ABOUT THIS at the break, then was
in tight between that one and SENSE A MILLION a couple strides later, raced well out of it near the three-path for a half-mile, shifted out wider in the stretch
and closed fast to just miss the place. MERMAID KISSES raced two wide in range to the stretch, and lacked the needed closing bid. REITERATE set the
pace inside, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. RANDIABBY lagged far back to the lane, and passed tired horses. MYSTIC COMIN HOME
bumped lightly with NENITA at the start, raced three to four wide, and tired approaching the stretch. UPSY DAISY DO broke slowly, trailed to the stretch,
and passed stragglers. FIAMMA MAMMA showed early speed inside, and faded after a half. DONA CAMILE saved ground to no avail. SURPRISE
ARRIVAL was through early. WILD ABOUT THIS bumped with AUBURN at the start and again shortly after that, and was outrun four wide.
