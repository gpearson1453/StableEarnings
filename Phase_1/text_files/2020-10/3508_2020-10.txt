Footnotes
GUSHER set the early pace then was joined by outside rivals heading into the turn, vied inside those just off the rail, edged clear in the stretch and held. W
F RIP TIDE broke outwardly, stalked the early pace from outside then three to four wide and between foes on the turn, proved no match for the winner but
was second best. WHISKEY LAUGH CAT pressed the early pace from between runners, dropped back two to three wide early on the turn, kept on in the
lane to secure show honors. DEVILS WORKSHOP broke awkwardly and slowly, shifted in, went on or just off the rail through the turn and came out to
improve position in the lane. DOCTOR TINK broke awkwardly then was urged forward outside rivals, went four to five wide on the turn briefly putting a head
in front before weakening. DIABOLICAL MIGHT tracked from on or just off the fence, lacked the needed late bid. CLABBERS WIN switched off the inside
going in the three path on the turn and failed to threaten. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SASSY GAL broke inwardly a bit, was mildly coaxed forward inside, bid up the rail inside a rival to take charge just past the eighth pole and drew clear.
DESTINY WHO settled just off the rail at the rear, came out six wide at the top of the stretch and gained the place. RAGTIME RYTHM set the pace in the
clear racing in the two path, was challenged in upper stretch, had no extra and lost the place late. FLOWER N BLOOM was forced out at the break, shifted
in and settled last but one, went in the two to three path through the turn and improved position in the stretch. INDIAN SECRET broke outwardly, stalked
from outside foes four to five wide on the turn then weakened. THE PACESETTER stalked three to four wide and between rivals on the turn, weakened
theraefter. SHAME ON BEA tracked close-up about two to three wide, steadied ever so slightly about the seven-sixteenths and moved out on the turn to be
six wide coming past the quarter pole, was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MORE SMORES was floated four to five wide heading into the first turn then eased back and moved in a bit to track three to four deep, advanced three to
four wide on the far turn, struck the lead outside LEIGH WHO in upper stretch and drove clear. LEIGH WHO raced well outside and off the pacesetter in the
three to four path into the first turn, edged closer up the backstretch, took over outside that rival about the three-eighths, was clear past the quarter pole,
drifted out a bit leaving the far turn, was no match for the winner but held the place. AMBERS STORM settled off the leaders along the inside, began to
advance some up the backstretch, came out on the far turn into upper stretch and was best of the rest. COWGIRL DOM set the pace inside, was overtaken
entering the far turn and gradually weakened. ROYAL QUEEN was caught six deep into the first turn but moved in a path on that bend stalking the pace,
was in attendance just off the leaders up the backstretch, lost ground into the stretch and ran on mildly. CONNIE'S LINDA failed to threaten racing mostly
four to five wide on the turns. MCFANCY shifted in two to three wide early then further still to be along the rail on the second turn but failed to produce a bid.
PRINCESS NICOLE failed to threaten while racing off the inside primarily in the three to four path. LADY SUZZETT chased from outside four to six wide into
and on the first turn, began to drop back after half and gave way.

Footnotes
WEST DAWN set the pace with outside pressure but just off the rail into the turn, drifted out a bit leaving that bend and edged clear in upper stretch then
continued to extend the margin. CERVEZA stalked from between rivals then outside, went four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to gain the place.
ATTILIANNO bumped the outside rival at the start, pressed the winner three wide on the turn floating out four deep out of that bend, lost place in late
stretch. EVACUEE was bumped between rivals and steadied slightly at the start, advanced inside up the backstretch, saved ground and missed show
honors. DESERT DANGER raced outside foes up the backstretch into the turn, went five to six wide on that bend and failed to rally in the stretch. ARCH
CITY bumped the inside rival at the start, chased in behind two to three wide into and on the turn, failed to rally. GO NOW GO failed to threaten racing in the
three to four path on the turn. SHAME ON POWERS chased briefly five to six wide, dropped back entering the turn and moved out a bit further, came up
empty. MASTERCLASS shifted in from outside six deep to the four path on the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BRICKBAT broke a step slowly then was urged forward inside rivals up the backstretch, challenged the leader on the turn, edged clear in upper stretch,
drifted out in mid-stretch and widened the margin. LODESTONE set the pace from off the inside, battled two to three wide on the turn, was no match but
second best. LORELEI'S WARRIOR was outpaced into the turn racing inside, saved ground and gained show in the lane. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER
bumped the outside rival at the start, was up close two to three wide up the backstretch, lugged out in upper stretch and could not kick on. KEATON was
within range early three to four wide, failed to rally. SUN TREADER was bumped at the break, raced off the inside in the four to five path on the turn and
failed to produce a bid while improving position. NEW YORK PROUD shifted in to race in about the three to four path on the turn and failed to threaten.
MYSTICAL PASSION chased from outside early, went about four wide on the turn and came up empty. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION OPENING
