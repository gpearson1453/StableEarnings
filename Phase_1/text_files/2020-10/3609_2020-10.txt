Footnotes
TAPERINEA stalked the pace from the three or four path into the far turn, gained momentum into the turn, bid two wide in late turn, dueled for the top spot
into the lane, cleared once straightened and kept to the task to the end. MISS FORT was in the two path through the turns when never far back, came into
the lane from the three path and offered a mild rally to gain the place late. TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN set the pace while near the inside into the turn, was
joined by the winner in late turn, dueled with that one into the lane then could not keep up and lost the place spot late. SWIFT TEMPLE was checked along
the rail mid-way through the first turn, tracked the pacesetter into the far turn then weakened. MAMBACITA was in the four to the three path through the
turns while in position then tired. IMA BARREL RACER was in the three path through the turns and never factored. REVS RUN was along the inside
through the turns and was never a menace. ALLIE MAES REVENGE ran off three-sixteenths of mile before loading in the gate, raced near the pacesetters
into the backstretch then was done before entering the fa turn. RHAPSODY IN GREY was bothered at the start, settled to the back and was never in it.
BICKERMENTS was done after traveling a half from the two path.

Footnotes
EMPIRE'S SCORE chased the pace while along the inside through mid-turn, bid two wide into the lane, caught the leader nearing the eighth pole and
moved right on by to be well clear at the end. COLONEL HUBERT set the pace while near the two path through the turn, was joined by the winner while
straightening in the lane, still on near even terms with a furlong to go then could not keep up while staying on for the place spot. HE'S A WARRIOR was off
with a slight hop to spot the field several lengths, was under right-handed urging near the five-eighths pole in an attempt to rejoin the field, continued to trail
into the and through the turn, stayed in the three path into the lane, split rivals near the eighths pole and finished with good energy. NUTTY TRAIN was in
the three path through the turn while in the second flight, angled into the seven path for the drive and gained momentum through the final eighth. KULMER
was three wide through the turn when a serious contender, came into the lane from the four or five path and weakened. DONT ASK KINMON was between
rivals through the turn while in the two path then lacked a closing response. OUR NEIGHBOR BOYS chased the pace from the two or three path into the
lane then faded. EXPRESSED was never a factor while racing near the inside. BRAVO EXPRESS chased the early pace four wide into the turn then
steadily faded.

Footnotes
CAKE INA CAN was off alertly to gain the lead at once, widened into the first call, continued clear through the turn and into the lane and widened under a
drive. PAWN chased the pace from the two path through the turn, was asked for more in late turn and entering the lane, was no match for the winner while
being passed for the place spot then kept on to regain that spot late. TIZ ABBY was unhurried while in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from
the two path and moved up along the inside and was closing in on the place spot. BETRAYAL chased the pace from the three path into the lane, moved up
to be closest the winner with a furlong to go then was empty late. JACK'S FINALE was in the two path through the turn and never was a threat. IRENE was
checked just after the half mile pole to avoid a rival, raced in the three path through the turn and never was a factor. BLAZING FIREFLIES was in the three
or four path entering the turn, got out into the nine or ten path and was not persevered with after angling back into the lane.

Footnotes
SKYVALUE set the pace while in the two path, widened down the backstretch, was under pressure in late turn, re-cleared into the lane, widened to the
eighth pole and continued to be well clear late when being geared down the last fifty yards. ENGLISH ESCORT chased the pace along the inside through
the turn, angled into the four path entering the lane and moved up to be clear for the place. NOBLE ALMA chased winner from the three path through the
turn, came into the lane with aim on the top one and lacked a closing response while losing the place spot late. GOLD INCLUDED was in the four to the
three path through the turns and tired. WEST VIRGINIA PAM chased the pace from the three to the two path into the turn and was done near the
three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
A FEW TOO MANY vied for the lead through the turn, with three others while two wide, gained a short lead into the lane, was under pressure with a furlong
to go then gamely held. PRIVATE UNION raced four wide through the turn when never far back, swung into the lane from the five path, moved to the winner
near the eighth pole and loomed a serious threat then could not get past while finishing second best. DIRTY JUSTICE vied for the lead along the inside
through the turn and into the lane, had an open rail after straightening and lacked the needed finish. COMPASS POINT chased the four rival duel through
the turn while racing in the two path, angled into the five path entering the lane then lacked a closing response. PUNCTUATION was in the two path through
the turn and into the lane, shifted from the two to the five path inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining at the wire. INDIGO RICH vied for the lead three
wide and between rivals, continued in the three path into the lane then weakened. ALTERED was along the inside through the turn and offered a belated
gain. RED LIAISON raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and never was a factor. TIP UP TOWN was in the three path through the turn
and never was a factor. INDIANA RED was slow to get going and made no impact. TIZSUCCESS was shut off and subsequently checked soon after the
break and was never in it thereafter.

STAGE FRIGHT stalked the pacesetter while in the three path into the far turn, was asked for more nearing the quarter pole, cleared into the lane then was
kept to the task to the end while well clear. CARSON'S PRINCESS was in the two or three path through the far turn when never far back, came into the lane
from the five path, hooked up with the place rival with a furlong to go then edged past that one late while not a threat to the winner. PRINCESS D'ORO
chased the pace from the two path through the turn, moved closest to the winner into the lane, could not gain on that one then lost the place spot after
dueling inside the eighth pole. LUCRESSIA was never a threat while racing near the inside. GOD WINK set the pace while in the two path then gave way
once headed turning into the lane.
