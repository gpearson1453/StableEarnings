TURBO DRIVE raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane, rallied down the lane, was three wide late and prevailed at the wire.
JUSTINTHENICKOTIME chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, made a late bid in the stretch from between horses but did not have
enough at the wire. BRING ME A CHECK set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, drew clear in the stretch but yielded late in the drive.
MIDNIGHT JOSTAR was unhurried early on and raced along the outside, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch and finished willingly in
the late stages. FRONT MAN tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. MISHKO chased the pace early,
was on the inside into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. HOMBRAZO stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and
leveled off late in the stretch. LASTCHANCEATGLORY was in the four path into the lane and empty down the lane. MOM SAID YES was never a threat.
SIR WINSALOT was pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
GOLD STANDARD tracked from midpack along the inside, inched forward around the turn to loom from behind the leaders and in the pocket at the five
sixteenths pole, tipped three wide passing the three sixteenths pole, and rallied to drive past the leader in the final sixteenth. ISTAN COUNCIL stalked two
wide, bid for the lead approaching the quarter pole as HIGH REGARD ranged up alongside, repelled that foe passing that marker and drew clear in upper
stretch, stayed clear through midstretch, but was surpassed by GOLD STANDARD in the final sixteenth. HIGH REGARD rated off of the pace three wide
early on, rallied four wide around the bend to produce a bid for the lead outside of a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, but was repelled by ISTAN COUNCIL
passing that marker, and leveled off. GOODBYE EARL set the pace along the inside while feeling pressure from ISTAN COUNCIL, but was headed by that
foe and HIGH REGARD passing the quarter pole, and gave way thereafter. QUEEN NEKIA tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but was
outmoved by an outer foe around the turn, tipped four wide passing the quarter pole, but lacked a rally and failed to factor. AUNT HATTIE (IRE) trailed early
on, and never got involved. TIMELESS CURLS stalked three wide, but came under a drive approaching the three furlong pole, failed to respond, and
weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
PHANTOM CURRENCY cleared early on, managed a clear margin down the backstretch, then vied inside of JUMPER while holding a lead around the far
turn, drifted to the four path turning for home to float that foe wider, repelled his counterpart in upper stretch, drew off, and was geared down passing the
sixteenth pole. JUMPER stalked along the inside around the first turn, shifted off of the rail into the backstretch, inched forward to vie outside of PHANTOM
CURRENCY around the far turn, got floated to the five path by that foe turning for home, then was awkward to change leads in upper stretch, which
contributed to him getting repelled, and proved second best. COUNTER OFFER trailed around the first turn, advanced three to five wide around the far turn,
rallied through the lane, and prevailed over BOURBON IN MAY for show. BOURBON IN MAY saved ground far off of the pace, shifted three wide turning for
home, rallied inside of COUNTER OFFER through the lane, but missed show to that foe. GOLDEN DRAGON stalked two wide, then between horses
around the far turn, forged show passing the five sixteenths pole and cut the corner turning for home, but tired through the lane. PEEKACHO tracked from
midpack in the three path around both turns, and failed to make an impact. CELERITY raced far off of the pace in the three to two paths around the turns,
and never got involved. KINENOS hesitated at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide around the first turn, advanced into the backstretch to achieve
inside stalking position passing the five furlong marker, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MINUTE WALTZ tracked from midpack six wide, rallied in the four to five path around the turn to produce a bid for the lead outside of foes turning for home,
drew clear in upper stretch, and was kept to task under driving pressure. LITTLE BLAZE lied forwardly placed five wide early on, tucked down to the two
path into the turn to track behind the leaders, inched forward around the bend, but was blocked behind those passing the five sixteenths pole, tipped four
wide turning for home and stayed on to claim place while not threatening the leader. AMUSING ANTICS prompted the pace four wide early on, bid for the
lead turning for home as MINUTE WALTZ rallied stoutly alongside, but drifted in in upper stretch and got outkicked by that foe, then was bested for place in
the late stages. ANOUSH raced far off of the pace along the inside, passed the quarter pole in the three path, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, and
rallied. HAPPY SUCCESS raced far off of the pace two wide, took the turn in the three path before tipping to the five path turning for home, but leveled off
through the lanne. FAIR GAME trailed early on, shifted from the four path to the six path turning for home, and stayed on for a minor rewrad. MILANA raced
off of the pace two wide, faded around the turn to trailed the field passing the quarter pole, then passed tired foes through the lane. TAQSEEMAAT dueled
for the lead three wide, but was headed by outer rallying foes at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. BOLD FIGURE pulled keenly early on to
vie for the lead inside of a pair of foes, but weakened turning for home. EASY TO BLESS dueled for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened
without encouragement or perseverance from the rider at the quarter pole. HYPERNOVA raced off of the pace along the inside, and was done early.

Footnotes
BETTER WITH AGE was off slowly, raced far off of the pace three wide, rallied four wide around the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole,
dueled outside of TREATY OF PARIS through the lane, and prevailed. TREATY OF PARIS was off a step slowly, stalked the trio of duelers down the
backstretch, split the tiring pair of that group at the three furlong pole, bid for the lead inside of BETTER WITH AGE at the five sixteenths pole, dueled
gamely through the lane, but was bested by her outer counterpart. CONOLOWAY trailed along the inside, split tiring rivals two wide at the quarter pole,
shifted four wide through midstretch, and stayed on late to gain on the leaders. ENGLISH dueled for the lead two wide and between horses into the
backstretch, drew clear of those foes into the far turn, but was headed by a pair of rivals at the quarter pole, and gave way. COLONEL ABY B took a
stuttered step at the start, raced far off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three to five path, and failed to menace. TWITTERPATED dueled for the
lead inside of a pair of rivals, but failed to keep pace with ENGLISH into the far turn, and weakened. KISS MO rushed around the first turn to duel for the
lead outside of a pair of rivals, but failed to keep pace into the far turn, and weakened.
