Footnotes
MERGE took command at once, moved two wide to a clear lead nearing the quarter pole and was under urging to the end. BERMONDSEY wasn't far back,
came out three wide approaching the lane but couldn't gain. JAIME JAMEL came out into the five path on the turn, improved position into the stretch but
lacked a strong closing. MY CANDY BIZ wasn't far back outside, angled four wide on the turn and came up empty. MAC AND BREEZE was slow early, was
bumped between horses in early stretch then made up some ground. KULP break a few lengths behind the field, lagged into the stretch, came out before a
half, bumped MAC AND BREEZE and failed to menace. COHODES was fractious in the gate, pressed inside the winner into the turn then tired.

SOUPER CATCH showed speed along the rail, moved clear leaving the backstretch and widened under urging. PAL CAL came out three wide while
tracking the leaders on the first turn, was bumped entering the far turn, edged closer nearing the stretch then flattened out. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN was slow
early, raced the three path around the final turn, made a mild run past tired ones through the stretch and was up for the show. SNOOP was slow from the
gate, angled out into tight quarters between horses nearing the end of the backstretch, bumped PAL CAL entering the far turn, moved closer before
three-quarters then flattened out. BIG BLIND was outrun. QUENCH MY THIRST took command at once, made the early pace outside the winner and was
finished after five furlongs.

MANAHAWKIN was slow early, circled into the stretch, finished fast outside and was along in time. CAMGO moved three wide to command before a half,
was put to intermittent whip once well clear in the final furlong but was caught. CHEESE ON broke sharply, raced along the rail while with the pace into the
turn, fell back and continued evenly. SKY GAZER R V F was slow early, raced wide into the stretch and lacked a closing response. IT'S THE JOURNEY
was outrun after a slow break. CONQUEST PRANKSTER showed speed, moved two wide to a short lived clear lead into the turn then tired. GET A
VALENTINE had early position along the rail, came out two wide on the turn then stopped. WRONG BEN was in tight between horses midway on the
backstretch, came out into the three path entering the turn then stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
MY TRAIN steadied along the rail early on the turn, continued inside while rallying into the stretch and took over nearing the final sixteenth. BIG DAVE broke
slowly, trailed early then split horses with a strong late run. DUPREE was slow early, raced three wide around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and
gained outside late. INTERCEPT sped to the front at once, moved clear from the inside midway on the backstretch, came out entering the stretch and faded
between horses. CALCULATED THINKIN wasn't far back two wide between horses into the final furlong but lacked a closing response. TEN HUT circled
into the stretch and couldn't gain. GONE INZANE advanced three wide on the turn then tired. LET ME GO FIRST bumped with PRAY WITH FAITH leaving
the gate then was outrun. PRAY WITH FAITH bumped with LET ME GO FIRST leaving the gate, moved between horses to chase the early leader, stopped
in the lane and was eased up late.
