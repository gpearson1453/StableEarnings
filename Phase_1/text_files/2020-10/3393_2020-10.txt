STEAL MY HEART Well placed four wide, continued four wide on the turn while three across contesting the lead, shook clear in the lane and widened some
under the whip. MISS CIRCULAR GAL Broke slow, well placed along the two path entering the turn, took the rail into the lane, eased out and finished well to
earn the place. CHAYSENBRYN Checked in the chute, saved ground on the turn and rallied inside. PENDOLINO Four wide on the turn and then made a
late wide bid. CLIFDEN PUNCH Forced the issue, between on the turn into the lane, chased and faded. A DAB WILL DO Broke slow, two path on the turn
and failed to gain. RIGADOON Three path around the turn and tired. SPIRIT OF LIFE Broke slow, rushed out to contest the lead along the two path to the
lane and gave way.
