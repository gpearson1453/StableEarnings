MUSTA NEVER MET U took over leaving the chute and rated the pace inside, came under pressure into the turn and was steadily handled through the
lane. WHAT ABOUT SHORTY gave chase inside and rounded the turn at the rail, then dueled through the stretch for second. MAXIMO STRONG gave
chase and rounded the turn at the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. FORT SUMTER broke through prior the start then picked up the chase
toward the outside, rounded the turn in the five path and passed rivals in an even finish. TAURIAN hesitated at the break and dropped well back from early
contention, rounded the turn about the three path and raced evenly through the lane. CELTIC MISSION gave chase outside, raced in the five path of the
turn and showed little in the lane. JUST GO WITH IT chased the pace and rounded the turn about the four path, then weakened.

Footnotes
CENT COMM broke a step slow then bore out on the opening turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, but, started a slow, steady bid from the
three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the six path and got up the final yards. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE stalked the earlier pace in the three and
four paths and raced toward the outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide approaching the
quarter pole, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught the final yards. SOCIAL MEDIA rounded the first turn in the five path and raced
outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and had range on the leaders in the four path of the far turn, though, finished evenly. ZALZA
rated a slim lead inside but was met leaving the half mile pole and gave up the advantage, recovered the edge nearing the five sixteenths pole, was caught
toward the quarter, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride. EDDY DIRT stalked three wide the first turn and drew to even terms leaving the half
mile pole, took a slim lead shortly afterward but was caught toward the five sixteenths and faded on the far turn. STEPS TO GLORY stalked the early pace
two deep while between horses, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, then weakened in the three path of the far turn. This race was hand
timed.

Footnotes
OUT OF CENTS stalked the pace off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and dueled with the advantage past the pole, contested the edge off the rail
on the far turn, gave up the nod leaving the eighth pole but dug in while lugging in under a right hand drive and determinedly took the nod through the final
strides. TO THE FRONT tapered to the inside to rate the pace, was caught past the three eighths pole and gave chase from that point, rounded the far turn
at the rail, recovered the lead inside the eighth pole and dug in gamely, while grudgingly yielding the final strides. PARTY LIFE stalked the pace off the rail,
bid leaving the three eighths pole and angled out toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the three path, came between horses past the eighth
pole but was shut off and checked off the heels of the errant, Out Of Cents mid-stretch. LOOKIN' SMART settled off the pace and raced toward the outside
into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then angled to the four path entering the stretch and finished well.
NATURAL ODDS raced off the early pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced four wide on the far turn then weakened
inside the eighth pole. JEFFERY SCOTT raced well off the pace and entered the backstretch outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the four path and showed little more. CUBIC SOUND showed little response through the backstretch. The Stewards posted the inquiry and
reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Out Of Cents, lodged by the rider of Party Life, and consequently, disqualified the former to third place for
lugging across the path of the latter mid-stretch.

WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY stalked the pace two deep, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the lead past the pole, raced clear at the five
sixteenths, was steadily handled from that point and widened to mid-stretch then coasted the final sixteenth. NOVA BOY saved ground off the pace the first
turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, but had to settle for second best. TOTALITARIO settled off the earlier pace in
the two and three paths, bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path and was along for third inside the sixteenth
pole. SAVAGERY angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and was caught past the pole, gave chase from
that point but dropped back at the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. DYNAFORM raced off the pace in the two and three paths and
showed little response. WILD ABOUT DEB raced outside into the backstretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS stalked the pace inside the first turn, eased out with a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the front in the three
path approaching the head of the lane, dueled clear inside the eighth pole and widened under steady handling, then taken in hand later yards. HOW IS SHE
was shuffled back at the start and rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily progressed in the four
path of the far turn and was along for second the final yards. MISS GRANDSTANDER stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled to a slim lead past the quarter, was caught approaching the head of the lane then flattened out the final sixteenth. C V'S
CAMPFIRE angled in to save early ground then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the five path of the far turn, swung to the outside entering
the stretch and flattened stride. MY EMMALLY rounded the first turn in the five path and raced outside entering the backstretch, picked up the chase from
the three eighths pole, raced in the six path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION rated a short lead and came under
pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was caught past the quarter then faded at the rail leaving the far turn. LADY LICIOUS broke outward then
stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, though, weakened in the four path of the far turn. GATTOLOTTACHARM
saved ground off the pace the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. CASTLE OF CAYLEE was through after a half mile. QUINCYS
WAY raced well off the pace.

Footnotes
ANOTHER VICTORY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and angled to the five path approaching the top of the stretch,
dueled to the front mid-stretch and was drawing away later yards. COZZE CAT rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled off the pace into
the backstretch, started his move from the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn about the six path, then dug in through the stretch to get up
for second the final yards. REFORM SCHOOL settled off the pace about the three path the first turn then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, raced close in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly. FREE DANCER angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the
quarter pole and raced at the rail through the far turn, drifted out across the path of Fiber And Emily under left hand urging in the upper stretch, was caught
at the sixteenth pole and flattened stride later yards. FIBER AND EMILY steadied into the first turn then stalked two deep through the turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, was shut off and checked off the heels of Free Dancer approaching the sixteenth pole then faded. RUSH TO THE CASTLE
hesitated at the break and raced well back while saving ground early, bid mildly from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then steadied off
the inside flank of Fiber And Emily approaching the sixteenth pole. OSKAR BLUES dropped well back early on and raced outside into the backstretch. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Free Dancer, lodged by the rider of Fiber And Emily, determined that the infraction also involved Rush
To The Castle, and disqualified Free Dancer to sixth place.
