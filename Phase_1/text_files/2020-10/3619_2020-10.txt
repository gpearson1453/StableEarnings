OH MARVELOUS ME chased the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and edged away through the final yards. WINDRIBBON
broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner late but finished with a steady bid. CATFISH HUNTER
was bumped at the break, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished willingly. MAKAH LANE lacked early foot, raced
three-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. HOLLYWOOD HEAT was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, saved ground through
the turn, steadied through the final yards and lost chance for better placing. PAPA'S GOLDEN BOY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the
pace, increased his advantage through the turn and began to shorten strides through the final furlong.

Footnotes
VICENTE'S SHADOW stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage with a furlong to run and was fully extended to hold AERO STREET
safe late. AERO STREET lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and again in mid-stretch and
finished with good energy. BEARCREEK MOUNTAIN disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final sixteenth. WILSON TO
LOCKETT was off a step slow and clipped heels, raced unhurried, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good courage. RENO ROY was
away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. WICKED WINNINGS was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive.

ABRAA JABRAA was away alertly to duel for the lead from off the rail, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete authority. FORTUNE
IN SILK was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to gain on the winner late. WHATA
FLIRT was off a step slow and bumped, raced unhurried early while saving ground through the turn, angled out and back inside in mid-stretch and finished
evenly late. PERFECT BLOSSOM chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. SHELBY R. settled off the leaders early from
between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not offer a bid. MISS MONIQUE was bumped at the break, lacked
early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BABY ROCKS broke awkwardly, was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not threaten. GOLDEN DELIGHT broke sharply to dispute the early fractions while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
GENOA BAY broke sharply to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker, responded when challenged
into the lane and drew clear. LOOK AT MY STAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole but could not get by the winner in the drive. IF I HAD A NICKEL tracked the winner from the inside, angled out into the stretch and
failed to gain late. JACKSON TELLER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
evenly late. BROMANCE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. RACE OFFICE was off a step slow, raced unhurried
early, moved three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. DEMERARA was away in good order to press the pace while racing four-wide and
weakened after going three furlongs. SLEET AFLEET chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going three-eighths.

Footnotes
JERRE TO CARRIE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, opened a clear margin nearing the half,
increased that into the lane and held IF YOU WANT IT by a diminishing margin. IF YOU WANT IT was bumped at the start, lacked early foot, angled out
nearing the quarter and was gaining on the winner late. LOOKOUT TAYLOR raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished
with a steady bid. CONSTANT CRAVING was bumped at the break, lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the
stretch and finished evenly late. NOUMEA settled off the leaders early, dropped back nearing the half and was not a factor. BISHOPS OF COMPTON was
forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. CLASSIC LEAH chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going six
furlongs. TOMORROW'S MINE showed brief speed and weakened.

Footnotes
SMASHING SUCCESS pressed the pace of JADEY AT THE BAR while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker,
opened a clear lead in mid-stretch and drew off. NATIONAL HEROINE was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled
out into the stretch and finished with good energy. CARDS N COFFEE pressed the pace while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain in the drive.
SECRETS OF MY SOUL was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late. CLOCKER'S CHOICE showed no early
speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with late interest. JADEY AT THE BAR set a pressured pace and
gave way after going a half. CHANTE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and failed to rally.
THECHAMPISFLORING lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. COMRADERY was void of early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. GLOA JEAN was forwardly placed, checked nearing the half-mile marker and weakened thereafter.

SOVEREIGN NATION sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when challenged by TRIBAL IMPACT nearing the quarter,
re-cleared and drew off through the lane with complete authority. IRISH SWING was allowed to settle early, raced three-wide through the turn and finished
with a steady rally. TRIBAL IMPACT chased the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the quarter and failed to sustain his
bid. WINNING BLUFF showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with late interest. PAMPER ME NOW settled off the leaders
early, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. MOJAVE broke in the air, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and did not menace. FLAT OUT FEISTY broke sharply to chase the winner while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
MAYBEE A DIVA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted
through the lane and drew off as a handy winner. PINCHALINCH was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out
further into the stretch and was up for the place. A GOOD SNICKER was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, was no match for the
winner in the drive and gave way late for the place. EASY DOES IT chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going five furlongs.
AUNTIE CHIANTI lacked early speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. MERRY MARIE settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. PAJAMA QUEEN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. LA PRINCIPESSA
raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened. ROI OUI was void of early speed, checked nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and did not offer a bid. HELEN FIRE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. BEAZEE BOLT was bumped
at the start, pulled up and walked off.
