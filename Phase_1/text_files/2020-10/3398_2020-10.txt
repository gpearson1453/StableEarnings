Footnotes
JILLS PASSION was away alertly to clear at once, remained on a clear advantage through the turn, widened into the lane then was kept to the task to the
end while clear. WEIGHTLESSNESS was unhurried while in the two path through the turn and into the lane, bid from the two or three path through the
stretch and was gaining to the end to settle for second best. LUCY TOO chased the winner through the turn while in the three path, was no match for the top
two but kept on to last for the show spot. J D'S GIRL was in the two path through then turn when in mid-pack, bid into the lane and lacked a response.
MAST COVE was along the inside through the turn, came off the rail into the lane and tired. BENTEN was off in good order, settled to near the back and
showed little. GATO STYLE was in the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path then drifted to the nine path while never
in it. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds

Footnotes
THATSWHATITHOUGHT pressed the pace two wide through the turn, moved to the front entering the lane with minimal encouragement, was shaken up a
bit approaching the sixteenth pole and was ridden out to the end while widening. BIG FUDGE chased the pace from the two to the four path through the
turn, came into the lane from mid-track, was no match for the winner but kept on to be clear for the place spot. ORIENT MAGIC was in the two path through
the turn while near the back, came into the lane from the three path and moved up to the show spot. OSCAR P Q was near the rail while well back through
the turn, raced in the two path through the lane and showed late interest and just missed the show spot. BARRIER set the pace from the two path through
late turn then gave way. SHADOW OF JUSTICE made little impact while in the two or three path. A LITTLE IRRADIC was in the four path through the turn
and was empty turning into the lane. AN INDIANA NIGHT raced close up early then steadily faded along the inside. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19
protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds. PER RULING FROM THE INDIANA RACING COMMISSION, ORIENT MAGIC WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
GOOD FIRST stalked the pacesetter from the three path into the far turn, lost contact with that one into the lane, kept on through the lane and closed quickly
as the pacesetter shortened up then cleared late. MOUNTAIN KING tracked the pacesetters while in the two path through the turn, came further off the
inside into the lane, was grinding on after straightening and closed quickly late. LEND IT TEWMEY set the pace while near the inside through the turn,
widened on the pursuer after straightening in the lane, continued clear inside the eighth pole then suddenly shortened stride and despite a strong ride could
not last. K RULES was never a serious threat while racing in the three to the two path throughout. BODE'S LIGHT saved ground into the lane and moved up
while not a menace. SOL DEL SUR bobbled slightly at the start, raced along the inside into the far turn, was asked for more near the three-eighths pole,
ridden hard into the lane then was done. COUNTING COUP steadily faded along the inside. OLD WORLD ORDER raced in the three path into the far turn
and was done. WEAPON was done near the half mild pole while near the rail. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional
three pounds.

Footnotes
PRESCIENCE was unhurried while saving ground through the far turn, angled into the six path when gaining momentum into the lane, continued with strong
energy from mid-track and just was up. FORBIDDEN FRUIT was unhurried while along the inside, came off the rail late in the far turn, came into the lane
from the three path, angled into the two path to split rivals, gained the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was outfinished at the wire. BREWSKY was in the
four to the two path through the turn when not far back, took aim on the leader into the lane, was inching up late when outfinished by the top two. APRIL'S
NO FOOL tracked the leaders from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path, gained the lead with an eighth to go then could not
hold the top ones safe. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was in the two path through the turns and lacked a closing kick. STRONG ILLUSION tracked the pace from the
two path through the turn and into the lane then weakened late. BEAUTILICIOUS was in the two or three path through the first turn, raced in the four path
through the far turn and into the lane then was not a factor. FIRST SQUADRON pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, put a head in front near the
three-eighths pole, continued with a short lead into the lane and was empty after straighening. AZIPASS set the pace near near the quarter pole then was
empty turning into the lane. MYSTICAL JUSTICE was never a factor while in the three path through the far turn. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols,
all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
LIBERTARIAN was unhurried while near the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the three path, moved up into traffic, waited briefly before
angling into the two path and finished with good energy to be going away at the end. SIDNEY'S RANSOM pressed the pace while two wide into the turn,
moved to the lead after mid-turn, slowly widened the advantage while straightening in the lane, gained his largest advantage with a furlong to go then was
no match for the winner late while keeping on to save the place spot. LOVE THAT SURPRISE was in the four path through the turn and in the five path after
straightening in the lane, stayed on well to gain the show spot while not a threat to the top one. FEELING IT chased the pacesetters from the three path
through the turn, had aim on the top ones in the lane then weakened. SHARP ART was last away, raced in the four to the two path through the turn,
continued in the two path through the lane and never was a threat. HIGH ESTEEM was never a factor while moving from the two to the four path through
the turn and racing widest through the lane. ITS JUST FATE set the pace into the turn, dueled into the lane then gave way along the rail. RUNMALIBURUN
was outrun while along the inside. UNCLE MOMO was done early while in the two path and was found to have bled post race. Per Stewards, due to
COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
PEARL TIARA pressed the pace two wide through the turn, was asked for more entering the lane, quickly cleared then extended while drifting from the four
to the eight path under left-handed urging. HOPE SHE CAN led early then settled off to chase the pace from the three path through the turn, continued to
chase the winner through the lane to no avail while settling for second best. MISS FORT was well back through the turn while along the inside, continued
along the rail through the lane and moved up while not a serious threat. EYE FLIRT was near the rail through the turn and into the lane and lacked a bid.
SECRET EXPRESS pressed the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane then faded. PORKETTA chased the pace early while in the three
or four path then tired through the stretch. AMA LUCY raced in the three path through the turn and passed tired ones. BLUESKIESATNIGHT was in the two
path through the turn and lacked an impact. EMBROILED raced in the five to the four path through the turn and made no impact. PERFECT SMOKEY EYE
pressed the early pace while in the four path, settled back to chase the others then faded. LIGHTUPJUSTICE was always outrun. BICKERMENTS was well
back throughout. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocals, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.
