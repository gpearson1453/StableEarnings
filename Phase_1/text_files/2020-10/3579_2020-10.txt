U. S. DANGER controlled the pace from the outset, responded in the stretech and extended his advantage driving. DUB TOWN chased the winner
throughout without making an impact. DEBT MONGER offered a threatening bid three wide on the second turn but flattened out. OUTRIGHT was never a
factor. UNION LEADER was always outrun. PROSPICIENCE refused from the gate.

Footnotes
EXHALTING sprinted clear early, set all of the pace and had little trouble holding his advantage. DOC ADAMS was never far back, raced three wide on the
turn to come on but never seriously threatened. LE MAJESTIC was slow early, raced in the two path on the turn and finished with some speed. MY
FATHER FOOTSTEP stalked the winner from the rail, was blocked behind that rival on the upper turn but made little headway once in the clear. CORSICAN
pressed the winner two wide and slackened. BIG DUKE showed little.
