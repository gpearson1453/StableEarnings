Footnotes
EASTERN SYMPHONY stalked the pace early three wide, was in the four path into the lane, continued three wide down the lane under a long drive and
prevailed at the wire by less than an inch. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS set the pace early from the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane, drifted out near
the eighth pole while under a long drive and just missed by a hair at the wire. BIG BIZ tracked the pace early while between horses, was in the three path
into the lane, continued from between horses down the lane but was bothered and was steadied near the eighth pole and weakened late in the drive. MY
NAME IS PHRED broke awkwardly from the gate, chased the pace early from the outside, was in the four path into the lane and moved up. FLORIDA
FLASH chased the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. DANCE AN IRISH JIG was through after a half. SONIC

Footnotes
YELLOWSTONE GIRL set the pace early on, cleared the field near the five sixteenths pole, was off the rail into the lane, repelled a bid in the stretch and
cleared again in the final stages. BERTRADA chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but hung in the late
stages. SHE'S FOREVER tracked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and finished willingly late but not enough for place. SPY A STAR
chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. HOT DAME came out at the start, stalked the pace early, was
in the three path into the lane and faded late. KENTUCKY PRIDE was steadied at the start and no factor thereafter. SACRE BLEU was through after a half.
MISS SKY CAT was done early.

Footnotes
IN LOVE (BRZ) saved ground off of the pace, commenced a rally in the two path around the latter half of the far turn before swinging four wide passing the
quarter pole, produced a good kick to run down the clear leader at the sixteenth pole, and won going away. FALKIRK set the pace along the inside, drew
clear in upper stretch, maintained a clear margin through midstretch, but was caught at the sixteenth pole while well clear of show. BAKERS BAY was
bumped by an outer foe at the start, but achieved perfect inside stalking position through the stretch for the first turn, tipped three wide to be outside of the
leaders passing the five sixteenths pole, but only produced a mild kick in upper stretch, and got outkicked by IN LOVE (BRZ) at the furlong pole. LAKE
NAKURU hopped a bit and was pinched back between horses at the start, saved ground while trailing into the far turn, hugged the fence and advanced
inside of foes turning for home before shifting to the four path in midstretch, then rallied willingly for a minor reward. PICASSO saved ground from midpack,
attempted to shift out turning for home, but was outkicked and shifted back inwards in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and chased the leaders home. BUY
ME CANDY raced off of the pace two to three wide, and improved past tired foes through the lane. JUGGERNAUT prompted the leader from the outside,
but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the quarter pole, and weakened between horses at the furlong pole. BENELUX was off very slowly, got rank
into the first turn and shifted off of heels to the four path, stayed unsettled around that bend, then failed to factor. CARAMELITO tracked from midpack two
wide and between horses around the far turn, but never got involved. LEMON KICK was a bit washed out pre-race, stalked the pace two to three wide, but
was fanned five wide turning for home and weakened thereafter. MARSHALL LAW (IRE) raced far off of the pace three wide, got caught in the four to five
path around the far turn, and failed to factor. MAJESTIC RO broke inward and bumped multiple foes, then raced off of the pace four to three wide around
the first turn, advanced to midpack into the backstretch, but weakened in the four to five path around the far turn.

Footnotes
INSPECTOR FROST set the pace outside of CEES GET DEGREES early on, cleared off from that foe at the five sixteenths pole, held a loose margin in
hand around the turn, then responded when set down approaching the three sixteenths pole, kicked further clear, and safely kept TIWANAKU at bay
through the late stages. TIWANAKU save ground off of the pace, advanced inside of foes passing the five sixteenths pole before tipping three wide
approaching the quarter pole, then sustained a strong rally through the lane to prove second best. MAZZINI trailed the field in the three to five path around
the turn, and willingly produced a mild rally to surpass tiring foes for a minor reward. WICK raced off of the pace three wide, then got outfinished by an outer
foe for minor rewards while besting tiring inner rivals. BIG POWER RED was off very poorly, raced far off of the pace along the inside around the turn, then
split foes three wide at the furlong pole, but was outfinished by his outer counterparts. CEES GET DEGREES vied inside of INSPECTOR FROST early on
before allowing that foe to clear off at the five furlong pole, stalked from the inside around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the three sixteenths
pole, and weakened thereafter. BEATBOX stalked early on, came under coaxing into the turn to take aim on the clear leader from the outside, held position
before being put to an all out drive approaching the five sixteenths pole to keep pace, but failed to do so passing the quarter pole, lugged in when put to
right handed pressure in upper stretch, and weakened thereafter. WAR MACHINE tracked from midpack in the two path, but weakened between horses
passing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MOTAGALLY stalked the pace from the three path while perched outside of the leading pair, inched closer to bid for the lead into the far turn, forged an
advantage with five sixteenths to go, then drew clear turning for home, and safely held sway from SHARECROPPER through the late stages.
SHARECROPPER stalked along the inside, shifted from the two path to the four path while inching closer inside of foes around the far turn, then sustained
a grinding bid through the lane, but was fended off by the clear leader through the late stages. FIRST RATE tracked from midpack two wide early on, then
chased the loose leader from from the four to five path and outside of foes around the far turn, but was outkicked by an inner rival turning for home, then
stayed on to claim a minor share. INDIAN COUNSELOR saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, pulled to midpack between horses approaching
the five furlong pole, then chased the loose leader from the three to four path around the far turn while between horses, but was outkicked by both of those
foes turning for home, and stayed on. PAYNTER PARTY raced far off of the pace while staying in the three path around the first turn, but chased leading
foes willingly through the lane without menacingg. MAGIC MICHAEL hopped a bit at the start, then prompted the pace setter two wide, vied between horses
into the far turn as MOTAGALLY ranged up along side, cleared an inner foe around that turn, but was headed by his outer counterpart at the five sixteenths
pole, and weakened in upper stretch. LOOKIN HIGH never got involved. VASARIANO was sent early on to set the pace along the inside, but was headed
by a pair of foes into the far turn, and wilted thereafter.

Footnotes
BLAME DEBBIE set the slow pace along the inside, lobbed along while holding an advantage down the backstretch, dug in while feeling stern pressure from
ALWAYS SHOPPING around the third turn and turning for home, the dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane, but never let her past her
throatlatch, and held tenaciously. ALWAYS SHOPPING stalked the loose leader from the outside, inched closer down the backstretch to vie around the third
turn, commenced a duel turning for home while reaching her inner counterpart's throatlatch, battled gamely through the lane as that foe dug in, but never
forged an advantage and was outgamed to the wire. WITH DIGNITY stalked along the inside around the first two turns, tipped three wide to be outside of
the dueling leaders turning for home, but failed to keep pace with those rivals in upper stretch, chased them thereafter, and fended off an inner foe for show.
OVER THINKING got rank into the first turn behind the slow pace, saved ground around the bends, then produced a mild rally inside of WITH DIGNITY
through the lane, but failed to reach that foe for show. SIBERIAN IRIS (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide around the first two turns, then from the three
path around the third turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and did not make an impact. NAOMI BROADWAY (BRZ) shook her head and hopped at
the start, then trailed the field throughout in the two to three path, and never got involved.
