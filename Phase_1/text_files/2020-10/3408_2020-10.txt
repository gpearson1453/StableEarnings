Footnotes
KRZ SOCIETY was off slow, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. SEA MY MOVES showed speed from the
inside, was a factor on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch held place. DARLING DAAHER was in range, had a good position on the turn
and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up for show. AISLE ALTAR HYMN was hustled early and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. JACK'S MEMORY was off the pace and roused on the turn but had no response. GINGER
CANDY was in touch and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire.

from the three path at the top of the stretch but was outfinished. DYNAMITE KARMA stalked the early leader from the outside and forced the pace on the
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. ELUSIVE RO showed no speed and was roused on the turn but from the seven path through

LUCKY STREET was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and rallied to get up in time. TOWN DANCER forced the pace, dueled on the turn and had the
lead in mid stretch but failed to hold. MIJO was hustled from the inside and had a slim lead on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. WILEY
O'RIELLY was in range and roused from the inside on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. CAPE DESIDERATO was in
mid pack and hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. HANDSOME GUY was in touch and raced evenly
on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR broke poorly and closed the gap on the turn but was not a
factor. DEPUTY OF EGBERT tracked the early leaders but chased on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch flattened out. SATIVA was off
slow and showed nothing in a dull effort. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

Footnotes
MUSICAL FLIGHT was off the pace, gained ground on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up in time. DIAMONDSINHEREYES set
the pace and had a clear lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch failed to hold. MISS TEA BLONDE showed no speed and moved up
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch needed more. CLASSY VISION was off slow, closed the gap on the turn and finished well. KEEP
YOUR SILENCE was away alertly and had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the to of the stretch faded. OBLIVIOUSLY stalked the leader
and was a factor on the turn but came up empty. DIAMOND LOVE was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the
stretch was no threat. COURT TIME was in range but chased on the turn and failed to fire. ONE FOR NICKI was in touch and roused on the turn but had no
response. STELLATARA was in mid pack but lost ground on the turn and had no impact.

STARONTHEHORIZON showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and was kept to task. DOODLE DANDY was in touch, a factor on
the far turn and had a bid from the four path in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. SEXY NEXY was off the pace, moved up on the far turn and
from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. HURRICANE DIRECTOR was off slow and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch had no response. STRIKING RED was unhurried early and hustled along on the far turn but was not a factor. MARVEL had no speed and
showed little in a dull effort. FRIDAY NIGHT MAGIC was up close early, trailed the field on the far turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

STRIKE was hustled early, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path through the stretch held place. EGYPTIAN NIGHTS was in range and
roused on the turn but from the five path through the stretch was no real threat. SECRET AFFIRMATION was up close and raced evenly on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. NONIOBUSINESS was in touch and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. SAVOIA was off the

Footnotes
AUNTIE KATHERINE showed speed and set the pace, had a clear lead on the far turn and from the three path through the stretch held sway. WORLD OF
PROSPECTS was unhurried early, a factor on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort.
SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. GIANT MINE
stalked the early leader and raced evenly on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. TWENTYTWENTYCREST had no
speed and was roused on the far turn but had no response. THE OTHER BREEZE was well back, showed little and was never a threat. CENAR was in
range but lost ground on the far turn and came up empty.

HENRY'S GIZMO showed speed from the outside, was a factor on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch drew clear.
GUNZIG STINGER was up close, had a slim lead on the turn and was clearly second best. DEN OF THIEVES was in mid pack and had a mild gain on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. I'VE PAID MY DUES was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the
top of the stretch was all out. WALKINAROUNDMONEY forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but weakened through the stretch. WESTERN
SOCIETY was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. TEXT ME TOO was well back, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes
through the stretch. C BY THE SEA had no speed, showed little and was never a threat. GIDEON'S SWORD was hustled early but lost ground on the turn
and was empty. SUNKA WAKAN was in touch but checked on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TALE OF VIENNA was in mid pack, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was up in time. SEAL TEAM TWO set a pressured
pace and had a slim lead on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was caught late. BE THE CHANGE was up close and forced the pace on
the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and was
up for a share. BEEN WAITING was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from then six path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. HIDDEN
ARTIFACT was in range and roused on the turn but had no response. SILENT CONTEMPT had no speed and was hustled along on the turn but from the
five path at the top of the stretch needed more. OMI'S BOY forced the early pace and dueled on the turn but flattened out through the stretch.
AREOCENTRIC was well back, chased on the turn and failed to fire. TOBRUK was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but had no impact.
BUTTERFLY STRIKE was hustled early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.
