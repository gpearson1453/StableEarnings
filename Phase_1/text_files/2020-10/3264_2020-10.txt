clear for the win. CRACKER FACTORY (GB) rated nicely and closed well to be a length back at the final hurdle, overtook all but winner. ADJUTANT (GB)
battled gamely from third out. BE COUNTED was prominent on the first circuit, then shuffled back, kept on with a fair finishing effort. SKYDIVING took the
lead going into the 2nd hurdle, tired third from home losing places. PRAECEPS (IRE) stalked the pace, then weakened in the stretch. ORCHESTRA
LEADER was in contention when erred at a jump, pitching rider forward but recovered though lost ground. DETROIT BLUES (GB) trailed throughout and
was pulled up.
