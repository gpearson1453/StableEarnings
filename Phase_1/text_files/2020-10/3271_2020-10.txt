CLEAN LIVING vied inside of two rivals for the lead, maintained position through the turn and into the stretch, responded gamely to urging and just held off
the closers late. SLIGHTLY tracked leaders two wide in the backstretch, entered turn to wide, midway through the turn went four wide, into the stretch five
wide, got going late in the stretch to finish strongly to get up for second. NIGHT OF IDIOTS tracked leaders along the inside, rider content to stay off the
pace into the turn, started bid at the three sixteenths pole along the rail, kept to task in the stretch and kept on for third. SIX EIGHTEEN vied three wide for
the lead on the backstretch, entered turn three wide then two wide for most of the turn, entered stretch in the two path and in striking position, kept on in the
stretch and outfinished late. SHE BE FIRE N ICE pressed leader in between on the backstretch, entered turn two wide, into the stretch in the three path,
lacked needed punch in the stretch to improve position. JOE'S PASSION stalked leaders along the rail, continued through the turn and into the stretch along
the rail and failed to make any impact.

ROSAT cleared rivals and went to the rail, entered turn well clear of rivals, stayed along the inside in the stretch, rival came up to him with a bold bid and
gamely held off rival. IRISH JACK tracked leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and into the stretch in the three path, took aim on
leader in the stretch and could not get by. CONEJOS bumped at the start, stalked leader along the inside, entered turn off the rail, kept to task in the stretch
to be a clear third. SEATTLE ENCOUNTER broke in and bumped foe at the start, tracked leader along the inside, asked for run at the three sixteenths pole
and lacked needed response in the lane. AT THE MARGIN settled in the back of the pack off the rail, stayed along the inside while never making any bid.
FERGUSON bumped at the start, lacked any speed on the backstretch, showed mild late interest in the stretch when making up some ground on tiring rival.
