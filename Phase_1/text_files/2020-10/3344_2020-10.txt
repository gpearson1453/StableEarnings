Footnotes
VIRGINIA BEACH set the pace, was under pressure through the stretch and held well under steady encouragement. TEA IN CHINA was crowded at the
start, raced close to the pace, went four wide entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. WHAT THE
BEEP got away well, was never far off the pace, shifted out for the drive and closed well to earn show. WOLVERETTE broke out, was in tight entering the
turn, awaited room, bid and came up empty. SWEET LADY SUE pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and leveled off. DETERMINED LOVE raced in
the back, went five wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
SUNMAN stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, bid five wide, closed willingly and drew clear under mild urging. WALL was unhurried
early, bid inside, closed along the rail to loom a threat, hung late and settled for place. APPROVETHISMESSAGE got away well, pressed the pace,
challenged for the lead on the turn, floated out entering the stretch, assumed command with a short lead, hung late and lost position. GLENGAR showed
good early speed, was taken back and stayed close, lacked a stretch rally and finished evenly. LUCID DREAM broke out, raced evenly and lacked a bid.
BATTLE READY set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back and faded through the stretch. LIFE IN FLASH was never far back, raced inside, lacked a bid
and was outrun. CAMPARI trailed the field.

TASTING THE STARS stalked the pace, rallied three wide on the turn, closed willingly and drew clear late in a driving finish. PINK PEARL pressed the
pace, moved up along the backstretch to vie two across, assumed command mid stretch with a short lead and yielded late. FIONNBHARR was unhurried
early, saved ground, shifted out for the drive and finished well to get up for show. SECRET OR NOT raced mid pack inside, shifted out mid stretch, bid
willingly, didn't have enough late and was outfinished for third. BELLA AURORA led around the first turn, vied inside, gave way near the eighth pole and
dropped back. ROLLOVER RISK was unhurried early while never far off the pace, lacked a stretch response and faded.

Footnotes
ZENDEN broke awkwardly to be off a step slowly, moved up outside while in hand, challenged for the lead on the turn, got a head in front, dueled late while
racing in tight quarters and held the advantage in a game effort. AWESOME D J pressed the pace while racing along the inside, fell back and angled out on
the turn, bid willingly, dueled in tight quarters late and was outfinished in a good effort. HALL PASS saved ground, fell back on the turn and angled out for
the drive, bid willingly, shifted back in past the eighth pole and closed to get up for show. FORTUNATE FRIENDS showed good early speed, fell back, went
widest in the drive, closed steadily but didn't have enough late. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) set a pressured pace, weakened in the drive and gave way
late.

Footnotes
KENNY HAD A NOTION led early, was taken back and moved off the rail, rallied on the turn, assumed command, drew off and was kept to task. POINT OF
GRACE was never far off the pace, closed well inside, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. VIRGINIA FIB broke slowly and veered out at
the start, was unrushed and raced far back, went widest in the drive and closed to earn show. COOL ENOUGH set a pressured pace, stopped near the
eighth pole and dropped back. CANHERUN had brief speed only and did not threaten. PAUPING broke in hand and failed to threaten in an even effort.

NIC NIC BOOM rallied around the turn, angled out for the drive, bid five wide, closed willingly, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. LITTLE BAY
lagged early while racing outside, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up for place. DESPITE ODDS vied three across, then between
horses, yielded near the sixteenth pole and held for show. RUNAWAY STAR bumped at the start, moved up outside to vie three across to the sixteenth pole
and was unable to sustain his bid. TRUE SHIPMAN bumped at the start, settled behind the pacesetters, angled out mid stretch and leveled off. WHATS
THE CHANCES bumped at the start, vied for the lead, was crowded along the inside near the eighth pole, steadied and not urged thereafter. NOT TELLING
vied along the rail early, was taken back, stayed inside and lacked a bid. CECIL THE LION dropped back quickly and was outrun in an even effort.
NEVERFOLD was not a factor. BEAN POLE broke awkwardly to be off slowly, dropped inside and failed to contend. NEVERHAVENEVERWILL pulled up
and walked off.

LARGENT raced close to the pace along the rail, got through inside leaving the turn, assumed command with a short lead, was under pressure late and
held gamely while under urging. TOLAGA BAY was reluctant to load, rated back at the start, rallied four wide on the turn, bid willingly to contend and was
outfinished in a good effort. KENDAMA raced close to the pace outside, rallied three wide on the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and went willingly to
the wire. GREAT CAMANOE set the pace to the upper stretch, leveled off in the drive and lost position. ISMUSBEMYLUCKYDAY was never far back,
closed steadily and didn't have enough left. DIVINE INTERVENTIO raced in the back, got through inside leaving the turn and lacked a rally. RIVER DEEP
stalked the pace to the second turn and gave way.

Footnotes
EMBOLDEN pressed the pace, assumed command in the upper stretch, drew off for a clear lead and held well. LYNCHBURG stalked the pace, fell back on
the turn, continued willingly to the wire and gained late to narrow the gap. BOONDOGGLE was never far back, got through inside on the turn, angled out,
lacked the needed late response and settled for show. UNCLE ANDREW broke out, was slow early, advanced steadily and was gaining for show.
BRAXTON raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. CARBON DATA was never far back, rallied around the turn to get within striking
distance, had nothing left for the drive and fell back. REFORM SCHOOL broke in, raced mid pack and lacked a stretch response. SIR ROCKPORT was
slightly squeezed at the start, raced inside to the turn, shifted out and lacked a bid. FLY E DUBAI was not a factor. LIME HOUSE LOUIE was outrun in an
even effort. TEMPTING MOMENT raced evenly and did not threaten. GOODLUCKCHUCK was not a factor. READY TO RUN broke awkwardly and the
rider appeared to be knocked off balance at the start, set the pace and stopped near the eighth pole. MATSUDA was outrun.

Footnotes
TWEET AWAY ROBIN stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through the stretch and inched away late to prove best. CALYPSO
GHOST stalked the pace, bid inside on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished despite steady urging. THIRD CARD DOWN was void of
early speed and raced far back, went widest in the drive, finished well and was gaining late. WICKED T broke slowly, was unrushed saving ground, angled
out for the drive and closed well. HOSS KITTEN set the pace to the turn, tired and gave way.
