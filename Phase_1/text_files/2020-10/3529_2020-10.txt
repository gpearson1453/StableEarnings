HAWAIIAN MEMORIES was unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, swung into the lane from the four path, hooked
up with the runner-up inside the eighth pole and inched up late under continuous right-handed urging. WILADENE pressed the pace while two wide, took
over near the three-eighths pole, cleared in late turn, was caught by the winner near the eighth pole and gamely fought to the wire. TO FAT TO FISH
chased the pace from the two path through the far turn, bid into the lane, was looking to split the leaders when straightening into the lane, lost the path and
waited, angled out a couple of paths and was best of the rest. CANDY EMPIRE was near the rail while never far back, remained in good position into the
lane and lacked a bid. SECOND EXCHANGE trailed the field while in hand, continued without urgency into the lane then gained mildly.
SAVEDBESTFORLAST set the pace along the inside into the far turn then gave way near the three-eighths pole. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF #7
TO FAT TO FISH AGAINST THE RIDERS OF #3WILADENE AND #6HAWAIIAN MEMORIES FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS
POLE DID NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE OF ORDER.

Footnotes
I'M MONEY set the pace from the outset while near the inside, was put under pressure through late turn, continued with a short lead into the lane, repelled
challenger nearing the sixteenth pole and re-cleared late. C F V RED NOVA chased the pace from the three path through the mid-turn, bid in late turn to be
a serious threat, continued pressuring the winner through the lane and could not keep up with the top one while well clear for the place spot. PERFECT
MISTAKE was along the inside through the turn and into the lane and moved up. NEIGHBORLY raced behind a two rival duel through the turn, tipped into
the three path entering the lane then lacked a closing response. PARKER chased the winner through the turn and into the lane and faded. LOOKIN AT
JUSTICE was in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and was never a factor. TWIRLING MAMBA stumbled at the
start and lost his rider, ran through the first half mile before being collared by outrider. AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE FOUND NO
REASON FOR CHANGE IN ORDER.

FROST OR FRIPPERY chased the pacesetter while in the two path, bid in late turn and into the lane, was on near even terms when straightening in the
lane then edged clear and held. RIVER ECHO (GB) set the pace along the inside into the far turn, was joined by the winner into the lane then gave ground
grudgingly. CALIFORNIA SWING was unhurried while off the inside, asked for more near mid-turn, made a quick move into the third spot but could not
sustain the effort. LONTANI chased the pace while in the two path into the lane and tired. STEWARDS RULES chased the pace while near the rail into the
turn and was done near the three-eighths pole.

Footnotes
OUT OF PATIENCE chased the pace from the two path into the turn, gained momentum and bid three wide through mid-turn, continued with another into
the lane, inched past that one with an eighth to go then cleared late. BOLD PROPHET stalked the pace while in the two path into the turn, bid nearing the
three-eighths pole to gain the lead, was joined by the winner soon after, stayed with that one to inside the eighth pole then could not keep up while saving
the place spot. OFF SIXES was unhurried while in the two or three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and finished evenly
while under a strong ride to the end. HYNDFORD chased the pace while along the inside into the lane was well placed after straightening in the lane then
weakened late. FLAT OUT FAST was in the two to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, angled in a couple paths near the
sixteenth pole and never was a serious threat. GOT THE NOTION set the pace while along the inside into mid-turn then gave way.
