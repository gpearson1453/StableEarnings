ADDING MACHINE accelerated to the lead inside approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear and drifted toward the head of the lane then dug in
under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted. SHAMELESS RISK chased the pace and raced close three wide on the turn, was forced out nearing
the top of the lane but dug in under steady stretch handling, and got up to share. OFFICER UNBRIDLED set a pressured pace the opening quarter mile and
dueled at a close disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn, was forced out entering the stretch then flattened out later yards. ROCKET
APPEAL raced well off the early pace and rounded the turn just off the rail, steadily improved through the stretch and finished well. REMYS SHOWTIME
chased the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn then weakened the final furlong.

Footnotes
ALPINE MOON stalked the pace early on then started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, took the lead at the five sixteenths, raced clear
through the far turn and held well with steady stretch handling. LONGSTORYLUCY raced well off the early pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
improved off the rail on the far turn then dueled for second inside the eighth pole. KATALIMA saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
raced in the three path of the far turn then ceded second inside the eighth pole. BOCA BIRDIE settled well off the pace inside the first turn, bid approaching
the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the three path and showed little more. MARY'S LISTED NEXT tapered in to stalk the early pace two
deep then took a slim lead into the backstretch, raced briefly clear past the seven sixteenths pole but was caught at the five sixteenths and faded through
the far turn. BECOMING MACHEN rated a slim early lead inside, was caught into the backstretch, dropped back at the seven sixteenths pole and weakened
at the rail on the far turn then galloped through the stretch.

GRECIAN ADMIRAL became a bit fractious in the gate then picked up the chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn two deep, dueled to the lead
inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear the final strides. BECOMING SMITTY chased the pace inside and raced at the rail on the turn, was outfinished for
the win through the final furlong and just lasted for place. GENESIS G G chased the pace, came through the turn about the three path, though, drifted into
the stretch and just missed second in an even finish. WINDSOR'S FUN surged to a long early lead that became diminished through the turn, then gave way
the final sixteenth. MY FINAL NINJA chased the pace through the backstretch and rounded the turn about the three path, drifted into the stretch and showed
little more. LUFTI'SBROKENHEART raced well back. EIGHT OF DIAMONDS became fractious and sat down in the gate then steadily retreated through the
backstretch.

Footnotes
SHE'S RIGHT saved early ground then eased out into the backstretch, steadily closed toward contention then bid to take the lead two deep midway on the
far turn, drifted into the stretch but dueled clear a sixteenth away. BUFF N raced with the early pace two deep and took the lead past the seven sixteenths
pole, was pressured from that point, though, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn, then continued close to the sixteenth pole before ceding.
KIM'S DIAMOND saved ground through the first turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily
progressed in the five path of the far turn then dug in to take third mid-stretch before flattening stride. CHARITABLE JAN settled off the pace and off the rail
the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path but had little left. CORKY COWGIRL broke through the gate
prior the start then took an early lead to set the pace inside, was caught past the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but weakened
leaving the far turn. BREAK DANCIN settled just off the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride off the rail
on the far turn. CHARITABLE MISS rated close to the early pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then faded
into the far turn. WORKPANSOMETHINGS raced in the five path the first turn and was through early. MARYLEE dropped well back. SMARTY PLEASE
bore out into the first turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SHORT CAKE'S MAN was bumped at the break then raced off the pace and off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far
turn, dug in through the lane to get up the final yards and raced clear under the wire. ITSAHATTATACK came in at the break then angled to the inside to set
the pace, was met leaving the first turn but recovered the advantage at the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure from the three eighths and matched
strides nearest the rail on the far turn, dueled clear in the upper stretch but was caught in the final yards. ASK ME HOW IKNOW saved ground off the pace
then started a three wide bid leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep on the far turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and
flattened stride the final sixteenth. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn,
but showed little more. THERE THERE broke outward to make contact with Cesar Augusto and rounded the opening turn about the five path, raced outside
into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole but flattened three wide on the far turn. SING FROSTY stalked the early pace inside then
took a slim brief lead past the half mile pole, gave chase from the seven sixteenths but faded while losing ground on the far turn. CESAR AUGUSTO
stumbled at the break and was bumped outward and into Short Cake's Man, rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths then never factored.
LUCA'S DREAM hesitated at the break and raced well back.

MR. VECCHIO set a pressured pace leaving the chute, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn then dug in under an all out drive to just last. EPIC
WEST pressured the pace and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn then dug in gamely down the lane and just missed. NATIVE COURAGE
engaged in close chase, rounded the turn just off the rail and dug in gamely to the finish. NICALOE chased the pace, came through the turn about the four
path and finished well while gaining on the top three. I AM THAT I AM gave chase, rounded the turn about the six path and finished well. THE FRANCHISE
chased the pace, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. R TAP chased the pace inside, had his heels clipped
nearing the five sixteenths pole and never factored. I'M WANNABE chased the pace outside, showed no response on the turn, was eased in the lane,
unsaddled on the clubhouse turn then vanned off. THE BOOK OF ROD chased the early pace outside but was eased inward and clipped the heels of R Tap
approaching the five sixteenths pole and lost the rider. The Stewards reviewed the incident on the backstretch before declaring this race official.

Footnotes
BARNSTORM chased the pace through the backstretch and raced in the four path of the turn, eased out at the eighth pole and dug in down the lane to get
up at the wire. MAJESTIC SEAS pressured the pace inside then dropped back past the five sixteenths pole, was carried out into the turn, dug in for the lead
leaving the eighth pole but was caught in the final stride. MY TIME IN COURT chased the earlier pace toward the inside but was carried out on the turn then
outfinished in the duel down the lane. GUNTER chased the pace and raced two deep on the turn, then flattened inside the eighth pole. DASHIELL gave
chase and raced at the rail on the turn and was not a factor. SIR MAJESTY set a pressured pace and drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, but bore out and
was pulled up lame into the turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
PENNY PINCHER settled off the pace and off the rail, bid into the backstretch and steadily improved, eased outside the waning pace-setter while taking the
lead toward the head of the lane then widened with steady handling. COLD HEARTED GAL saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled to the four path into the lane, though, had to settle for second best. FLICKER'S PRINCESS raced
well off the pace and off the rail, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail but ran up on the heels of the waning
Infinitypowersiwin and had to steady nearing the top of the lane, recovered stride near the rail and dueled later yards for third. RICH IMAGE broke
awkwardly then lunged from the gate and raced well back saving early ground, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, angled to
the six path into the lane and was outfinished for third later yards. MAIDU raced in the four path the first turn, was well off the pace into the backstretch and
showed little response. TRINNI LOVE raced well off the pace in the three and four paths and was not a factor. LUCY I'M HOME stalked the early pace then
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, though, faded in the three path of the far turn. INFINITYPOWERSIWIN hustled clear and angled to the
inside to open up a long early lead, but flattened stride at the rail on the far turn and gave way.
