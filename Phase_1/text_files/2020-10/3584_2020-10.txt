Footnotes
GOLLY SHEZ HOT SV raced off the pace, went three wide on the turn, split foes while gaining fast passing the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead outside the
three-sixteenths then moved clear, drifted out under a left-handed whip inside the furlong marker then was straightened by the rider and held under steady
urging. NILLA was urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, steadied near the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the
stretch and finished willingly for the place. VOLATILIS MHF was urged along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn, advanced late on the bend,
came six wide into the stretch and flattened out while able to get the show. ROYAL JOLIE was urged along off the pace, moved from the inside to the three
path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. AA RICH WHISKEY was urged along towards the front on the outside, went four to five
wide on the turn, drifted out near the furlong marker and had nothing left. AA POCKIT ROCKIT was urged along while drifting about some at the rear, went
three to four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. RB DIVA was urged along towards the front, went four wide on the turn,
dropped back late on the bend and capitulated. HAFFIRS SIMONE showed good speed and set the pace, controlled the action while near the inside on the
turn, lost the lead outside the three-sixteenths and gave way. MIRAGE AA chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, dropped back passing the
five-sixteenths and retreated.
