COREY'S CATCH stalked the early speed, angled out in the stretch, drew clear late under left handed urging. FOREVERJUMBONMIKE set the pace with a
clear lead, was hooked in mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was second best. ROCK'N ROLL MUSIC was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch four
wide and finished well. CHILLINLIKAVILLIN tracked four wide and went evenly. TEQUILA FLATS had good position just off the speed and lacked a late
response. GIVE ME A CHANCE allowed to settle, failed to menace. BIG PERFORMER tracked three wide and faded in the stretch. DOC GARDNER
showed little and trailed.

mild bid. KEYED ON TOP had good position while between horses, lacked a late bid. ODIE raced wide early and had no rally. BRET'S AT CADDIES was

lacked a late kick and went evenly. GENUWINE raced mid pack and had no late bid. BIONIC ROSIE never far back while saving ground, had no rally.

Footnotes
WHISKEY SIS was unhurried early, rallied on the turn four wide, drew clear late under firm handling. SAMTASTIK chased the early speed, rallied in the
stretch and drew even, was outfinished late but was second best. BETTER VIBES set the pace with a clear lead, was hooked in mid stretch and held well.
MUSICAL LADY was well placed and saved ground, had a mild bid on the inside. FROSTY LINZ raced three wide early and went evenly. CINS BOSS raced
close up until mid stretch, then weakened. ULTERED PERCEPTION was unhurried early and was no threat. LET'S GO LUNA was no factor. BIONDETTA
was outrun.
