Footnotes
TWISTED EMOTIONS was well placed early on the inside, eased out for racing room past the five sixteenths pole to make a bid three wide, hit the front
past the three sixteenths pole, then remained clear to the wire to prove best under left handed encouragement. CAFE MISCHIEF stalked the early pace
setter three wide, then made a four wide bid entering the stretch, but could not get to the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. HONEST GAL
was sent to the lead to set the pace from the inside then faded in the stretch while saving the show award. SONG AND A KISS chased the early pace four
wide but offered no rally. COCO LOCO MAMA was bumped at the start, then was three wide past the quarter pole, swung out six wide for the stretch drive
but offered no gain. AMERICAN KISSES failed to menace while four to six wide throughout. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry
an additional three pounds. PER RULING IG-2020-2219 FROM THE INDIANA RACING COMMISSION, CAFE MISCHIEF WAS DQ'D DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
BACKHAND was unrushed early, rallied in the four path at the three-eighths pole, then dueled late and prevailed under mild urging. STARGAZER LILY
dueled outside of a foe, went clear on the far turn, was challenged in the stretch and was outfinished. DASH OF SIMPLICITY saved ground and gained the
show spot late. READY TO MONBA pressed the early pace between foes, took back, stalked in the three path, bid on the far turn, then faltered in the drive.
TOUCH OF BLESSING and JULIPS HOLD raced evenly. JOKINGLY stalked in the four path and faded after a half mile. ABBY'S LUCKY HEART stumbled
at the start and lost the rider. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
AZILOOK was well rated while four wide on the backstretch, was fanned out five or six wide entering the stretch, made a bid to get up late to prevail under a
drive. LADY STELLA was bumped at the start, rated while two wide on the backstretch, then was box on the far turn, eased out four wide for racing room
entering the stretch, made a bid in the drive but was outfinished. MIRACLES TAKE TIME was allowed to settle nicely towards the inside on the backstretch,
swung out three wide for the drive, made a bid and split rivals by the sixteenth pole and rallied well. TOO CROWDED was reserved early, advanced on the
far turn while three wide, came into the stretch four wide and finished well but was blocked in deep stretch with run then had to check close to the wire,
missed show award. QUIET CONTENDER vied for the lead on the inside clipping off fast fractions then faded late. MISTY EXPRESS broke outwardly at the
start, pressed the pace three wide and made a four wide bid entering the stretch but flattened out final furlong. GINORMOUS had no response.
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP vied for the lead from between horses then weakened in the drive. TWILIGHT MAGIC was not a factor. Per Stewards, due to
Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

Footnotes
AIKEN TO BE TAKIN was hard held while three wide on the backstretch, then was let go past the five sixteenths pole to make bid, hit the front at the quarter
pole, then was headed by the eighth pole, dug in and responded well to left handed encouragement to prevail in a game effort. SECOND EXCHANGE was
rated along four wide on the backstretch, made a four wide move on the far turn, went on even terms with the winner past the furlong marker but hung to
just miss. TO FAT TO FISH was bumped at the start, raced on the inside on the first turn, eased out three wide on the far turn, finished well for the show
award while no threat to the top two. HITCHED was five wide into the first turn, made a five wide bid on the far turn to loom boldly but flattened out.
QUEENOFMYDBLWIDE vied for the early lead on the inside, then fell back off the pace, swung out three wide for the drive but had no late gain. CRAFTY
JUSTICE vied for the early lead three wide, then dueled outside a rival by the half, then weakened final quarter of a mile. LADY SNIPER was bumped hard
at the start, then offered no rally. SNAPASELFIE failed to menace. DYNAH MAC vied for lead early in between horses, then dueled for the lead on the
inside down the backstretch before tiring. MABEETHISTIME showed little. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three
pounds.

Footnotes
GAWKIER was away alertly, then was well placed early while three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, drew clear by the furlong marker, then held on
late to prove best, driving. BANDIDO DE AMORES was allowed to settle early, started to advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came into the stretch five
wide, closed well late. STOP HAMMERTIME was settled back early, then eased out past the three eighths pole to start his bid, was four wide by the quarter
pole, then came into the stretch six wide, rallied well late but too late. SACRED KIKI BIRD dueled for the early lead on the inside, then remained in
contention while just off the pace entering the stretch, but faded in the drive on the rail. MEROCKETMAN chased the early pace towards the inside then
swung out three wide for the drive but was empty. MATERS N TATERS dueled for the lead three to two wide then made a bid to set a pressured pace on
the turn then weakened. WHEREWEGOIN failed to menace. Per Stewards, due to Covid-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

room, made a four wide bid entering the stretch, hit the front around the furlong marker and continued on to draw clear under a drive. RIA MUNK was well
