Footnotes
BRICKYARD RIDE away quickly and angled to the inside, set the pace clear to the turn, stayed inside around the bend then a bit off the rail into the stretch,
put to right and left-handed urging and inched away from the field. THANKS MR. EIDSON came in and bumped ONE FLEW SOUTH at the start then
steadied off the heels of BRICKYARD RIDE, tracked off the inside then outside a rival or two wide around the turn, had aim on the leader at the top of the
stretch but could not summon the needed rally while staying on well to the place. ONE FLEW SOUTH got knocked into inside rival at the start, settled at the
back along the inside, moved out into the two path around the turn, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole, then showed a mild rally but could not get up for
second. PASSIONATE REWARD tracked off the inside, went three wide into the turn then moved into the two path, moved out four wide in upper stretch
and lacked the needed late kick. OCTOPUS bumped from the outside and forced in leaving the gate, settled in the early going, saved ground into the lane,
tipped out a bit in the stretch and could not rally. UNDENIABLE PROOF broke well then dropped back a bit to stalk the lone leader, angled in from the two
path to the rail on the turn and weakened in the stretch.

DEFENSE WINS stalked the top pair up the backstretch, bid three wide into the stretch, took over at the eighth pole and edged clear. HOLDEN THE LUTE
up close just outside the leader, headed rival midway around the turn then took a short lead at the five-sixteenths marker, put TIZ VICIOUS away in upper
stretch then received a challenge from DEFENSE WINS, relinquished the lead with a furlong to go but stayed on to prove second best. TIZ VICIOUS set the
pace up the backstretch, headed midway around the turn by HOLDEN THE LUTE, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, could not match the top pair in
the stretch but finished a clear third. PRINCE MAGICIAN stumbled at the start, settled off the pace along the inside, went two wide into the stretch then
moved out a bit further in the lane and earned a minor award. CANDY FURY stumbled leaving the gate, chased two wide through the turn and weakened.
PELICAN WAY off a bit slow to begin, steered out early, raced four then three wide into the stretch, came out into the lane and was always outrun.

ORDER AND LAW up close outside the leader, bid alongside KING OF SPEED at the seven-sixteenths pole, challenged through the far turn and into the
lane, took over in upper stretch and drew clear under right-handed urging. KING OF SPEED set the pace from inside, challenged at the seven-sixteenths
pole, met that bid and held a short lead over ORDER AND LAW through the turn, lost command in upper stretch but proved second best. UNBROKEN
STAR stalked off the inside, took closer order outside the top pair on the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn, lost ground around and then moved
out into the four path and kept on for the show. PEPE TONO unhurried in the early going, went four wide into the stretch and weakened.

BIDDY DUKE bumped with inside rival at the start, dueled for the lead from outside then cleared JO JO AIR, showed the way along the inside into the
stretch, challenged from the outside in the lane, responded strongly to urging and held gamely. JO JO AIR bumped with outside rival in the beginning,
dueled for the lead from the inside then dropped back to stalk the leader, went two wide around the turn then bid outside the leader in the lane, headed rival
past the eighth pole but could not get by. AN EDDIE SURPRISE stalked off the rail then two wide into the turn, moved out into the three path around the
bend, bid outside a pair of rivals in the stretch and could not find the needed late kick but held the show. AQUA SEAFORM SHAME broke through the gate
prior to the start, raced off the rail then two wide around the turn, in range through the stretch but lacked late punch. MAGIC AT MIDNIGHT off slow to begin,
angled in then rushed up to chase from inside, lacked room around the turn then continued inside to the stretch and failed to rally. LAKERBALL dropped
back early and steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch and was never a factor.

with rival past the eighth pole then took control and proved best late. WORTHY TURK tucked inside on the first turn, entered the stretch two wide, angled
out and rallied to earn the place honors. MITHQAAL stalked two wide then three wide into the stretch, bid three deep at the eighth pole, drifted in a bit and
brushed rival soon after and got outkicked by the top pair in deep stretch. ACKER chased off the rail, four wide into the lane and kept on to earn a minor
award. TRUTH SEEKER went two wide around the first turn then moved off the rail, traveled three wide around the far turn then swung five wide into the
stretch and summoned a mild rally. MOVE OVER (GB) pulled early then settled inside on the first turn, saved ground into the lane, split foes in the stretch
and improved position. SWAMP SOUFFLE tracked outside a rival then two wide on the second turn, asked in the lane but failed to rally. SILVER SUMMER
sped to the front and angled over to the inside quickly, led two wide into the lane, challenged from both sides at the eighth pole, brushed between rivals and
steadied inside the furlong grounds then weakened in the late stages. EROTIC trailed the field early, angled four wide into the stretch and made no impact.
CONTAGION settled off the pace, went two wide into the lane then angled out and had little left for the drive. NEW YEAR saved ground along the inside and
checked sharply off the heels of SILVER SUMMER late. GRAND MEISTER in range early outside a rival, raced off the rail then three wide into the stretch
and faded.
