Footnotes
FISH TRAPPE ROAD went evenly rallying from the turn splitting horses in upper stretch dueling up inside of rival late. THORPE D'ORO pressed the pace
dueling three deep in upper stretch extending abreast rival late being out gamed. U S MARSHAL went evenly angling five wide in upper stretch finishing
well. PAXOS away alertly pressed a narrow lead through the turn, dueling on the inside of foes in upper stretch would wear down. SWITHER'S SHORTCUT
slow early played no factor. FREEDONIA flashed early speed then gave way on the turn.
