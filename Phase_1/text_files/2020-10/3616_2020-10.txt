Footnotes
ALLURED established the top in short order, flicked off some pressure from the outside after the first fraction had been finalized, sailed along from path two
on a loosely-contested lead afterwards, swung three wide onto the head of the stretch, settled in and was given his cue, drew off to its largest advantage
during the rest of the trip leading up to the eighth pole, came out at intervals whenever fed some left side work in the final furlong but managed to hold sway.
MICROSCOPE seemingly the widest throughout, was parked out four wide on the turn, got steered much farther to the outside for the stretch run,
outfinished the rest for place honors racing six to seven wide. MR. SHORTANDSIMPLE stalked the pace from path three, got roused as three-quarters was
being completed, angled five wide into the stretch, got outkicked. LATIN LOVE BUG slid over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, got
cued up leaving the fie-sixteenths pole, wandered out towards path three stepping into the lane, weakened. KING OF AMERICAN hustled on the chute into
a prominent position, tucked along the inside route at the top of the turn, went four wide into the lane, backed away readily.

Footnotes
STORM SHOOTER coaxed from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through
the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three wide for home, drew clear under a drive to the eighth pole and was geared down inside
the final sixteenth. DANTE'S MAP hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and ran on to secure the place honors. NOBLE JOURNEY coaxed from the start, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went eight wide
into upper stretch and improved position to procure the show honors. ANOTHER SHOT bumped at the start in a chain of bumping begun by pressure from
IN THE ZONE veering inwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three to four wide for home and passed tired
foes. REUNION TOUR got bumped and was forced to steady when squeezed back between foes at the start conceding four lengths to the front, chased two
to three wide from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals.
ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE got bumped at the start by IN THE ZONE who veered in and in turn bumped REUNION TOUR into ANOTHER SHOT conceding
two lengths to the front, chased five wide throughout coaxed along from three furlongs out, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. PANSTER got
steadied and was brushed at the start when IN THE ZONE veered in front and conceded three lengths to the front, chased six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from midway, went seven to eight wide for home and tired. DREAMPOINT chased along the inside greenly
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. PRODUCTION CREDIT prompted the pace
of STORM SHOOTER from the outside four then three wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded. IN
THE ZONE veered in at the start forcing PANSTER to be taken in hand and bumping ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE into REUNION TOUR and in turn ANOTHER
SHOT, showed brief speed five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
began to fade near the quarter pole, swung six wide into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
MADERA went at it from the outside with BUYER'S REMORSE just about from the get-go, gap-dueled with the nemesis from path two, slithered its way into
path four when called upon for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, won the battle then although appearing a little leg weary in the final stages,
arrived safely at the finish line. WISHES AND DREAMS pursued the pace from the three path, swung out five wide for the drive, was moving best off all,
however belatedly, en route for place honors. BUYER'S REMORSE got engaged with the winner right after the start, was along the inside route as the
twosome raced as a team, well isolated from the others, got roused after the half had been reeled off, saw the top one slowly but steadily take charge,
weakened late into the show slot. QUEENTIGUA saved ground until the end of the bend, got spotted two wide at the head of the stretch, lacked the needed
response. SANDER'S EMPIRE at a considerable distance from the inside throughout, travelled four wide on the turn, fanned farther out for the drive,
straightened away then proceeded six to seven wide to the wire, making no headway. HOT BUTTON stumbled badly after leaping into left side of the
starting gate, saw the pilot pop back into the irons exhibiting coolness after being briefly out of them, took the inside route until the quarter pole, got
maneuvered into the three path coming onto the top of the lane, irmproved. PLEASE two wide entering the turn, got sent out four wide exiting it, gave way.
SWEET BREEZE cut over to the inside after the start, never made her presence despite the ground-saving journey that followed.

MCERIN hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide for home, dug in under threat knocking heads in game fashion through to the finish but was caught in the late stages while safe for the place honors.
HOME RUN MAKER coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide from just off the duel in tandem with SKYLER'S SCRAMJET heads apart with that

Footnotes
FORGOTTEN HERO retained the advantage after breaking on top, showed the way on an open lead two to three wide, saw the pilot go to work striking the
three-sixteenths marker, kept well clear while kept to the task at hand. AWESOME ALANA underwent a two wide pursuit, was about as wide stepping into
the stretch, proved no match rallying for second. JC'S SHOOTING STAR took up the chase from path two on the bend, got put to a drive entering the
stretch, wound up towards the three path by the three-sixteenths pole, fell short of snagging the place. GENTLE ANNIE travelled three wide on the turn, was
getting roused coming slightly wider into the stretch, flattened out. SWEET MEADOW MIST sighted in the two path at the top of the turn, was still in the
neighborhood of that path stepping onto the head of the stretch, shifted wider late, made no impact. BUSTIN TO PLEASE parked out four wide on the turn,
wandered out into path eight early during the stretch run, capping off its designation of being just about the widest of all throughout. DIRTY BIRD along the
inside, faltered after going a half.

Footnotes
TENDERFOOT seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, raced eight paths off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, continued eight wide into upper stretch, rallied and was bumped by BISCHOFBERGER when seizing command near the eighth pole, then
went clear of the rest through to the finish geared down in the final sixteenth. MY FIRST GRAMMY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and
through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went nine wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to just get
up for the place honors. I GOT A SECRET chased six wide down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven
wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. PRINCE OF CAPS dueled from the two path with BOLD GEM to his outside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and yielded the front straightened away, then weakened to the finish. AMISTAD chased two
to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. BOLD GEM dueled from the three path with PRINCE
OF CAPS to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened.
SEEDISKID chased four to five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled eight to nine wide for home and made no impact. LIL JOJO chased two to
three wide from near the rear under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE
three to four wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. CONFECTIONER chased four to five wide
under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. INAPPROPRIATE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. BISCHOFBERGER five then four wide in pursuit from just off the duel, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, ducked out nearing the eighth pole
steadily four to five paths bumping TENDERFOOT as that rival took over command, then drifted in slightly before ducking in sharply nearing the sixteenth
marker four to five paths and lost the rider near the rail as a result, then got apprehended by outrider after the finish and walked off under his own power.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on BISCHOFBERGER before the result stood and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
UNDINE broke in line with RISK MODEL, saw that foe get taken back and assumed control, tucked into the two path at the top of the turn after leading the
competition one wider on the backstretch, continued to show the way, pilot holding something in reserve, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and got
switched over to stronger handling, kicked well clear, kept to a drive. SEASIDE RETREAT loped along during the initial stages, got guided over to the rail
approaching the half mile pole, ventured onward, too far back to make her presence felt, angled into path five for the stretch run, rallied down the center of
the strip to be along for the place. RISK MODEL taken back into a stalking role, pursued the winner three to four wide on the turn, was more the former
entering the stretch, flattened out. MALIBU ANTHEM remained stationed along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, unleashed an
abbreviated run after getting called upon, from between the five-sixteenths marker and the head of the stretch, failed to sustain the momentum and
weakened. BARISTA VIXEN contently brought up the back of the pack, raced taking the two path on the turn, got moved out six wide from upper to
midstretch, had no offering. TACTICAL MOVE prompted the winner from the outside, going about the task from path three on the turn, left the
five-sixteenths marker having been set to a brisk hand ride, turned into lane and gave way.

STUNNING MUNNINGS cemented itself to the top with some light encouragement after the start, pressed the issue from path three, came under a ride
abreast of HURRICANE BREEZE in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, inched its way to the front end travelling in the furlong grounds, saw the second
place finisher narrowing in, held late under a drive. MAKE OR BREAK well off the rail at all times, pursued the pace four to five wide on the turn, got driven
into path six for entrance into the stretch, gradually closed the gap to gain the place. GIRARDI a forward factor in the four path, got set down approaching
the quarter pole, stayed on for the show. HURRICANE BREEZE hustled to the top, disputed the pace from path two, was put to the test by the top one
coming up to the three-sixteenths pole, got vanquished, then steadily weakened in the final furlong. BIG AL'S GAL tracked the front runners from the pocket
until the end of the bend, tipped into path two at the top of the lane, got outkicked. TRAPPED N MY MIND took up the chase three to four wide, went into
path five stepping into the stretch, had no offering. CLASSY SADIE strung out along the overland route, was never involved. MISS CIRCULAR GAL saved
ground until the quarter pole, was spotted three wide at the start of the stretch drive, backed away.
