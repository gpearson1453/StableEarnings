Footnotes
G CITY WARRIOR stumbled at the start while being bumped by COOKIN ROSES, was quickly righted to prompt that foe racing through the backstretch,
conceded some position on the turn, continued with a steady bid to wrest the advantage racing into upper stretch and kicked away under firm handling.
TWO MORE TIMES, off slowly, saved ground on the bend gradually regaining contention, shifted out entering the lane to gain position between foes and
prevailed for the place honors late. NURSE KATIE, caught six wide early tracking just off the second flight, made steady progress four wide on the turn and
continued with interest to prevail for a share. NO PASSING ZONE settled off the second flight racing through the backstretch, angled six wide racing into the
stretch and gained some position. LYNNE T tracked off the first flight between foes in the opening quarter, shifted in racing into the turn and faded.
ASHLEYSDREAM tracked the leaders four wide between foes in second flight, shifted in racing into the turn and faded after a half. COOKIN ROSES, urged
along the rail disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, went clear on the turn but failed to sustain that momentum in upper stretch. BELLA MY ELLA
tracked just off the leaders five wide between foes early, continued three deep into the turn but was through after a half. SOUTHERN ATTACK settled
between foes in early stages and offered no rally. THE MORE I BURN, caught seven wide early, proved no threat. HERO'S JEWEL, raced five wide, then
four deep between foes in the last flight to the turn, was caught in tight quarters entering the bend and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
STACK SHACK broke readily to gain terms with a rival on the pace, drifted out entering the first turn turn, was quickly righted to prompt a rival racing into the
backstretch, moved to a clear advantage racing into the far turn, continued in a protracted skirmish when challenged racing into upper stretch and held
AIMARA gamely under firm right handed pressure. The latter tracked just off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, split foes racing into the far
turn to bid for command nearing the lane, gained terms with the winner in a prolonged drive but was outkicked. SUPREME IRENE, urged to prompt the
pace inside the eventual winner into the backstretch, shifted out three wide once headed by the top pair racing into upper stretch but kept on to prevail for a
share. SPEAK ENGLISH, caught five wide early, tracked off the second flight, angled in on the far turn and continued evenly. MISS HATTIE settled off the
second flight to the backstretch, split foes racing into upper stretch and gained some position while making no impact. WICKED SOPRANO, caught four
wide racing into the first turn, settled outside foes early and proved no threat. ZAPPI dwelt at the start, shifted well wide racing to the first turn and trailed the
field to the stretch. COLOROFACLOUD, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leaders outside a rival in second flight, continued three deep into the
second bend and soon gave way. SISTER MARY CLETUS tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
IHADADREAM raced between horses in the chasing flight, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead outside of THE FIRST HERO past the five sixteenths,
drove clear in upper stretch and held safe. TAPNGO soon trailed, took closer order approaching the far turn, rallied two to three wide around that bend, was
driven five wide in upper stretch, and continued to gain on the leader with good interest all the way to the wire. THE DOGMEN tracked the pacesetter, was
relegated to third position past the seven sixteenths as IHADADREAM rallied, floated four wide into upper stretch, and chased on best of the rest. NEXT
MONDAY raced three wide in the chasing flight around the clubhouse turn, was wrangled back to third last into the backstretch, was urged to gain between
horses on the far turn, chased three wide in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick. KAPCORI ROAD came out slightly at the start, settled in second last,
improved position inside horses into the lane, but could sustain a bid down the lane. TURFMEISTER settled at the inside of the chasing flight, was driven
along the inside around the far turn, came into the lane two wide between horses, and came up empty. THE FIRST HERO cleared to the lead, was driven
around the far turn, lost the lead to IHADADREAM past the five sixteenths, and weakened inside. MESSED UP raced four wide in the chasing flight on the
far turn and three wide down the backstretch, faded when driven three wide on the far turn, and had no more for the drive. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THERE IS NO THREE QUARTERS FRACTION.

Footnotes
WAKE UP JOE, prompted to a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, bid inside that rival racing into upper stretch, wrested the
advantage in a long drive and just lasted under firm handling. BOOM BOX tracked off the second flight between foes, angled to the rail racing into the turn,
saved ground gaining position into the lane, shifted out to split foes just outside the winner late and edged a rival for the place honors.
WHENTHEDOVESCRY tracked off the first flight between rivals racing into the turn, was urged to bid three deep between foes leaving midstretch and
continued willingly to close the gap. EASTER MUSIC tracked off the first flight outside foes racing to the turn, angled five wide nearing midstretch and
continued with interest to gain some position. MUTAKDDIM ROAD settled outside foes dropping well off the second flight racing to the turn, then split foes
four wide in the closing stages to make a mild late bid. HE'S DANN GOOD, bumped at the start, was settled between foes racing to the turn, shifted out
leaving midstretch and continued evenly five wide late. FORT MARSH, urged prompting a rival's pace while just outside the eventual winner racing to the
turn, shifted four wide racing into the lane but came up empty near midstretch. JEGGYJEGGY tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the
turn and lacked the needed late response. SEQUINS STORM, urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way.
RED CORVETTE settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. MOONLIGHT MISCHIEF, shuffled out of close quarters at the start, settled
between foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. BEEMIE AWARD tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening quarter but retreated early.

VERRAZANO FIRST broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, widened racing into upper stretch and
extended the advantage under a few right handed taps while being kept to the task. LASTFORTINOFAMILY settled into stride along the inside in the
opening stages, saved ground on the turn, shifted out to split foes three deep racing through the lane and prevailed for the place honors. TODDLES angled
inwards while being urged prompting the eventual winner's pace racing into the, weakened entering the stretch to lose the place honors late. LINE OF
DENHAMS tracked the leaders between foes in second flight in the opening stages, shifted three deep racing into the turn while being prompted to advance
but came up empty in the drive. ROCKET RIDE tracked off the first flight racing four wide into the turn and soon dropped out. BE YOUR OWN HERO broke
awkwardly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AFTER RED SUN broke readily, went to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating, then
maintained that advantage into the lane while being kept to firm right handed pressure to prove best. LAUNCH AWAY broke inwards, was held up while
dropping out last racing to the first turn, gathered momentum on the far turn, swung six wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady late effort
to prevail for the place honors. ROMANTIC ATTACK, bumped at the start, was rated off rivals while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, shifted out
splitting rivals midway through the backstretch, gained between foes on the far turn to bid three deep racing through the stretch but couldn't gain terms with
the winner while being just outkicked for second. DOUBLE BEE STING tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part of the second flight racing to the
backstretch, came through inside foes to bid into the lane but was outkicked for a share. BEE BIT, urged to a forward placing racing just off the pacesetter,
prompted that rival into the far turn and weakened between foes late. VIVA FOREVER tracked off the second flight along the inside, lost some position
racing into the far turn and offered no rally. SHOWIT tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, continued three deep between foes into
the far turn and steadily faded. GO YEOWOMEN, reserved outside foes off the second flight while pulling a bit against restraint, was prompted to advance
while caught four wide racing into the far turn and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SPLASH FOR GOLD, unhurried between foes in the opening stages tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, shifted three wide nearing the
turn tracking off the first flight, continued in that path into the lane and made a steady gain in late stages to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm left
handed encouragement. CLUB SODA, urged to the lead while angling inwards after the opening sixteenth, dueled for command through the turn into the
lane to edged forward late but just failed to contain the winner. COME ON DOVER settled while shifting just off the inside in early stages, was shuffled out of
close quarters nearing the half mile marker, angled to the inside entering the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages
to rally sharply four wide between foes. FOUR LEFT FEET hopped at the start to break last, angled in to gain some position between foes racing into the
turn, then angled five wide late while continuing with interest to close the gap. SOUTHSIDER broke sharply, angled to the rail, tracked off the first flight
saving ground into the bend and continued with a mild bid inside foes late. LONG STATION tracked off the first flight four wide in early stages, was fanned
six wide leaving midstretch but continued with a mild bid. GREY MASK, urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leader, advanced to press the issue
on the turn to upper stretch but proved empty in the closing stages after his rider lost his whip in upper stretch. SON OF POSEIDON settled outside foes,
continued four, then five wide into the lane and offered no rally. NOT CHOPPED LIVER tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn and
steadily faded nearing the lane. YANKTON proved no factor. ROMEO O ROMEO showed little.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE tracked the leading pair through the first turn, attended outside the leading pair down the backstretch, took the lead outside of TAK
near the seven sixteenths, and drove clear in the lane. OFF THE MEDS chased two wide near the rear on the clubhouse turn, pulled along the outside past
the seven furlong mark, raced four wide at the outside rear of the leading line past the three quarters, settled back to track the leading trio outside of
GALINDO past the five eighths, attended three wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner but kept on for the place.
GALINDO chased midpack through the clubhouse turn, tracked behind the leading line for the backstretch run, continued in range behind the leading flight
through the far turn, proved no match for the winner in the lane and was outfinished for the place. JEFF THE LION was off a step slowly, settled at the rear,
was pushed along two wide down the backstretch, took closer order around the far turn, and kept on willingly four wide in the lane. RICHIE GARY settled
near the rear inside early, was urged at the rear in the three to four path on the far turn, and passed tiring horses in the lane. CANARY ISLANDS broke out
and bumped TAK in the opening strides, set the early pace while pressured by that foe, began to weaken with half a mile to go, took up near the three
eighths while weakening inside, and had no more in the lane. TAK was bumped by CANARY ISLANDS in the opening strides, pressed the pace outside of
CANARY ISLANDS, led briefly near the half when that foe began to weaken, was outpaced by KHOZAN'S VALENTINE from the seven sixteenths, and
faded in the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, NO MILE TIME IS AVAILABLE.

Footnotes
THIRSTY COWGIRL settled last outside foes racing to the turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to edge VALIANT
LADY in time under left handed pressure. The latter tracked just off the leaders while shifting out four wide in the opening stages, advanced readily to
challenge in the three path nearing upper stretch, shifted out under left handed pressure fending off a bid from HER WILD LIFESTYLE to go clear late but
couldn't contain the winner. TRUE TO JEANINE angled inside tracking off the second flight in the opening quarter, steadily gained position between foes
and continued willingly inside the top pair late to prevail for a share. LILLET tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the turn, shifted out four
wide entering the lane and made some late progress to gain some position. ENCHILADA settled well back while angling to the rail, saved ground to the
stretch and came through close quarters to improve her placing late. HER WILD LIFESTYLE was rated tracking just off the first flight in the opening quarter,
switched out on the turn to bid for command in the four path entering upper stretch, altered course avoiding VALIANT LADY leaving midstretch shifting to
the inside and qucikly came up empty. ANNIE TIME GIRL tracked off the second flight between foes in early stages, was caught four wide racing through
the turn and had no rally. LEMON DROP TWIST angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival racing into the turn, dueled inside a rival nearing the lane
and gave way abruptly in the drive. FILLY FROM ILLY, urged along rail disputing the pace in the opening quarter, was steadied out of tight quarters racing
into the turn and quickly gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF HER WILD LIFESTYLE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER
OF VALIANT LADY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.
