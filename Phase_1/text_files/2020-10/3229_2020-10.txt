Footnotes
VASARIANO cleared inner foes a maneuvered to the inside into the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch, held an advantage from a pair of foes
around the far turn as those rivals made bids, but shook away from them turning for home, and held sway through the lane under driving pressure.
PATRIOT'S WAR tracked three wide, inched forward around the far turn to produce a bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was floated a path outwards by
an inner foe turning for home, got outpaced by the inner leader in the process, then kept on to regain ground on the clear leader while fending off EEL
POINT for minor rewards. EEL POINT brushed the gate at the start, then took an awkward step passing mile pole while trying to recover inside of rivals,
settled off of the pace around the first turn, tipped outside of the leading group and tracked from the four path around the far turn, then shifted to the five
path turning for home, and produced a mild rally outside of foes, but failed to achieve place. CIVIL SERVANT pressed the pace setter from the outside,
inched forward around the far turn as PATRIOT'S WAR ranged up along side, but came under an all out drive at the five sixteenths pole, drifted out while
tiring turning for home, and weakened through the lane. GOOD JUJU stalked along the inside, saved ground around the turns, but failed to rally through a
bit of tight quarters along the inside in upper stretch. HERO OF LOVE stumbled at the start, and was outrun throughout.

Footnotes
FARSIGHTED dueled for the lead outside of a trio of foes, then a pair of foes around the turn while staying in the four path, forged an advantage from those
inner rivals passing the quarter pole under confident handling while shifting down to the three path, responded when roused approaching the three
sixteenths pole and quickly asserted command, then widened her advantage handily through the final furlong. SILK AND SUGAR settled far off of the speed
duel two to three wide around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, but lugged in approaching the three sixteenths pole, straightened course and
rallied four wide through the to achieve place approaching the wire. NAUGHTY RENDEZVOUS stalked the leading trio of duelers from the three path, tipped
four wide turning for home, but proved no match for the eventual winner while forging place approaching the furlong pole, then was outfinished by an outer
surging foe in the final sixteenth for that position. MANIA dueled for the lead inside of a trio of foes early on, then a pair of foes around the turn, but failed to
keep pace with the eventual winner passing the quarter pole, then kept on through the lane, but was outfinished for minor rewards. CARDIOVERSION was
off a step slow and crowded at the start, then saved ground far off of the pace and passed tired foes though the lane without threatening. REMINISCENT
settled off of the collapsing pace in the two to three path around the turn, and failed to factor. YELLOW DRESS stalked the leading duelers along the inside,
then from the two path around the turn before swinging to the five path turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch. RAWAN dueled for the lead three
wide and between horses, but weakened in upper stretch. PLATINUM SKY was off a step slowly and outrun. AUNT JOIE dueled for the lead two wide and
between horses, but backed out into the turn, and wilted around it.

RISKY MANDATE set the pace along the inside, drew clear from the pressing CARDAMON into the turn, established a margin around the bend, then was
roused when feeling mild pressure from the rallying CLUB CAR in upper stretch, and stubbornly fended off that foe through the lane. CLUB CAR rallied
three wide through the latter part of the turn to forge place from CARDAMON passing the quarter pole, took aim on the clear leader with multiple lengths to
find in upper stretch, grinded away and got within a pair of lengths, but flopped leads at the sixteenth pole and was second best. CARDAMON pressed the
leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that foe into the turn, and tired thereafter. SARA SEA stalked along the inside, but steadily faded
through the latter half of the turn. CLEAR AS DAY was outrun.

Footnotes
BLAME DEBBIE saved ground while settled far off of the pace around the first turn, advanced to track from midpack two wide around the far turn, waited for
racing room behind the leaders passing the quarter pole before altering out to the four path in upper stretch, then responded willingly, rallied alongside the
leaders at the furlong pole, and drove clear in the late stages. PRAIRIE WINGS stalked along the inside and from the pocket, tipped three wide approaching
the quarter pole to bid for the lead in upper stretch, vied outside of URBAN FAIRSTYLE approaching the furlong pole as BLAME DEBBIE rallied along side,
then got outfinished by the latter and prevailed over the prior for place. URBAN FAIRYTALE pressed the pace setter from the outside, dueled with that foe
around the far turn before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, then dug in inside of PRAIRIE WINGS in upper stretch, got headed by that foe and a
wider surging rival at the furlong pole, then gave way through the final sixteenth. AURELIA GARLAND saved ground from midpack, but failed to produce a
bid and chased the leading group through evenly through the lane. TEMPERS RISING trailed along the inside, took the far turn in the two path before
shifting to the four path turning for home, then to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to produce a rally. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO raced far off of
the pace in the two to three paths around the turns before swinging to the six path turning for home, but failed to factor. CHANNEL PRINCESS stalked two
to three wide, but was outmoved by inner foes in the latter half of the far turn, then got floated to the six path turning for home while fading. INVETERATE
set the pace along the inside, dueled inside of URBAN FAIRYTALE around the far turn, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and weakened in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
OFF WE GO lunged outwards at the start, vied five wide and outside of multiple foes down the backstretch, then four wide into the turn before forging an
advantage from a pair of foes while under confident handling at the quarter pole, drew clear when roused passing the three sixteenths pole, and held safely
from SUN PATH through the final furlong. SUN PATH bobbled at the start, tracked the leading duelers from midpack in the five path, inched closer turning
for home, but was bumped by SUPER QUICK passing the quarter pole as that foe tried to shift out, then leaned in from right handed pressure while
sustaining a rally through the lane, but failed to have enough to catch the clear leader. SUPER QUICK stalked from behind the leading duelers and in the
three path around the turn, leaned out and bumped SUN PATH while trying to create racing room passing the quarter pole, then chased the clear leader
through the lane while getting outfinished by her outer counterpart for place. JOY OF PAINTING vied for the lead four to three wide and between horses,
then two wide turning for home, but proved no match for her outer counterpart in upper stretch, and tired thereafter. ZAPPORITA vied for the lead three to
two wide and between horses, then cleared an inner foe approaching the five sixteenths pole, dug in turning for home, but proved no match for OFF WE GO
in upper stretch, and tired. SOLEMN OATH raced off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor. JUST LIFE trailed, saved
ground around the turn before attempting a rail rally through the lane, but failed to factor. RISKY REWARD lied close up to the pace inside of multiple foes,
but backed out at the half mile pole, raced far off of the pace around the turn, and steadily tired after coming into the lane in the three path. SENTIMENTAL
CROSS vied two wide and between horses, cleared her inner foe at the half mile pole, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. PEACHY
QUEEN had a slow start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
LADY LILLY stalked the loose leader two to three wide, inched closer into the far turn to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage
turning for home before digging in inside of DASH TO THE TOP in upper stretch, and held courageously to the wire. DASH TO THE TOP rallied five wide
around the far turn to bid for the lead in upper stretch, inched closer to gain even terms with the leader with a sixteenth to go, but hung. AMERICAN GRACE
forced an inner foe inwards after the start, tracked the pace from the two path, lied in range around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leaders
turning for home, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, then stayed on to claim a minor share without threatening. SPUN D'ETAT tracked from midpack
three wide, inched closer four wide around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with inner and outer foes in upper stretch. TORSIE'S CHARM stalked along
the inside, shifted outside of the clear leader down the backstretch, inched closer into the far turn to bid for the lead two wide and between horses around
that bend, but gave way to outer foes in upper stretch. TETE A TETE raced far off of the pace in the four to three path around the turns, and never got
involved. PUYE TIMING pulled clear around the first turn, opened up into the backstretch, but met multiple bids into the far turn, and weakened at the five
sixteenths pole. CROWELLA tracked from midpack along the inside, but was done early. STEPHANIES JEWEL was forced inwards after the start, lobbed
along behind the field throughout, and showed little.

Footnotes
LUCK MONEY tracked from off of the pace two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn before swinging four wide turning for home, rallied in
upper stretch to bid for the lead at the furlong pole, drove clear of inner foes, and held firm through the late stages. QUIET DIGNITY stalked along the
inside, but lacked room and was blocked behind the leaders passing the quarter pole, split foes at the furlong pole and bid for the lead inside of LUCK
MONEY in the late stages, but did not have enough to catch that foe. SURSUM CORDA saved ground far off of the pace around the turns before shifting to
the four path turning for home, then altered to the five path to be outside of leading foes in upper stretch, sustained a rally through the lane, and surged in
the final sixteenth to achieve show. CHOATE BRIDGE saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, then took the far turn two wide before swinging to
the five path turning for home, but only produced a grinding rally, and was outfinished by an outer foe for minor rewards. ELLA BRILLA stalked three wide
around the far turn before bidding for the lead outside of LEMON PEPPER approaching the five furlong pole, vied with that foe around the far turn before
responding to coaxing to forge an advantage passing the quarter pole, but was headed by LUCK MONEY at the furlong pole, and yielded between horses
through the late stages. FIRST COURSE raced far off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, and failed to factor. LEMON POPPER set the pace,
held an advantage from ELLA BRILLA around the far turn, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, and weakened in upper stretch. I HEAR YOU
stalked two wide, shifted three wide turning for home, brushed with her outer rival while getting outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, then was squeezed
back when put to tight quarters by both ELLA BRILLA and LUCK MONEY approaching the furlong pole, steadied, and was protected thereafter.

Footnotes
DIAMOND OOPS stalked along the inside, saved ground before shifting three wide turning for home, took aim on the clear EMPRIRE OF GOLD in upper
stretch, and rallied under a long drive to wear down that tiring foe approaching the wire. EMPIRE OF GOLD prompted the pace three wide, then dueled
outside of NO PAROLE around the turn, forged an advantage at the quarter pole and drew clear in upper stretch, but drifted in while hanging on his left lead
in midstretch, tired through the final furlong, and was caught approaching the wire. ECHO TOWN chased the pace two wide and between horses, lost
ground to the leaders into the turn while under pressure, got outmoved by the eventual winner to his inside through the latter half of the turn before being
floated four wide by that rival turning for home, then churned on through the lane to outfinish WHITMORE for show. WHITMORE settled off of the pace in
the two path around the turn, swung six wide turning for home, but only produced a mild rally, and was outfinished by an inner foe for show. ABSOLUTELY
AIDEN was restrained back after failing to achieve the lead in the early stages, got outsprinted and trailed the field by a distance into the turn, then produced
a mild rail rally through the lane, but lacked room at the sixteenth pole, and failed to factor. NO PAROLE was washed out pre-race, dueled for the lead
inside of EMPRIRE OF GOLD around the the turn, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole, proved no match, and weakened through the lane.
MIDNIGHT SANDS tracked the pace five wide, got floated seven wide turning for home, and tired in upper stretch. MO DONT NO raced forwardly placed
four to three wide around the turn, but was outkicked between horses in upper stretch, and faded. LEXITONIAN raced off of the pace in the three path and
never got involved.

Footnotes
SIMPLY RAVISHING cleared off early on, shifted down from the three path to the inside around the first turn, held a loose and unpressured advantage down
the backstretch, drew away from the field under her own power with five sixteenths to run, then widened her margin under driving pressure through the short
stretch. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL stalked two wide, but came under a drive to keep pace with the loose leader into the far turn, failed to do so and proved no
match for that foe with five sixteenths to run, then prevailed over an inner rival through the lane to secure place. TRAVEL COLUMN hopped at the start,
saved ground off of the pace before advancing inside of foes to a stalking position down the backstretch, tracked from the pocket into the far turn, but failed
to keep pace with the loose leader around that bend while bidding for place inside of CRAZY BEAUTIFUL, then lost the battle for that position to that foe
through the lane. THOUGHTFULLY stalked along the inside around the first turn, shifted off of the rail to be three wide at the five furlong pole, but chased
and faded around the far turn. OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT saved ground while trailing around both turns, but failed to factor. XTREMA tracked from midpack
two to three wide around the first turn, then four wide around the far turn, but tired through the lane. GRAMERCY raced far off of the pace two wide around
both turns, and never got involved.

Footnotes
ROYAL PRINCE stalked along the inside early on, but got rank along the rail into the firs turn, pulled to a three wide stalking position and outside of foes into
the backstretch, tracked into the far turn before bidding for the lead turning for home, then forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and held it
safely through the lane. SKY TEMPLE stalked from the pocket after maneuvering to the inside into the first turn, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch
and lacked a kick to split the leaders through a large hole, shifted three wide in midstretch to attempt a outside bid, but remained on his left lead, lugged in
greenly, and needed correction through the lane. CONQUEST RAINYCITY set the pace along the inside, held an advantage from HOISTTHEMAINSAIL
down the backstretch, but was headed by the eventual at the three sixteenths pole while hanging on his left lead, and lost place to an outer foe in the late
stages. MASTER OF THE RING saved ground far off of the pace, took the far turn in the two path before swinging to the five path at the quarter pole, then
sustained a late rally and was gaining through the closing stages. STORMING LION rated far off of the pace in the two path around both turns, and stayed
on mildly to surpass outer foes through the lane. SHALDAG tracked from midpack three to four wide around both turns, but tired. MR. BRUTUS lunged
outwards and bumped an outer foe at the start, then raced far off of the pace three wide before inching closer five wide around the far turn, but failed to
factor. NARMER was off slowly and lagged behind the field early on, then took the far turn in the two to three path before swinging to the five path turning for
home, but lugged in in upper stretch and failed to rally. HOISTTHEMAINSAIL pulled to prompt the pace two wide into the first turn, but weakened between
horses at the quarter pole. CITY DRIFTER advanced to midpack into the backstretch, tracked within range of the lead in the three path and between horses
into the far turn, but lacked room and was blocked in upper stretch, then failed to menace. CATIPARI took the far turn in the three to four path while far off of
the pace, and was no factor. BRYCE CANYON was forwardly placed two wide and between horses early on, but shied from an inner rank for into the first
turn, retreated to midpark into the backstretch, then steadily faded thereafter.
