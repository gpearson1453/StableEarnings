Footnotes
CASTLE CASANOVA raced off the pace between rivals, advanced on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed willingly outside and pulled
away under urging. ATTHEPEARLYGATES stalked three wide, bid three wide on the turn, led into the lane, dug in gamely inside of the winner and came up
second best. RICARDITO chased three wide, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied late and got up for third. FLEET WARRIOR showed the way in the
opening furlong, then stalked two wide, bid two wide on the turn, dueled into the lane and weakened. HAIL TO THE KING raced off the rail, off the pace,
came three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. SIR HIGGINS chased inside and tired. DAYTIME LOVER raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
KILL SWITCH rushed up on the rail to set the pace, dueled on the turn and faded. Five furlong fraction provided by GMAX timing.
