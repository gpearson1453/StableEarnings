AMERICAN CAMP raced unhurrie3d behind a quick pace, raced two wide on the second turn, offered a determined rally in the lane and was up late.
ALBANY FRONT settled well off the early leaders, moved two wide on the second turn to gain command once in the stretch but could not hold off the
winner. BLUES RAPPER settled earlly, came four wide on the second turn to loom a bold factor but lost his punch in the stretch. REDACTION lacked a late
response. GEM STATE set the quick pace, but had little left after six furlongs. DON'S FINAL FINAL forced the fast pace and came up empty.

Footnotes
KLONDIKE CREEK took a good striking position from the inside early then raced unhurried to the second turn, remained inside into the stretch, forged to
the front near the furlong pole and won driving. SPANISH HOMBRE settled early, offered his best bid three wide into the stretch but could not go with the
winner. AVALANCHE lagged well back to the second turn, finished in a good but belated rally. OCEAN FURY dueled on the lead from the rail to the head of
the lane and slackened. CONCUR raced unhurried, tried to rally two wide into the lane but lacked the needed response. UNPOSSIBLE dueled two wide for
six furlongs and gave way. OH BE ONE showed little.
