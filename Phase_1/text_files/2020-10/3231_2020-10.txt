DANCINGWITHPAYNTER was content to lag following a slow break, began a run outside rivals after a half, raced four wide around the final turn, took over
nearing the final furlong then drew out under urging. WITCH raced in good position along the rail, angled out two wide nearing the stretch while inside the
winner then couldn't keep up. MOON CHANT moved to a clear lead before going a quarter, angled to the inside, set the pace into the stretch then
weakened. NEW FOUND TREASURE was unhurried, raced two wide around the final turn and lacked a strong closing. TEX MEE A KISS stayed inside,
improved position into the stretch then flattened out. BOOMERANG MISS wasn't far back three wide into the far turn, bore out and faded. ARTIFUL MOVE
chased, gave her best three wide into the far turn then stopped.

and weakened. BEACH BANKER ducked out leaving the gate, wasn't far back in the three path into the turn then stopped. RAECHEL'S RISK came well out
from the inside on the backstretch, raced the four path around the turn and failed to matter. PERFECT HIDEAWAY couldn't keep up.

close into the stretch then weakened. FIFTY FLAGS was slow early, stayed inside around the turn, came out between horses for the drive and flattened out.
OBROTHER ITSYLVIA came out leaving the gate, bumped with FLASHINTHENIGHT, raced wide into the stretch and wasn't a factor. UNCLE TONY P
faded early from between horses and was eased up through late stretch. FLASHINTHENIGHT came in leaving the gate, bumped with OBROTHER

HIS NAME IS SUE broke slowly, advanced outside to stalk the early leader, raced the three path around the turn, took over just after a half then drew out
through the final sixteenth. JEEZUM JIM moved to a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail while making the pace for a half then couldn't
stay with the winner. DUPREE wasn't far back in the four path and lacked the needed rally. WOLFINBARGER had position along the rail to the stretch then
tired. LET ME GO FIRST was reluctant to load, was fractious in the gate then was outrun.

Footnotes
ARCH YOU READY chased between horses early, fell back in the three path on the final turn, split horses into the final furlong and took over just after a
mile. RICK'S SURPRISE settled inside, rallied the rail to a short lead nearing midstretch but couldn't withstand the winner. SWITCHBLADE moved clear on
the first turn, ran out while still in control entering the stretch then gave way leaving the furlong grounds. CLINIC made a two wide run around the final turn,
swung wide into the stretch and lacked a further response. PAL CAL had his head turned to the inside by the assistant starter at the break, left several
lengths behind the field, moved to press outside the early leader, gave his best on the final turn, was carried wide into the stretch and tired. CATTLE DRIVE
stopped. CANT STOP THE RAIN trailed.

KATY THE CAT was unhurried outside, rallied the four path around the final turn, closed a gap from the outside through the final yards and was in time.
PADRINONEVERQUITS moved clear from the outside before a quarter, stayed out from the inside while clear into deep stretch but was outfinished.
TOMARIE wasn't far back outside, raced the three path around the final turn while inside the winner but couldn't stay with that one through the lane. KEW
PALACE advanced between rivals early, stayed inside around the final turn and lacked the needed closing. LADY A. G. was slow early then made a mild
run. LEAKY CAULDRON chased the early leader for about a quarter then faded. QUIET PLEASE wasn't far back between rivals for about five furlongs then
stopped.

VANESSA'S SECRET chased, moved two wide to command just after a half, drew out in early stretch and was kept to urging. NEARLY MISSED broke
slowly, made a run two wide between rivals around the turn then gained slowly through the lane. CALS MY PAL bobbled leaving the gate, was unhurried,
angled out entering the stretch and finished willingly. UNEMOTIONAL opened a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed inside around the turn then gave
way. SWEET MAGIC MOMENT wasn't far back outside into the turn, fell back and continued evenly. MICRO BLAST tired inside. CANDY PANTS was
outrun.
