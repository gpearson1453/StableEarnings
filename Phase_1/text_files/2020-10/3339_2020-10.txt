Footnotes
NINA EN FUEGO pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide and pushed to the front into the stretch then held under steady urging. ONLY THE
FACTS set the pace under pressure from the winner, saved ground, was overtaken into the stretch but battled on to the line. ROCKETANN was rank inside
rivals to the first turn, stalked the pace to the half, saved ground to the stretch but lacked a closing response. FOGGY BOTTOM had no speed, settled to the
second turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was making up ground belatedly. EARLY RISER (IRE) settled mid pack to the second turn, was between
rivals two wide to the stretch then came up empty in the drive. GREY ABBEY steadied off of ROCKETANN'S heels on the first turn then was not a factor.

Footnotes
CATS BLAME was outsprinted to the turn, shifted four wide then swung out widest for the drive and closed steadily to be along in time. TRIBAL STORM
was also outsprinted, saved ground to the stretch then shifted off the rail, rallied between rivals but was outkicked by the winner. HOT ENCOUNTER hustled
to contest the pace from the rail, pushed clear to mid stretch then could not hold on. MALIBU ALEX chased the leaders three wide to the stretch, responded
to mid stretch then was outfinished. TANNERS PRIDE contested the pace outside a rival to the stretch, got outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly.
AOTEAROA had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but could not make an impact late. ARGOSY FLEET hustled to contest the pace early, got outrun to
the stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
DYN O MITE pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide to take over into the stretch but then was green, lost focus, was collared leaving the
furlong grounds but regained his stride and pushed clear. MOMMA MOCCA was unhurried to the half, raced two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to
almost collar the winner nearing the sixteenth pole but had to settle for the place. MISTY CAT trailed to the second turn, raced three then four wide to the
stretch, closed to also loom a threat leaving mid stretch but finished evenly. MR. PICKLES tracked the pace to the second turn, bid two then three wide to
the stretch but was outkicked in the late stages. COLAVITO was very washy in the post parade then was reluctant to load, became rank in the early stages
then chased the pace from the rail for six furlongs and weakened. SOONER THAN SOONER was allowed to settle for a half mile then saved ground to no
avail. SOBER hustled to the front, eased over and set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then tired.

MINISTERS OF MONEY stalked the pace three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front leaving mid stretch then went wrong nearing the finish line, was pulled
up quickly by the rider and vanned off. CALL SIGN LUCKY set the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the
winner but held the place.'. LOZLOVIAN bobbled to begin, recovered and also stalked the leader two wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch then
finished evenly. RAGING WATERS was chasing to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch and could not make an impact late. AUTISM ABILITY trailed
while off the rail to the stretch then closed a gap without threatening. ELI B got outsprinted early, raced three wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive.
CANDY BARON was also chasing the pace, came three wide to the stretch then gave way. BIG ERROR had no speed and was not a factor.

strides. LUCKY STEPPER settled mid pack to the half, saved ground to the stretch and was gaining ground steadily inside rivals. SHAKE IT CALI trailed to
the second turn, had to swing out five deep for room into the stretch and finished in a rally. WILLING TO BURN pressed the pace to the second turn, bid two
wide to engage for the lead to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. STRADARI had good speed but lugged out into the first turn, was

tracked the leaders to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. CREATIVE ROMANCE pressed the winner

Footnotes
WINE AND WHISKY chased the pace to the turn, came three wide to the stretch, rallied in the final furlong, took the lead late and just held off the runnerup.
READY FOR A FIGHT was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, was widest in the drive and closed fast to just miss. SLAM
DUNK SERMON attended the pace from the rail to the stretch, inched away to mid stretch then stayed on but could not hold. FOOTHILL had no speed, was
two wide on the turn then finished steadily inside rivals. DARNQUICK chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then finished with
interest late. TAKE ME FOR A SPIN hustled to contest the pace outside of SLAM DUNK SERMON, was outkicked to mid stretch and came up empty.
NIGHT GIG was chasing the leaders three wide to the stretch then had little to offer in the drive. EUSTACE had no speed, was five wide on the turn, got
bumped by LITTLE CENTS at the quarter pole and gave way in the stretch. LITTLE CENTS also had no speed, was inside EUSTACE and four wide on the
turn then was pushed out slightly by NIGHT GIG, bumped EUSTACE and gave way.
