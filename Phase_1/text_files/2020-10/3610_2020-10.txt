BABY BOO was well placed just off the speed, rallied in the stretch on the rail and prevailed after a long drive under strong handling. UNWRITTEN set the
pace with a clear lead, was hooked at the quarter pole, held gamely and just missed. DARK TEMPTRESS had good position throughout, rallied, three wide
and and finished with good courage. MARCIE'S CANDY was allowed to settle early, rallied four wide at the top of the stretch and drew close, then flattened
out. MORNINGSTARDUST was no factor. CHANNEL PRINCESS raced mid pack early, dropped back on the fat turn and failed to respond when asked.

Footnotes
HURRICANE NATION was away alertly and quickly made the lead, led throughout and widened late under right handed urging. TIMELESS BOUNTY had
good position throughout, rallied in the stretch and was up for place. HARDLY SWAYED contended throughout and finished willingly. JUST U AND ME KID
was never far back early, swung wide in the stretch and had a mild bid. COWARDLY ACT tracked four wide and went evenly. CALIFORNIA MARTINI was
well placed early and lacked a late bid. TRULY OBLIGATO raced mid pack and was no threat. NAMATH allowed to settle on the inside, failed to menace.
THE GREATEST EAGLE slow early, was no threat. WHAT A BEAST was outrun. ARTIE AND JESSIE raced wide early, and was no factor. HOLY PALACE
was outrun.
