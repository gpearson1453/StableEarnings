Footnotes
THE HUMONGOUS ONE never far back, moved up three wide down the backstretch, gained a short lead four wide through the second turn, then drew off
in the lane and was kept to the task. FRENCH KISS ME allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the
lane, angled out and closed well for the place. PITON mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then
weakened late and held the show. ROYAL FAMILY allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, angled out
and edged up for a share. ONE REAL COWBOY mid pack, looped up four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and flattened
out. BOARDWALK BOB set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged into the second turn, then weakened in the drive. ZOODLES vied for the early
lead on the inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong. CHOCOLATE TWIST improved
position. MIKE MIKE stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground through the second turn and had no stretch rally. LUCKY UNLUCKY mid pack,
faded after a half.

Footnotes
MARMALADE stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader gaining a short lead into the
stretch, then shook clear and lasted under steady pressure. FLIRTY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into
the lane, made a steady gain and missed. TULA mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked
the needed late kick. RIPROARING well placed and inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and evened out.
STRAIGHT MADNESS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final furlong.
FED POLICY mid pack, looped to position three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. HOLLEE PEACH well
placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally. VIOLET BLUE was no factor. DESERT
DOTTY was never involved.
