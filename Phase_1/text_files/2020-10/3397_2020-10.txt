Footnotes
WASON broke outward, stayed in range moving out to the three-path entering the turn, rallied determinedly through the stretch, and was up outside S.
MUFFIN at the wire. S. MUFFIN broke in bumping SHOOTING, vied between rivals early, moved inside into the turn, edged away from MASTER KEV after
three furlongs, stayed clear through most of the stretch, but could not hold off the winner. MASTER KEV contested the pace outside rivals, got shaken off by
S. MUFFIN past the midway point of the turn, and ran on well enough to stay well clear for the show. BROTHER SATCHMO broke in bothering MIDNIGHT
TEQUILA, saved ground to the stretch, got steered out through the furlong grounds and could not gain with an even finish. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) was
devoid of early speed, and passed tired horses in the stretch. UNDER THE COUVERS bumped with SHOOTING at the start, and posed no threat. JOE
PHILLIPS broke with the leaders but was soon shuffled back between horses, and faded around the turn. SHOOTING got bumped from both sides at the
start, and was never close. SPEIGHT came four wide off the turn, and could not reach contention. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA steadied off BROTHER SATCHMO
at the start, and raced far back.

Footnotes
WHYRUAWESOME dueled inside TAKE CHARGE DUDE under a hold early, gained control after a half-mile, and drew clear through upper stretch under a
drive. JOE DI BAGGIO saved ground to the stretch, had aim outside the winner coming to the eighth-pole, but did not have enough while clearly second
best. GAME BOY BENNY got bumped lightly twice by TAKE CHARGE DUDE after the start, came under a ride three wide on the turn, and lacked the
needed response. KALU saved ground for a half, moved out in the stretch and could not gain. J S BACH broke slowly, raced four wide and was not a factor.
TAKE CHARGE DUDE broke alertly despite taking a slight hop, came in a few strides later bumping GAME BOY BENNY lightly a couple times, dueled
outside WHYRUAWESOME, could not keep pace with that one approaching the stretch, and was eased up through the late stages.

Footnotes
SPIN YOUR PARTNER advanced in the two-path heading into the far turn, bid outside LAUGHABLE through upper stretch, got bumped by the latter in the
process of wresting command outside the sixteenth-pole, and prevailed narrowly. LAUGHABLE got out a bit while on the lead into the first turn, moved
inside rating along for six furlongs, got set down after straightening away for the drive as SPIN YOUR PARTNER ranged up, drifted out under left-hand
pressure bumping that foe in deep stretch, and fought on stubbornly. AIZU moved up four wide after six furlongs, angled in through the final furlong and was
best of the others. SHE'S JUST QUALITY brushed with GALWAY CITY at the start, raced forwardly inside to the stretch, and weakened. GALWAY CITY
bumped with HUMOR ME DIXIE and brushed with SHE'S JUST QUALITY at the start, and saved ground to no avail. ART OF LAW was no factor. HUMOR
ME DIXIE bumped with GALWAY CITY at the start, had the rail early, and tired around the far turn four wide. AQAAREB broke slowly and was outrun
inside. TWISTED TREASURE pressed LAUGHABLE from outside early, and gave way approaching the stretch. CHARDRENEE raced four wide early, and
tired after a half-mile.

Footnotes
GRAVEL GERTIE set the early pace outside KAYS DREAM, moved inside entering the turn, shook off her pursuer near the quarter-pole, and was driving to
stay well in command. KAY'S DREAM pressed GRAVEL GERTIE from inside early, moved out and bid in earnest entering the turn, could not keep pace by
the top of the lane, moved to the rail and ran on best of the others. NATURELL (ECU) was outrun to the stretch, and secured the show on the rail. TRINNI
CUTIE PIE got bumped by RAIN OF BLESSING after the start, faded from contention around the turn, and was outfinished for third. PALOMA MIA chased
the leaders two wide early, and tired after a half-mile. RAIN OF BLESSING came in bumping TRINNI CUTIE PIE just after the start, and was finished early.
UNDERCOVER OUTLAW broke slowly, dropped far back around the turn, was eased up in the stretch, walked under the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
SPEEDY FIRE vied early inside several rivals, let the leaders go approaching the turn, stayed close saving ground to the stretch, tipped to the three-path
with a rebid nearing the eighth-pole, caught AWESOME VIEW from outside 70 yards out and drove clear. AWESOME VIEW contested the early pace
between horses, moved inside battling with VIVI'S DREAM'S into the turn, got the best of that dispute by upper stretch, could not hold off the winner but
stayed on well. DANCING IN FIRE was outrun early, came four wide off the turn, and rallied outside to get up for the show. VIVI'S DREAM'S vied outside
AWESOME VIEW into the turn, got shaken off after straightening away for the drive, and weakened. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER was near the two-path
turning for home, moved inside and lacked a solid closing response. DOUBLE DOT broke slowly and was outrun to the stretch, and improved position going
by tired horses. RUN SILENT was outrun two wide. WORLD GONE WILD broke in the air, moved up outside early, continued to advance around the turn
three wide, but gave way through the lane. MARIA'S MIRAGE took up between horses past the five-eighths pole, and never recovered. GLOBAL QUEEN
COCO bumped solidly with SIERRA DIAMOND at the start, and was never close. BELLA BASORA was always outrun. SIERRA DIAMOND bumped hard
with GLOBAL QUEEN COCO at the start, contested the early pace outside several opponents, and dropped back around the turn.

Footnotes
FIVE OF HEARTS chased from close range between horses around the turn, rallied to the lead outside SOUL REFLECTION coming to the sixteenth-pole
and edged away. MUKULWITZ raced two wide around the turn, had aim at the leaders in the three-path through the furlong grounds, and closed willingly
outside. NICHOLAS ROSE waited for an opening along the inside turning for home, could not get through inside SOUL REFLECTION and altered course to
the three-path outside the sixteenth-pole, then lacked a clear path late inside MUKULWITZ and behind the winner. SOUL REFLECTION set the pace
slightly removed from the rail to the stretch, moved inside keeping FIVE OF HEARTS bottled up, then gave way through the late stages. KHOZY MY BOY
raced three wide, and lacked a solid bid. ROAD TO PEACE saved ground to no avail. RICKI TICKI TAFFI pursued the leaders three wide early, and tired
through the lane on his left lead. ROYAL DUKE dropped back after an alert beginning, got pulled up midway on the turn, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SUNSET EMPIRE broke sharply, set the pace in the two-path, edged away around the turn, and was all out to hold sway late. BACCARAT FASHION raced
four to five wide around the turn, rallied through the lane and was gaining outside the winner despite jumping back to her left lead late. SALSA RITA waited
behind horses two wide midway on the turn, fanned out four wide at the top of the stretch, rallied mildly through the furlong grounds, and was outfinished.
TAKECHARGE MIRELLA chased three wide to the stretch, and weakened. BEAST OF WILDWOOD stumbled at the start, advanced around the turn four
wide, stayed on to the eighth-pole, and gave way. TATI (MEX) rushed up early inside, and retreated around the turn. GILDA F. was outrun throughout.
BABY ICE showed early speed two wide, and tired after a half-mile.

Footnotes
CAJUN BROTHER pressed the pace three wide, poked a head in front outside VINNIE VAN GO at the quarter-pole, had that rival spurt away from him
through upper stretch, stayed on task and rebid gamely to get up near the finish. VINNIE VAN GO dueled early inside RALSTON and CAJUN BROTHER,
regained command from the latter into upper stretch, drifted out late under heavy pressure and could not hold on. WANDERING WEST was outsprinted
early, came four wide off the turn, and rallied mildly to be along outside for the show. MOZO BELLO saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed
closing response. SIR KAHN stayed in range four wide to the top of the lane, and faded. RALSTON argued the pace between horses for a half-mile, and
tired through the stretch inside. LOUIS LE GRANDE was no factor.

Footnotes
HALCYON DIGEST sped right to the front, rated along through an easy pace, dug in when challenged by HONORABLE into the stretch, exchanged bumps
and brushed with that rival through the late stages and held on resolutely. HONORABLE saved ground in easy striking range to the far turn, moved two wide
taking aim outside HALCYON DIGEST after six furlongs, exchanged bumps and brushes with the leader through deep stretch and could not get by.
DAISY'S DOC saved ground outrun for six furlongs, stayed inside for the drive and rallied mildly. LIAMS STAR had the rail around the turns, and finished
evenly in the two-path. COBB stayed in range three to four wide for six furlongs, and faded into the stretch. HONESTO steadied first time through the
stretch, remained under stout restraint heading into the first turn in the second flight, and was empty when roused. UNCLE FUN raced three wide early, and
never reached contention. FEARLESS LION broke out and bounced hard off GENUINE KITTEN at the start, and was outrun. GENUINE KITTEN got
slammed from both sides and steadied back at the start, entered the backstretch widest, and never got close. MILITARY COMMANDER was outrun early,
came four wide off the far turn, and could not gain. COMPILER (IRE) broke in bumping GENUINE KITTEN solidly at the start, prompted the pace outside
the winner for nearly six furlongs, and had nothing left. OUR GREY GHOST steadied first time through the stretch, and was always outrun.
