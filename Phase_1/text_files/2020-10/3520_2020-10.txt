Footnotes
MOBIL MAGIC chased the pace for six furlongs, made the lead at the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace and maintained his advantage under
right handed urging. BEAULOVED unhurried early, loomed boldly along the rail in upper stretch and finished. TANCAHUA stalked the pace into the far turn,
inched closer entering the stretch then leveled off. FLINT CORN close up around the first turn, dropped back then passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GOOD
ENERGY outside, lacked the needed response. TROMBONE EASTON sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace for six furlongs then
tired. LIL BIT KROME trailed.

Footnotes
QUEEN CITY KITTY allowed to settle outside in the five path, drew closer four wide nearing the far turn, rallied into the stretch to gain a narrow lead and
proved best by a narrow margin in a stretch long drive. ALL THE BEST stalked the early pace, rallied thee wide on the far turn, made the lead near the
quarter pole, battled gamely to the wire and just missed. ENDURING LOVE trailed for five furlongs then found her best stride late in the six path. ISLAND
CHIC close up along the rail, lacked racing room midway on the second turn, checked then finished evenly along the rail. PEGASUS CROSS failed to
menace. SHOW ME SOME SASS pressed the pace two wide for a half, led between calls, battled into the stretch then weakened. WEEKEND AT LAST
was through after a half. TEJATE wouldn't load, set a slow early pace and flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
CASCABRIA stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead, at the top of the stretch, quickly shook clear and won under strong
handling. DARING unhurried, brushed a foe nearing the far turn, closed willingly in the five path and finished clear for second. KENNEDIE SKY settled
inside, was brushed near the three eighths pole, altered course to the six path and closed a gap late. QUIET NO MORE moved up four wide into the stretch
then failed to sustain that bid. DESIGNATE mid pack, failed to respond. CASPIAN TALE hopped inward at the start bumping HOLY DIVER then was outrun.
HOLY DIVER was bumped at the start, had speed for six furlongs then gave way. SHESWILDNFREE pressed the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the
lead, set the pace to the top of the stretch then came up empty. VAPNYARKA set the pace for five furlongs, had speed into the stretch then faltered. THE
RIDER OF KENNEDIE SKY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF DARING FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE SECOND TURN.
AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

LAST DROP OF WINE prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, set the balance of the pace, drifted to the five path and won as much the best.
WINCREDIBLE STAR allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the five path and finished clear for second. GEHRIG close up from the start, advanced
in the four path on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. LEOMBRUNO stalked the pace along the inside and went evenly. MY COWBOY away alertly,
set a pressured pace for nine sixteenths of a mile then weakened. SOUL BEAM was no factor. MINE N YOURS hopped at the start and was outrun.

Footnotes
REIGN SHOWERS was bumped at the start, responded readily when set down, slipped through along the inside entering the stretch, made the lead then
finished full of run to win as much the best. LINCOLN CENTER stalked the pace into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then was
no match for the winner. EMPIRITA had a mild late rally outside. MISS LEGS pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the pace to the top
of the stretch then came up empty. PRETTYFUNNYHONEY was shut off at the start, trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals. WROTE'S GIFT bore
in at the start bumping rivals and was no factor. LA CAFETERA well placed, was through after a half. WARRIOR BABY was outrun. LA MUNECA was
bumped at the start, sprinted to the lead along the inside before a quarter, set the pace into the turn then folded..
