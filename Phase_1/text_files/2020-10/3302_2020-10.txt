early, tipped out nearing the lane, bid three wide in midstretch, reached near even terms at the sixteenth pole, battled on outside of the winner to the wire
and just missed. SAVVY ALLY hit the starting gate, raced well back inside early and rallied belatedly. FIGHTRESS chased the pacesetter three wide in the
clear and was one-paced in the lane. CULTURAL MANDATE set a clear pace in the two path and tired in midstretch. MARKET MONEY saved ground and

HITCH A RIDE pressed the pace two wide, drew clear around the turn and held clear under a drive. GUNS BLAZING settled off the early pace between
rivals, advanced two wide around the turn and finished willingly inside of the winner while unable to seriously threaten. MAGNIFICENT MAGS raced off the
pace inside, advanced inside around the turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole, loomed outside, stayed on the left lead throughout the lane, lugged
in and faded through the final sixteenth. TAPIT'S GIRL vied inside of the winner and tired around the turn. CALI DIVINE failed to menace while racing three
wide. CALL ME HAPPY had some speed three wide and steadily faded. NOT ON MY WATCH played no factor while racing two wide.
OUTKICKTHECOVERAGE was outrun inside.

SMOOTH B set a pressured pace inside, put away the pace rival nearing the eighth pole, braced for challenges on both sides late and dug in gamely to
hold. ABSENTEE settled off the pace outside, raced three and four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, closed outside and just
missed. SOUND OFF saved ground off the pace and rallied inside of the winner. CHUBLICIOUS perched off the duel in the clear two and three wide and
was one-paced in the lane. ACE NINE NINE lacked early speed while racing three wide and rallied belatedly. MY BOY LENNY dueled outside of the winner
to upper stretch and weakened.

PLATINUM PAYNTER stalked the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, angled in and held clear under a drive.
GLOBAL BRAND settled well off the pace along the inside, swung to the extreme outside in upper stretch and rallied down the center of the track.
MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT tracked the pace from the rail, checked nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out in upper stretch and re-rallied. DECIDING
VOTE chased the pace three and four wide, battled on between foes and was outfinished for the show. MOSALAH saved ground off the pace, advanced
three wide around the far turn and had a mild rally between rivals. DON'T CHARGE IT failed to menace while racing two wide. LA BABIA saved ground in
range early, advanced three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. AMANITE chased the pace two wide, was in tight nearing the eighth
pole, angled out and lacked a further bid. STARS FOREVER set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner nearing the quarter pole, was pushed
inward near the eighth pole, steadied soon after and dropped back. SUNDRENCHED played no factor while racing two wide. HAPPYCREST was outrun
while racing two wide. HAPPINESS made little impact while racing two wide.

Footnotes
NASHVEGAS dueled inside in the two path, drew clear midway around the turn, drifted into about the five path turning for home, held clear past the
sixteenth pole then just lasted under a drive. LAFITTE'S FLEET settled off the pace along the inside, could not keep pace while under a drive around the
turn, kept plugging away inside and made a late surge inside of the winner to just miss. ALDO'S KITTEN chased the pace three wide, lacked the needed
rally but held on for the show. BOSTON LIGHT saved ground well off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. SILVER EDGE
saved ground and failed to menace. BYCHANCE dueled outside of the winner early and tired nearing the lane. FROST'S SONG had brief speed three wide.
