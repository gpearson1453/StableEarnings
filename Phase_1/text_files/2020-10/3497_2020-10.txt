STILL ALIVE stalked the pace outside, took over midway on the turn and drew away under light pressure. CARDI G hustled to a clear lead inside, vied on
the turn and held gamely for the place. FREEDOM PASSAGE settled just off the leaders three wide and flattened out in the stretch. ONE SLICK CHICK
moved inside on the turn, angled out in the stretch and lacked a bid. WHITNEY COVE broke sluggishly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
TRUE WISDOM was five wide early and then was steered closer to the rail, drifted out while opening a clear lead near mid stretch, and maintained a clear
lead under strong handling. VERY COLORFUL saved ground in second flight, fell back near stretch but was slowly gaining late. NAVY COMMANDER broke
slowly and was two wide while just off the pace, raced between rivals through stretch and weakened. INCENSED moved strongly inside on the turn, swung
out into stretch, flattened out but was just up in the final strides to outfinish JACKS A WARRIOR. JACKS A WARRIOR was three wide in second flight, raced
between rivals through stretch, was not persevered with through the final furlong and it may have cost him fourth place monies. SAMADI SKY, widest in
second flight, tired. SARATOGA WILDCAT failed to be a significant threat. SALT IT HERE was not a serious factor.

LIVIN A DREAM forced the pace outside, vied throughout and was up in the final yards in a determined showing. BOW TOWN CAT hustled to the front
inside, battled throughout and just missed in a game try. SALLY O'PRADO lacked speed, angled wide in the stretch and showed late energy. SPECIAL
RISK settled outside the pacesetters and continued willingly to the finish. NOT IN THE MOOD raced off the pace and flattened out through the stretch. HER
DIVINENESS stumbled at the start, angled inside then proved empty. GALILEO'S AFFAIR trailed far behind and was never in contention.
FILLUPCOHENSAPIKER was urged close up wide down the backstretch and gave way readily.

Footnotes
CAWAJA TIME stalked inside, fell back a bit on the turn, responded readily when set down in the stretch and won going away. TRIPLE JUMP was outside
and just off the pace, loomed boldly in deep stretch but couldn't match strides late. OUR LADY OF LORETO set the pace just off the rail, edged clear near
mid stretch but then weakened late. CONGAREE ROSE was outside early, moved to the rail, angled out into stretch and tired. IWASBORNAWINNER raced
just off the rail and passed tiring foes. UP JUST IN TIME, two wide in second flight, drifted out on the turn and tired. GODDESS OF CASH was two wide and
failed to menace. SWEET LILLY FACTUM, slowest from the gate, showed nothing.

JEROME AVENUE broke alertly and led in hand, repelled a challenge after half a mile then drew away handily through the stretch. KADENS COURAGE bid
inside the winner before half a mile and continued well while no match for the winner. WEATHER WIZ split rivals advancing on the final turn and after a long
drive earned the show. HOLIDAY BONUS rated inside, moved closer after half a mile then flattened out. ACED angled outside on the first turn, was asked
for run on the final turn then faded. MASTERFUL TOUCH lagged far behind then passed a fading rival. HIZAAM was urged close for half a mile and stopped
abruptly.

Footnotes
INCUBATOR set the pace just off the rail, quickly shook loose and opened a huge lead in mid stretch, began to shorten stride deep stretch but had more
than enough to maintain a clear lead. DODDSPRIVATELABEL, very wide early, split rivals on the turn, came five wide into stretch and closed well.
THOMAS KNIGHT saved ground, moved out on the turn and held show. MASS APPEAL eased out on the turn rallying, was angled towards the rail through
stretch but was too late. RIDE ON FAITH, between foes and just off the pace, had no rally. COLORADO GRANDSLAM, bumped leaving the gate, stalked
lapped on winner then tired. FREE FOR NOTHING came in leaving the gate and raced wide. IRONBOUND saved ground just off the pace then tired.

LORDEN'S LOVE stalked from the four path, took the lead on the final turn and gamely held on. BLUE SHINE saved ground, eased out near quarter pole,
challenged and loomed through stretch but hung. PENANCE, reluctant to load, was racing in the five path while never far back, fell back but held show. SO
INNOCENT saved ground early, eased out on the final turn, split rivals through stretch but was too late. CHECKBOUNCIN BILLY, between rivals while not
far back, tired. JANELLE DREAMS broke slow, raced wide and drifted wider through stretch. GATOR GIRL set the pace in the three path then tired.
DAZZLE ME raced wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SALSITA ROJA took the lead at once, ran freely in front in the four path, held a long lead through stretch and won with speed to spare. CORN OFF THE
COB raced in three path and fought gamely to hold place. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE saved ground, continued along the rail through stretch and raced with good
courage to the wire. LOVE ON FIRE raced three wide in second flight but then weakened late. DREAMING DIAMONDS, two wide and just off the pace, also
weakened late. PROSPECTIVE BELLE was jostled around leaving the gate and then was very wide. DI came out leaving the gate, raced well off the rail
and was no factor. SHE'SMYRISENSTAR was never a factor. ATLANTIC AVENUE came in leaving the gate then showed little. TOWSON was very
fractious in the gate, broke in a tangle and unseated her rider.
