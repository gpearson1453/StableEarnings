Footnotes
CARIBBEAN SKY broke sharp, backed off the lead to track a clear leader, was urged at the top of the stretch and ridden out to wear down the leader in the
final yards. OHIO STORM was shut off at the start, raced well off of the pace, gave chase on the turn from inside, angled out for room and gained best late
for second. COUNTRY MOON was bumped at the start, quick up the rail to a clear lead, stayed in front to the stretch, had the rider shake the reins down the
lane and weakened to third in the final yards. CONCORDSDIFFERENCE was bumped at the start, stalked inside from off the pace and lost the show spot
late. MYSTIC MAGIC was bumped at the start, unhurried, roused on the turn and empty. ATLANTIS ROSE was bumped at the start and quit after a quarter.

PRIMARY APPEAL saved ground to the turn, rallied outside in the drive to go past late. LIL BIT KROME no speed to the turn, rallied on late to pass weary
leader for place. BOASTFUL DENIAL chased to turn, inherited lead past quarter pole but faltered late. TORNADO KID well placed to turn but swallowed up
past the five sixteenth pole only to improve late. SONNYS CIGAR close up to turn, swung wide to avoid trouble past quarter pole. TER POLE, no late run.
MASTER VOLUME troubled trip to turn with no where to run, ran on when clear when encountering severe traffic problems past the quarter pole almost
dropping rider with the rider displaying an amazing display of strength, fitness and agility not to fall off and regain his balance to gallop out to the wire. KID
TEJANO broke sharp outside and was pulled up quickly on the backstretch and walked off. KING LOMAX quick to front, led to the turn but went wrong and
fell while subsequently being vanned off.

from inside while off the pace, rallied in the three path on the turn, ran down the stretch among several foes and kept on for the show spot. MY GOOD GIRL
tracked up close and lost position down the stretch. HAMPTON SPRING was roused on the turn in the four path, gained to mid stretch and faded.
RIPROARING was never close and widest in the stretch.

Footnotes
JAZZ MUSIC rushed inside to the stretch, angled out for run between horses in the final seventy yards while all out to the wire. EXCLUSIVE DONALD
tracked off rail to the stretch ran on in the lane while bumped late for the place spot. HACIENDA BLVD sharp speed to the front secured the rai but caved in
the drive. RIGHT THE WRONG chased to stretch, caught between horses late, bumped rival inside the final sixteenth and backed out. ELECTRIC AVENUE
raced wide to turn, continued on outside to pass tired ones in the stretch. KEIGHTLEY raced evenly with no late kick when needed. DRAFT BEER inside to
stretch, could not respond in the drive. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK tried to keep up to turn but retreated from quarter pole. JACK SPARROW had an awkward
start outside and never in contention. AFTER A TRAINER OBJECTION AND STEWARDS INQUIRY POSTED FOR AN INCIDENT THROUGH THE FINAL
SIXTEENTH, THE STEWARDS DEEMED NO ACTION TO BE TAKEN WITH THE RACE DECLARED OFFICAL.
