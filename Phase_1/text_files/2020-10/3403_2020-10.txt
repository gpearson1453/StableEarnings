Footnotes
TWILA MAE well placed and outside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off
late. NOSTALGIA set the pace on the inside, turned back a bid into the stretch, stayed on when challenged at the furlong marker, then was no match late
and held the place. LIGHT IN THE DARK stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the
leader into the lane, weakened and held the show. SEEKING VIOLET hard to race inside, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into
the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and could not gain. DISCRIMANATION was never involved. BRILLIANT PATINA showed little.
CHARMEDNDANGEROUS well placed and outside, faded through the second turn. FIELD REALITY lost contact with the field, was pulled up and vanned
off.
