Footnotes
SLY unhurried in the beginning, raced two wide then outside a rival, came off the far turn three wide, rallied outside the top pair and got up in time. BENCH
JUDGE stumbled leaving the gate but recovered well to quickly to take command, cleared and angled to the inside, led clear to the quarter pole, met bids
and clung to a short lead through the final furlong but got edged at the wire. SEEKING REFUGE stalked three deep then outside a rival, went three wide into
the stretch, bid between in the lane but got outkicked. HONOS MAN content to settle at the back, tucked inside on the first turn, moved out into the two path
around the far turn then back to the rail still on the bend, angled out into the stretch, then closed well from outside. SINGLE ME OUT tracked between foes
then a bit off the rail into the stretch, angled to the fence and never responded to urging. MONTANA MOON stalked the pace in the two path to the stretch
and weakened. BABAEL stalked from inside, dropped back on the second turn, tired and was ridden out to the wire.

Footnotes
HIMIKO showed early speed then lost command to AS TIME GOES BY, chased that rival two wide through the turn, bid outside approaching the
three-sixteenths pole, took the lead and cleared at the furlong marker then inched away in deep stretch. AS TIME GOES BY off slow to begin, rushed up
inside to clear the field, showed the way along the rail into the stretch, could not match the winner in the final furlong but proved second best. ANGEL OF
FREEDOM off slow to begin, chased near the inside then rushed up to close the gap on the leader, kept inside through the turn then tipped out in the lane
and bested the rest. MISS MO' LICIOUS broke well and was in close outside the top pair, chased three wide through the turn and weakened in the drive.
MOJO MAMA chased off the inside, entered the turn three wide then moved into the two path, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.

MUCH MORE HALO in range just off the top pair early, went three wide into the turn, moved in a bit around the bend then back out into the three path,
drifted in a bit in the stretch, collared the leader at the sixteenth pole and edged away. PORT SAINT JOE settled off the rail, went four wide into the stretch,
closed from outside and earned the place honors. DEUCE set the pace under pressure from PROVOST, cleared rival at the quarter pole, inched away in
upper stretch, caught the sixteenth pole and held the show. INCH stalked the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, finished willingly along
the fence while in tight late. PROVOST pressed from outside, failed to keep up into the stretch and weakened. WITCH'S VOW off slow to begin, went two
wide through the turn and was never a factor.

behind early, went two then three wide around the turn, rallied and closing well in the late stages. CALL YOU TOMORROW broke out and bumped rival at
the start, chased outside a foe then three wide into the stretch, tossed head at the eighth pole and flattened out. SUANCES SECRET chased off the inside,

SAVVY GAL settled off the inside early, traveled two wide into the turn, three wide entering the stretch, four wide upper lane, rallied and reeled in the
runner-up. MISS FRAULEIN pressed the leader up the backstretch, headed rival at the five-sixteenths and took control shortly after, kicked clear in upper
stretch but got caught late by the winner. ACAI raced off the rail, angled in entering the turn, traveled along the inside to the lane then moved a bit off the
inside and lacked the needed late kick. NORMA'S LOVE chased off the rail, two wide through the turn, three wide in upper stretch and went evenly late. DIM
LIGHTS brushed leaving the gate, saved ground along the inside around the turn then tipped out and failed to threaten. AWESOME GALAXY brushed rival
at the start, took the turn two wide, moved a bit in the stretch and lacked a rally. VEGAN stumbled leaving the gate, chased outside a rival, three wide into
the stretch and proved no menace. BREAKFAST BALL tossed head and stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, angled to the inside
and was never a factor. MAJESTIC GIGI set the pace with a rival to the outside, headed at the five-sixteenths pole, failed to respond to urging and folded in
the drive.

KALYPSO broke in, showed speed inside, set the pace up the backstretch, led clear into the lane and inched away under right-handed urging. QUEENGOL
in range early, chased outside a rival through the turn and edged ILLUMINATION for the place. ILLUMINATION stalked outside the leader, entered the turn
two wide then exited a bit off the rail and got edged for second. FOREST CARAWAY stumbled leaving the gate, tracked off the rail, took the turn three to
four wide and never rallied. NEEDLESS TO SAY chased the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch, angled out and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT stalked in the two path, took closer order near the half mile pole, bid between into the far turn, gained command past the midway
point around the bend and drew away in the final furlong. SCARTO raced in the two path into the first turn, steadied at the nine-sixteenths pole, raced three
deep or three wide around the far turn, rallied and gained the place. FIELD PASS came in early and bothered rivals, went three wide into the clubhouse
turn, advanced off the rail up the backstretch, bid three deep into the far turn, vied for command around the bend, flattened in the late stages and held the
show. KISS TODAY GOODBYE chased from mid-pack along the inside, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out in the stretch and summoned a mild
rally. FARMINGTON ROAD put in tight quarters and steadied early along the rail, settled off the pace, moved out into the two path, angled out in the stretch
and improved position. K P ALL SYSTEMS GO forced in and steadied early, tracked in the two path then moved out on the backstretch, went four deep
around the second turn and lacked a rally. MARGOT'S BOY shifted in soon after the start, stalked from the inside, angled out on the backstretch then went
between runners at the half-mile pole, dropped back a bit from rivals, came two wide into the stretch and weakened. EXPRESS TRAIN steadied briefly
when MARGOT'S BOY shifted in soon after the start then steadied again when K P ALL SYSTEMS GO was forced in, trailed the field to the stretch and
never threatened. DOMINANT SOUL set the pace inside, vied with a pair of rivals around the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
PRIVATE MISSION stalked outside the leader up the backstretch, bid alongside rival at the five-sixteenths, took over at the quarter pole, cleared into stretch
and inched away to prove best. FROSTERIA stalked off the rail, took aim three wide at the top pair, could not threaten winner but was clearly second best.
TMORROWISALONGTIME tracked the pace near the inside, saved ground into the stretch, moved off the inside and bested the rest. SHVERE ARBETER
had good early speed from inside, set the pace to the turn, headed by rival at the five-sixteenths, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened through
the lane. MAMA SUPERIOR stalked in the two path through the turn and failed to respond when asked. FULL OF LAUGHS traveled near the back of the
field, angled in on the turn and improved position. HYLAND HAVEN off alertly from the far outside then dropped toward the rear of the field, went four wide
through the turn and proved no menace. LADY MO chased the speed from inside then two wide on the turn and was never a factor. MEET AT DUDLEY'S
raced near the back of the field early on, came off the turn three wide and tired.
