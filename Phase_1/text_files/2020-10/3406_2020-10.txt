Footnotes
MINDOFMYOWN was allowed to settle early, found room while racing five wide, took control early stretch and drew off as an easy winner. SINGING
NICOLE was up close early, went six wide, was no match and finished second best. PRINCESS JADA was unhurried early, advanced between rivals and
was along for the show position. LESSTALKMOREACTION tracked the early pace, raced seven wide and was empty. DRAFTY BREEZE was outrun early,
raced seven wide and never fired. JACK'S PARTY GIRL stalked the early pace while saving ground and faded. STORMY WORLD raced in mid pack early,
raced between rivals and flattened out. CAN'T GET AWAY pressed the early pace, went four wide and gave way. SASHAYING SIS set a pressured pace
from off the rail and tired. DUBLINS WILDBERRY was never a factor. FLYING PRETTY always outrun.
