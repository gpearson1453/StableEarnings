WINE AT SUNSET was bumped slightly at the start by LIS LA VICTOIRE, dueled inside to the stretch then responded when roused, kicked away and was
ridden out to the line. GO VAIDAGIRL chased the pace to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then shifted widest for the drive and came on late to
get second. LIS LA VICTOIRE was bumped by MIRACLE MILER into the winner at the start, stalked the pace three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing
response. BEE EINSTEIN was outrun early but pushed up three wide on the turn to try to engage for the lead, got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
MIRACLE MILER broke inward, bumped LIS LA VICTOIRE then dueled outside the winner and two wide to mid turn, got outrun to the stretch and tired in
the lane. TALE OF TEARS had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

was last on the backstretch then circled four or five wide to the stretch and did not rally. VONHRA had no speed, trailed to the second turn then saved
ground to no avail. CEEYA LATER chased the pace to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then tired. The rider on CULTURED PEARL
lodged an objection against the rider on BILLY'SGOTASINGLE for alleged inteference into the first turn but the stewards unanimously declined to make a
change.

JAMMERS JUSTICE set all the pace to the stretch then responded in the drive and held determinedly. RETURRAY stalked the winner from the rail to the
stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then outbattled GOVERNANCE for second. GOVERNANCE pressed the winner to the second turn, came three wide to
the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch and missed the place. BIG HOOF DYNAMITE settled for a half mile, was two wide to the stretch then could not
offer the needed late response. BOTTLE OF SMOKE chased the pace to the second turn, circled four wide to the stretch then weakened. DIRT ROAD RED
was slow to settle and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was unhurried to the half, circled four wide on the second turn, rallied despite drifting out in mid stretch, was clear late and just
held BABE DIDRICKSON safe. The latter was outrun to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, eased widest then shifted inside the winner
leaving mid stretch, closed steadily and just missed. TIZNO'S DILEMMA set the pace while off the rail to the second turn, remained two wide to the stretch
then was overtaken by the winner and finished evenly. FAIRY TALE BLISS tracked the pace to the half, offered a bid three wide to loom a threat on the
second turn but was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. FASHION ROYALTY (GB) was settled to the second turn then saved ground to no avail.
GOING TO SHABOOMS pressed the pace to the second turn but tired after six furlongs.

response. RESPECT MY CANDOR was outsprinted to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then also did not rally. OUR BOLD PRINCESS tracked
the winner from the rail to the stretch then weakened. ROLINGA trailed to the turn, was two wide to the stretch but did not threaten. MOMMY ROSE had no

Footnotes
JAMASON was on the pace to the backstretch then took back and pressed the leader to the second turn, rallied two wide and caught GENTLEMAN'S
SECRET nearing mid stretch, was overtaken by INSANIAMANIA leaving the furlong grounds but dug in gamely to best that one. INSANIAMANIA never far
back to the second turn, rallied two wide to the stretch, pushed up to engage the winner leaving mid stretch, had a head in front nearing the sixteenth
marker but could not hold. STARSHIP CHEWY had no speed, trailed to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then finished willingly in the final
furlong. GOLD N GRAND also had no speed, got fanned out four deep to the stretch and closed determinedly but too late. BILLTOWN BANNER was
chasing to the half, bid three wide on the second turn to loom a threat into the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then was outfinished. ST. GEEZY hesitated
then hopped to begin and lost about four lengths, was outrun to the second turn, had to circle rivals five wide to the stretch and did not threaten in the drive.
FULL REGALIA was allowed to settle to the second turn then saved ground but lacked a late response. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET hustled along four deep
to contest the pace to the backstretch, was in front to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then tired. SLEWPY JO stalked the pace for five furlongs
then stopped.
