Footnotes
GOLDEN APPEAL bobbled outwardly to make contact with Sunbridled then stalked inside the opening turn, eased out with a bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and widened the final sixteenth. TRUE CROSSING angled to
the inside to rate the pace then came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn, remained close
through the upper stretch but flattened stride the final sixteenth. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE stumbled at the break then settled off the pace about the three
path the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch and bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and got up for
third mid-stretch. HACKER MAN saved ground off the pace the first turn then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and
showed little more. SUNBRIDLED broke inward to exchange contact with Golden Appeal then stalked the pace off the rail, picked up the chase into the
backstretch but flattened stride at the rail on the far turn. VILLAGE PRINCE rounded the opening turn in the four and five paths and raced outside into the
backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six path and improved his position. MAN OF CHROME
raced well back in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. WINSTON'S WAY entered the first turn in the four path
and stalked from the five eighths pole, picked up the chase toward the three eighths then faded in the five path of the far turn. SAMADI BLUE rated just off
the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole but faded in the five
path of the far turn.

LOOKS GOOD took quick control to rate a short lead inside, was met into the backstretch and engaged in a long duel from that point to determinedly put off
the game effort of ENVISION SUCCESS, who stalked the early pace off the rail and challenged into the backstretch, then dug in for a game protracted
battle to the finish. ROYAL BLUE saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and finished
evenly. GLEN'S CASTLE raced off the pace about the four path the first turn then picked up the chase from the nine sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
near the rail then angled to the outside into the lane and passed rivals. MACANAO settled well off the earlier pace in the four and five paths and raced
outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole and continued in the five path of the far turn before flattening stride. THE PREDICTOR
settled off the pace and off the rail then bid into the backstretch, though, faded in the three path of the far turn. CAT MOR BRIDGE stalked the early pace in
the three and four paths and raced outside into the backstretch, then faded from the three eighths pole. CHARITABLE HERO raced well back mostly saving
ground. BEST OFFER raced with the early pace then stalked from the seven eighths pole, picked up the chase into the backstretch but gave way into the
far turn.

FENDER BABY drew clear and angled sharply in to set the pace, came under pressure at the rail past the quarter pole, was steadily handled down the lane
and lasted well. MY LOVELY GIRL broke inward across the path of the late breaking Nice N' Broad then gave chase inside, raced close through the turn
and finished well. WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT chased the pace through the backstretch and was eased to the five path on the far turn, then lugged inward down
the lane and finished evenly. BIG AFFAIR gave chase and raced close in the three path of the turn but drifted toward the head of the lane while flattening
stride. NICE N' BROAD hesitated at the break and checked off the heels of My Lovely Girl on the chute, picked up the chase down the backstretch, was
carried to the six path on the turn and finished evenly outside. HOUSE OF LOVE gave chase outside and was not a factor. MORE OR LESS gave chase
racing well off the rail, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened.

HOBE SOUND stalked the pace from the three path the first turn then took the lead four wide approaching the three eighths pole, drew clear past the five
sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. GIO DUDE stalked the pace two deep while between horses early
on and moved to even terms into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths while able to hold on for
second. KING MAURO raced well back from early contention in the three and four paths then left the first turn outside, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide and steadily improved while gaining on the runner-up. THE IRON BANK saved ground the first turn then gave
chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail, drifted leaving the turn and flattened stride. LASER LOOP saved early ground and settled off the
pace leaving the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn four wide and flattened stride. CAPE LOOKOUT
stalked the pace about the three path then gave chase from the five sixteenths pole, though, flattened stride leaving the far turn. DYNAFORM rated a slim
lead inside and was met past the half mile pole, gave chase from that point but faded leaving the three eighths.

Footnotes
WILLMAKEYOUHAPPY rated the pace inside and was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, widened on the far turn then taken in hand later yards.
BROTHER CORBIN rounded the opening turn in the four path then stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of
the far turn and settled for second best. RIP RAP RILEY came through the opening turn about the four path while stalking the pace, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened stride. HOT N SPICY LOVE rated off the pace in the three path, bid approaching the
three eighths pole then drifted toward the head of the lane and showed little more. NEW AFLEET saved ground off the pace, showed little response through
the backstretch and rounded the far turn at the rail. BIZ NASTY entered the first turn in the four path but angled to the rail midway through the turn and
raced well back. CATONSVILLE broke awkwardly and steadied at the start then never factored. PORT MORE rated close to the early pace inside, faded
past the seven sixteenths pole and was not asked for more.
