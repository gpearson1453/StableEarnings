Footnotes
MARYANORGINGER saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail near the quarter pole, aggressively split rivals inside the eighth pole, closed outside
COMBAT QUEEN under strong riding and was up near the finish. COMBAT QUEEN sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, opened up in mid stretch
and gave way grudgingly. ESCAPE FUND , well placed three wide leaving the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch and closed the gap late.
PRETTY EDGY hugged the inner rail most of the trip and weakened. MARY'S JEWEL prompted the pace, was three wide in upper stretch and gave way.
TWEET AWAY ROBIN was not a factor.

closed under vigorous rousing and was up near the finish. IT'S SIZZLING TIME sprinted clear on the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and gave
way grudgingly. NATTY BEAU , a forward factor along the inner rail for a half mile, eased out leaving the turn and flattened out. BANANAS ON FIRE , three
deep around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. MANKLIN CREEK , wide turning for home, passed tired horses. HOUSE IMPEACHMENT , four wide
leaving the turn, came up empty. MOONZANO , outrun, was wide turning for home. BUDDY REVELL was outrun. PEPE AND HEYWOOD raced in the two
path between horses on the turn and gave way.

LANDING ZONE , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail under confident handling, was set down in upper stretch and drew away while kept to
her business. DAPHNE MOON raced along the inner rail throughout, chased the winner through the stretch but could not gain. MORTAL STORM , four wide
entering the first turn, prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch and faded after six furlong. MIA BELLA ROSSA stalked the pace, advanced three
deep on the far turn and gave way in upper stretch. QUIET COMPANY , four wide the first turn, failed to menace and retreated through the stretch.
ALWAYS SOMETHING lacked speed, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
WITTY BANTER stalked the pace while kept outside rivals, circled the far turn three wide, gained command inside the eighth pole and drew off under
encouragement. ZOLA B sprinted to a clear lead on the first turn, set the pace along the rail, raced on her left lead in the stretch and weakened.
PEARLYVILLE chased the pace two wide to mid stretch and tired. GOLD CADILLAC lacked speed, raced two wide on the far turn and failed to be a factor.
TALIYAH hugged the inner rail both turns and faltered. ELLIPSIS raced along the inner rail on both turns and stopped.
