STORMS A BREWN a step slow through the turn emerged at mid track in upper stretch bidding three deep rallying clear. DREAM PARK pressed the pace
shaking clear on the turn digging in from the three path upper stretch ceding late to outside pressure. DOYLE THE WARRIOR chased the pace extending
between horses late hanging in the closing yards. J Z'S DIVA pressed early then ceded on the turn racing evenly through the lane inside. MS.
NINEONESEVEN failed to menace. STARSHIP CARNEGIE raced inside to upper stretch weakening there. WHATS YOUR DREAM was always outrun.
DOUBLE JUSTICE gave way on the turn.
