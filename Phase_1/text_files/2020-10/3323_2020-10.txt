FINAL ROSE had the best speed, set the pace from the rail, pushed away to mid stretch and remained clear under steady urging. SECOND BOLD was
outsprinted to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch then did not threaten the winner but battled determinedly to get the place. HOT SOCKS
stalked the winner three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. ON ICE was chasing early, saved ground on the turn but came up
empty in the drive. PEQUENO MONTE pressed the pace two wide to the stretch then also was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. CHARLIE RED RIVER
showed little, stopped in mid stretch then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ODESSA was always well placed, rallied two wide on the second turn to get on terms into the stretch, inched away to mid stretch and held driving.
SENORITA COMETA chased the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then outfinished JUSTA POPPA for the place. JUSTA POPPIN set
the pace under pressure to the second turn, stayed on doggedly when collared until mid stretch then weakened and could not save second. MARJORIE E
had no speed, settled for a half mile, was two wide on the second turn then could not offer the needed late response. BORN TO REIGN also settled mid
pack off the pace to the second turn, came three wide then swung out widest for the drive but did not rally. PROUD TO SHOYU had no speed and trailed
throughout.

SUNRISE JOURNEY hustled to the front, set the pace inside to the stretch then edged clear and held under steady urging. FACTS MATTER chased the
winner from the rail to the stretch, responded in the drive but settled for second. PLAYING THROUGH pressed the pace two wide to the stretch then was
outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. ABUSIVE GARY got outsprinted early, raced two then three wide to the stretch, lacked the needed late
response and was whiskered for the show. JENS DE VILLE hesitated at the start, was away a bit slow and trailed.

Footnotes
TIZZY never far back to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, took over leaving mid stretch and held stubbornly. SPUN AWAY had
no speed, was three wide to the stretch then finished steadily but too late. TONI TWO POCKET broke alertly, set the pace from the rail to the stretch,
responded to mid stretch but was tiring late. HELLO BUBBLES was chasing to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was making up ground
belatedly. TIPPY TOP chased the pace off the rail to the stretch, remained a threat to mid stretch then slackened. BRAHMS COMMAND was awkward to
begin and lost about four lengths then was used to close the gap, raced four wide on the turn and showed some interest in the late stages.
GALWALKSINTOABAR pressed the pace three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. PERSUASIVE LIPS was crowded and
checked off heels nearing the half mile pole, raced three wide on the turn but was never a threat. LYRICALLY VIOLENT had no speed and was not a factor.
THRILL'S LEGACY pressed the pace in the two path to the stretch then tired.
