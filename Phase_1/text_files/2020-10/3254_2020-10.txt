ADARI settled while four wide, advanced on the far turn and rallied while four wide in the stretch under solid handling. MULBERRY stalked the pace, dueled
around the far turn, stayed on the stretch, led late and was worn down. FABULOUS GIRL led early, was headed on the far turn and gave way.
NOCTURNAL MISSION failed to threaten. ICY DAWN never menaced. DUSTY PRINCESS was reluctant to load into the starting gate and took no part.

MY GOLDEN DAY stalked the pace, kicked clear leaving the turn and held on well thereafter. GIRLS IN CHARGE chased while three wide, remained three
wide into the stretch and stayed on. CADI DEVILLE awkward at the start, was outrun early and closed ground in the stretch. BLUSHING SCARLETT saved
ground, was angled off the rail for the stretch run, lodged a mild bid and came up empty. PALETTE was always outrun. STORM FURY sprinted clear, was
headed on the turn and gave way.
