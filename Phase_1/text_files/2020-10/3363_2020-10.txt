Footnotes
EMBEED vied to the upper stretch, drew clear and held well under urging. DETERMINED FOCUS raced close to the pace outside, closed steadily, drifted in
a bit late and earned place while no threat to the winner. ROOF TOP BAR raced in the back, shifted out for the drive and finished well to get up for show.
ZEN PI lagged early, bid inside on the turn, angled out and offered a mild bid only. FLASH IS BACK vied to the stretch, fell back, weakened and faded from
contention. JOHNG broke out, raced close to pace between horses, lacked a stretch response and failed to threaten. GOOD LUCK LEGACY raced three
wide between horses in the second flight, showed speed to the turn, dropped back and gave way. BRIGHTWOOD was a bit reluctant to load, hesitated at
the start to be away slowly, went widest in the drive and lacked a response. HINTING raced close to the pace while racing ralong the rail, was in tight and
steadied entering the turn, fell back and leveled off.

Footnotes
THE REVENGER set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held off the late charge of JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ. JOYCEE
HAZ PIZZAZ raced mid pack along the inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. MAGIC MULE stalked the pace,
was roused on the turn, lacked the needed late response and held safely for show. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT raced in the back, went widest in the drive and
failed to rally. ONE NINER TANGO stalked the pace, dropped back on the turn and finished evenly. TIZ AUCTION TIME broke slowly, saved ground and
lacked a response. PER RULING #20-199 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO
UNPLACED DUE TO A POSTIVE TEST.

Footnotes
FAIR CATCH got away well, pressed the pace, assumed command in the upper stretch, drew off for a long lead and held safely to win handily. TO THE
FRONT set a pressured pace to the upper stretch, fell back, was no match for the winner and held for second. POWER BACK was never far back while
racing outside, rallied around the turn, went six wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid to earn show. SHELLY ISLAND lagged early, angled out on
the turn, went five wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. B DETERMINED put in an even effort in an outside trip and was not a threat. NO FOOLING
DUDE stalked the pace between horses, lacked a stretch response and hung in the lane. SIN BIN was crowded and bumped at the start and outrun.
CONFUSION BABY BOY was not a factor. SCORCHED BY FIRE came in at the start, advanced inside leaving the turn and failed to respond.
WONDERMEISTER was crowded and bumped at start, raced evenly and failed to contend. DON JUPP pressed the pace along the rail, shifted out for the
drive, had nothing left and dropped back. MISTER FRANK'S WAY broke slowly and failed to contend.

evenly. KING ALAN was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and improved position. GET LIT was never far back, bid inside on the turn and came up
empty. WHAT DOES IT TAKE flashed speed, fell back and went evenly thereafter. HERE COMES RUDY was outrun in an even effort. FEROCIOUS
STORM was in tight at the start and failed to contend. KATIE'S NOTION pressed the pace three wide to the turn and gave way.

turn, closed steadily and gained late. AWESOME JAZZ raced mid pack inside, was in traffic mid stretch, closed once clear and gained late. MINT GAME

Footnotes
RUM BOBBY stalked the pace, challenged three wide on the turn, closed willingly and drew off. ELUSIVE MOTION was never far back, advanced to the
turn, closed steadily and earned place while no match for the winner. IMAGINETHEJOY broke slowly and was jostled at the start, raced in the back, awaited
room inside on the turn, altered course mid stretch and closed once clear. SURVEY (IRE) stalked the pace while racing inside, awaited room on the turn
and in the upper stretch and leveled off in the drive. INFINITY advanced on the far turn, shifted out for the drive and failed to rally. GLACIER PARK
improved position in an even effort. BOB'S GLORY pressed the pace two wide, challenged between horses on the turn and tired in the drive. YES MEANS
NO failed to threaten in an even effort. PERSEVERED set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and faded from contention. GALACTIC SLAM was not
a factor. NAKED IN CABO showed speed to the second turn, tired and was not urged late. EJE GAMA was outrun.

KISSES FOR HEIDI dropped inside, bid along the rail on the turn, closed under urging, dueled late and proved best. BOURBON WILDCAT set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel and was outfinished in a game effort. RONA was never far back, was roused on the turn, shifted out for the drive,
closed and didn't have enough late. GOLD FINCH showed good early speed while racing outside, fell back, went six wide entering the stretch and lacked
the needed rally. PAYNTERBYNUMBERS pressed the pace to the turn, tired and faded. LOVE MY CAT passed tiring rivals. C TWO failed to threaten in an
even effort. VANNA BELLE was steadied twice along the backstretch and lacked a bid.

GOOD LIFE CIDER rallied three wide on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held under urging. LOOKIN DYNAMIC raced inside
early, was taken off the rail, was never far off the pace, closed steadily, narrowed the gap and finished second best. WAITING FOR A STAR was a bit
crowded at the start, settled in the back, offered a mild bid only and earned show. GALLINELLA bumped at the start, lagged early and improved position in a
steady effort. JUMPSTARTMYHEART saved ground, bid along the rail, had little left and did not threaten. BETHABARA was never far back, raced outside
and lacked a bid. BEACON OF TRUTH bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing in hand, was taken off the rail, challenged between horses turn,
tired and faded. MAHKATO set the pace, tired in the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
BIG BOOTS saved ground mid pack, angled out on the turn, swung wide, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. VIPER was void of early
speed, advanced on the turn, closed with a rush and got up for place. ROBBER BOB was away alertly, set the pace with a clear lead, yielded in the final
strides and lost position. FIVE CARD DRAW chased the pace, bid willingly and didn't have enough late. COOL MAN CLETUS was never far back, was
carried out leaving the turn, closed steadily and was gaining late. VOODOO VALLEY was not a factor. IRISHTOWN moved up inside to stalk the pace, tired
in the drive and gave way.
