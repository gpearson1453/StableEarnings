Footnotes
SIDD FINCH unhurried while racing along the outside, departed the backstretch from the three path, tipped to the outside as three-quarters was being
completed, unleashed a bold five wide run from the five-sixteenths marker, accelerated to the top after stepping onto the head of the stretch, scampered
away to a commanding advantage before being geared down in the final seventy yards. TRUE PALACE gradually made his way to the inside route on the
backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch, rallied for the place. BEING ME took up the chase three wide for the opening half, was maneuvered
into the four path at five-sixteenths marker, went into the lane under urging, got outfinished. JET FOR ANDY pursued the pace from along the inside route,
hand urged travelling on the fuller turn, came three wide into the lane, no no offering. PERFECT BANKER disputed the pace two wide, was put to a drive
spinning into the lane, got rolled over then backed away steadily. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE contended for the top from along the inside for six furlongs and
gave way. FIVESTAR BANDIT strung out three wide for three-quarters, folded. NERO'S FIDDLE fell back abruptly after taking some bad steps early on the
backstretch, got pulled up after being eased, was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
FAIR LASSIE established the top after a brisk hand ride, showed the way facing pressure from a pair of opponents from the outside until the half mile pole,
edged away COTTON CANDY CUTIE during the run around the bend, got called upon for her best in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker,
responded and held sway. COTTON CANDY CUTIE remained stationed in the two path after the start, was in between rivals disputing the pace for a good
portion of the trip leading up to the conclusion of the backstretch, stalked the winner unhitched after springing from the half mile pole, was asked for more as
the half was being rattled off, stepped into the stretch, got staved off. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY saved ground, was worked into path five from upper to
mdlane, went on to secure the show. COVER PHOTO three wide arguing for the control outside the top twosome, chased the pace towards midpack
afterwards, commenced the stretch slighlty wider, lacked the needed response. ZECHA two wide onto the turn, got sent out five wide leaving it, never made
her presence felt. ON DECK angled sharply into the two path, was about as wide spinning into the lane, failed to menace. DIRTY BIRD guided over to the
rail at the half mile pole, was being roused cutting the corner into the lane, faltered.

OUR LAST BUCK veered in at the start bumping and pinching TWISTED TOM, vied briefly with a trio to his inside before prompting the pace stacked
outside a trio five then four wide, advanced to take command at the five-sixteenths and swung four to five wide into upper stretch holding a narrow
advantage, dug in under a drive through to the finish under threat and held safe to prevail. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD vied briefly with a trio to his outside
before establishing sole albeit narrow command, showed the way just off the inside under pressure from a trio, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, got
displaced from the front at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive fighting on latched on through to the finish to
be along for the place honors. TWISTED TOM got bumped and pinched between foes at the start, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. I LOVE JAXSON vied briefly among a trio before pressing the pace three then two
wide between foes, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE bumped
at the start, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened. DYNAMAX PRIME broke a half a
beat slow, chased inside until tipped out three wide through the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HIT IT ONCE MORE vied
briefly and was checked off the heels seven and a half furlongs from home, chased four then three wide, went four wide for home and was eased.

Footnotes
COMPLIANT quickly spotted along the inside route, was patiently ridden tracking the front runners, slipped into the two path midway on the far turn,
continued to bide time, was slightly wider entering the stretch, altered course into path five in midlane, obtaining optimal racing clearance, kicked into his
best, wore down a pair of opponents to its inside in the final seventy yards to prove best. HIGH TIDE sat forwardly placed three wide, was closer to the rail
challenging in earnest stepping onto the top of the lane, forged to a narrow advantage during the ensuing furlong, dug in well defending it against heavy
pressure, relinquished during a three-way tussle in the final stages, stayed on to salvage second. BAIL OUT off the inside throughout, pursued the pace
three to four wide after being primarily in the two path until the conclusion of the backstretch, swung out four wide for the drive home, closed in, was bearing
down on the runner up from the eighth pole onward, doing so between rivals by deep stretch, came up snort. PURE CARMINE kept watch on the pace while
taking the inside route, got eased into the two path in the general area of the three-eighths pole, was switched over to a brisk hand ride spinning to the
outside entering the lane, wound up in the neighborhood of path six by the furlong grounds, came home willingly for the last major check. AMANO sat on
hold in the pocket, abandoned the slot for path two at the midway point of the second bend, got cued up for the drive, issued a bid from upper to midstretch,
flattened out. HOLY EMPEROR underwent a two to three wide trip, lacked the necessary stretch response. MAGIC MOJO was rated along prompting the
pace from path two, moved when ready coming up to the three-eighths pole, got put to the test heading home, succumbed and backed away. THIS ILL
DEFEND slow to respond to a rating hold, disputed the pace from along the rail until the three-eighths pole, faltered. FEELING DANGEROUS strung out
three wide on the clubhouse bend, was one path nearer the rail on the subsequent one, folded.

Footnotes
WILD WILLIAM established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside uncontested, tucked inside through the turn, took the inside route into
upper stretch, got roused straightened away, drew away to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. SMILE BRYAN chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, offered up a mild kick. QIAN B C chased just off the inside under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to just secure the show honors over a rival on the wire. IL PRIMO SOLE (GB) broke in at the start
filling the space left vacant by TENURE, chased along the inside, angled out four wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away roused,
offered up a mild bid to just miss for the show honors. QUEEN'S MASON chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LIGHT THE POSSE chased three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five
wide into upper stretch, offered no response. TENURE jumped slightly at the break brushing the near side stall while remaining in the gate and hesitated
before lunging out of the gate having already conceded six to seven lengths to the front, got put to brief coaxing and advanced quickly to fall in line near the
rear of the field swaying in hunt of an open seam trying to avoid running up on rival's heels while placed to a hold with five furlongs to go, settled three wide
and tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.
FOREVER WICKED four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun two to three
wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
BEARS MAFIA prompted RIKEN from the two path, got cued up prior to spinning into the lane after falling back slightly, closed in relentlessly on the runner
up, struck the front end with approximately a sixteenth to go and kicked well clear. RIKEN established the top in short order, got guided over to the inside
route, showed the way, tailed by the winner from the outside, inched away to its largest lead as the second split was about to be posted, settled in upper
stretch and got roused, saw the top one whittle away at the deficit, surrendered in the general area of the sixteenth marker, stayed on for second. BIG BOY
MO pursued the leader two to three wide on the turn, came about four wide into the stretch, mustered up a mild response rallying for the show.
QUICKFLASH rated in the pocket, came up empty. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY tracked the front runners pulling hard on the bit saving ground, shifted two wide at
the commencement of the run around the bend, went into the lane, made no impact. NUMBER ONE DILLON three wide on the turn, stepped into the lane,
had no rally. MICROSCOPE chased the pace four wide on the turn, got moved out five to six wide for the stretch run, went on to mainly improve position.
FREUDIAN SIP saved ground to no avail. TIERGAN three wide onto the turn, was sent out into path four exiting it, launched no bids. INSIDE INFO raced
three wide, never made its presence felt. SAMAY sighted inside on the turn, was allowed to fade away down the lane under a protective hold.

Footnotes
WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN away the quickest, remained forwardly placed, sat perched four wide with a good view of the contested pace, glided up to the
ones to catch after the half had been completed, struck the front end wile in hand approaching the quarter pole, ventured onward to the three-sixteenths
marker and was switched over to stronger handling, responded and drew off smartly. PANSTER settled into the three path, was within striking distance of
the front runners, moved together with the top one late on the bend, swung into the lane, proved no match. DRESSY pursued the pace two wide on the turn,
commenced the stretch slightly wider, secured the show. TIZ TACT TOE brought up the back of the pack after brushing with the gate, was two wide at the
top of the turn, and four wide at the top of the lane, rallied mildly for the final significant slice of the purse. RUSE pocketed keeping watch on the pace, was
urged towards path two for entrance into the lane, had no rally. NOT STORMY bumped at the start, underwent a ground-saving journey, stepped into the
lane, improved but without impact. ROYAL NAVY taken hold after coming in slightly at the start, was four wide entering the turn and one path farther off the
rail leaving it, launched no bids. SINASHACK pressed the issue two wide until the end of the bend before giving way. SPEEDY BANKER slid over to the rail
coming up to the end of the backstretch, shifted two wide for the drive, had no offering. TOM'S CHOICE shied in slightly at the start, travelled three wide on
the turn, went out four wide spinning into the stretch, never made its presence felt. STRETCH THE TRUTH disputed the pace while saving ground until the
quarter pole, faltered. SIMPLE SUGAR bumped at the start, raced two wide on the turn, was more in the three path heading home, gave way.
