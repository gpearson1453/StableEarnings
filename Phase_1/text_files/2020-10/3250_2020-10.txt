showed no speed, rounded the turn in the two path, moved out while gaining into upper stretch and finished with good energy for the place. RB DJUSTA

disputed the pace on the inside of foes, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. VIXEN MHF was urged along towards
the rear, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to respond. AA SPEEDBALL disputed the pace on the outside then in
the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faded. RISKY VAZ was sent hard from the start then ridden along off the pace, moved out late
on the backstretch, dropped back on the turn and was no factor. AA RICH WHISKEY was urged along on the outside, drifted out near the half-mile pole,
