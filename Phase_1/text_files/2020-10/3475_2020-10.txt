Footnotes
OFFICER SYDNEY (IRE) was well placed from the start and jumping well, got up to stalk the leader heading for the 12th jump, took command after the 13th
heading down the hill, was challlenged going to the last, but held on through the stretch for a clear victory. AS YOU LIKE IT settled mid pack got into
contention heading for the 13th jump, made his bid going down the hill after the 13th to get into striking distance but could not gain further ground after the
last. RENEGADE RIVER showed the way from the beginning but started to give up ground after the 12th jump, gave way heading to the 13th, but still ran on
gamely going down the hill going to the second last fence, weakened after the last but held on for the third spot. WORZEL GUMMIDGE (IRE) was in good
position just behind the leaders, got into the race after the 12th jump and got to the lead briefly heading to the 13th, then gave way going down the hill
heading for the second last, and was out run from there but just missed for show. PURED IT raced mid pack for the first two miles, made a mild bid after the
12th jump but gave way after the 13th and weakend after that. PRIME PROSPECTOR was through after two miles and was no factor here. EL JEFE
GRANDE raced towards the back and never really got into the race. FOREVER BERNARDINI made a bid going up the hill after the 11th jump to get into
contention and then stopped after the 12th and fell back from there. COCODIMAMA was behind the field from the start and was distanced after a mile and a
half, but managed to finish the race. GRAND MANAN was stalking the leader when he went off course after the 10th jump.
