Footnotes
AIR TEMPLE chased the pace from the four to the three path, pressed the leader into the lane, dueled with that one through the final eighth and edged up.
VAPOR POINT vied for the lead into the turn while two wide, raced with a short lead into the lane, put away the early challenger but was joined soon after
by the winner, dueled with that one through the lane and could not keep up late. ARCH DREAMER tracked the pacesetters through the turn while in the two
path, came into the lane with aim on the top ones and clear running but lacked a closing response. INDIAN SHOW was in the five to the four path through
the turn, came widest into the lane and was never a factor. TOUGH OX was near the rail into the turn and steadily faded. MY NORTHERN STAR dueled for
the lead through late turn, began giving ground turning into the lane, was being pulled up inside the sixteenth pole to the wire when in distress and was
subsequently vanned off. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds.

ABBY'S DESTINY vied for the lead from between rivals through the turn, shook clear near the eighth pole then widened to the wire. SHAPE OF YOU
tracked three rival duel through the turn, bid four wide near the quarter pole, straightened and loomed a serious threat straightening into the lane but was no
match for winner while clearly second best. LOVE BROKE THRU was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from
mid-track and moved up for the minor share while not a threat to the top two. QUITE A BABE vied for the top spot with two others through the turn, gained
the lead entering the lane then gave way along the rail. COLONIAL JILL vied for the top spot three wide through mid-turn then began losing ground in late
turn and was empty turning into the lane. SWEET BRYNLIE was always last while along the inside. A STEWARDS INQUIRY DID NOT RESULT IN
CHANGE OF ORDER. Per Stewards, due to COVID-19 protocols, all starters will carry an additional three pounds

Footnotes
CRAFTY JUSTICE stalked the pace, bid at the quarter, lost her path at the eighth pole, angled four wide and rallied to be up in time under steady urging.
JUMP RIGHT IN stalked in the three path, bid at the quarter pole to be clear but couldn't hold off the winner. PERFECT JUSTICE was clear early in the
three path, then gave way in the stretch. FACEYS FIRST stalked the early pace inside, then faded. SHE DA ONE was not a factor. PREMIUM PASSION
stalked inside to the stretch and gave way.
