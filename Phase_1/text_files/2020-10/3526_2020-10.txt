Footnotes
RAGING WATERS broke alertly then was permitted to slip back off the lead, advanced two wide on the turn, forged to the front near the furlong pole and
drew clear driving. REST EASY TWO FOUR dueled two wide to the turn, edged away then met the winner's bid into the stretch but could not match strides.
FLIGHT SPEED set the pace from the inside and slackened. EDWARD T. showed little. RAIL HOG flashed only brief speed. SWEET BAGS was not a
factor.

CROWN KITTEN settled off the pace but never far back, moved up willingly from the outside on the turn, got to terms a furlong out, and edged clear driving.
I LOVE ROMANCE dueled from the inside into the stretch and battled gamely to the wire. LUCKY ANTARES dueled two wide into the stretch led briefly at
the furlong pole but slackened. UNION SMARTIE stalked from the inside to the stretch but did not rally. POPULAR APPEAL was never a factor.

AWAY FROM THE SUN was not asked for speed early but rallied quickly rallied three wide on the turn, gained command a furlong and drew off with
authority. APPLES ARCH dueled from the outside into the stretch, kept to her task but was no match for the winner. CHRIS IS READY settled early, raced
two wide on the turn but lacked the needed response. KAELY'S CANDY dueled for the lead from the inside to the upper stretch and gave way. SQUARE
DREAMER lacked early speed but found her stride late. GREY ABBEY was never a factor.

Footnotes
SEQUENTIALLY was never too far back, offered a strong rally around horses into the stretch, took command leaving the furlong pole and won driving.
HONEYMOONZ OVER pressed the pace two wide, led upper stretch but was outfinished by the winner. EASY GAME set a pressured pace from the inside
into the lane and slackened. PURE COMEDY settled early and lacked the needed strong finish. CONCENSUS stalked the leaders three wide and gave
way.

Footnotes
TROJAN MAGIC took command once on the backstretch then controlled the pace and had plenty left for the stretch to win driving. NO PARKING HERE
was forwardly placed from the inside, rallied three wide to the stretch and flattened out. T BONES TRICK raced unhurried from off the rail, came in the three
path to the stretch and closed a minor gap. BOYSON lacked the needed rally. MISTER MCLEAN led early from the rail, continued to press the pace once
headed but gave way inside. OASIS raced two wide throughout and failed to rally. NIGHT GIG was never a factor.

RUN HEAT pressed the pace from off the rail, gained command inside at the furlong pole and dueled gamely. JAZZ STREET was never too far back, came
three wide to the stretch and rallied steadily. HOSS CARTWRIGHT set the pace from off the rail and gave way grudgingly. VASTLY DEEP lacked the
needed rally while in the two path into the stretch. NORTH CROSS came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. DAVE'S GIFT saved
ground to no avail. RED STAR checked in the stretch off VASTLY DEEP but was never a threat. SOUTHEAST ASIA was fanned five wide into the stretch.
