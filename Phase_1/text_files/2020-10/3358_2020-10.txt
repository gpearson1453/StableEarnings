Footnotes
GO SMILEY GO broke a step slow then was used early, chased to the turn, was three then four wide to the stretch, shifted widest then finished fast to be up
in time. AMBER LOUISE tracked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch, rallied in the drive, took a short lead a sixteenth out then could not shake
loose from LUCKY ANTARES and was nailed by the winner. LUCKY ANTARES had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then finished in a rally inside.
BRILLIANT BIRD pressed the pace two wide, pushed alongside PRINCESS ASHLYN and dueled that one to mid stretch but was weakening late.
PRINCESS ASHLYN set the pace, was collared and dueled from the rail to mid stretch but tired in the late stages. COASTAL STARLITE had no speed,
raced two wide to the stretch and closed the gap without threatening.

finished steadily but could not impact the winner. SANDY SUNSHINE was forced four wide by the winner to the backstretch, pressed that one to the second
turn, got pushed out to the five path by the winner to the stretch then lacked a closing response. MO BRANDI trailed to the second turn, raced two then
three wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper stretch but also did not rally. MY THREE ASE'S tracked the winner to the second turn then saved ground but
came up empty in the drive. THE HENRIETTA tracked the pace from the rail to the half, bid inside to loom a threat to mid stretch then weakened. RAIL HOG

Footnotes
INCREDIBLY LUCKY was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, briefly waited for room nearing mid stretch then split rivals and rallied to the
front. REGAL LADY attended the pace outside NO SPIN ZONE, dueled two wide to the stretch, dug in determinedly late but could not stall the winner while
holding ARIES safe for second. ARIES stalked the pace two wide to the stretch, pushed up to try to engage for the lead in mid stretch then battled on and
just missed second. VACAVILLE SPECIAL chased the pace three wide to the stretch, was outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task to the line. BE LIFTED
UP got outrun to the turn, saved ground then eased out in upper stretch but shifted back to the rail in mid stretch and finished evenly. NO SPIN ZONE
hustled to duel for the lead from the rail, stayed on gamely to mid stretch but was tiring late. EUPHEMISTIC had no speed and was not a factor.
GIRLSINTHEOFFICE also had no speed and was always outrun.

prevail. MYLITTLERUNAWAY set all the pace from the rail, turned back REV REE on the second turn, inched clear to mid stretch then could not stall the
winner. REV REE pressed the leader three wide to the backstretch, bid two wide on the second turn, got outkicked to mid stretch and hung in the final

SPLASHING had no speed, settled to the second turn, rallied three then four wide to the stretch and continued to respond in the drive to collared SIDE
EFFECT (GB) and edge clear. SIDE EFFECT (GB) set the pace from the rail to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch, pushed clear to mid stretch
then was tiring and could not hold. CASINO GAMES tracked the pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then finished willingly but too late for
second. BUTTIE was settled to the half mile pole, offered a bid three wide to loom a threat to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and flattened out.
AVALON RIDE also had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. TAMMY'S WINDOW was
stalking for a half mile, offered a rally three deep on the second turn but got outkicked to the stretch and tired. ACCLAIM THE QUEEN pressed the pace for
a half mile, was outrun on the second turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
FOSTER BOI never far back to the half, rallied two then three wide into the second turn, took over from MY SUNSHINE then battled determinedly to hold.
POUR ON THE COLE was well placed to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then finished willingly but could not collar the winner. BOYSON
was unhurried to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch, looked a threat to mid stretch then finished evenly. FINAL FINAL was a bit reluctant to
load then raced four wide to the backstretch, pushed up to stalk the pace, bid four wide on the second turn but was outkicked to mid stretch and lacked a
closing response. MAJOR KONG had no speed, raced three then four wide to the stretch and closed a gap without threatening. I WILL YEAH (IRE) settled
mid pack for a half mile, was off the rail on the second turn then was outfinished in the drive. MY SUNSHINE hustled to set the pace, saved ground to the
second turn then was collared by the winner and tired. NORTHERN QUEST had no speed, raced three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
GREAT ULYSSES flashed speed to the backstretch then dropped back after a half mile and was not a factor.

Footnotes
U. S. DANGER had good speed, dueled inside to the second turn, pushed away two wide to the stretch then held under steady urging. LUCK IS MY NAME
chased the frontrunners to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then could not impact the winner while besting the others. KENJILOOKSLUCKY
was settled for a half mile, saved ground on the second turn then dug in late in the drive to hold the show. GAMBINI had no speed, settled to the second
turn, was three wide to the stretch but could not catch up for third. INFATUATE trailed to the second turn, got forced to circle five wide to the stretch but was
not a threat in the drive. CHASE AND COLORADO also was outrun to the half while mid pack, came three wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
KALINE was void of speed, raced four wide on the second turn and did not rally. EXETER checked off heels shortly after the start, chased the leaders to the
second turn but tired after six furlongs. BIGFOOT CITY hustled early to be on the pace but lugged out to the five path into the first turn, was corrected and
dueled for a half mile but stopped on the second turn.
