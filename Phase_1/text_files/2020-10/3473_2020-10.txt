PASZ THE PEPPER broke in full stride to set all the pace under pressure and edged clear late under right handed urging. IMMACULATE HEART forward
from the start, loomed boldly two wide into the stretch and finished second best in the six path. COOL IRIS unhurried early, found her best stride late in the
five path. DANZIG RAINBOW trailed through the turn, swung wide and closed a gap late in the seven path. YURUBI had good early speed along the inside,
shifted out on the turn then faded. HAPPY ISSUE stalked the pace three wide through the turn then gave way. GRACE APPEAL pressured the winner from
the inside early, had speed into the stretch and was used up.
