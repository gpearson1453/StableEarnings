Footnotes
GHOST GIANT away without apparent mishap, got set up along the inside route, was patiently ridden keeping watch on the front runners, closed the gap
springing from the half mile pole, waited for options during the final strides leading up to the quarter pole, angled three wide into the stretch, kicked into his
best and gained readily on the ones to catch, wore down the duelers coming up to the eighth pole and edged away. NUTZFORBOLTZ in path two,
partnered up with CATCH A CAB at the back of the pack, continued along under the same scenario for three-quarters, got ridden four wide into the lane,
rallied down the center of the course to get up for second. DR. SHANE the quickest of the gate, got sent over to the rail holding a slim advantage, was
joined by HIT IT ONCE MORE early on the backstretch, raced heads apart with that foe all the way to the fuller turn, was let out loose as their tussle spilled
over into the stretch, got run down by the top one making his way through the furlong grounds, lost out late for the place. HIT IT ONCE MORE lost his
footing after coming out a bit at the start, was gathered by the pilot then launched itself into a forward position with a three wide run on the chute, shifted one
path nearer the rail, sparred on even terms with DR. SHANE,got asked for more setting onto the top of the lane, saw the winner take charge in midstretch,
backed away just enough so as to have to settle for the final significant slice of the purse. CATCH A CAB loped along the rail for three-quarters, swung out
four wide into the stretch, made no impact. HONORABLE HERO two to three wide in pursuit of the front runners, lacked the necessary response. PIPES
strung out three wide on the turn, got steered out five wide from upper to midstretch, gave way.

Footnotes
SARATOGA PAL five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with
ADVANCE NOTICE to his inside, overhauled the leader nearing the sixteenth marker and taking narrow command, dug in and prevailed on the wire.
ADVANCE NOTICE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide for home,
rallied as a team with the aforementioned foe to overthrow the leader nearing the sixteenth pole and was repelled to the finish. BERNIN' THRU GOLD
coaxed from the gate, dueled to the inside of VICTORY BUILT from the get go, shook off that rival at the three-eighths, got let out taking the inside route into
upper stretch, inched away to the eighth pole, dug in and was overhauled nearing the sixteenth pole, then weakened in the late stages while clear for the
show honors. BIG BOY MO hustled from the gate, chased along the inside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. VICTORY
BUILT dueled from the two path with BERNIN' THRU GOLD to his inside, got shaken off at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. FREEDOM FORCE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
RISKY MISCHIEF tracked the pace from the pocket until the end of the bend, slithered its way into path approaching the three-sixteenths pole, attaining
better racing room, kicked into stride and narrowed in, knifed its way between foes and onto the front end with approximately a sixteenth to go, edged away.
VIP NATION disputed the pace from path two, got put to a drive for the drive home, saw the top one strike the top in the general area of the sixteenth pole,
stayed on to save second. PURRAGEOUS DYNA the early trailer, cut over to the rail nearing the conclusion of the backstretch, flashed momentum
proceeding to angle approximately six wide, the widest of all, into the stretch, finished willingly, but fell short of snagging away the place. FIERCE LADY
established the top in short order, vied for command from along the inside route, matched up with VIP NATION, kept at the task in earnest before
weakening late. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS three wide onto the turn, went five wide exiting it, had no offering. ELEGANT ZIP pursued the pace from path
two, commenced the stretch slightly wider, gave way.

Footnotes
JOINT AND SEVERAL took up residence in midpack, entered the turn, stalked the front runners perched three wide, crept up towards them after the half
had been rattled off, moved wider spinning onto the head of the stretch, challenged in earnest from path four at the three-sixteenths pole, inched his way
close and closerr to the front end, wrested away the advantage for good in the final seventy yards and shook free. MUCHO SUNSHINE gained the
advantage shortly after the field had been sent off and running, got guided over to the rail in time for the start of the run around the bend, showed the way,
attended by WARFRONT FIGHTER out in the two path, shifted into the two path himself when put to a drive heading home, came under heavier pressure in
the form of the eventual winner a few strides later, relinquished reluctantly well beyond the eighth pole, kept going well enough to save the place. KITH
underwent a two wide pursuit, stepped into the stretch, gained on the front runners in a steadfast manner, altered into the four path in deep stretch en route
to show honors.. TRI SAINT LORENZO off the inside throughout, took up the chase two to three wide on the turn, got sent out into path five during the
stretch run, narrowed in for the last major check. WARFRONT FIGHTER sparred for control against the winner from path two, was one farther off the rail
when asked for more in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole, had the top one arrive on the scene shortly afterwards, failed to claim the top, then flattened
out in the final sixteenth. KICKIN' KIRBY got gradually worked over to the rail on the backstretch, angled three wide stepping into the stretch, came up
empty. BAYERN'S MIRAGE loosely pocketed, faltered. MARKET IMPACT three wide onto the turn, never made his presence felt, strolled out towards path
six going into the lane, went down it coaxed along.

set down two to three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. CEANT tracked just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to preserve the place honors.
LOOK ME OVER broke in at the start brushing THIS JUST IN, tracked the pace two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SENGEKONTACKET tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened. LADY ROSALIE (IRE) just off the inside near the rear of the field, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and passed tired rivals. THIS JUST IN brushed between foes at the start, chased two to
three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. ALL AMERICAN DREAM chased along the inside, came under

Footnotes
CONTROL GROUP established the top in short order, appeared to be in control sailing along from just off the rail on the lead, got cued up in the general
area of the three-sixteenths marker, extended the margin to a comfortable before getting geared down in the final seventy yards. LUCKY RAMSEY three
wide on the turn, swung out towards path four for the drive, proved no match. DYNAMAX PRIME settled into midpack after the start, took up the chase three
to four wide, fanned out into path six from upper to midlane, advanced well enough to be along for the show. HAMMERIN AAMER kept watch on the winner
from near the inside, went five wide into the lane, mustered up a mild response. AMERICAN LINCOLN saved ground until the end of the bend, tipped into
the two path heading home, gave way. BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE stalked the pace two to three wide, was more the latter entering the stretch, backed away.
ATTENTIVE two wide onto the turn, went into path four spinning onto the head of the stretch, was never in it.

Footnotes
BALLAGH ROCKS tracked just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong out, dug in under a drive inching away to the finish to prevail. WINNING FACTOR attended the leader from the outside four then
three wide, tucked to the two path through the far turn, got set down spinning four then three wide into upper stretch straightened away, dug in under a drive
and fought on to the finish securing the place honors on the wire. ABIDING STAR established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under
the close watch of the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three then two wide straightened away into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to preserve the show honors by a nostril. ZARKALLANI (FR) came out slightly after
the start brushing the back of ABIDING STAR, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and kept on outside to just miss for the show honors. SENTRY saved ground at the tail of the field until tipped three wide through the far turn,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked with too much to do late.
SOULMATE three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SILVER TOKEN underwent a three wide journey until the end of the second bend, responded when asked for run in the general area of the three-sixteenths
pole, struck the front about a furlong down the road and inched away. MICHAEL'S BAD BOY off the inside throughout, took up the chase two to three wide
on the far turn, angled five wide for the drive, finished with some willingness down the center of the course to garner the place. HURRICANE ANDREW
away alertly, retained the advantage and kicked clear of the others, was joined by NOBLE MISCHIEF shortly after the first fraction had been finalized,
flickeed off that one's bid on the backstretch and edged away once more, settled in upper stretch and was switched over to stronger handling, offered
resistance before relinquishing with around a sixteenth to go, stayed on for the show. SELFMADE three to four wide until the top of the lane, made no
headway. Z'FINALE three wide on both turns, possessed no punch. NOBLE MISCHIEF launched a four wide run to the front end, vied for the lead outside
STARSHIP EMPIRE for nearly three-quarters before folding. KEY TO VICTORY got tipped into path two early on the backstretch, stayed in it on turn two,
was sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, didn't offer enough. SUPPLY SIDER hung out four wide on each bend, failed to fire. STARSHIP EMPIRE
unhurried during the opening phases, was stacked five wide at the five-sixteenths pole, was in the same path entering the stretch, had no response. TRUE
PALACE along the inside route until the quarter pole, faltered.
