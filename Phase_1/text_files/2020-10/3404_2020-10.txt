Footnotes
PLUM SEXY settled outside outside a rival on the backstretch, came out at the top of the lane, flew late and surged clear to win going away. FREEDOM
FLYER drifted out early from the inside, set the pace under pressure from MAP TO MY HEART, cleared that rival around the turn and inched away into the
stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole, failed to put up any resistance to the winner and stayed on to best the rest. HIGH CON in tight between foes early,
settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, moved off the rail a bit in the stretch and was along for the show. BRILLIANT CUT chased outside the
top pair early then angled to the rail, remained inside to the stretch, lacked a response in the final furlong and lost the show. MAP TO MY HEART prompted
the pace outside the leader, could not match strides around the turn and chased two wide then between into the stretch and weakened. I'M THE BOSS OF
ME showed early speed from the far outside then dropped back to stalk the top pair, took the turn three wide and weakened in the drive. CUTETIP angled in
early, trailed the field along the fence, moved into the two path around the turn, then angled out in the stretch but failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
TIZ A UNICORN pressed the pace outside early the cleared rival into the backstretch, set the pace two to three wide to the far turn, drew off in the two path
around the turn, urged twice right-handed and remained well clear under hand urging. SUEZAAANA away quickly from inside, led early with company to the
outside then lost command into the backstretch, chased along the inside then two wide into the stretch, could not make any headway on the winner late but
proved second best. TRUE MISCHIEF bumped from the inside midway around the first turn, stalked off the rail then outside a rival, started to weaken
nearing the quarter pole, tired in the lane but lasted for the show. TURKISH ANGEL off slow to begin, trailed the field to the far turn, went around MARIA'S
ROYALTY on the bend and failed to threaten. MARIA'S ROYALTY shifted out and bumped rival on the first turn, tracked the pace near the inside, asked
early on the far turn only to drop back and was eased into the stretch and through the lane and walked off following the race.

UNCLE BOOGIE off a bit slow to begin, allowed to settle then closed in up the backstretch, bid outside the leader at the five-sixteenths, took a short lead at
the quarter pole and drew off under right-handed urging then geared down nearing the wire. FROM THE GET GO tracked off the rail early, went two to three
wide around the turn, summoned a mild rally and gained the place. STONE'S RIVER chased the speed from inside to the lane, steered out past the eighth
pole and weakened. EMPEROR'S FISC lacked early speed, trailed the field to the stretch and was never a factor. SUPERDUTY JUSTICE sped to the front,
crossed over to the inside, led a bit off the rail into the turn, headed at the quarter pole, could not go on with the winner and retreated through the drive.

Footnotes
ASTUTE off alertly from the far outside, took control early then moved clear, crossed over to the inside, saved ground into the lane, hand urged in the drive
while shown the whip left-handed and held off the runner-up. EVOO settled outside a rival, angled out into the stretch then angled inward past the eighth
pole, surged late but could not get by. MAGICAL THOUGHT chased the pace from inside, cut the corner into the stretch and finished willingly for the show
honors. KATERINI raced outside a rival while in range of the leader, went two wide into the stretch, drifted out through the lane and weakened. PHILLY
LISHES steadied when bothered by outside rival early, tracked two wide then along the inside, came a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked a rally.
DORITA'S HAPPY stalked off the rail, went two wide around the turn then came out a bit into the stretch never responded when asked. CHEVELITA
stumbled a bit at the start, angled outside a rival early, traveled two to three wide around the turn, angled out in the stretch and never made an impact.
YOU'RE ALL TALK saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.

Footnotes
COLOSI went five wide around the first turn, tracked well off the rail up the backstretch, entered the far turn four wide then bid outside the top pair three
deep or three wide, cleared both rivals entering the stretch, responded when asked in the lane and held the runner-up at bay. LITTLE NO WAY settled early,
raced along the inside into the far turn, angled four wide leaving the bend, rallied outside but was not enough to overtake the winner. LEAD STAR hustled
early from inside, set the pace up the backstretch, pressured into the far turn, vied with a pair of rivals around the bend, could not go on with the winner
leaving the turn but kept on for the show. PAIGE RUNNER stalked the leader early then pressed from outside at the five-eighths, lost contact again and
chased before challenging again near the seven-sixteenths pole, vied between rivals around the far turn, chased the winner into the lane and weakened.
CAYMANS COBRA stalked outside a rival, dropped back on the far turn, was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
LITTLE JUANITO dueled for command from inside, cleared CALEXMAN into the stretch, put to right-handed urging and held gamely to the wire. MESUT off
a bit slow to begin, chased outside a rival then moved three wide leaving the turn, raced three deep in drive, brushed with inside rival past the eighth pole,
closed outside the leader but lacked the needed late punch. GRIT AND CURIOSITY chased from inside into and around the turn, cut the corner into the
stretch, tipped out in the lane and finished willingly but was outkicked by the top pair. CALEXMAN dueled for the lead from the outside, shifted in near the
half-mile pole, continued to contest the pace two wide into and around the turn, failed to keep up with the winner and chased two wide into the lane, raced
between rivals in the stretch, brushed with outside rival and steadied past the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.

SHADY EMPIRE broke in and bumped rival at the start, sped to the front and set the pace outside of UNCAPTURED HERO, inched away around the turn
only to be challenged once again from that same foe in the lane, responded to urging and edged away in the late stages. UNCAPTURED HERO pressed
the pace from inside, chased the leader into the stretch then re-bid along the fence in the drive but flattened in the closing moments. CARPE VICTORIAM
pinballed between rivals at the start, raced up close outside the top pair, went three wide around the turn and kept on for a clear third. RACE HOME bumped
both sides at the start, chased outside a trio of rivals, came off the turn four wide and weakened. PRESS BRIEFING bumped leaving the gate, chased in the
two path into the turn, remained a bit off the rail into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
INVICTATATUS quickest early and angled to the inside, set the pace inside, dueled with MOST SANDISFACTORY through the far turn and down the
stretch, battled to the wire and would not be denied. MOST SANDISFACTORY up close outside the leader then pressed the issue, dueled with
INVICTATATUS around the second turn and through the lane, fought gamely to the wire but could not get by the winner. SILENT MUSKETIER away quickly
at the start then stalked from inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch and finished a clear third. FIRE POLISH off a bit slow to begin, pulled from inside
nearing the first turn, tracked along the rail then a bit off the inside in the stretch and kept on for a minor award. WHISPERING FLAME settled off the pace
along the inside, saved ground into the lane, drifted out a bit while the rider tried to correct and could not rally in the late stages. AFLEETING LIFE unhurried
in the early going, traveled two wide then between rivals, asked around the far turn but lacked further response. VEGAS MOON stalked in the two path then
outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and never rallied. MIDNIGHT LUCK unhurried in the beginning, floated out by rival into the first turn and
went four wide around the bend, remained off the inside then angled in on the second turn and proved no menace. MALIBU PRINCE shifted out entering the
first turn, chased off the rail throughout and had little left for the drive.
