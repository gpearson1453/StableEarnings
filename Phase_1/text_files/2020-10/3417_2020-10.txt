Footnotes
PIN UP LADY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing
yards. TIMBERLAKE GAGE broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin approaching the stretch but could not resist the
winner from over the top. TOMORROW'S MINE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, checked nearing the quarter, moved between foes
into the stretch and finished willingly. SECRET PARANOIA was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to rally.
SUNSHINE EMILY was bumped at the start, disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. BLUE CHIP BETTY was bumped at the break, vied
for the lead from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN broke sharply to press the pace of SHEZA DELIGHT while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. IT'S CURLIN TIME settled off the leaders from the inside,
angled out late and was up for a the place. SHEZA DELIGHT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged
by the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with that foe and gave way after going a half. SPECIAL LESSON lagged early, raced three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. PIVOTAL LUCK was off slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not menace. FIRING DEMONS
broke awkwardly, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. PLUMA showed brief speed, raced four-wide
through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN NATION sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, responded when challenged by ALL ABOUT TIME nearing the quarter,
re-cleared and held off the closing DONT REMEMBER to prevail. DON'T REMEMBER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the
turn, remained inside for the drive and rallied to just miss. ARUGULA chased the leaders while racing three-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing
response. CONTINUE ON VICTOR was off a step slow then allowed to settle, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
failed to rally. ALL ABOUT TIME was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid approaching the stretch and weakened in the
drive. FREESTONE raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. PEACE PRINCE lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn and did not menace.

Footnotes
STAY IN GRACE broke sharply to duel for the lead from the inside with ABRAA JABRAA from the inside, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a
clear lead and held B C MIDDLETON safe to the wire. B C Z MIDDLETON was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn,
reached a striking position but failed to gain on the winner late. SUDDENLY AWESOME was bumped at the break, raced just off the leaders early, saved
ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and lacked needed late response. CLOSE THE SHOW LO was bumped at the start
and threw her head, lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. ABRAA JABRAA broke
out, dueled with the winner for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. PERFECT BLOSSOM settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and did not menace. JERRE TO CARRIE lagged early, races six-wide through the turn and was eased through the lane.
