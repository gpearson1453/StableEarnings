Footnotes
BRODYTHEOXMAN went evenly rallying to bid on the far turn surging clear along the inside in upper stretch holding firm under a drive. STOP MAKING
SENSE prompted early then backed off to the half, re bid dueling on the far turn proving no match for rival in upper stretch holding as a clear second best.
BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI gained on the outside to threaten on the far turn, couldn't keep the momentum down the stretch finishing evenly near mid track.
MAKEMIE PARK tracked loose leaders evenly to the half drawing closer on the far turn before weakening in the three path upper stretch. LION LION raced
mid pack proving no menace. APPEALING GROOM slow early played no factor. LIL PISTOLA was never involved. DONEGAL ACES set the pace being
hooked on the turn wilting along the inside to upper stretch. OLD FORT was always outrun. REGAL CROSS folded up after a half mile. PER RULING
FROM THE WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, MAKEMIE PARK WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

touch near the eighth pole dueling from the rail from there ceding grudgingly in the final yards. CANDYCREAM pressed on the turn then steadied briefly
when in tight along the rail near the eighth pole, would weaken after. PRINCESS MARYKATE slow early mustered a mild rally down the lane finishing
evenly along the inside. LITTLE SATILLA pressured the early pace weakening to upper stretch. SHAKIN SPLASH played no factor. SHORE SHOT gave
way on the turn.

WINK AND A NOD stalked the pace rallying to draw even on the turn, shook clear in upper stretch widening under a drive. CREAKY CRICKET pressed the
pace dueling on the turn ceding to outside rival in upper stretch holding place in the three path. WILDWOOD'S AFLEET went evenly circling to mid track in
upper stretch outbidding the others with an even finish. WANDERING KITTEN slow early was rushed outside on the turn coming eight wide in upper stretch
gaining position there. FOREST BLUE chased early fading on the turn swinging out eight wide in upper stretch. REEDER pressed the pace dueling through
the turn wearing out in upper stretch. MISTERBULLTOYOU played no factor. AMACE was never involved. BUNGALOW hustled along through the turn
would tire in upper stretch. RHONDOO gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
DARREN'S FORTUNE unhurried early took charge on the final turn drawing well clear in upper stretch being ridden out as much the best. TUF INTENSITY
well rated rallied on the far turn chasing a very loose leader through the lane a clear second best. CONGRATS THIS advanced steadily into the final turn
losing momentum in upper stretch finishing evenly. REVIVE AND RESURGE slow early was never a factor improving past tired ones. YORK ROAD moved
on pace wearing out after a mile. PRE FLIGHT on pace would fold on the final turn. VALID CAUSE prompted early giving way into the final turn. The mile
and one half fraction was unavailable.

in upper stretch. LET ME ASK BOB was never involved. WAHOOWAH was always outrun.
