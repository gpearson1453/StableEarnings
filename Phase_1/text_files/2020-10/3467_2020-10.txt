Footnotes
FIVE CARD DRAW , snugly rated off the pace down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung out turning for home was five deep in upper
stretch, advanced outside rivals, took command inside the sixteenth pole and edged clear. SEATTLE RIC broke alertly to make the early lead, set the pace
along the rail, drifted out turning for home, gradually weakened late and finished in a dead heat for second. CHUCK'S DREAM prompted the pace outside
SEATTLE RIC , challenged that one in mid stretch and weakened to finish in a dead heat. VICTORY GIVEN , two wide between horses, dropped back a bit
on the turn, angled to the inner rail in mid stretch and jumped a shadow near the sixteenth pole. LUCKY JUNIOR , well positioned down the backstretch,
circled the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and failed to rally. VOODOO VALLEY lightly bumped with MEO DESPERADO leaving the starting
gate, circled the turn three wide, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a serious response. MEO DESPERADO lightly bumped with VOODOO
VALLEY, hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning VICTORY GIVEN near the sixteenth pole but no
action was taken.

Footnotes
SUPREME BLESSING , off a step slow after a bit of a lunge at the break, quickly recovered and edged up to contention, traveled three deep stalking past
the three eighths marker, took closer order under some coaxing into the lane, asserted herself while under right handed rousing and forged past LADY
CLAU in mid stretch, spurted clear and continued to eagerly widen while kept to task. LADY CLAU bobbled at the break, quickly recovered and sped clear in
the opening furlong, opened up into the turn while towards the rail, came under pressure in upper stretch, could not contain the winner with a furlong
remaining, faded but was clearly second best. CLASSY ESCORT , off slow when bearing out at the break, lagged well back into the turn, circled four wide
under a ride into the lane and had belated action. NICOLAR , off the pace, made a mild three wide run into the lane but failed to seriously sustain.
MYSTIQUE PALACE had speed, chased in the two path into the lane and faded. GREAT CAUSE broke a step slow, was used inside nearing the half mile
marker and gave way in upper stretch. GUAPA CHICA , urged along while off the pace, raced between runners into the stretch and weakened.

the break, pulled her way forward while saving ground near the half mile marker, came under pressure chasing past the five sixteenths and faded. GREAT
FUN , four wide outside rivals, was under a ride mid turn and gave way. TAM CHAR broke a step slow, dropped in and was taken to rate, edged up towards

Footnotes
TAPETE CLAIRE stalked the pace in the two path between horses around the turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside horses and took
the lead a few strides from the finish. I'MTHEKATSMEOW advanced three deep leaving the turn, gained a clear lead near the eighth pole then drifted in on
GRACE ISABELLA near the sixteenth pole while failing to hold off the winner. GRACE ISABELLA rushed up two wide into the turn, gained a short lead
between horses entering the stretch, raced along the inner rail in the drive and was steadied when placed in tight quarters by I'MTHEKATSMEOW near the
sixteenth pole. BOOM BOOM GONE , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired
ones. ALGODONAL lacked speed, was four wide turning for home and failed to be a threat. MAE SAI PRINCESS saved ground on the turn, remained
inside horses in the stretch and was steadied in tight quarters near the eighth pole. TRIXIE'S TIME hugged the inner rail on the turn, angled to the three
path in upper stretch and weakened. BUFF'S IN LOVE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and gave way through the stretch. COSITA RICA ,
very wide, was outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of GRACE ISABELLA, I'MTHEKATSMEOW was disqualified and placed
third.

Footnotes
HARD STING edged up while saving ground past the five eighths, sat patiently tracking mid turn, eased out into the lane, moved to engage the leader soon
after, secure command past the quarter pole and drew away emphatically while under steady hand encouragement. BOURBON AGOGO settled off the
pace while saving some ground, picked up some momentum past the three eighths, angled four wide into the stretch, split rivals with three sixteenths to go
and kept on willingly to be clear of the rest. FAVOR MAKER broke a bit slow then rushed up inside to take command leaving the chute, kicked clear and set
the pace, was joined nearing the quarter pole then weakened in the final sixteenth. BRIGHTWOOD drifted out at the break, straightened and raced off the
pace while removed from the inside, circled six wide with a bit of a run into the lane then flattened out. FIND YOUR BOAZ saved ground without threatening.
GOOD LUCK LEGACY , three wide stalking the early pace, dropped in some around the turn, faded then checked in close quarters near mid stretch.
SHERIFF CHIP chased outside the winner and weakened in upper stretch. PERSEVERED , four to five wide, made a mild run nearing the lane then
faltered.

inside horses on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. PETION LASS , far back early, swung to the eight path in upper stretch and
rallied outside horses. SWIRRLIE SHIRLIE , inside horses around the turn, eased out to the four path at the head of the stretch and failed to sustain her bid.
JOYFUL NOISE , squeezed back leaving the starting gate, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. R TRUE SENSATION chased the
early pace racing along the rail and weakened through the stretch. BLUE SKY VENEZUELA circled foes on the turn, was four wide approaching the stretch
and gave way. CHECOTAH chased the pace three deep around the turn and weakened late. BARBSGRAY LION prompted the pace two wide and gave
way. MARIE FROM PARIE , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
PATRIOTIC PUNCH , outside foes early on, dropped in a bit and took closer order in hand past the five sixteenths, awaited room behind rivals into the lane,
bumped with BLUEFIELD when working her way between runners in mid stretch, sustained under right handed rousing, took command soon past the
sixteenth marker and drew clear. QUEEN OF TOMORROW tracked the pace off the inside, bid between foes past the five sixteenths, took command three
wide into the lane, briefly shook clear under a drive in mid stretch, could not fend off the winner but kept on well to the line. BLUEFIELD stalked the pace
three wide, moved up four wide under a ride and lodged a bid outside rivals after a half mile, leaned in a bit and exchanged a solid bump with the winner
near the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. MY QUEEN MICHELLE , brushed at the break, raced off the early pace while between runners, edged
up between foes near mid stretch but flattened out late. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY , three to four wide and under pressure pursuing the pace, moved up a bit
nearing the lane but lacked a solid finish. PRETTI XTREME dropped back past the half mile marker, was under a a ride around the turn, swung well wide for
the drive and had belated action. KIT KAT KATIE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was confronted approaching the quarter pole, stayed on
to mid stretch then faded. WEDONTBELIEVEHER gave inside chase to mid turn then weakened.
