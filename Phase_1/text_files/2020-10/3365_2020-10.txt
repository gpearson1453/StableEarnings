Footnotes
SAND CANYON JS bumped with a rival at the start and was off a step slow, moved up to take the lead with a half-mile to run, vied inside to the two path on
the turn, shook clear nearing the three-sixteenths, responded well in the stretch and held under steady urging. HIGHH STICKING was urged along off the
pace, rounded the turn in the two path and finished willingly for the place. GOLLY SHEZ HOT SV was urged along near the middle of the field, went three
then two wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. GOUDURISKE AL BARAKA disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the
three path on the turn, dropped back in the four path into the stretch and tired. PISTOLINE was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and
failed to respond. RB RATH broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and capitulated. WMA GRAND CENTRAL
bumped with a rival at the start, went five wide on the turn and came up empty. LAPCOS LEGACY bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then
checked, raced on the outside under urging, went five to six wide on the turn and never reached contention. CHAILLE was bumped at the start then forced
into another rival and checked sharply, went three to four wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and was no factor. AA POCKIT ROCKIT broke out and
bumped with a foe, saved ground towards the rear, moved out in upper stretch and also was no factor. AA RICH WHISKEY chased the pace, dropped back
while four wide on the turn and retreated. RB DIVA broke out and bumped with a foe then was pulled off that rival, was urged along off the pace, dropped
back while three then two wide on the turn and faltered.
