Footnotes
ARGENTIUM moved to the rail early in the race, settled in mid pack, closed saving ground on the far turn, swept inside and went by the leader near the final
16th and widened under a strong hand ride. DANCERS GHOST stalked the pace, chased angling from the rail to three-wide late on the final turn then rallied
gamely. GREEN FLEET stalked early, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn and finished under a determined drive. PREACHER POWER set the
early pace getting pressure from rivals, was reserved on the backstretch then quickened on the far turn, was passed nearing mid stretch and gave way.
RON'S GIZMO, five to four-wide on the first turn, stalked on the backstretch and chased three and four-wide on the far turn but evened out in the final 16th.
LION'S GOLDENHEART, at the rear early, chased four and five-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. TALLESTOFTHETALL stalked the pace,
chased five then four-wide on the far turn and rallied belatedly but did not threaten. CRYPTIC GRIP pressed the early pace, stalked on the backstretch,
dropped back through the far turn and trailed home.

SKYGAZE took back to manufacture a nice trip in the two path behind the three leaders, awaited room in between runners and still behind the pacesetters
around the turn, found a seam and squeezed through outside the sixteenth pole, driving past her stablemate inside the seventy yard pole, winning the
bragging rights in the barn in a one-two-three Casse trained finish. LILI'S SONG settled off the pace, came off the inside to three wide late on the turn,
tipped out in upper stretch and looked poised to drive by them all but the winner had a seam and outkicked her to the wire. SUPER PATRIOTIC was
steadied and taken up early, taken over to the rail to chase the three on the lead, awaited room inside the eventual winner on the turn, snuck up the fence
when the speed tired and had the lead inside the eighth pole but couldn't match the energy of her two stablemates, settling for the show. HAI BOBBI rushed
up the rail to mid pack, in behind two groups of three on the turn, angled out to the three path turning for home but had no clear room in upper stretch,
tipping out by the sixteenth pole and closing late for a minor award. PSEUDONYM off the pace early, circled around three to four wide on the turn to make it
a line of three chasing the top trio, had dead aim on the lead in upper stretch but couldn't sustain her bid, stalling in the final seventy yards.
JUSTLEAVEITALONE three wide stalked and pressed the front throughout, got the better of her pace sisters in upper stretch and had a brief advantage by
mid stretch but tired in the final seventy yards. SILENT CAUSEWAY between rivals and dueling throughout, battled to a very brief lead after turning for
home but got the wobblies late and fell back quickly in the final sixteenth. BOSSALINA trailed by multiple lengths throughout, only able to pass a tired foe
down the stretch while outside and on her wrong lead. DOUBLE MEDAL led inside two rivals, under pressure throughout, was headed at the top of the
stretch, and lost ground down the lane.

Footnotes
DESIGNER READY missed the break and trailed early, gradually moved through the field while two to five wide on the turn, shifted in a tad green in upper
stretch to pass some wide rivals, tipped out again inside the eighth pole and blew by the tiring leaders, widening in the final sixteenth. MRS FRANKEL (IRE)
broke out at the start from her outside post and was taken back so as not to get involved in the speed duel, bid three wide versus those two pacesetters late
on the turn and in upper stretch battled with the pace survivor, wresting the front away by the sixteenth pole but immediately tackled by the winner, no match
for that one. ANGELOU dueled outside a rival through quick fractions, shook free of that one by the turn for home but was immediately tackled by another
foe and battled that one gamely to inside the eighth pole before succumbing to the pressure, holding the show spot gamely. OSTRACIZE settled in mid
pack, rallied two to four wide on the turn, shifted in upper stretch and changed leads a few times, closing well in the final sixteenth when levelling out.
BEQUIA off the pace and still second last mid turn, came into the three path late on the bend and out in the six path upper stretch, weaving her way through
rivals down the lane, best of all from the rear late. DANCE WITH DESTINY settled in mid pack along the rail, moved in behind the leaders late on the turn
and hung around inside until the final seventy yards, losing ground from there to the wire. IN MY OPINION bumped with a rival at the start before settling
outside in mid pack, came three to four wide into range on the turn and was in touch with the leaders until the eighth pole, stalling from that point. HADLEY
sat along the rail in mid pack, was asked for run late on the turn but could only rally mildly down the stretch without threatening. HI HONEY off the pace
along the inside, rallied into the four path late on the turn and fanned out to the six path turning for home but could only run evenly down the lane. MS
WICKED bumped hard with a rival at the start, was off the pace and between rivals looking uncomfortable on the turn, no rally forthcoming. MUSICAL RIDE
dueled inside a rival throughout, the fast pace catching up with her down the stretch, retreating to finish far back. MISS FLOKI chased the front runners two
to three wide on the turn, tiring and falling back mid turn to the wire.

PROVEN STRATEGIES led briefly then forced the pace, regained the lead entering the turn, shook clear into the stretch and finished under a hand ride.
LUCKY CURLIN was away slowly, settled off the pace, came four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied outside. SHIRL'S SPEIGHT
pressed the pace, chased three-wide late turn, launched a determined drive but lost place on the wire. DUKE OF CARTHANIA, away slowly, settled off the
pace, was steadied three-wide approaching traffic late turn then chased through the stretch. TOLD IT ALL, off slowly, raced in mid pack, was in hand on the
turn, chased two-wide into the stretch and finished gamely in vain. CLEAR DESTINATION settled off the pace, closed five-wide on the turn, rallied, but
evened out late. RUNWAY DREAMER settled in mid pack, closed three-wide late turn but evened out in the final 16th. LOOKINATAMIRACLE stalked up

Footnotes
BOARDROOM sat wide and off the pace early, advanced steadily while four wide on the turn to loom dangerous at the top of the stretch, collared the leader
at the eighth pole and opened a clear lead, holding safe to the wire, her margin diminishing late. OUR SECRET AGENT four wide chasing the pacesetters
early, dropped back to near the rear late backstretch, rallied three to five wide on the turn and was following the winner, a couple of lengths behind that one
turning for home, lay in down the lane under right handed encouragement, gaining on the leader gradually late. FLY SO PRETTY off the pace and under a
hold along the inside down the backstretch, came off the rail in upper stretch and gradually cleared traffic while angling out to be widest at the sixteenth
pole, closing best of all the final seventy yards. AVIE'S SAMURAI chased the leader along the inside, angled out to bid in upper stretch but hung after the
winner blew by to her outside, shifting in by the sixteenth pole and holding a minor award. OWLETTE sped to the front and set a fast pace, had a clear lead
turning for home but was headed by the winner at the eighth pole, retreating from that point. WINDRACER (IRE) between rivals and in mid pack into the
turn, fell back mid turn to upper stretch before re-rallying mildly in the final sixteenth. RAISON D'ETRE three wide and between runners on the turn when the
winner came up outside of her in mid pack, levelling off down the lane without threatening. DIAMOND SPARKLES off the pace and two to four wide on the
turn, never got involved in the outcome. TWO SIXTY hit the gate hard at the start, stalked the fast pace and was asked to bid mid turn but retreated late turn
and down the stretch.

LION KINGDOM settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch, drew even with STRIKE A BEAT a 16th out, was
herded outward a little but prevailed under a drive. STRIKE A BEAT, in range, closed three and four-wide on the turn, took command upper stretch, drifted
out in the final 16th herding LION KINGDOM, battled to the end and missed. FIFTH SEASON stalked the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide late turn,
rallied, lost his path with a 16th to run and evened out. CURLIN'S THRILL broke outward and was steadied, raced in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on
the turn and finished under a determined drive. WINGS OF VICTORY settled in mid pack, came two to four-wide through the turn and was all out in the
stretch. PERSONAL JOURNEY broke inward, was hustled up to contest the lead, forced the pace on the turn, was headed upper stretch and chased to the
end. SAMUEL H raced from off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then evened out late. TARA CITIZEN dueled briefly and gained a short lead,
set a pressured pace on the turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way under a ride. CREATIVE FORCE settled well off the pace, was hustled two and
three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SENSATIONALIST showed brief speed then forced the pace, faded three and four-wide late turn and
had no closing response. L'ETAT (GER) raced in mid pack, came three to six-wide through the turn then lacked a rally. A CLAIM OF FOUL WAS LODGED
BY THE RIDER ON FIFTH SEASON AGAINST STRIKE A BEAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE AREA OF THE 16TH POLE. AFTER REVIEWING THE
STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED STRIKE A BEAT AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

Footnotes
RED STORM RISEN, in range, was hustled four and five-wide on the turn, took command upper stretch and held sway, driving. IN ALL ALONE stalked the
pace, came along the rail and two-wide though the turn then rallied gamely. RACING IN THE RAIN raced in mid pack, was hustled four-wide hard late turn,
launched a determined drive and was gaining late. WALTZING CHAMP settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail to three-wide late turn, ran into traffic
in the stretch and came up with a strong late effort when clear. PITCHING FAST, steadied at the start, gained mid pack, chased hard three to five-wide on
the turn then came running fast in the late stages. AIM FOR THE SKY broke in the air, was rated in mid pack and taken back to the rear of the pack, hugged
the rail on the turn then rallied gamely in the stretch. UNION COLONEL dueled early, forced the pace on the turn, bid at the top of the stretch but was
outkicked and gave way. WINDCHILL ZAR, in range, was hustled four-wide late turn, was blocked behind rivals in the stretch and never really got clear.
BENLION settled off the pace, was hustled four to six-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but was never in contention. WINNERS CLUB stalked the
pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, ran into traffic in the late stages and was not a threat. MR. COOL set a pressured pace, was headed
upper stretch and gave way. TURF FLIGHT settled off the pace, was hustled five then four-wide on the turn but lacked a rally.
