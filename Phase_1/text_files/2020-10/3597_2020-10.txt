Footnotes
THE KOHEN was off a step slowly, moved up to set the pace, responded to pressure on the turn, came out in late stretch and held well. INQUISITEUR
pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, was crowded and steadied late, continued willingly and was outfinished. PALICE REVENGE was off
slowly, unhurried early, rallied on the turn, swung wide, angled in, bid and came up empty. RANDOM KRPTONIGHT showed speed to the turn and stopped.
DYRDEK had brief speed only. LUCKY WALLY showed speed to the turn and stopped. The rider of INQUISITEUR lodged an objection against the rider of
THE KOHEN for alleged interference in late stretch. No change was made.

Footnotes
SUBTLE RIDE was rated early, rallied into the second turn, angled in, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a long drive. ESTEEMED raced close to
the pace inside, was checked along the backstretch but didn't fall too far back, rallied on the turn to take command, responded when challenged to duel
through the stretch and was outnodded in a game effort. TOSS THE FLAG stalked the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, quickly dropped back,
leveled off and settled for show. BINGHAM'S FLASH was hustled along to set the pace to the second turn and stopped. SIXTH GEAR broke out, went five
wide on the first turn and was outrun in an even effort. PAIN FOR GAIN was through after a half.

Footnotes
ENROUTE was slow early, rallied inside on the turn, shifted out, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. SHINNY raced mid pack, swung wide
entering the stretch, found his best stride late, gained late and got up at the wire for second. MINISTERSDON'TLIE set the pace, drew away for a clear lead,
faltered and was caught for place. LIL LATIGO swung wide entering the stretch, finished well and didn't have enough late. PACIFIC OCEAN was slow early,
rallied inside on the turn to loom a threat, had nothing left for the drive and dropped back. INDIAN DRAGON chased the pace to the stretch, tired and gave
way. SHACKMANDU raced between horses, showed speed to the turn and gave way. WOW THE CROWD failed to threaten in an even effort. COMIN
SUNDOWN was not a factor. FIELD GENERAL was outrun. PACHE'S NUGGET was never far back, raced outside, had nothing left and lacked a response.

MOLLY DENALI broke slowly, moved up inside to contend, drew away for a clear lead leaving the turn and held well. THREE CHIPS lagged early, swung
wide entering the stretch, finished well and gained late. COUNTRY CLASSIC saved ground, bid inside, lacked the needed rally and held for show. DARK
DOM vied early, dropped back and lacked a late rally. CANCAN led early, responded to pressure to vie for the lead, fell back into the stretch and leveled off.
NAVARONES SPARKLE swung wide leaving the turn, offered a mild bid only and failed to menace. ZIPZAPZOOM raced close to the pace, lacked a stretch
response and faded. SO PRO showed good early speed while racing inside, stopped on the turn and dropped back. LITTLE PET KITTY broke through the
gate, ran loose briefly, got away well, dropped back and was not a threat. SPLITS N STRIKES was outrun.

Footnotes
PAPA JUSTICE vied inside, fell back on the turn, rallied into the stretch to duel for the lead, inched clear and held. REMEMBER ME TONY pressed the
pace, was boxed in briefly into the turn, shifted out, went willingly to the wire and didn't have enough late. TIME TO RUMBLE vied to mid stretch and was
unable to sustain his bid. SILVER DADDY saved ground, was roused on the turn, bid six wide and hung late. CEBOLLA raced in close outside, rallied three
wide on the turn to contend, weakened and faded through the stretch. BARELYSTILLCOUNTS raced in the back, swung wide entering the stretch and
lacked a response. QAABIL was not a factor.

Footnotes
BAYERN TO BE WILD dropped in along the backstretch, stalked the pace to the turn, shifted out, bid willingly, dueled for the lead and inched clear late to
prove best. GEORGIAN ROAD set the pace, responded when challenged to duel through the stretch and yielded late, grudgingly. DANDY VAN broke out,
was void of early speed, offered a mild bid inside and earned show. SHARK HUNTER was carried out at the start, stalked the pace to the second turn and
flattened out. THE KID IN SYD stalked the pace while racing between horses, was steadied along the backstretch, angled out for the drive, bid and came up
empty. SEBASTIAN CAPE failed to threaten in an even effort. TIZ A SLAYER was rated back leaving the first turn, lacked a bid and was not a factor.
BEYOND PRECHER was outrun.
