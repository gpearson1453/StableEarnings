Footnotes
BACHELOR PAD chased the early leaders wide and under a hold, advanced gradually while still four to five wide, the rider seemingly not concerned about
loss of ground, fanned into the seven path turning for home and drove to the front at the sixteenth pole, increasing his margin with every stride. JERSEY
DIAMOND led quickly, was pressed to his inside by a rival and stalked by another into the turn, repelled those challengers and had a length in upper stretch
but couldn't hold the winner off at the sixteenth pole, drifting out a tad but holding the place spot gamely. ACT OF BOB stalked three wide early, bid midway
on the turn to make it three in a line, dropped back in upper stretch but was re-rallying when losing his path at the eighth pole, running on evenly to hold the
show spot. STORMY EGBERT had a perfect trip closing from mid pack into contention along the rail, angled out in upper stretch to look dangerous but lost
his opening near the eighth pole and shifted inside, only able to run on evenly from there to get a minor award. EMBRACE MY UNCLE trailed by open
lengths, rallied from early on the turn along the rail and down the stretch to best the balance, lengthening his stride noticeably in the final sixteenth.
AGNELLI was three wide chasing the early leaders, advanced into range four wide between rivals late on the turn but could only inch up in the final furlong
without threatening. MUSKOKA STORM rushed up inside the leader quickly, battled that rival to the head of the stretch and tried to stay on but tired from his
early efforts and faltered in the final furlong. POLYDEUCES sat in behind the trio of early leaders, angled out to take a shot late on the turn but had no
response down the lane. FRAC ATTACK circled the field two to five wide on the turn but was on his wrong lead down the stretch, dropping back, the rider
up in the saddle late.

CAPTURE THE RIDE settled in mid pack, chased hard two and three-wide on the turn, rallied and swept to the lead in deep stretch. GIVE ME AN EYE was
pinched back early, raced in striking range, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, rallied determinedly but was outkicked. BARTMAN, in range,
encountered traffic late turn then threaded his way on a very tight path along the fence and closed gamely. MANNY raced in mid pack, was hustled four and
five-wide on the turn then rallied mildly outside. MAZINAW LEGEND, rated off the pace along the rail, was blocked at the top of the stretch but came running
late between foes. UNDER CITY LIGHTS held a short early lead, dueled on the backstretch, shook clear mid turn, was lugging in approaching the top of the
stretch and continued to lay in through the stretch and faded to sixth place. DECISION MADE forced the pace, chased three-wide on the turn then the rally
stalled mid stretch. BIG MATTEO stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then finished gamely on a very tight path along the fence. LANDRY
showed speed, dueled on the main track, was headed, chased on the turn, was steadied approaching the stretch and evened out. TOGQUOS hopped at
the start, dropped well off the pace and trailed throughout.
