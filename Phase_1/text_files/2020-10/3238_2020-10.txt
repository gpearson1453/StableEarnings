Footnotes
GIRL OF TOSCONOVA forwardly placed four paths off the inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and prompted the leader from the outside, got let out
spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. STUNNING MUNNINGS
hustled from the gate, crossed over in tandem with LEFT LEANING LUCY who was also hustled from the start and forced CLASSY SADIE to be steadied
off her heels when reaching the inside, chased along the inside in behind the leader from the pocket patiently handled through the turn, cut the corner into
upper stretch with a usable seam along the inside, remained on hold as the seam closed down and was paused in behind LEFT LEANING LUCY from the
three-sixteenths to inside the eighth pole, had that rival altar out and followed her despite a now open rail and was roused to be along for the place honors.
LEFT LEANING LUCY hustled from the gate, crossed to the two path in tandem with the aforementioned foe to her inside, tucked inside at the
nine-sixteenths and came under some pressure from the eventual winner to the outside, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting collared near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. CLASSY SADIE got steadied off the
heels of STUNNING MUNNINGS early on as that rival crossed in front, chased along the inside, tipped out put to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung
three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. THEA'S THEME chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. HOLMDEL PARK stumbled at the start, chased two to three wide coaxed along from three furlongs out,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
OYSTER BOX got hand ridden into the pocket along the backstretch, bided time tracking the front runners during the run around the bend, was driven four
wide and into full clearance entering the stretch, gained readily on the ones to catch, vied as the widest of three for a sixteenth beginning from midlane then
afterwards in a duel versus the second place finisher, got the job done. SO ENCHANTING off the inside throughout, departed the backstretch from path
four, picked up interest and closed the gap on the front runners springing from the five-sixteenths pole, was slightly closer to the rail challenging in earnest,
fought her way to a slim advantage during the ensuing furlong, was forced to defend it between rivals from the eighth pole to the sixteenth marker, left the
latter station hooked up in a spirted tussle with the winner after having just been headed, stayed on for the place. BAY STORM pursued the pace from path
three, got fanned out seven wide from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, rallied with willingness to get up for the show. STATE CROWN sat
reserved two wide on the turn, commenced the stretch slightly wider, narrowed in, lost third. MUN LUV involved in an early pace dispute with an eager
CASHMERE QUEEN, got eased off of that opponent, drafted behind the aforementioned rival for a spell before shifting back into the two path by the
conclusion of the backstretch, increased her presence as the half was being rattled off, challenged from between foes from the head of the stretch to the
eighth pole, failed to claim the top and weakened. LILLY SIMONE took up the chase from path two, was moved out five wide for the drive, had no offering.
CASHMERE QUEEN seemed keen engaged one on one with MUN LUV early on the backstretch, saw that rival back away, went on to the show the way
thereafter pressed by her former nemesis, while taking the inside route, was put to a stern test in the vicinity of the quarter pole, succumbed in short order
and backed away. HOLLYWOOD GINA three wide onto the turn, was in path four wide exiting it, gave way.

Footnotes
FORT DRUM emerged with control shortly after the field had been released, cut over towards the inside, eventually settling at a slight distance from off the
hedge, was rated along showing the way on a loosely-contested lead, saw some of the closest pursuers under drives themselves turning into the lane but
waited until the three-sixteenths marker before finally called upon for more herself, left the eighth pole with the runner up having kicked into her best, began
to drift out with approximately a sixteenth to go as SPLIT THEN DOUBLE whittled away at the deficit, dug in late to preserve the decision. SPLIT THEN
DOUBLE (GB) took up the chase from the three path, came under a ride spinning into the stretch, had a good finish down the center of the course, fell short.
SIMPLY THE BEST stalked the winner from path two, got roused heading home, stayed on for the show. MY TOMMY LEE chased the pace from the two
path, angled five wide into the lane flashing momentum, maintained it after being straightened away en route for the final significant slice of the purse.
ARMY WIFE remained in the two path after the start, went about the turn from between rivals, stepped into the stretch, lacked the necessary response.
BOSS CARA sneaked her way into the pocket coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, tipped out towards path three for the drive, had no rally.
HURRICANE FLORENCE failed to fire after undergoing a ground-saving journey. FEELING PRETTY three wide on the turn, gave way. JORDY CAN TAP
darted to the hedge on the backstretch, went on to ride it on the turn to no avail.

Footnotes
FRANK'S ROCKETTE broke in at the start and was corrected under coaxing, raced three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two to three
wide through the turn and steadily advanced on the leader to assume command near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, got roused
straightened away and drew off under a light drive before being taken in hand nearing the sixteenth marker widening away to prevail comfortably at the end.
HONOR WAY lunged through the stall door just as the latch was sprung getting away nearly a length on top, settled five then four wide in pursuit from the
tail of the compact field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to
secure the place honors. ROYAL CHARLOTTE chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, kept on to secure the show honors. BERTRANDA hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside under
a ride from the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. PACIFIC GALE lightly coaxed showing the way three paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, came under threat nearing the quarter pole and got displaced from command just outside
that station, took the inside route into upper stretch under a drive and weakened.

Footnotes
FIRE AT WILL tucked over to the hedge midway on the clubhouse bend after assuming control, was well rated throwing down moderate fraction after
moderate fraction for the opening three-quarters, got cued up for the drive with mild encouragement after reeling off the third one, settled in at the
three-sixteenths pole and got set down, opened up from the others in a flash, left the eighth pole in possession of his largest lead, saw it cut in half by the
runner up, but held sway. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) kept an eye on the winner loosely pocketed until the conclusion of the backstretch, was gradually
maneuvered into path four from the half mile pole to the five-sixteenths marker, came under a drive a few strides later, spun onto the top of the lane, saw the
top one kick clear, battled onward with good courage garnering the place. STEP DANCER strung out three wide on the first turn, stalked the pacesetter
thereafter from path two, got roused after six furlongs had been run, went into the lane, got outfinished. SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY rode the hedge after a
sluggish start, was asked for more entering the stretch, mustered up a mild response for the last major check. ZIPPY BABY four wide on the opening bend,
travelled one path closer to the inside on the subsequent one, folded. AMERICAN MONARCH reserved chasing the pace from path two, was asked for run
on the far turn, failed to make any headway, came into the lane, then after being placed to a protective hold, was allowed to fade away.

CHANNEL MAKER hustled from the gate intent on the lead, showed the way in hand just off the inside, past the stands for the initial time and through the

at the five-sixteenths as rivals in behind got busy themselves, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole and dug
in to hold well to the finish kept to task. LACCARIO (GER) bobbled at the break, recovered to settle just off the inside near the rear of the field, tipped three
wide down the backstretch remaining unhurried until placed to light coaxing into the far turn, came under urging three furlongs from home two to three wide,
angled out five wide into upper stretch and closed well outside to procure the place honors in the late stages while unable to threaten the winner. SADLER'S
JOY saved ground past the stands and through the first turn, tipped to the two path down the backstretch under a light hold tracking the front from near the
rear, came under coaxing tipped three wide at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide at the head of the stretch, ran on through to the finish and was just
bested for the place honors in the final strides. MASTER PIECE (CHI) tracked the pace along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and kept on for the last major share. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) three wide through the first turn, raced three wide in pursuit
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, bid swinging four wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move and backed away through the
final furlong. CROSS BORDER broke out at the start under coaxing and was corrected, chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got coaxed
along three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened. HIGHLAND SKY just of the inside in the early stages, raced three
then two wide through the first turn, then chased three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COMPLEXITY assumed a prominent position after the field had been sent on its way, was confidently ridden attending ENDORSED from path two, left the
three-eighths pole having securing the advantage by a neck or so, inched away from the others the rest of journey on the turn with the pilot continuing to
hold something in reserve, sputtered four wide when put to a drive stepping onto the top of the lane, with CODE OF HONOR following suit by shifting much
wider himself, clung to the advantage during the ensuing furlong, despite the second place finisher bearing down hard from the outside, drifted out a bit late,
but edged away.. CODE OF HONOR was allowed to settle into stride proceeding along the chute, tipped into the three path for the start of the run around
the turn, narrowed the gap as three-quarters was being completed, was induced by the winner to swing approximately five wide into the stretch,
straightened away and saw the pilot go to work, got staved off. STAN THE MAN tracked the pace from just off the rail, got asked to pick it up coming up to
the five-sixteenths marker, fanned out towards path six from upper to midstretch, proved no match. ENDORSED established the top after a light hand ride,
carved out the pace, shadowed by COMPLEXITY in the two path, got overhauled just as the twosome was about to cross the midway point on the turn, fell
back, even when put to a drive a sixteenth later, stepped into the lane and backed away readily.

Footnotes
GUFO broke out a step at the start and was corrected, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack early on, tipped to the two path down the
backstretch and advanced to be leading a second flight momentarily as the top trio slipped away, got given some rein to work with half a mile from home,
came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch in behind NO WORD, nudged MOON OVER MIAMI a bit outwards
straightening away, drifted out briefly forcing that rival now in behind to alter slightly, offered up a good kick to issue a challenge through the final furlong
collaring the front just inside the sixteenth marker and prevailed edging clear at the end. NO WORD tracked the pace just off the inside in range of the front,
advanced on the leader nearing the far turn in tandem with MOON OVER MIAMI, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the leader through the stretch taking command briefly a sixteenth out before being collared by the eventual winner,
ran on to safely secure the place honors. MO READY established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under some pressure
nearing the far turn from a pair to the outside and tucked to the hedge, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under threat and staved off the challenge stubbornly through to the sixteenth pole, got caught at that station and kept on to preserve the show
honors. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM traded light bumps with MOON OVER MIAMI shortly after the start, raced three wide through the opening bend, chased
three wide from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper stretch, tipped out slightly as MOON OVER MIAMI
did so near the three-sixteenths and kept on to procure the last major share. PIXELATE just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under
encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. MOON OVER MIAMI forwardly
placed three wide through the first turn, tracked the leader from the three path down the backstretch advancing in tandem with NO WORD on that foe
nearing the far turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and was nudged along the inside by GUFO straightened
away, then paused and altered out slightly as that foe drifted in front with about three-sixteenths to go before weakening through to the finish. SOUTH BEND
saved ground near the rear of the field, came under urging at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired. VENEZUELAN HUG three wide
through the first turn, chased three to four wide from near the rear, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered four wide at the top of the stretch
and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on GUFO in regards to MOON OVER MIAMI. After review the result stood and the
race was declared official.

SHOW ME THE HONEY took up the chase two wide on the backstretch, got guided onto the inside route at the top of the bend, sat within midpack keeping
watch on the front runners, cut the corner into the lane, was bumped by a slightly-errant LOVE'S MYSTERY in the general area of the three-sixteenths
marker, went on to abscond that opponent's two path afterwards by shouldering it out of the way, rallied after the winner in earnest, struck the front end with
approximately a sixteenth remaining and shook free. SECRETS KEPT along the outside, took up the chase three wide on the turn, angled five wide for the
drive, came home with willingness down the center of the course to procure the place. SHE'S A MAJESTIC brushed at the start, grabbed the advantage in
short order, cut over to the inside, was rated along setting the splits, accompanied by MONDEUSE one path farther to the outside, settled in at the
three-sixteenths marker and was given her cue, saw the winner take charge approximately a furlong later, had enough left late to salvage the show. HEDDA
forwardly placed three wide, was let loose for the stretch run, chased the ones to catch from between rivals from midstretch to the sixteenth pole, fell short of
snagging away third. SAYOH three wide onto the turn, got sent out four wide exiting it, mustered up a mild response. LOVE'S MISERY taken hold of after
breaking a bit to the outside, travelled two wide, swung into the lane, lugged in momentarily in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths maker, making contact with
the winner, then got nudged of its path during the next several jumps, made no headway in the last eighth. EMMA AND I rode the rail, got roused angling to
the outside from the five-sixteenths pole, wound up in the neighborhood of path seven by midlane, had some gain. THEATRICAL DANCER three wide on
the turn and in upper stretch, made no impact. MONDEUSE stalked the leader two wide until the head of the stretch before giving way. BLACK LICORICE
bumped lightly with SHE'S A MAJESTIC right after the start, lost some momentum in addition to real estate after becoming unsettled just as the first fraction
was being finalized, travelled four wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path wider, never made her presence felt. KHALI MAGIC sighted two wide
on the turn, was never involved. ROSIES SURPRISE saved ground, faltered after going a half.
