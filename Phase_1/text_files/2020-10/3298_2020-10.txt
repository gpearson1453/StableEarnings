late. DOMINANT STRANGER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin to the final furlong, stayed on when challenged, then was
outfinished in a good effort. PUFFER FISH well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the

Footnotes
FAST LANI sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off under mild urging. SALIZA
stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position through the turn, bid outside the leader into the lane, then could not threaten that one, while
clearly best of the rest. TRUDIAN'S PROMISE allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and closed well
for the show. MAGIC LEMONS allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and got up for a share. HIDEY
HIDEY well placed, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened in the drive. LADY
DOMINANCE improved position. GET ME A DIAMOND well placed and outside, angled in and lost some ground through the turn, came through inside of
rivals and faded. FABULOUS DREAMER mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally.
VACATION SECRET was a brief factor. WINE TRAIL was no factor.

looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, weakened late and held the place. VIOLET BLUE allowed to settle, saved
ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and missed the place. MADAME X. allowed to
settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and got up for a share. MARMALADE mid pack, moved up three
and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. A ROSE FOR LIZZY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. OFFLEE IRISH well placed and outside, faded after a half.

Footnotes
TOOLCAT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and drew off the
final furlong. CLASSY HALO allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the
place. NEVER FORGET HER sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. ELIA stalked the pace on the
outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and weakened in the drive. GENEVIEVE'S Z VA allowed to settle, looped
up three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and passed a tiring rival. SPEAK LIGHTLY was no factor.

Footnotes
EMBRACE THE GRIND allowed to settle, moved up on the two path while boxed through the second turn, came through on that path, angled out for clear
racing room, made a steady gain and drove clear late. FRENCH KISS ME mid pack, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the
lane, dueled late, edged ahead, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. BEACH PASS mid pack, looped up three and four wide through
the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and closed well for the show. BOARDWALK BOB set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the
stretch, dueled in the late going, then weakened and held a share. ROYAL FAMILY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside
of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. EL DUQUE allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the
stretch and passed tiring rivals. LEVEL SEVENTEEN never far back, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and faded.
CRASHDAPARTY (IRE) well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the lane and
had no rally. LUCKY UNLUCKY was no factor. STORMBIRD'S SONG stalked the pace on the outside and faded after a half. MAKINDREAMSCOMETRU
reared at the start and lost the rider.
