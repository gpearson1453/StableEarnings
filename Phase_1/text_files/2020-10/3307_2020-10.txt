Footnotes
SPANISH KINGDOM stalked from the three path, inched closer turning for home to make a three wide bid in upper stretch, forged an advantage passing the
three sixteenths pole, and held CHURN N BURN's rebid just at bay in the final stages under driving pressure. CHURN N BURN set the pace along the
inside, vied inside of FRONT MAN around the far turn, but was headed by that foe at the quarter pole and by SPANISH KINGDOM in upper stretch, but
fought back grudgingly, rebid inside of the latter in the final sixteenth, but was denied and missed. MUD PIE was off slowly, saved ground far off of the pace
around both turns, shifted three wide turning for home before gliding to the six path through midstretch, then produce a belated kick to achieve show
approaching the wire. KENTUCKY GHOST tracked from midpark two wide, rallied while shifting from the three path to the five path turning for home,
sustained a gain through upper stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong and was outfinished by MUD PIE foe show. FRONT MAN pressed CHURN N
BURN from the outside before vying outside of that foe around the far turn, forged a narrow advantage passing the quarter pole but was headed by an outer
foe at the three sixteenths pole, and yielded thereafter. HELLORHIGHWATER stalked along the inside and from the pocket around the turns, but lacked a
kick to split the leaders through a narrow opening in upper stretch, chased through the lane from behind those foes, and tired late. BATTALION dwelt at the
start and raced far off fo the pace two wide around both turns, then swung six wide turning for home, and passed tired foes. SINGAPORE FLASH saved
ground from midpack before shifting four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by outer foes. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR trailed in the two path, then in the
three to four path around the far turn, and failed to factor. MANTRA advanced by saving ground turning for home as other foes went wide, but found traffic in
upper stretch, and lacked a rally to make a bid before tiring. SURF AND TURF tracked from midpack in the three path around both turns, but was outkicked
between foes passing the quarter pole and weakened. BAYOU PROSPECTOR raced off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, and was done
early.

JUNGLE JUICE (IRE) dueled for the lead outside of HONEY PARADE, assumed command after that foe weakened passing the three furlong pole, repelled
CENTERFOLD ANGEL's bid passing the quarter pol, drew clear in upper stretch, then hung on her left lead through the lane, but determinedly fended off
QUEEN NEKIA in the final sixteenth. QUEEN NEKIA tracked from the three path and between foes into the turn, allowed her outer foe to make first run
around the bend, tipped five wide turning for home to be outside of foes, then produced a grinding rally through the lane, but was fended off by JUNGLE
JUICE (IRE) through the final stages. CEDAR HALL saved ground in midpack, inched closer inside of foes in upper stretch to bid for place, but was no
match for the top two passing the sixteenth pole. CENTERFOLD ANGEL trailed the short field three wide, advanced in the four path and outside of foes
around the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was repelled by the leader and flattened out in upper stretch. LA FEMME ROYALE stalked three
wide, but was outmoved by CENTERFOLD ANGEL at the five sixteenths pole, and faded through the lane. HONEY PARADE dueled for the lead inside of
the eventual winner, but weakened passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
AUNT PEARL (IRE) set a quick, but contained, pace along the inside while in hand, held a clear margin down the backstretch before feeling pressure from
NAVRATILOVA into the far turn, spurted clear again from that foe when let out a notch passing the three-eighths marker, came under coaxing to extend her
margin passing the quarter pole, responded well and quickly asserted command, then drew off under driving pressure to stay well clear of SPANISH
LOVEAFFAIR through the late stages. SPANISH LOVEAFFAIR stalked two to three wide, inched closer into the far turn to take dead aim on the clear leader
turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, proved no match, then stayed on well through the lane to clearly prove second best.
INGRASSIA raced a bit keenly far off of the pace two wide and between horses crossing the wire for the first time and into the first turn, shifted three wide
down the backstretch, advanced while swinging five wide around the far turn, then sustained her rally through the lane to secure show. ARM CANDY got a
bit keen into the first turn while tracking from midpack two wide and between horses, held that position around the far turn, but bumped with GAMBLING
CAT while shifting three to four wide passing the quarter pole, then stayed on for a minor reward. BATYAH saved ground around both turns while far off of
the pace, then came off of the rail in midstretch to pass tired foes. NAVRATILOVA pressed the clear leader from the outside down the backstretch, inched
closer to attempt a bid into the far turn, but proved no match for that foe turning for home, cut the corner to hold position, but weakened through the late
stages. TAYLOR'S TOURIST stalked along the inside, drifted out while failing to keep pace on her left lead in upper stretch, and weakened. MOMENTOUS
MISS got very rank into the first turn while along the inside in midpack, then got rank again down the backstretch before saving ground around the far turn,
but to no avail. BEAUTIFUL STAR trailed around both turns, and failed to factor. GAMBLING CAT tracked from midpack three to four wide, inched closer to
be in striking range into the far turn, but weakened turning for home, was bumped passing the quarter pole, and stopped. LAZY SUMMER DAY broke
outwards and was away last of all, then was caught four wide while far off of the pace, and weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
GROOVY LEMON PIE pressed the pace two wide, vied outside of FUGITIVE around the turn before forging a narrow lead in upper stretch, then put away
his inner counterpart while meeting LONG TERM THINKING's bid passing the sixteenth pole, and held the latter at bay. LONG TERM THINKING was off
slowly, rallied four wide and outside of foes around the turn to take aim on the leaders in upper stretch, grinded away at GROOVY LEMON PIE's advantage
through the lane to produce a late bid, but was denied by that foe. FUGITIVE set a pressured pace inside of the eventual winner around the turn, dug in as
that foe inched a narrow lead in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and yielded in the final sixteenth. ENGLANDER was forwardly
placed three wide, but chased the leaders through the lane wihtout producing a bid. AMERICAN HUMOR tracked from midpack along the inside, but failed
to threaten. EPIC ADVENTURE raced far off of the pace two to three wide, and failed to menace. CARRIER PIGEON trailed the field and failed to factor.
MONKEY ZONE stumbled at the start, but recovered to race close to the pace along the inside, then weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. PAINT I
AIN'T raced far off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.
