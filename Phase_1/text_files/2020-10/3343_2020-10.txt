Footnotes
GHOSTLY WHO stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, drove past the leaders three wide and drew off late under a steady drive.
VICTORY ELEMENT vied for the lead early three wide, was in the three path into the lane and was no match for the winner in the stretch run. ATTAIN
SUCCESS raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in the stretch and just missed show at the wire. MARK MY WAY raced back early
on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. PARK RIDGE BENNY vied for the lead from between horses, was on the inside into
the lane and weakened late in the stretch. RED BLUE AND TRUE was bothered along the backstretch, raced along the four path into the lane and improved
position in the stretch. GIDDYMEISTER was bumped at the start and done early. SILVER LUKE SILVER came out at the start and was no factor.
MANIACAL was through after a half. ROYAL PRIVACY had brief speed then folded up. COLLEGE PARTY was bumped at the start and slightly clipped
heels along the backstrretch. NICE WORK stumbled at the start and lost the rider. After a stewards inquiry, PARK RIDGE BENNY was disqualified and
placed eleventh for an infraction that occurred along the backstretch.

Footnotes
FLATOYA set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, repelled foe down the lane, drifted out and cleared in the final stages. TESORINA chased the
pace early, was off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, altered late but was kept at bay in the final stages. TELLURIDE QUEEN chased the pace
early while hugging the rail, stayed on the rail into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. TWIRLING DERVISH broke slowly at
the start and trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. GRIMPANTE came out at the start and raced back
early on, was in the five path into the lane and improved position. ASHLEY'S NEW SHOES was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early, was in the four
path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA was never a factor. CHARMED ONE was through after a half. The rider of
TESORINA claimed an objection against the rider of FLATOYA for interference late in the stretch run but after review by the stewards the claim was
disallowed.

Footnotes
TELEPHONE TALKER saved ground off of the pace early on, advanced on his own power down the backstretch to stalk the trio of leaders from the pocket
around the far turn, tipped to the four path passing the three sixteenths pole, commenced a grinding rally to produce a bid passing the furlong pole, and
drove past the leaders in the late stages. WINTERS BACK set the pace inside of the pressing GEAR JOCKEY, but was headed by that foe passing the
quarter pole, fought on gamely through the lane, and reclaimed place from that foe while being surpassed by TELEPHONE TALKER in the closing stages.
GEAR JOCKEY prompted the pace two wide, then between horses around the far turn, shifted to the three path turning for home to float DREAMS OF
TOMORROW wider, forged an advantage passing the quarter pole, but was headed by TELEPHONE TALKER passing the furlong pole before losing place
to his inner counterpart. DREAMS OF TOMORROW got rank stalking the leaders into the first turn, stayed unsettled around the first turn while shifting
outside of those foes, prompted three wide around the far turn, but was floated to the four path turning for home, and tired in upper stretch. TRADE
DEADLINE raced far off of the pace in the two to four path around the first turn, then in the three path around the far turn, but failed to factor. GHOSTLORE
took the turn in the two to three paths and never got involved. LUXOR hesitated at the start, then was caught five wide around the first turn, was done early,
and showed little.

SHELLEY'S GEM was bumped by an inner foe at the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses early on, surpassed those foes around the
bend before shifting three wide to take aim on the dueling leaders in upper stretch, then produced a grinding rally through the lane to bid at the sixteenth
pole, and drew clear approaching the wire. BEHIND THE COUCH bumped an outer foe at the start, then pressed LARIMAR from outside of her flank,
dueled with that foe around the turn and through upper stretch, gamely sustained the battle into the final furlong, but was surpassed by SHELLEY'S GEM
passing the sixteenth pole while prevailing in the duel for place. LARIMAR set the pace along the inside, dueled for the lead inside of BEHIND THE COUCH
around the turn, gamely sustained the duel through the lane, but was bested by an outer oncharging foe and her dueling counterpart in the final sixteenth.
NOT A PROBLEM tracked the pace three wide, but failed to make an impact. BLONDE BY NATURE trailed the field four wide around the turn, and failed to
factor. BARBADOLLA chased along the inside, but weakened. LETTERS TO BELLE stalked three wide, but weakened passing the three furlong pole, and
faltered around the turn.

Footnotes
STRIKE THAT stalked the leading quintet of duelers down the backstretch from the three path, got floated to the five path turning for home by an inner foe,
then sustained a rally through the lane under a long drive to bid at the sixteenth pole, and prevailed over the foe splitting HOG CREEK HUSTLE at the wire.
HOG CREEK HUSTLE raced far off of the pace two wide, rallied inside of foes turning for home as those rivals shifted wider, sustained his advance behind
the leaders through the lane, then split those foes at the sixteenth pole to produce a menacing bid, but was nailed by an outer oncharging rival at the wire.
RUBUS vied four wide and between horses early on, then outside of only LOOKING AT BIKINIS around the turn, forged an advantage from that foe turning
for home while shifting to the three path, clung to a narrow lead under a long drive through midstretch, but was outfinished by an inner foe and an outer rival
in the final sixteenth. LASTING LEGACY bobbled at the start, advanced four wide around the turn, and sustained her gain through the late stages for a
minor reward. LOOKING AT BIKINIS dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, then inside of a pair into the turn, but was headed by
RUBUS passing the quarter pole, dug in gamely, but yielded in the final sixteenth. BORRACHO vied three wide and between horses early on, then stalked
two to three wide around the turn, but was outkicked by an outer foe at the furlong pole. MUCHO raced far off of the pace along the inside, swung seven
wide turning for home, and rallied mildly. VISITANT was off a step slowly, then saved ground off of the pace and failed to factor. GRAY MAGICIAN tracked
from midpack in the three path, but failed to rally. COVE BLUE stumbled at the start, dueled five wide early on, then three wide into the turn, but weakened
at the three furlong poe. HIGH NORTH trailed two wide and never got involved. COPPER TOWN dueled for the lead along the inside of multiple foes, but
failed to keep pace with them passing the half mile pole, and steadily faded thereafter.

GOT STORMY rated far off of the pace two to three wide around the turn, kept that path turning for home, then shifted six wide passing the three sixteenths
pole, produced a strong kick to rally stoutly outside of foes through the lane, then lunged late to just get up at the wire. INTO MYSTIC stalked close to the
pace in the two path, shifted to the three path passing the five sixteenths pole for clear racing room, rallied to drive past the leader passing the furlong pole,
drew off, but met a stern test from GOT STORMY approaching the wire, and got nailed on it. JAKARTA set the pace outside of the closely pressing
SURRENDER NOW, shifted a bit down while clearing at the three furlong pole, held a clear margin in upper stretch, but was headed at the furlong pole, and
gave way. CHANGE OF CONTROL tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer foe passing the
furlong pole, then kept on for minor rewards. WINNING ENVELOPE was off slowly and trailed the field, came into the lane three wide, produced a rally while
altering course four wide in midstretch, and sustained her gain willingly late. SURRENDER NOW lied close up inside of JAKARTA early on, steadied into the
turn, then chased through upper stretch before tiring through the final furlong. STILLWATER COVE pressed the leader three to two wide, but was outkicked
and outpaced in upper stretch, and faded. AMBASSADOR LUNA tracked from midpack four to five wide, but tired in upper stretch. VIOLENT TIMES saved
ground far off of the pace, but never got involved. CHALON threw her head at the start, then took the turn in the three path far off of the pace, and failed to
factor.

Footnotes
LADY ROCKET prompted the pace three wide, produced bid while being floated to the four path turning for home, forged a lead at the furlong pole as
OCEAN BREEZE ranged up along side, and safely fended that foe off to the wire. OCEAN BREEZE pressed the leaders four wide, inched closer turning for
home in the five path, then sustained a bid through the lane, but was denied by her inner foe. PALOMITA dueled for the lead two wide and between horses,
shifted to the three path turning for home, but was headed at the furlong pole and gave way. SHE CAN'T SING failed to factor. MAJESTIC BLEND lied close
up to the pace in the two path while behind the leaders, but failed to produce a foe splitting rally in upper stretch before tiring. MADAME OVERSERVED
dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole. ZERO TO SIXTY and. WE THE CLOUDS were outrun.
