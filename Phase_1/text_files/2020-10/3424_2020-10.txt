ONE SMART COOKIE stayed out from the inside while making the pace in hand, drew out on the turn and was under mild urging to the end. RAECHEL'S
RISK advanced inside early to chase, swung out leaving the turn and couldn't gain. UNOQUATROSIETE advanced early between rivals, came out into the
four path on the turn and lacked a closing response. LADY LYNNE pressed outside the winner in the three path and was finished before a half. WILD N'
STORMY ducked out into BY MY OWN leaving the gate, advanced between rivals early, raced three wide into the turn and stopped. PLACID wasn't far
back four wide into the turn then stopped. BY MY OWN was bumped leaving the gate, fell back and couldn't catch up.

under mild urging. PAPADOPALOUS broke slowly, rallied the rail around the turn, gave his best into the final furlong then flattened out. TWEET KITTEN
showed speed from the outset, came well out from the rail on the turn, steered wide into the stretch then tired. CHUNNEL was slow early then gained mildly
while no threat. MAJESTIC CALLING was outrun after a slow break. BEN Z ROLLS chased outside the early leader and was finished early. MODERN TALE
briefly showed speed then stopped.

SUSIKIN settled, rallied three wide into the stretch and quickly ran clear under urging. MOON HEIST showed speed inside, moved to a clear lead just before
a half but was little math in the lane. ROCKIN RUTH was bumped while slow from the gate, stayed inside and passed tired ones. HURRICANE PATRICIA
ducked out into ROCKIN RUTH leaving the gate, fell back, never got close and was vanned off after the finish. MISTRESS AT SEA dueled two wide and

Footnotes
PENNY IN LOVE stalked two wide, moved to a clear lead leaving the backstretch and was kept to pressure. SHECOR was unhurried inside, rallied the three
path around the final turn and gained outside to the end. PICASSO MOON advanced outside on the backstretch, raced the three path around the final turn
but lacked a rally. IF YOU ONLY KNEW wasn't far back, steadied two wide between rivals into the far turn then gained mildly late as the rider stood up
before the finish. ICE PALACE raced wide around the final turn, lacked a strong closing and finished in a dead heat for fifth. SYDNEY TIME was content to
lag then made a belated run between rivals to finish even for fifth. MISS FORESTER lacked room along the rail for much of the final turn. POSTINO'S
SECRET came wide into the stretch while outrun. SWEET DANCER ducked in sharply leaving the gate, bumped L.A. HOUSE, was shuffled back soon after
and was outrun. L. A. HOUSE bobbled and was bumped leaving the gate, recovered to make the pace along the rail for about five furlongs then stopped.
