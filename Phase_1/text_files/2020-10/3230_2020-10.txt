Footnotes
SOUND CHECKERS tracked leader along the inside, at the start of the turn came in and caused MALIBU MAGIC to steady, entered stretch in the two path,
overtook leader at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MALIBU MAGIC stalked leader along the inside on the backstretch, at the start of the turn had to
steady due to shifting in rival, got back in range late in the turn, entering stretch in the two path, finished willingly to the wire to be 2nd best. ZINZAN cleared
rivals quickly and went to rail, held position throughout the turn and into the stretch, asked for run in the stretch and responded, overtaken by rival at the
sixteenth pole and weakened late in deep stretch to get caught for second. RUNAWAY INDY tracked leader in between rivals on the backstretch, entered
turn two wide and in a stalking position, entered stretch in the three path and lacked needed rally in the stretch. AUTISMONEFORTYFIVE hit right side of
the gate and came out slow, settled in the back of the pack on the backstretch, entered turn along the inside, and into the stretch along the rail, made a mild
rally in the stretch passing tired rivals. CHIEFTAIN'S LAD stalked leader two wide on the backside, maintained position through the turn and into the stretch
in the two path, lacked needed response in the lane and edged for fifth. BALLYCASTLE tracked clear leader three wide on the backstretch, entered turn
three wide and in a stalking position, started to lose ground late in turn and entered stretch in the four path, lacked needed response and came up empty
late in the stretch. JOCKEY OBJECTION, rider of MALIBU MAGIC claimed foul on SOUND CHECKERS alleging interference entering the turn, after a
Steward review it was a UNANIMOUS decision to disqualify SOUND CHECKERS and be placed behind MALIBU MAGIC due to the infraction causing
MALIBU MAGIC a chance at a better placing
