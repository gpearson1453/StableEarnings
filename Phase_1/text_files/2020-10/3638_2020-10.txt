Footnotes
LAKER JET broke out and bumped foe at the start, quickly settled at the back of the pack under a loose reign, entered turn two wide, made a bold bid
midway through the turn three wide into the stretch, and responded strong to urging and comfortably drew away from rivals. SOPRESCIOUS bumped by
inside rival at the start, pressed rival along the inside on the backstretch, rival cleared and jockey eased out to be two wide on the turn, bid for lead in upper
stretch and proved no match for closing outside rival while easily being second best. STREET FLYER led two wide on the backstretch, gained a clear lead
on the turn and maintained position entering the stretch, kept to task in stretch and weakened in deep stretch. ANNITASHEAVEN tracked inside on the
backstretch, entered turn along the rail, came out into the two path in the stretch and kept on while no threatening top three. CHARMING WEEKEND
tracked leaders two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two wide and faded late in the turn and had no impact in the stretch.
