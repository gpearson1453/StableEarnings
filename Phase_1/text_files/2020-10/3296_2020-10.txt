ATLANTIC SUN (GB) tracked the pace bidding between horses in upper stretch edging clear late. CATAUGA COUNTY gave a prompted middle move
bidding three deep in upper stretch being out gamed while saving place. SUM OVERTURE hustled clear set the pace to the far turn, hooked on the inside in
upper stretch would weaken. BLACK CIRCLE raced evenly bidding mid track down the lane finishing well. ATREYU slow early played no factor. GLIDING
ALONE chased into the far turn then gave way in upper stretch. TOM'S MUSIC was always outrun. GRAND NENUCO hustled along tired to upper stretch.
