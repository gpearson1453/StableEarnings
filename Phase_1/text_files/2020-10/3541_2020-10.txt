Footnotes
BOBBIE TOO TOO broke sharply, was hustled clear of the field while angling quickly to the rail, turned back her foes racing into upper stretch and held
sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. APRIL'S GEM, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, moved to
challenge in that path in tandem with several rivals nearing upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the winner while proving best of the others. SHE'S
HONORABLE tracked just off the leaders racing four wide into the turn, and continued with some mild interest in that path to prevail for a share late.
STOLEN GLANCE tracked off the first flight from out of striking distance racing five wide into the turn and continued evenly in that path to the lane while
gaining a position. TALLY UP, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter from the outset into the turn, briefly moved to terms with that foe in tandem with
several rivals nearing upper stretch but gave way in the drive. LOCASH settled outside foes in early stages, angled six wide racing into the lane but made
no impact. COLUMBIA CLIPPER angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing into the turn but lacked the needed late
response. SKIPTOTHEWIRE settled between foes in early stages and failed to menace. SUNDANCE CHICK broke slowly, shifted inwards while being
prompted to make some brief progress between foes gaining position racing into the turn but came up empty in the drive. GRADED ATTITUDE angled to
the inside settling as part of the last flight in early stages and never menaced thereafter.

AZUSA ST. tracked the leading pair, saved ground through the turn, was taken three wide in upper stretch, responded under a drive, and edged away in the
final sixteenth. CRANKSHAFT went off a step slow, settled three wide near the rear, improved position three wide on the turn, was taken five wide in upper
stretch, rallied, and got up for the place. MAJOR BIZKIT pressed the pace outside of IDAHO TORNADO, was urged into the turn while still attending the
pace, led approaching the five sixteenths, vied on the pace to the sixteenth, proved no match for AZUSA ST. from there, and lost the place late. TAP'S BIG

sustained a mild rally between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked. IDAHO TORNADO set the pace while pressured by MAJOR BIZKIT, saved
ground through the turn, was headed approaching the five sixteenths, vied inside to just past the furlong mark, and weakened. LOOKIN' AT MIKE was

to challenge in that path nearing the lane but proved only second best. IRISH MAJOR settled last racing to the backstretch, split foes just off the inside
racing into the lane and continued with interest to prevail for a share. LEMON BLITZ, reserved off the second flight inside foes, shifted out nearing the far
turn to advance between rivals, then shifted three wide into the lane while continuing to improve position. MIRACLE MOUNTAIN, bumped at the start,
tracked off the second flight between foes, angled inside racing into the far turn and emptied out nearing the lane. CROW MOON sprinted to the lead while
angling to the rail racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the second bend and gave way abruptly entering the stretch. NORCO
tracked just off the first flight near the inside racing to the backstretch but retreated early. ZANFORCE tracked off the second flight outside foes in the openig
half, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and soon gave way.

Footnotes
SWEET BLINDNESS raced midfield early, settled back near the rear outside of SIMPLY FAST past the five eighths, was pushed along to improve four wide
on the turn, came into the lane four wide under a drive, sustained her rally, and drive clear in the final sixteenth. TRIPLE SCOUT tracked the leading pair,
bid three wide past the three eighths, came three wide into the lane, kept on under a drive but proved no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. SIMPLY
FAST settled in second last, was pushed along while saving ground on the turn, was taken five wide in upper stretch, and made mild improvement to prove
best of the rest. DUSTY MILLER tracked the leader down the backstretch, was pushed along two wide on the turn to bid outside the pacesetter, loomed
outside her from the three eighths, and weakened in the final furlong. LADY MAGNA quickly cleared to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn,
was confronted by DUSTY MILLER and TRIPLE SCOUT to her outside past the three eighths, kept on under a drive to midstretch, and emptied out.
PIERETTE settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, took closer order under a drive in upper stretch but ultimately never threatened.

interest while outkicked for the place honors. LADY WARRIOR, urged to dispute the pace racing a bit off the rail into the turn, dueled between foes into

YOU'RE KILLIN ME settled at the inside of the rear group, was pushed along in the two path on the turn, improved position past the three eighths, was
taken five wide in upper stretch, rallied under a drive, found his best in the final furlong, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. DURANGO KID settled three
wide in the rear group, was pushed along in the four path on the turn, improved past the three eighths, swung five wide into the lane, was pushed out
another path when YOU'RE KILLIN ME was taken out in upper stretch, rallied, was forced out again in the final sixteenth by MAY WE ALL, and kept on for
the place nonetheless. I'M CORFU was lightly bumped by MAY WE ALL in the opening strides, attended the pace four wide early, went on to dispute the
pace outside of BEST YOU EVER SEEN on the turn and into the lane, shook off that foe near the furlong pole, kept on despite drifting out and forcing MAY
WE ALL out as a result, and lost the place late. MAY WE ALL came out in the opening strides and bumped I'M CORFU lightly, attended the pace three wide
early, tracked the leading flight three wide through the turn, was taken four wide into the lane, kept on under a drive, was carried out by I'M CORFU in the
final furlong and forced DURANGO KID out late as a result, and was outfinished. BEST YOU EVER SEEN pressed the early pace outside of MIND
TRAPPE, disputed the pace inside of I'M CORFU through the turn and into the lane, and weakened in the final furlong. RIV raced between horses in the
rear group early, settled at the rear into the turn, trailed in the three path, and mustered no bid. MIND TRAPPE was placed on the lead, set a pressured
pace to the half mile mark, tracked the leading pair through the turn as BEST YOU EVER SEEN and I'M CORFU went on to dispute the pace, tracked while
saving ground around the bend, was urged into the lane when a hole opened up between BEST YOU EVER SEEN and the rail, but had no response and
weakened.

Footnotes
SERTOMAN, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the far turn, moved to challenge nearing upper stretch and continued under
stout right handed pressure to wrest the advantage from that foe nearing the wire. PLEASANT MOON, urged to the lead along the inside racing to the
backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn, grudgingly resisted the winner but came up second best. SHELL FIRE, urged to a
position between foes in second flight tracking the pacesetter into the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the lane and finished evenly late while
prevailing for a share. RUNNINGFROMTHEFEDS, raced three deep between rivals to the backstretch as part of the second flight, angled inwards on the
backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes into the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and finished evenly late. ANDREAS
settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then split foes in the closing stages to gain some position. DIAMOND DAVE
threw his head at the start, settled outside foes to the far turn, split foes three deep racing into upper stretch but passed only tiring rivals. BEAR TRAPPE
tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the far turn but offered no rally. TALKING ZIP, urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter in the opening half, steadily faded into the stretch. JUSTENUFFTUFF tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was
caught four wide racing into the far turn and lacked a rally. SON OF POSEIDON, caught four wide racing into the first turn, tracked off the second flight
through the backstretch and emptied out nearing upper stretch. ALPHA BOY hopped at the start while bumping slightly and dropped out early.

Footnotes
WHAT'S UP DUDE hopped slightly at the break, was bumped by NUCLEAR OPTION in the opening strides, settled well behind the leading trio, chased in
the three path on the turn, drew closer past the three eighths, forced FIREMAN OSCAR out in upper stretch while swinging four wide, sustained his rally,
came in and bumped NUCLEAR OPTION with a furlong to go, battled with FIREMAN OSCAR in the final furlong, came out, bumped, and brushed with
FIREMAN OSCAR late under left handed urging, and proved narrowly best. FIREMAN OSCAR settled inside of WHAT'S UP DUDE while well behind the
leading trio early, continued in second last in the two path on the turn, took closer order past the three eighths, was taken out four wide in upper stretch and
forced further out when WHAT'S UP DUDE swung out, sustained his rally, battled outside of WHAT'S UP DUDE in the final furlong, was bumped late when
WHAT'S UP DUDE came out under left handed urging, brushed with that foe late after being bumped, kept on gamely but was narrowly outfinished.
DEVILEYE was unhurried to the three eighths, began to improve in the two to three path on the turn, sustained his rally inside in upper stretch, slipped
through between STRONG WILL and the rail approaching the furlong mark, came out past the furlong mark and bumped STRONG WILL, and was
outfinished. NUCLEAR OPTION came out and bumped WHAT'S UP DUDE in the opening strides, was sent for speed between horses, pressed the early
pace, dueled two wide from the five eighths, around the turn, and into the lane, was swallowed up by the closers midstretch, got bumped at the furlong pole
when WHAT'S UP DUDE came in, and weakened. STRONG WILL set the early pace while pressured by NUCLEAR OPTION, dueled inside of that foe from
the five eighths while well clear of the rest of the field, was swallowed up midstretch, was lightly bumped near the eighth pole by NUCLEAR OPTION after
WHAT'S UP DUDE came in, took up when bumped by DEVILEYE past the furlong mark when he came out, took up, and faded. OIL MONEY attended the
early pace three wide, tracked the leading pair three wide on the turn, was urged in the six path into the lane, but had no response and weakened. THERE
WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SENSE OF SELF broke out bumping a rival, was quickly righted to dispute the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage
racing into the stretch and held sway to the end under firm handling. LOGI, forwardly placed along the rail tracking just off the leaders racing to the bend,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly to edge rivals for the place honors in the final stages. GOLDEN LILY settled off the second flight while
angling inwards racing to the bend, split foes just off the inside in late stages while making belated progress and edged rivals for a share. HENRYS GIRL
tracked just off the second flight racing five wide into the bend, steadily gained position in that path racing into upper stretch but was outkicked for a share.
MS KELA TIME settled off the second flight outside foes, angled six wide racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance but had no final kick. RARE
ACTION ATTACK, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight between foes to the turn, faded on the turn, then shifted five wide racing through the lane
while regaining some position late. CAROLINA BEAST tracked just off the first flight three deep racing into the bend, advanced in that path nearing upper
stretch, exchanged some contact with G CITY WARRIOR leaving midstretch while being steadied momentarily and had no final response. G CITY
WARRIOR angled inwards to force the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, faded in upper stretch while exchanging bumps with
CAROLINA BEAST and soon emptied out. LADY OF LAHTI settled off the field while switching out early and failed to menace. HOOK HER UP trailed
throughout.
