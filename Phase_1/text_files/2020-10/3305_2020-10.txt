Footnotes
FIRSTCADETE sprinted clear soon after the start, widened the advantage unchallenged, and coasted in under a mild drive. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO
bumped with GABRIELLA SUNSHINE for several strides after the start, pursued the winner throughout, stayed on his left lead and was clearly second best.
ALTMAN chased inside to the top of the stretch, faded and was just able to salvage the show. WATER CAY was no factor inside. HE AIN'T NO SAINT was
finished after a half-mile. GRAY SOL ran off with the rider in the warmups, bumped with GABRIELLA SUNSHINE for several strides after the start, and was
done early three wide. BROKEN CODE showed little inside. GABRIELLA SUNSHINE hit the right side of the gate coming out, got jostled around between
GRAY SOL and TIMEWON'TLETME GO for several strides after the start, and dropped far back after a half.

Footnotes
GRAN ETIQUETA was outrun early inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, and kicked in near the sixteenth-pole to overhaul the leaders from outside.
WORDS OF DEVINE raced close up early, bid outside TREVESS into the turn, came away with the lead going past the quarter-pole, could not handle the
winner in deep stretch but ran on willingly. TALKTHETALK was never far back, had aim outside the leaders in the three-path turning for home, but was
outfinished. TREVESS vied inside SHES ONE MAD MOMMA through the first quarter-mile, went clear into the turn, got hooked from outside by WORDS
OF DEVINE, battled with that rival to upper stretch, and weakened in the final furlong. BROADWAY CAT failed to menace four wide. SHES ONE MAD
MOMMA stumbled at the start, showed speed outside TREVESS to the turn, and gave way. MS BIG SPRING bumped with ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA at the
start, showed brief speed outside, and dropped back on the turn. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA bumped with MS BIG SPRING at the start, and retired early.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN KITTEN was keyed up early saving ground near the back, advanced steadily four wide after six furlongs, rallied determinedly and was up
outside TAILADIOS in time. TAILADIOS stayed close toward the inside for six furlongs, moved out to the three-path with a bid into the stretch, pulled clear
with a furlong to go, drifted out late and could not deny the top one. STRICT VOW was outrun to the top of the stretch near the inside, moved out and
finished well. NOBLE MARIA stayed in range three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid final response. KARENINA was never far back, moved in
approaching the quarter-pole, bid along the rail turning for home, but flattened out. CAPELINE vied up front outside AVOCADO TOAST early, moved inside
up the backstretch, stayed on to upper stretch, and gave way late. JEANIE'S ANGEL was no factor. LA VIEXA raced in the second flight throughout, and
lacked a response. TELL ME MAUX was never prominent. BIZNESS BEAUTY was always outrun. AVOCADO TOAST contested the pace for six furlongs,
and faltered. KISSES FOR TIZZY moved up mildly after a half-mile, then gave way.

Footnotes
SLASHING took command after the start and rated along through an even early tempo, widened the advantage around the far turn a bit off the rail, and was
kept to pressure to the finish. GRAN RUNNER raced four wide early, advanced approaching the stretch in the three-path, and rallied into second without
threatening the winner. BIG CITY RED was outrun for six furlongs, moved to the far outside through the furlong grounds, and offered a mild response. FIGO
failed to menace through an even effort. ANDRES EDUARDO prompted the pace for six furlongs, and faded in the stretch. DISTORTED LIMITS raced three
wide early, and never factored. CONFUCIO stayed close early three wide, and was finished after a half-mile.

Footnotes
SHEA D SUMMER pursued DEM A WONDER from outside into the turn, challenged for command after a half-mile, stayed on task through a long drive and
edged away late. DEM A WONDER sped clear early inside, fought back when confronted by SHEA D SUMMER approaching the quarter-pole, drifted out on
her left lead in the stretch, and yielded. FRANKLY MY DEAR saved ground around the turn and into the stretch, and finished evenly. SPECIAL PRINCESS
had the two-path turning for home, and lacked a solid response. KHOSEA was no factor. BETH'S DREAM tired three wide after a half-mile. ISLA BONITA
steadied at the start, and was never close. TOO BLESSED was outrun inside. LIL GRACE was through early. ONE NIGHT STAND reared at the start, and
raced far back. UNDENIABLY showed early speed, and dropped back on the turn three wide to four wide.

Footnotes
GRAN OLD PARR broke alertly, pressed the pace outside KING'S CASTLE and FANTASIZING, poked a head in front at the top of the stretch, edged away
into the final furlong, and had enough to repel two late challengers. HERO OF THE HOUR went along behind the leading trio around the turn, finished
gamely and just missed outside rivals. MOON PISTOL stayed in range three wide to the lane, bid outside GRAN OLD PARR in deep stretch, could not get
by and was nipped for second in the last strides between horses. FRANCO'S TEAM broke slowly, came wide outrun past the quarter-pole, rallied between
horses near the sixteenth-pole and was going well to the finish. HYDRAULIC was outrun early, and gained mildly through the final stages. MY
BROTHERSLEDGE cut the corner into the stretch, and lacked the needed bid on the rail. FANTASIZING dueled between horses to the stretch, and gave
way past the eighth-pole. YOUNG RAYMOND was no factor. SAINT BENEVOLENCE was never prominent. KING'S CASTLE contested the pace inside
rivals to the stretch, and faltered. ICE PEAK was outrun inside.

Footnotes
GEGE CONQUEST sped to the front early, showed the way a bit off the rail to the stretch, stayed on his left lead and faced no dangers under a drive.
BEASTER was outrun for a half-mile, came wide off the turn, and rallied to get up for the place outside rivals. SIDARTH got clobbered from both sides at the
start by PAPA HONOR and PARTY OF NO, saved ground advancing into the stretch, and rallied mildly on the fence for the show. MINDSHIP Q chased
inside early, bumped with MONDAY'S WITH MIKE heading into the turn, moved out continuing to pursue GEGE CONQUEST through the lane, weakened
late and was overhauled from both sides. PARTY OF NO broke in bumping SIDARTH solidly, advanced around the turn four then five wide, but flattened out
into the lane. MONDAY'S WITH MIKE bumped with MINDSHIP Q and steadied out of tight quarters between horses into the turn, moved inside past the
quarter-pole still in range, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. DREAMING THOUSAND chased between horses early, and gave way three wide
at the top of the stretch. PAPA HONOR broke out slamming into SIDARTH and was left reeling from the exchange, and never reached contention. THE
METHOD fanned wide coming off the turn at the back, and remained outrun. SILVER DOLLAR CITY advanced mildly on the turn three to four wide, could
not sustain the rally and dropped back.
