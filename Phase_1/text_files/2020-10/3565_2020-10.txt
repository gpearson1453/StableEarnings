NEXT set the pace from the outset, was off the rail into the lane then shot away from foes and drew off down the lane while ridden out to the wire.
EUCHARIST stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. LIKE THE KING tracked the pace
early on, was under a full drive along the far turn, was off the rail into the lane and empty in the stretch drive. TEXAS RULE was fractious in the gate during
the pre-start, raced back early on, was off the rail into the lane and moved up in the stretch. RICHIESGOTGAME was never a threat. HENDRICK was
steadied along the first turn and through after a half. REALLY SLOW done early.

LOVE OF MY HEART was slow at the start, chased the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, took over command in the stretch, drew clear
near the eighth pole and held sway in the final stages. WEST BANK BABY stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and slowly gained on
the winner in the final stages. TAILORBESWIFT dueled early along the inside, stayed on the inside into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run.
SHELLEY'S GEM trailed the field early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. KAY BEE GEE was slow at the start then
was rushed up and dueled early on, raced off the rail into the lane and gave way down the lane. PICK UP THE FONE threw her head at the start and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
JOE FRAZIER stalked three wide and outside of the leading duelers, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, drew clear
approaching the furlong pole, and widened under driving pressure. SABUDA chased while close to the pace in the two path and just behind the leader,
tipped four wide passing the quarter pole to take aim on JOE FRAZIER, forged place from inner foes while that foe kicked away at the furlong pole, then
held that position to the wire. WELLMAN settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted three wide turning for home, tipped in as SABUDA shifted out
approaching the three sixteenths pole, then altered back out passing the furlong pole to split foes four wide passing the sixteenth pole, and surged
approaching the wire, but missed place. KOUFAX tracked from midpack in the two to three path, tipped to the four path at the five sixteenths pole to be
outside of the leaders, but was floated five wide in upper stretch, and flattened out through the final furlong. FIVE DREAMS raced far off of the pace, shifted
seven wide through midstretch, but failed to factor. CANE CREEK ROAD dueled for the lead inside of foes, vied after being headed turning for home, but
proved no match for the leader approaching the furlong pole, and got outfinished for minor rewards in the late stages. FLAGS UP dueled for the lead two
wide, but was headed by an outer foe in upper stretch, and subsequently gave way. SAMURAI PRINCE saved ground in midpack, but never got involved,
and tired. GET TO KNOW ME broke outwards, raced far off of the pace in the four to five path around the turn, and never got involved. HICKORY HIGH was
off slowly, trailed throughout, and got outrun.

WILLISTON WAY dueled for the lead along the inside, held an advantage around the turn before digging in inside of AMERICAN MANDATE in upper
stretch, sustained the duel after being headed in midstretch, quickly regained even terms passing the furlong pole, held resolutely, and prevailed.
AMERICAN MANDATE vied two wide and between horses, produced a bid and commenced a duel passing the quarter pole outside of WILLISTON WAY,
forged a narrow advantage approaching the furlong pole, but got re-headed by his inner counterpart passing that marker, and was outgamed to the wire.
SHARED LEGACY raced far off of the pace in the five path, advanced mildly turning for home, forged show outside of rivals passing the furlong pole while
hanging on his left lead, and willingly held that position. MUNN PASSAGE lied forwardly placed in the four path around the turn, inched closer turning for
home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with inner foes in upper stretch, and flattened out. EQUAL JUSTICE raced far off of the
pace two wide, shifted five wide in midstretch, and passed tired foes without menacing. PHAST PHAROAH was crowded at the start, settled off of the pace
in the two path, advanced to striking range turning for home, but failed to produced a bid in upper stretch before weakening. NETTLETON was off a step
slow and got brushed by an inner foe at the start, then trailed along the inside and failed to factor. BIARRITZ saved ground in midpack, but weakend through
the final furlong. LIVING VICARIOUSLY broke outwardly, dueled for the lead outside of a pair of foes while under a steady urging to sustain position, chased
his inner counterpart into the turn, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
HIDDEN STASH tracked from midpack from the two path, glided outside of the trio of leaders approaching the quarter pole to bid for the lead in upper
stretch, then drew off passing the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead and needing correction from lugging in. ANTIGRAVITY perched himself outside
of the leading duo, vied outside of that pair around the far turn before forging an advantage in upper stretch as HIDDEN STASH ranged up along side, but
was headed by that foe at the furlong pole, and was second best. SWINGMAN lied close up along the inside around the first turn, stalked from the pocket
down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with outer foes in upper stretch, shifted two wide, and surpassed the tiring early pace setter for show in the
late stages. MUNQAD set the pace along the inside while feeling pressure from a pair of rivals, but was headed by foes in upper stretch, and weakened
through the final furlong. CALL PAPA saved ground around both turns while far off of the pace, and passed tired foes through the lane. JOE MAN JOE was
hard used from the gate as the rider used the crop a dozen times in the opening furlong, failed to reach forward position and was caught six to four wide in
midpack around the first turn, then failed to respond to driving pressure into the far turn, and was done early. MCDOWELL was off a step slow, tracked from
midpack in the three path around the first turn, but came under coaxing to hold position passing the six furlong pole, but failed to respond and did not play a
factor. A C EXPRESSWAY vied two wide and between horses around both turns, but failed to keep pace with those rivals turning for home, and wilted
through the lane. FLAT REWARD was off a step slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide, and got outrun.

HIS GLORY set the pace along the inside, put away an outer pressing rival with five sixteenths to run, then widened her advantage under driving pressure
through upper stretch. MISS IMPERFECTION tracked from midpack three wide, chased the leader from the four path around the far turn as that foe kicked
away, then forged place turning for home, and proved second best without threatening the winner. ALTA'S AWARD was off a step slowly and shied from an
inner foe at the start, then trailed along the inside, advanced passed tiring foes by saving ground around the far turn, and forged show in upper stretch.
LUCKY JINGLE raced off of the pace two wide, then in the five path around the far turn, but failed to make an impact. CURLS AND BOWS prompted the
leader while staying in the three path, but weakened with five sixteenths to run, and was eased through the lane. IN GOOD SPIRITS stalked along the
inside, attempted to inch forward to vie between horses approaching the five furlong pole, but came under coaxing to hold that position with nine sixteenths
to run, but failed to respond and faded around the far turn.

MANDALOUN raced far off of the pace two wide and between horses, bumped AMERICAN REVOLUTION multiple times through midstretch after shifting
four wide, then surged inside of the leader in the late stages to get up approaching the wire. BOB'S EDGE tracked from midpack two wide and between
horses, tipped four wide turning for home to bid for the lead at the three sixteenths pole, cleared off, but was tested and surpassed by an inner foe in the
final furlong. ROCKSTAR RO raced off of the pace four wide around the turn before shifting six wide turning for home, and produced a grinding rally outside
of foes through the lane. AMERICANREVOLUTION hopped at the start, raced far off of the pace in the four path around the turn, advanced turning for home
to be outside of MADALOUN while between horses in upper stretch, but was bumped multiple times by that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, was
pinched back at the furlong pole, then switched out and kept on. STARTDFROMDABOTTOM was off a bit rank, prompted the pace two wide and between
horses, but weakened through the final furlong. PLUCKY STRIKE was off slowly, trailed the field in the four to five path around the turn, then shifted eight
wide in upper stretch, and produced a mild rally. KENTUCKY PHAROAH saved ground far off of the pace, then passed tired foes. MACRON vied three
wide, but gave way between horses in upper stretch. NAME REJECTED chased from midpack along the inside, but weakened through the lane. MIDNIGHT
WARSHIP raced forwardly placed three to four wide, but weakened between horses turning for home. DEVIL'S FIRE set the pace along the inside, but was
headed at the quarter pole, and wilted through the lane. Following the race, the rider of AMERICANREVOLUTION claimed foul against the rider of
ROCKSTAR RO, but it was disallowed by the stewards
