WAR AT SUNRISE slow early, closed with a burst of speed in the eight path through the stretch and got up in the final strides. BARNACLE BILL stalked the
pace four wide for a half, made the lead two wide at the three eighths pole, set the balance of the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner.
CLYDE PARK never far back, loomed boldly in the four path approaching the top of the stretch then was outfinished. OUTTHINK'EM went evenly.
ARTAKSEZ trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. COTTONWOOD CANYON failed to menace.
ROBERT'S PRINCE was bumped start, set the early pace, remained a sharp threat into the far turn then gave way. MO TRAMP vied for the lead along the
inside and was through after a half. SLANTED TRUTH bore out at the start bumping ROBERT'S PRINCE< prompted the early pace, led briefly, had speed
into the stretch then stopped.

THREE ILLUSIONS prompted the pace two wide for five furlongs, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch while drifting
out to the middle of the racetrack under right handed urging to win as much the best. ABSOLUTE LOVE never far back, offered a mild bid in the five path
into the stretch and finished second best. COLORINCOLONEL unhurried early, finished with good courage in the four path. PAINT DAKOTA trailed for a
little over a half, improved in the six path into the stretch then leveled off. STELLAR TRICK made the lead soon after the start, set the pace for five furlongs
then wilted. HASTY LADY failed to respond. YIELD close up, was through after a half. RACINROSEMARY had brief speed.

LIMONITE matched strides for the lead along the inside into the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under a strong hand
ride. SEA THIEF battled with the winner two wide into the stretch then was no match while clearly second best. FRANCO stalked the pace along the inside
and went evenly. MANGA MAN failed to menace. BARITONE stalked the pace into the far turn then, wilted. GONE TOO SOON was outrun. GIZMO JONES
was through after a half.
