Footnotes
SWEET N WICKED set the pace into the backstretch, was joined by another to vie for the lead into the far turn, continued with a short lead through the turn
and into the lane, repelled challenger straightening into the lane then widened when put to the task. KALALOU was in the two path through the turns when
never far back, swung into the lane from the five path and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. STAGE FIVE CREEPER chased the
pace from the three path into the backstretch, continued within proximity through the far turn, angled into the six path for the drive and moved up for the
minor share while not a serious threat. BLOODY MARY MORNIN was bothered at the start when inside rival broke outward, raced in the three path into the
backstretch, continued in the three or four path through the far turn and never launched a serious bid. INDIAN FEATHER broke outwardly, hustled up to join
the leader into the backstretch, vied into the far turn while gaining a short lead, continued in contention into the lane then was empty outside the eighth pole.
BLACK NOVA was in tight at the start and was slow to get going, trailed the field into the far turn while in the four path and never responded.

Footnotes
PROPER SHE IS set the early pace on a clear lead, was joined by another to vie through the turn while two wide, continued on near even terms into the
lane, lost the lead with an eighth to go then inched up late. SALTED REVENGE vied for the lead into the turn, continued on near even terms for the top spot
into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then could not hold sway while clearly second best. QUITE A MOONGLOW was in the three path
through the turn while unhurried, came into the lane from the four path and rallied for the show spot while not a threat to the top two. NATTY NORA was in
the two path through the turn, angled into the six path into the lane, was gaining momentum near the eighth pole when stepping in under right-handed
urging, brushed rival and flattened soon after. GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS chased the pace from the four path through the turn, came int the lane from the four
path, was brushed by another near the eighth pole and weakened. GIRLYS GIFT was never a factor while near the inside. BETTING ON A HERO trailed
throughout while in the three path.
