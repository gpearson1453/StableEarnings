DREAMER'S DISEASE set a clear pace early on, widened in hand near the five sixteenths pole, was on the inside into the lane and drew away late in the
stretch under a steady drive. ULTIMATE BADGER stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run.
MEISTER tracked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. TATE chased the pace early, was on the inside
into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch. PICO D'ORO was never a factor. DROP ANCHOR steadied a bit along the first turn, was in the
three path into the lane and empty down the lane. PERFECT MISTAKE was through after a half.

INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ stalked three wide, inched closer into the turn to bid outside of a pair of foes at the three furlong pole, sustained her bid to forge an
advantage at the five sixteenths pole, cleared LADY'S ISLAND turning for home before kicking away from PALACE AVENGER in upper stretch, and
widened her margin through the final furlong under driving pressure. SNEAKING OUT stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail at the five sixteenths
pole, then four wide turning for home, and rallied through the lane to achieve place from PALACE AVENGER inside the final sixteenth. PALACE AVENGER
prompted the pace inside of a pair of foes into the turn, vied turning for home inside of INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ, but proved no match for that foe in upper
stretch, then was outfinished by a rallying rival for place in the late stages. DOS VINOS tracked the pace from the two path into the turn while outside of
SNEAKING OUT, but was floated to the four, then five, path turning for home by that foe, got outkicked by that rival in upper stretch, then leveled off and
chased evenly through the lane. ON PROBATION raced far off of the pace in the two path around the turn, and failed to factor. LADY'S ISLAND set the
pace in the two path while feeling pressure from PALACE AVENGER to her inside and INTHEMIDSTOFBIZ to her outside into the turn, but was headed by
the latter at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened between them turning for home before fading through the lane. DIVINE QUEEN was off a step slowly,
trailed the field throughout, and was outrun.

Footnotes
UNI (GB) rated kindly in midpack along the inside around the first turn, inched closer down the backstretch before tipping three wide into the far turn,
sustained her advance turning or home while being floated to the five path by NEWSPAPEROFRECORD (IRE), but took dead aim as that foe cleared in
upper stretch, reached even terms passing the furlong pole, and drove clear in the final sixteenth. BEAU RECALL (IRE) trailed the field around both turns,
came into the lane in the three path before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, then rallied outside of foes through the lane, and was gaining on the
eventual winner in the late stages while prevailing over NEWSPAPEROFRECORD (IRE) for place at the wire. NEWSPAPEROFRECORD (IRE) allowed
CRYSTAL LAKE to clear off into the first turn, stalked that foe from the two path down the backstretch while just a bit headstrong, inched closer into the far
turn to produce a bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole as UNI (GB) ranged alongside, shifted to the four path turning for home to float that foe wider,
took over and cleared off in upper stretch, but met a stiff challenge from UNI (GB) at the furlong pole, got headed by that foe at the sixteenth pole, yielded
through the closing stages, and was nailed on the wire for place. DALIKA (GER) stumbled at the start and got rank from restrained right after, raced off of
the pace in the two path while keen around the first turn, advanced to striking position from the pocket around the far turn as the field bunch up, but failed to
produce a bid through the lane. CRYSTAL LAKE was off slowly, rushed to clear the field into the first turn, opened up down the backstretch, but tired into
the far turn, saw her lead evaporate by the five sixteenths pole, then wilted through the lane.

Footnotes
ESSENTIAL QUALITY prompted the pace from the four path into the first turn, shifted down to the two path around that bend while inching forward to vie
into the backstretch, forged a narrow advantage into the far turn, kicked away from his inner counterpart on his own turning for home, then widened his
advantage under driving pressure through the lane. KEEPMEINMIND raced off of the pace along the inside around the first turn, advanced to be in range of
the leader two wide and between horses down the backstretch, came under a drive to rally passing the three furlong pole, produced a grinding kick, churned
on turning for home, and split foes at the furlong pole to edge place in the late stages while no threat to the winner. SUPER STOCK stalked along the inside,
got keen around the first bend, then saved ground behind the leaders around the far turn before shifting three, then four, wide turning for home, but leveled
off through the lane, and was outfinished by an inner foe for place. UPSTRIKER set the pace along the inside, vied inside of the eventual winner down the
backstretch, but was headed by that foe with three furlongs to run, proved no match turning for home, then faltered through the lane. FOUNDER settled off
of the pace in the four to five path, but drifted to the six path turning for home while attempting a rally, hung greenly on his left lead through the lane, and
failed to threaten. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS was pinched back at the start, saved ground while trailing around both turns, and passed tired foes along the rail
through the lane. CALIBRATE raced off of the pace two to three wide around the first turn, then three to four wide around the far turn, but failed to factor.
KING FURY tracked from midpack four wide, shifted three wide around the far turn, but tired in upper stretch. NOTARY was forwardly placed two to three
wide around the first turn, but weakened between horses around the far turn, and wilted through the lane.

IVAR (BRZ) settled off of the pace in the two path around the first turn, then took the far turn in the three path before swinging to the five path turning for
home with many lengths to find, produced a swift turn of foot approaching the furlong pole, blew past inner foes, and drove clear in the final sixteenth.
RAGING BULL (FR) trailed the field around both turns before swinging six wide turning for home, then rallied widest through the lane to reach place at the
sixteenth pole, and cut the gap on the clear leader thereafter. WITHOUT PAROLE (GB) stalked from the pocket while saving ground around both turns, but
chased the clear leader in upper stretch without making much headway, got outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong pole, then split tiring foes in the
late stages, but was outfinished for place. CASA CREED set the pace along the inside, inched clear passing the quarter pole, dug in inside of multiple foes
at the furlong pole, but was bested at the sixteenth pole and gave way. FLAVIUS saved ground from midpack, shifted to the two to three path turning for
home, but was blocked behind horses in upper stretch, brushed ANALYZE IT approaching the furlong pole while shifting out, and offered a mild late kick.
PARLOR stalked three wide, inched closer in upper stretch, but was outkicked by outer foes at the furlong pole, and flattened out. BOWIES HERO saved
ground far off of the pace before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, then passed tired foes without threatening. ANALYZE IT tracked from midpack two
wide, shifted to the three path turning for home, grinded along mildly in upper stretch, but was brushed by FLAVIUS at the furlong pole, and weakened.
BORN GREAT prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
EDGEMONT ROAD set the pace, drew clear under his own power passing the half mile pole, stayed clear around the turn before coming under coaxing in
upper stretch, but tired late, met TOUGH LOVE'S challenge in the final furlong, lasted, and won the photo via a head bob. TOUGH LOVE was forwardly
placed four wide, rallied through the lane to produce a bid inside the final furlong, but was denied missed on the wire. STRAIGHT SHOT tracked from
midpack three to two wide and between horses, swung five wide turning for home, and produced a grinding rally through the lane, but failed to make
headway on the leaders in the late stages. SIR ALFRED JAMES stalked along the inside, but chased the leader through the lane and failed to make a bid.
NIFTY was off slowly, raced far off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide in midstretch, and offered a grinding rally through the late stages.
SHASHASHAKEMEUP was off slow, advanced inside of foes to midpack down the backstretch, then saved ground around the turn, but to no avail.
SAGAPONACK stalked three wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. SAVVY raced far off of the pace four wide, and never got involved.
HIDE THE DEMON stalked two wide and between horses, but weakened turning for home. MADISON'S LUNA tracked from midpack in the five path around
the turn, shifted six wide turning for home, and tired through the lane. TANK COMMANDER hopped a bit and was off slowly, trailed the field, swung seven
wide turning for home, but was outrun.
