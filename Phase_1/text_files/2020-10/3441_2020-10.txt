Footnotes
MAXWELL ESQUIRE spotted onto the inside route in short order, flashed interest springing from the five-sixteenths pole, fanned out into path six from
upper to midstretch, closed the gap on the one to catch, out-dueled that opponent in the final sixteenth to prove best. DURESS departed the backstretch
from the three path, crept up as the half was being completed, took over after challenging in the earnest in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker,
left the eighth pole in possession of his largest advantage but with the winner bearing down hard to the outside, failed to keep pace in the last sixteenth, had
no trouble salvaging second. BOURBON CURRENCY two to three wide on the turn, angled five wide for the drive, was along for the show. FAME TO
FAMOUS hustled from the gate, brought up the back of the pack nevertheless, tipped into the two path by the top of the turn, was already being asked for
more prior to the quarter pole, got steered about seven wide from upper to midlane, made no impact. CRYOGENIC made light contact with FRENCH REEF
in the shadow of the starting gate, pursued the front runners from just off the rail on the turn, was moved out two wide stepping onto the top of the lane, gave
way. MONTAUK DADDY along the inside arguing for control with FRENCH REEF during the initial stages, was briefly shaken off, tipped to be outside the
aforementioned foe leaving the half mile pole for another go for the top, kept at it until upper stretch before backing away. FRENCH REEF (IRE) brushed at
the start, went on to secure a prominent position, vied for command two wide on the backstretch then from along the rail on the bend, came under heavy
pressure as the second fraction was being finalized, readily succumbed.

Footnotes
JOQULAR five paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn taking over command inside the half mile pole,
steadily shook away coming under light coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went four wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and was geared down in
the late stages. ROSIES SURPRISE seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. LITTLE NUTTER coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in aim of the
front, advanced tucked to the inside to take narrow and brief command at the half mile pole, got headed inside that station, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DAILY BRIEFING chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from
home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. MISS MORGANTOWN chased six then five wide under a
ride from three furlongs out, went six wide for home, weakened in the stretch. NIIJI bobbled at the break, recovered to show the way in hand four paths off
the inside, tucked to the two path and yielded command half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper
stretch and faltered. JORDY CAN TAP chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
VACAY lunged in springing from the gate, got going after being put to a brisk hand ride, departed the backstretch from path four, steadily advanced towards
the front runners, was given her cue challenging in earnest spinning into the lane, got driven to the front end with approximately a sixteenth to go, edged
clear. LA URBANA established the top shortly after the field had been sent off and running, showed the way, spaced at a slight distance from off the rail,
was put to the test by the winner heading home, surrendered with approximately a sixteenth remaining, held the place. A BIT O'IRISH SASS tracked the
pace from along the inside route, angled five wide into the stretch, secured the show. VALLARAND took up the chase from the two path, got sent out six
wide from upper to midstretch, made no impact. EXFILTRATION gathered after breaking to the outside, tucked into the two path by the conclusion of the
backstretch, travelled around the turn hand ridden, shifted out four wide for the drive, rallied mildly, appearing to just improve position. MARIA'S GIFT sat
within range three wide for the opening half, was already under a drive prior to coming into the lane, gave way. MONDEUSE sparred for control from the two
path, folded.

Footnotes
MEBS WEB contended for the top from path two, sputtered towards path four when set down for the drive home, saw a duel with the second place finisher
get ignited by the eighth pole, went at it head to head with that opponent the remainder of the journey leading up to the wire, won the bob. CRICK brought
up the back of the pack while saving ground during the initial stages, picked up interest getting maneuvered into the two path as the half was being
completed, got roused stepping onto the head of the stretch, closed in menacingly, went at it with the winner on near even terms in the last eighth, lost the
bob. SANDER'S EMPIRE away a half beat the slowest, sat parked out five wide on the turn, shifted out one path farther off the rail for the stretch run,
secured the show. EMPRESS LUCIANA four wide onto the turn, was about as wide exiting it, got outfinished for third. QUEENTIGUA pursued the pace from
the two path, went into the lane, had no response. LOVE THAT FACE two wide, was through after going a half. LEMONCELLA along the inside contending
for the top, was through after going a half. VITANZA stalked the pace three wide in midpack, wandered towards path eight backing away in upper stretch.

GONE GLIMMERING attained a forward position after an apparent clean getaway, prompted the second place finisher two to three wide, pilot holding
something in reserve during the run around the bend, was about three wide when given her cue entering the stretch, whittled away at the deficit, got nudged
to the outside by a wayward OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE from between the eighth pole and the sixteenth marker, saw an end to that erratic action come about
after going shoulder to shoulder with the nemesis for a couple of jumps, took charge soon afterwards and edged clear. OUR CIRCLE OF LOVE retained the
advantage after outbreaking the competition by a narrow margin, showed the way, well rated and with the top one in attendance from the outside, swung
approximately two wide into the stretch, and after settling in, was called upon for more, desperately clutched a slim lead after finishing off the run through the
furlong grounds, came out for the next sixteenth, taking GONE GLIMMERING along for the ride, failed to protect the lead, stayed on well to save second.
SECURE CONNECTION went over to the inside, saved ground until the end of the bend, got driven into path four heading home, won the fight for the show.
SLIMEY under encouragement right from the get-go, pursued the front runners from path two, was under a hard drive making its way on the turn, got sent
out five wide from upper to midstretch, lost the battle with SECURE CONNECTION for third. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL three wide onto the turn, appeared
through after going a half.

KEY BISCAYNE at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, argued as the outermost of a trio from path four for a good portion of the opening
three-quarters, shifted inward to go at it one on with PANDAMOM afterwards, was switched over to a drive in the general area of the five-sixteenths marker,
turned into the lane, drew off. WICKED AMBER departed the backstretch four wide, pursued the pace being hand urged on the turn, was moved one path
closer to the rail after coming into the lane, rallied mildly to procure the place. PANDAMOM remained stationed in the two path after the start, was forced to
contend inside a pair of opponents for the top for almost six furlongs, was out-fought by the winner late on the bend, got roused angling five wide into the
stretch, backed away. PURE RHYTHM took the inside route until the conclusion of the backstretch, tipped towards path two at the top of the turn, was still
there entering the stretch, never made her presence felt. UNA LUNA in path three, was the middle member of a threesome vying for the lead for the opening
three-quarters, wandered six to seven wide into the lane in retreat.
