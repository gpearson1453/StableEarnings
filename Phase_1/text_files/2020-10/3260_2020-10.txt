Footnotes
IMPAZIBLE DONNA sparred for control matched up with MUNNINGS MUSE just about from the get-go, was held well in hand going about the task from
path three during the run around the bend, settled onto the head of the stretch and was given her cue, poked a head down in front by the beginning of the
final furlong after a grueling fight, saw the runner up slice into the margin belatedly, but held on well enough to hold sway. WASP unhurried two to three
wide, got sent out five wide from upper to midlane to obtain optimal racing clearance, closed in late, missed. BEAUTIFUL KAREN tracked the front runners
from the pocket, cut the corner into the lane with usable clearance along the rail corridor, disdained it and got committed to a maneuver to the outside
instead, wound up a bit more than three wide by midlane, flattened out. MUNNINGS MUSE was rated towards the two path going at it one on one with the
winner, got set down approaching the quarter pole, relinquished reluctantly during the ensuing furlong, weakened. MISTY TASTE took up the chase from
path two, was in the same one coming into the lane, had no offering. CALIDAD strung out four wide on the turn, was through after going a half.

Footnotes
GENERALONAMISSION just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths as the field took closer order on the once
well clear leader, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside closing well to overthrow the front inside the sixteenth pole, then inched away to the
finish to prevail. NOBLE MISCHIEF got taken in hand off the heels of a rival shortly after the start and was shuffled back to late, chased five paths off the
inside from the tail of the field early on, advanced to mid pack before tucking four wide through the far turn, offered up a bid sweeping into contention
five-sixteenths from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take command briefly a sixteenth from home, before being
overtaken by the aforementioned foe in the final strides to the finish. WHICHWAYTOMALIBU coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace just off the inside from
afar leading the main body of the field minus the spurting away leader, advanced in tandem with the field on the leader to take command inside the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat, got caught near the sixteenth marker and kept on to preserve the show
honors. RINGGOOD four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, kept on to the finish but was
outfinished. Z'FINALE chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and made no late headway.
SUPPLY SIDER chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home, offered up a bid and passed tired foes.
BIELEFELD was taken in hand off the heels of WHATS IN IT FOR ME shortly after the start, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home,
came under urging near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid before flattening out in the late stages.
YOUSAIDHELLO three then two wide in pursuit, tucked inside nearing the half mile pole and was steadied in tight inside of NIGHTSPOT then got shuffled
briefly back behind that rival before able to tip two to three wide into the turn, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung six to seven wide into
upper stretch and made no headway. NIGHTSPOT chased three to four wide in pursuit forwardly placed among the main flight, got shaken off and began to
retreat nearing the far turn tucking to the inside which in turn forced YOUSAIDHELLO to steady in behind and get shuffled back, faded through the bend,
spun just off the inside for home and faltered. WHATS IN IT FOR ME coaxed from the gate, spurted away on the lead just off the inside, widened away
down the backstretch to a commanding advantage, began to get a bit leg weary near the midway point on the far turn as the field advanced with a rush
from, in behind, got overhauled inside the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and readily gave way.

Footnotes
FOXTAIL briefly engaged with GRACEFUL PRINCESS for control, saw that opponent ease back, got guided over to the inside route, rated well showing the
way on a loosely-contested advantage, arrived at the three-sixteenths marker and got asked for her best, gave the desired response to stay comfortably in
the clear. JENNEMILY tracked the winner from the pocket, was put to a ride approaching the five-sixteenths marker, angled out in front of GRACEFUL
PRINCESS late on the bend, with less than sufficient space separating them, leading the pilot of the aforementioned rival to check the mount, settled in path
two at the top of the lane and went after the top one in earnest, was up to task at hand. OVERJOYED took up the chase three wide on the turn, was in the
same one heading home, lacked the necessary response. INDY UNION proceeded along the chute sluggishly after getting off to an awkward start,
continued to hug the rail all the way to the end of the bend, got moved out three wide for the stretch run, made no impact. GRACEFUL PRINCESS disputed
the pace with the winner early before being taken back after the first fraction had been finalized, was in path two between rivals on the turn, had already
backed away a tad when forced to steady by the maneuvering JENNEMILY nearing the quarter pole, stepped into lane, never regained interest. OFF TOPIC
three wide entering the turn, was a path farther off the rail exiting it, had no rally.

NOBLE THOUGHT four paths off the inside in the early stages, tucked inside with six furlongs to run, remained saving ground through the far turn coming
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for home, tipped out a path straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge through the final
furlong advancing in tandem with LUCKY RAMSEY, got bumped by that rival inside the eighth pole, collared the leader a sixteenth out between foes, then
dug in gamely to fend off the runner up to the finish. LUCKY RAMSEY five to six paths off the inside early on, tucked to chase four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final eighth bumping the aforementioned foe lightly inside the eighth
pole, fought on gamely to the finish but was ultimately denied by a nostril. SIDING SPRING chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat from a pair and was caught a sixteenth
from home, kept on preserve the show honors. CATCH A CAB three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went six wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. ANOTHER coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a furlong out, weakened in the late going. HONORABLE HERO chased
along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the late stages. GIO D'ORO two to three
wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, weakened in the stretch.
COLTANDMISSISSIPPI four then three wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

KUMAR away well, secured a prominent position, hitched up to the front runners coming up to the five-eighths marker, disputed the pace from path two as
the middle member of a threesome from that station until the end of the bend, got set down for the drive home, edged clear of the competition, then stayed
so, kept to the task at hand. GRIT AND GLORY unhurried taking up the chase two wide, became caught in traffic as three-quarters was being completed,
continued to idle behind a wall of opponents after stepping into the stretch, got maneuvered into the six path thus attaining racing room in midstretch, rallied
for the place. SARATOGA PAL took up position in midpack after bobbling at the break, departed the backstretch from path four, got moved out seven wide
from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all, closed in to be along for third. STRIKING SPEED kept an eye on the pace from the pocket, slithered
three wide entering the stretch, flattened out late. ADVANCE NOTICE remained forwardly placed after out-breaking the field, found itself in path three,
contending as the outermost of three beginning from around the five-eighths pole, kept at it until the head of the stretch, weakened in the last eighth.
MACHO JACK pursued the pace three wide on the turn, got steered out into path five for the drive, lacked a closing punch. FRIED RICE KING two wide
stepping onto the turn, was one wider stepping into the lane, made no impact. SNEAKINESS involved for the lead to the inside of ADVANCE NOTICE early,
cut over to the rail, argued for control against a pair of foes positioned to his outside, saw the winner begin to assert himself at the third fraction was being
posted, remained prominently placed for a little longer then backed away. LOST IN ROME pinched at the start, rated unkind by pulling hard on the bit for a
good portion of the initial half, went over to the rail approaching the half mile pole, was never heard from again. TIKHVIN FLEW out in the middle of the strip
during the journey leading up to the top of the turn, was four wide coming onto it, took some bad steps making his way to midpoiint, got eased to the outside
after losing his best action, got pulled up, was subsequently vanned off, having suffered an apparent injury.

Footnotes
PLUM ALI away in good order, worked her way over to the hedge, narrowed the gap between calls on the backstretch, then continued to do so after
stepping onto the far turn, picked up interest slipping to be outside CALDEE as six furlongs was being completed, turned into the lane on near even terms
with the previously-mentioned foe, pilot holding something in reserve but with the other having been called upon for more by this juncture, had the rider go to
work in the vicinity in the three-sixteenths pole, forged to the front, shook free in the final sixteenth under good handling. CALDEE brushed with MASHNEE
after losing her footing springing from the starting gate, grabbed the advantage, showed the way from path two, pulling a bit on the bit, became more
professional by midway on the backstretch, inched her way onto the inside route, saw the top one get taken to the outside at the five-sixteenths marker, got
set down a sixteenth later with that one directly abreast, relinquished despite putting up a good fight from upper to midstretch, narrowly saved second.
EDITOR AT LARGE (IRE) took up the chase from path two, shifted over to the hedge for a respite late on the second bend, got cued up back on the move
to the outside heading for the top of the lane, drafted behind the winner before tipping into path three in the general area of the three-sixteenths marker,
proved no match for the winner, missed the show. MASHNEE GIRL went on to save ground after making light contact with the second place finisher in the
shadow of the starting gate, angled three wide into the lane, lacked the needed offering then ventured on to the finish line under light urging. DIRECTOR'S
CUT kept the runner up company for three-quarters, primarily from path two, stepped into the lane appearing to have little left, then was allowed to fade
away, lightly encouraged.

HOROLOGIST away well and to the front, settled in hand in closest aim of the leader, got shaken off by that rival and chased in closest range four then
three wide down the backstretch isolated between the spurting leader and a pair in behind, dropped back through the turn patiently handled before coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to
prevail. POINT OF HONOR three then two wide in pursuit from the tail of the well spread out compact field, tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under
coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish to be along clear for the place honors.
DUNBAR ROAD four wide in pursuit down the backstretch and through the far turn, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper
stretch, offered up a mild bid to the eighth pole and flattened out through the final furlong. LETRUSKA broke out at the start and was corrected, came under
coaxing to establish the front shortly after and showed the way in hand just off the inside, spurted away down the backstretch opening up a commanding
lead through swift splits, got lightly coaxed along nearing the quarter pole as the remaining trio took closer order, cornered just off the inside for home leg
weary, got overhauled at the three-sixteenths and backed away to the finish.

WET YOUR WHISTLE light bumped in the shadow of the starting gate, motored up to the front end on the backstretch, tucked back into path two and led
the way on a loosely-contested lead, struck the three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, kicked clear. CHEWING GUM underwent a ground-saving
journey, cut the corner into the lane and went on to rally for second. ARCHIDUST pinched in the shadow of the starting gate, took up the chase three wide
on the turn, fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, straightened away then mustered up a good kick to be along for the show. FOG OF WAR
brushed shortly after the start, made it into the two path by the commencement of the run around the bend, angled five wide after entering the stretch,
missed third. HOLIDAY STONE took the inside route, got maneuvered in the two path at the three-sixteenths marker, failed to fire appreciably. BATTLE
STATION taken in hand and moved wider as the rider-less rival went by coming up to the half mile pole, was in the three path springing from that station,
went one path farther off the rail for the drive home, had no rally. BIG WONDER got bumped after bobbling shortly after the field had been sent on its way,
was taken hold and guided to the outside as the horse without a rider arrived on the scene late on the backstretch, went into the three path by the top of the
turn, got sent out approximately seven wide during the stretch run, backed away. BACKTOHISROOTS lost his rider after stumbling right after the start.
Following a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the start of the race, the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
PHANTOM SMOKE three then two wide in pursuit from just off the duel, came under coxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied
to take command at the eighth pole, dug in tussling briefly with SANDOR CLEGANE before inching away to the finish. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS got
bumped at the start by SANDOR CLEGANE due to pressure from DEE BO breaking inwards, chased just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside half a
mile from home coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors
battling to the finish with COTTON to his inside. COTTON four paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to close in concert with
the aforementioned foe and was along for the show honors. SANDOR CLEGANE got bumped at the start by the inwards breaking DEE BO and in turn
bumped DANZIGWITHTHESTARS, dueled four then three wide with DATA DEAL to his inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took slight
advantage over that rival before spinning two to three wide for home, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, fought on latched on to near the
sixteenth marker, then kept on to preserve the last major share. BOSS BEAR turned his head to the off side as the latch was sprung and veered out at the
start conceding two to three lengths to the front, crossed to chase three to four wide from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six
wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. IWO JIMA got bumped between foes at the start due to mostly pressure from DATA DEAL breaking
outwards and was taken in hand briefly conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide from near the rear, came under a ride three
furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. DATA DEAL broke out at the start bumping DECLARE
JUSTICE into IWO JIMA and in turn BE YOURSELF, dueled from the two path with SANDOR CLEGANE to his outside, tucked inside half a mile from home
and held a slight advantage, got put to coaxing nearing the quarter pole and was headed for command, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. BE YOURSELF got bumped at the start and was steadied in behind PHANTOM SMOKE who crossed over and conceded
three to four lengths to the front, chased four wide from near the rear down the backstretch and through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went
six wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. DEE BO broke in at the start bumping SANDOR CLEGANE into DANZIGWITHTHESTARS,
chased four then three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered four wide at the head of the stretch and tired. DECLARE JUSTICE got
bumped between foes at the start due to the pressure from the outwards breaking DATA DEAL and was steadied off the heels of that rival conceding three
to four lengths to the front, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under a ride at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home and
made no impact.
