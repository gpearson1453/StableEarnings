Footnotes
AUSTIN'S BOY bobbled slightly at the start, had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away in upper stretch and drew clear under a left handed crack
of the whip and good handling then a long hold late. ZERO DOWN dueled between horses then stalked a bit off the rail on the turn and into the stretch,
drifted in late and was second best. SQUALOTORO hopped some in a bit of a slow start, settled off the rail then angled in leaving the backstretch, came out
leaving the turn and three deep into the stretch, lugged inward in midstretch then angled to the inside and edged a rival for the show. KING ARTHUR dueled
four wide then outside the winner on the turn, drifted out into the stretch and was edged for third. PERFECT AFFECTION prompted the pace three deep
between foes then stalked three wide on the turn, came into the stretch four wide and weakened. BLUE BLITZ hopped slightly in a bit of a slow start, stalked
outside a rival then between foes on the turn, angled to the inside in the stretch and did not rally. WORLD O LUCK a bit slow to begin, chased inside then
just off the rail, came out some in the stretch and lacked a rally. EQUIPO A saved ground stalking the pace, dropped back into the stretch and gave way.

handed urging and a vigorous hand ride. RAGER saved ground chasing the pace, also came out into the stretch and again in upper stretch, was three wide
in deep stretch and got up for the place. ROOKIE MISTAKE a bit slow to begin, chased outside a rival then a bit off the rail on the turn, swung three deep
into the stretch, was between foes in late stretch and edged the pacesetter for third. BULLETPROOF ONE had good early speed and dueled inside, inched
clear on the turn, fought back along the rail in midstretch and was outfinished for a minor share late. AIR FORCE JET (GB) prompted the pace three deep
then stalked on the turn, angled in outside a rival into the stretch and weakened. BIG RETURNS dueled between horses, stalked just off the rail then
