Footnotes
WEAR MY RING hustled from the starting gate, cut over to the rail after establishing the top, showed the way, coaxed along and with I'M FINE in
accompaniment from the outside, continued along under the same set up for over three-quarters, got called upon for more a short distance from the quarter
pole, turned into the lane challenged in earnest by the earlier-mentioned opponent, got headed after drifting out towards the middle of the strip in midlane,
fought on tenaciously, by this juncture with the runner up having boldly arrived on the scene, to re-claim the top then dug in to preserve it. MICROMILLION
underwent a three wide journey to the end of the second bend, inched up to the ones to catch springing from the three-eighths pole, got cued up after
settling in upper stretch, maintained the momentum despite shifting out six wide during the ensuing furlong, battled as the widest of three front runners from
the eighth pole onward, came up snort. I'M FINE prompted the winner from the two path, well rated for nearly three-quarters, was let loose spinning into the
lane, shied out several paths in response to the errant ways of the top one at the furlong grounds, vied from between rivals for the final furlong, wound up
denied. MONEYBACKGUARANTEE sat reserved two wide to the conclusion of the backstretch, tucked along the inside route at the half mile pole, tipped
back into the two path for the stretch run, lacked an offering. EYE'M GONE rode the rail, was through after going three-quarters.

CURLIN ROAD three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path and advanced through the turn to pressure the front coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away, dug in under threat to the finish and held safe to
prevail, then got pulled up after the finish and was subsequently vanned off. RUNABOUT broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch, rallied to threaten through the final furlong but was repelled through to the
finish while clear for the place honors. CANDY PROMISES established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under increasing pressure through the turn and got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, yielded
the front straightened away and weakened in the late stages. TOO FAST TO PASS five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths,
swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. LUCKY RAMSEY chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the half mile pole, got
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home and weakened. TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK chased inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. K D'S CAT BIRD chased just
off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
SUPEREGO cut over to the inside after establishing the top, rated kindly showing the way, with KILMARKNOCK in accompaniment from the two path,
edged away from the competition after finishing off the half, was heading for the furlong grounds when asked for his best, gave the desired response to stay
well in the clear. STASH MY MONEY was unhurried towards the two path during the initial stages after stumbling at the break, picked up interest after
halfway done with the backstretch, tipped outward and into path four by the half mile pole, improved, while being asked for run, swung about as wide into
the stretch, rallied well enough to be along for second. UNBRIDLED JOHN pursued the pace two wide, got guided over to the rail at the half mile pole, was
switched over to stronger handling a furlong later, swung out approximately three wide into the lane, failed to keep pace with the top one then lost out place
honors. ZIPALONG chased the pace from path two after overcoming contact with JUSTINTIMEWITWINE , got roused travelling on turn two, went into the
lane and lacked the needed response. MR. TAG saved ground to the quarter pole to no avail. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE bumped with ZIPALONG as they
were coming up to the crown of the clubhouse bend, sat strung out three wide racing around it, was one path closer to the rail by the subsequent one,
stepped into the lane and was allowed to fade away under a protective hold. KILMARKNOCK prompted the pace from the two path, failed to pick it up when
asked for more as three-quarters was being completed, came into the lane and was allowed to fade away under a protective hold.

FIGURE IT OUT bumped at the start by BLACK KETTLE who broke inwards, chased from near the rear in the three path down the backstretch, tucked
inside half a mile from home, gained a clear rail and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter portion of the bend to take
command before swinging two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth, held safe to the finish to prevail. PRIVATE BEACH
showed the way in hand three then two wide under some pressure from CAN U HANDLE THIS to the outside, had the aforementioned foe advanced up the
open rail and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got displaced from the front and spun three wide for home, ran on to chase the winner home clear
of the rest and along second best. GRACETOWN broke in the air, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. BLACK KETTLE broke in at the start bumping FIGURE IT OUT, chased four wide down the
backstretch and then from the two path through the turn coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. CAN U HANDLE THIS prompted the pace from the outside four then three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, swung three
wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ALL ABOUT REYANA came away without apparent mishap, was under some hand encouragement advancing three wide on the front runners on the turn,
struck the front by a narrow margin as the half was being completed, got turned loose spinning into the lane, kicked away to her largest advantage during
the ensuing furlong, then had enough late to hold sway. ANNOULA disputed the pace from the two path, went about it from between opponents late on the
turn, was put to stronger handling as the second split was being finalized, saw the winner open up, stayed on well for the place. KEMBA quickly spotted
along the rail, rode it for the opening half, got cued up for the drive home, was worked towards path four from upper to midlane, got outfinished. QUANTUM
COMPUTING vied for the top from along the rail, yielded when put to to the test by ALL ABOUT REYANA approaching the quarter pole, stepped onto the
head of the stretch and faltered. HELMERS RUN off about a length the tardiest, underwent a two wide pursuit, shifted over to the rail in time to cut the
corner into the stretch, had no rally. SAPUCAIA remained along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, came up empty when put to
the whip at the three-eighths pole, went into the stretch and backed away. MUSICAL THUNDER three wide onto and then exiting the turn, was never
involved. ROMA CARPE hung out three to four wide on the turn, fanned out into path five after entering the lane, venturing onward as the widest of all,
never made her presence felt.

AM IMPAZIBLE at a considerable distance from off the rail throughout, sat parked out five wide on the turn, commenced the stretch one path farther off the
inside, kicked into stride and closed the gap, forged to the front with approximately a sixteenth remaining and edged away. MARY'S GIRL pursued the pace
from path four on the turn, angled into the path five for the drive home, was one of several arriving at the eighth pole on near even terms with each other,
saw the winner take charge a sixteenth later, won the place. VIRADIA stalked the pacesetter from the two path, was called upon entering the lane, was
fighting from between opponents in midstretch, stayed on for the show. LUCKY MOVE took up the chase from the two path on the turn, fanned out into path
seven from upper to midlane, becoming the widest of all, closed in to earn the final significant slice of the purse. ELEGANT ZIP sneaked her way into the
pocket approaching the conclusion of the backstretch, kept watch on the unattended CARTWHEEL, attained clear passage along the inside corridor at the
quarter pole when the aforementioned rival moved out approximately four wide entering the stretch, argued onward as a prominent factor for the next
furlong then flattened out. MAKIN' OUT chased the pace three wide on the turn, gave way. CARTWHEEL established control in short order, was lightly hand
urged showing the way on an open lead from along the inside route, sputtered about four wide into the lane, yielded and backed away. THE GREAT
JOHANNA saved ground for the opening six furlongs, had no offering after getting tipped into the two path in upper stretch. ELEGANT JEM took the inside
route for three-quarters, came three wide into the lane appearing to have little left, faded away.

KOSCIUSZKO brushed the near side stall at the start, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong to get up in the final jumps and prevail. LEAKY CUP dueled briefly with HUSHION
before taking sole command and showing the way three then two wide, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing
threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish. HUSHION dueled briefly inside the aforementioned foe before chasing just off the inside, got coaxed
along half a mile from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. KAZMANIA chased along the inside under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, ran on through to the finish but was outkicked. DURKIN'S CALL five then four wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. CASTLE CASANOVA four then three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. DADDY KNOWS broke out at the start, chased four wide
from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, began to get out inside the five-sixteenths and went seven to eight wide into upper stretch,

Footnotes
VITESSE settled into the three path after the start, closed the gap during the run around the bend, challenged in earnest spinning into the stretch, shied in
slightly between the three-sixteenths marker and midlane, reacting to some right side stick work, took charge nevertheless and drew away. LITTLE MAZZY
stalked the pace from the two path, issued a bid as three-quarters was being reeled off, proved no match but finished well clear of the others for the place.
GEILS ROCKS disputed the pace from the two path for a good portion of the opening half, put away FORTUNE FOUND as the second fraction was being
finalized and cleared over to the inside route, was put to the test by a pair of opponents to the outside coming up to the quarter pole, succumbed and
steadily backed away. IHADADREAM briefly placed along the rail, abandoned it when JOHN WANT REVENGE went onto it himself, underwent a two wide
pursuit on the turn, got sent out four wide for the drive home, made no headway en route to securing the last major check. BAY BURNER three wide
departing the backstretch, gave way. JOHN WANT REVENGE made it over to the rail prior to reaching the end of the backstretch, sat towards the back of
pack keeping an eye on the front runners, swung two to three wide onto the top of the lane, had no offering. FORTUNE FOUND attained a forward position
after bobbling slightly losing its footing springing from the gate, got worked onto the inside route shortly after leaving the chute, contended for the top during
the opening half, retreated after getting shaken off.
