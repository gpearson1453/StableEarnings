KISS TODAY GOODBYE stalked three deep then off the rail, went around a rival on the second turn and four wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit and bid
outside the runner-up under urging a sixteenth out to gain the lead nearing the wire. DIVINE ARMOR close up stalking the early pace between foes, bid
between horses on the backstretch and second turn to gain the advantage into the stretch, inched away in deep stretch, fought back just off the rail through
the final sixteenth and was edged late. EXAULTED had speed between rivals then angled in, set the pace inside, dueled along the rail on the backstretch
and second turn and into the stretch and just held third. MASTERING four wide into the first turn, stalked three deep then bid three wide on the backstretch
and second turn and into the stretch and was edged for the show. REPROBATE a step slow to begin, settled a bit off the rail then inside, continued along
the fence into and through the stretch and lacked the needed rally. COOL RUNNINGS saved ground stalking the pace, dropped back on the second turn,
came out into the stretch and gave way. FANTASTIC DAY fractious in the post parade and warm up, dropped back inside then off the rail, fell farther back
on the backstretch, was through early and eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
PROMISE NOTHING bobbled slightly at the start, settled outside a rival then a bit off the rail, came out in upper stretch, rallied under left handed urging to
run past the pacesetter in late stretch and proved best. JAXON'S GOLDIE had good early speed and set the pace a bit off the rail, turned back a bit into the
turn, inched away inside, continued clear in the stretch but could not hold off the winner. GOLDEN VICTORY stalked outside then four wide on the
backstretch and turn and into the stretch, drifted in and edged a rival for the show. TACO WACO hopped slightly and broke slowly, was sent between
horses early, stalked off the inside then between foes into and on the turn and into the stretch, also drifted in and was edged for third. NIETZSCHE stalked
three deep between horses to the stretch, also drifted in and lacked a rally. UNMASKED angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, cut the corner into
the stretch and did not rally. PRINCE RICKY stalked outside a rival then inside, bid along the rail into the turn, continued inside on the turn and in the stretch
and weakened. GRAND SIERRA had speed three deep then stalked off the rail, continued between foes leaving the backstretch and on the turn and also
weakened. CHERRY PIE settled outside then off the rail, came a bit wide into the stretch and did not rally. GEOCAS STREET broke slowly, came off the rail
early, continued three deep on the turn and into the stretch and was not a threat. WICKED BLUE bobbled some at the start, settled inside, fell back into and
on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
K P INDY stalked a bit off the rail, bid alongside the pacesetter to take a short lead in midstretch, fought back under urging between foes in deep stretch and
held on gamely. MUCH MORE HALO stalked outside the winner then off the rail, came three wide into the stretch, bid three deep a sixteenth out then
continued willingly outside the winner but could not get by. RESTORING DREAMS came out early then angled in and sped to the lead, set the pace inside,
fought back in the stretch then could not match the top pair late but held third. EASTERN OCEAN hopped some in a slow start, went up four wide on the
backstretch and three deep on the turn and into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. MUNNINGS' PILOT threw his head and broke inward in a slow
start, went up inside, saved ground stalking the pace, steadied in tight into the turn to fall back some, continued along the rail and could not offer the
necessary response in the drive. BRAVO stalked three deep between foes then chased alongside a rival on the turn, came out into the stretch and did not
rally. DIAMOND RANGER a bit slow to begin, stalked just off the rail then between horses into and on the turn and lacked a response in the stretch. VODKA
TWIST between horses early angled in and chased inside, came out into the stretch and also lacked a further response.
