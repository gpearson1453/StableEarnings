Footnotes
RED MULE settled into a good spot behind the battling threesome up front, briefly awaited room past the quarter-pole, found an ample opening on the rail to
take over from COOL HAND COOP into the stretch, and widened with every stride under pressure. NOTHIN BUT NET was outsprinted three wide to the
stretch, and rallied outside KATARA PASS to get the place late. KATARA PASS hit the left side of the gate coming out and got bumped by SWEET RIDE,
saved ground outrun to the stretch, came off the inside rallying past the eighth-pole and was outfinished for second. SWEET RIDE broke in bumping
KATARA PASS at the start, raced evenly in the second flight and failed to menace. COOL HAND COOP dueled for the lead hounded by two pursuers,
drifted off the fence yielding to the winner at the top of the stretch, and gave way. CREEDMOOR contested the pace outside COOL HAND COOP and
FORT KING, and drifted wide weakening into the stretch. FORT KING rushed up after the start to battle up front between horses, weakened after three
furlongs and drifted wide through the lane. WARRIOR SPIRIT steadied at the start between horses, and showed nothing at the back.

Footnotes
LEO'S DIAMOND was forwardly placed out of the gate and raced off the top pair entering the turn, launched a three wide bid for command at the quarter
pole, roused three wide to a narrow advantage at the furlong marker then cleared and held on gamely. TARA rated along the rail through early going,
hustled along two wide late turn, sustained bid and shifted out wider upper stretch, finished with solid response but could not reach the winner in time.
PANAREA raced off the top two early leaders, prompted four wide at the quarter pole, raced in aim for the lead near furlong grounds then evened out.
FANCIFIED hustled along racing off the early pace, failed to advance under pressure around the turn then kept on four to five wide in the lane and had a
mild improve late. SHE ANSWERED steadied just after the start, raced in the back and quickly angled inside to save ground, shifted out and raced widest in
the lane and had a mild improve without threatening. BIBIANA pressed the pace in opening stages then dueled for the lead with OUR LITTLE DEVIL around
the turn, took on added challenger's and battled back to the furlong marker then had no late kick left in reserve. TREVESS got brushed between foes at the
start then steadied slightly in opening stages, was not too far off the pace then lacked response and weakened round the turn. OUR LITTLE DEVIL held a
slim lead out of the gate then dueled for the lead racing inside of BIBIANA, continued to battle back around the turn and top of the lane then tired in the
drive.

Footnotes
SOGLIO was covered up behind the leaders for better than six furlongs, tipped out to the four-path after straightening away for the drive, and responded to
vigorous hand urging and flashes of the whip to wear down DERBY CHAMPAGNE in the closing yards. DERBY CHAMPAGNE moved up to a stalking
position three wide up the backstretch, wrested the lead away from FACE OF VICTORY in mid stretch and edged away, but could not withstand the winner.
FACE OF VICTORY cleared to the lead before reaching the first turn, rated along through an easy opening half-mile, turned back a bid from DONJI coming
off the far turn, but began to weaken past the furlong marker on the rail. DONJI prompted the pace between horses, challenged for command after six
furlongs, could not get by the pacesetter and weakened in the two-path. COWBOY CULTURE became fractious unseating the rider prior to the start, was
backed out and reloaded, saved ground in range to the stretch and was outfinished. DIFFERENTIAL was slowest to begin, trailed within striking distance to
the stretch, and could not gain.

UNSHAKEN tracked the top trio through early stages then steadily inched way up past the half mile marker, vied four deep with three furlongs left to run,
held a slim advantage at the furlong marker then cleared on top and kept sharp. YOUNGEST OF FIVE raced off the top flight at half mile marker, prompted
five wide to go after the leader around the turn, stayed on in steady pursuit along the outside through stretch run and finished second best.
SEPTEMBERTEN was off to a good start and briefly held on top then came under attack, vied for the lead racing inside of a duo down the backstretch, took
on added challenger on UNSHAKEN and battled back around the turn and upper stretch then had no late kick left in reserve. COASTAL DEFENSE backend
bumped the gate on the way out and steadied at the start, lagged behind in opening stages, hustled along and ranged up near the quarter pole then raced
four to five wide with even response in the final furlong. QUICK STEP ED vied three deep for the early lead, continued to battle for the lead entering the turn
then failed to match at the quarter pole and faded. GROUNDBREAKING vied for the lead down the backstretch and continued into the turn then failed to
keep pace and retreated near five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
HAPPY LOUDON sprinted clear soon after the start, rated along inside through a soft half-mile, and drew away flashed the whip left-handed. NICE
ADVENTURE chased outside the winner throughout, and finished well to go clear of the others. FELONY MELANIE loaded after some reluctance,
advanced outside around the turn, and lacked the needed late bid. BUSINESSINDUBAI took up sharply approaching the quarter-pole in the two-path,
moved well out in the course for the drive and picked up the last major share with an even finish. BLAME THE STORM had a ground-saving trip within
range, and lacked the needed response. DELIA'S PRIDE lagged far back to the stretch, and passed tired horses late between foes. AWESOME FLYER
came out tossing her head briefly, stayed in striking distance three wide to the quarter-pole and faded. AZNAVOUR swung four wide off the turn and made
no headway. PAZYARMONIA checked inside FELONY MELANIE heading into the turn, and fanned out about 10 paths wide into the stretch. NO GOOD
DEED checked inside BUSINESSINDUBAI and bobbled past the quarter-pole in the second flight, and tired. MUSIC MUSIC veered out at the start getting
away behind the others, shifted out five wide leaving the turn and could not gain. FLUFFY TRUFFLE checked behind horses at the back going to the turn,
and remained far back.

Footnotes
TROPICALITY raced near the inside and rated off the top two leaders down the backstretch, launched a three wide bid on the far turn, advanced to race on
equal terms for the lead at the sixteenth pole then drew clear under a driving finish. SHANGHAISWEETHEART quickly cleared on top and led the way two
to three wide down the backstretch, continued with a clear advantage around the far turn, roused for more turning for home, dug in two to three wide under
firm handling in stretch run, briefly raced on equal terms for the lead with a sixteenth left to run then got outfinished. MYFRANCESCA settled four to five
wide off the early pace, was put to a drive entering the far turn, sustained bid and raced two wide then along inside in stretch run and secured a share. A
SONG FOR SUE raced in the last flight down the backstretch, prompted around the far turn, hustled along two to three wide in stretch run and had a mild
improve. STRONGER KAT raced off the pace and saved ground through early stages, shifted out and put to a drive six wide in the lane and had a mild
improve without threatening. PAGALO IN AVANTI stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched a bid around the turn but failed to advance then
gave way in the lane. HILLTOP HARMONY raced two wide to inside, had no response and eased up in stretch. SPECIAL FOR YOU showed response in

Footnotes
NEW YEAR advanced around the far turn swinging out four wide, rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from outside a furlong out, and kicked away on the
wrong lead. MYSTICAL MOON pursued the pacesetter from the outset, moved off the rail with a bid in the two-path turning for home, could not match the
winner's move but held on to salvage second. DIRECT APPROACH was crowded back to last at the start, trailed to the stretch, moved outside with a
belated rally and just missed the place. LOOKIN AT ROSES was bumped between SUMMER BEACH and POSITIVE PHIL going to the first turn, went
along in midpack through the middle stages, lacked room inside through upper stretch, and finished up evenly when clear past the eighth-pole. SMELL OF
ROSES set a sharp pace inside, and succumbed to challenges through the furlong grounds. POSITIVE PHIL got pinballed in the five-path between LOOKIN
AT ROSES and UNCLE CURLY going to the first turn, loomed with a three-wide run after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. UNCLE CURLY
bumped with POSITIVE PHIL out in the six-path nearing the first turn, remained wide and never reached contention. SUMMER BEACH bumped lightly with
LOOKIN AT ROSES while just inside that one nearing the first turn, chased after the pacesetter to the far turn and tired. HARD COUNT broke inward and
steadied slightly at the start, and never factored. VOLUBILE had an inside trip, and lacked room through the stretch never fully set down.

Footnotes
BELLE TAPISSERIE vied for the lead with BALANDEEN in opening stages then cleared a length on top and repelled bid from CAJUN FIRECRACKER
around the turn, put to a drive entering top stretch, stayed sharp in response under firm handling and kept clear. BALANDEEN vied for the lead with BELLE
TAPISSIERIE in opening strides then remained forwardly placed and tracked up the inside around the turn, tipped out two wide entering top stretch and
continued a solid bid for the winner. MALIBU MAX was not far off the early pace while positioned five wide, chased around the turn then continued a steady
outside bid through the lane and secured show. FRONT LOADED raced along the inside not far off the early pace, angled out a path on the turn then
switched back to the inside and needed more for late impact. CAJUN FIRECRACKER raced up close just off the leader in the opening quarter, launched a
bid for eventual winner entering the turn, raced in striking distance but could not get to rival then gave way in the lane. STONE HANDS was not far back in
opening quarter and raced four wide leaving the backstretch, prompted around the turn but failed to advance then steadily faded. STAR JUANCHO raced in
range between foes through early stages then got in tight and steadied entering the turn, lost all kick and dropped back.

BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD bumped with KIFFLE at the start, settled in the middle of the group two wide to the stretch, rallied between horses overtaking the
pacesetter a sixteenth out and held firm to the finish. BELIEVE INDEED broke slowest, moved out three wide approaching the backstretch, took closer order
with aim in the four-path coming off the far turn, and finished well outside rivals. SASSY JUSTICE tracked outside the leaders to the stretch, bid between
horses looming a late threat, but was outkicked. HOTTY TODDY saved ground unhurried early, raced two then three wide around the far turn well back,
moved out widest through the furlong grounds and gained belatedly to pick up the last major share. KIFFLE bumped with BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD at the
start, then bumped lightly with YAKO while still away alertly, set the pace inside to the stretch, and faded through the late stages. BEACH DREAMING
saved ground from the start, got shuffled back past the midway point of the far turn, moved to the two-path for the drive and advanced cautiously through
traffic not fully set down. PICASSO MOON pressed the pace outside KIFFLE to the stretch, and weakened approaching the eighth-pole. YAKO bumped with
KIFFLE after the start, and was never a threat. FAITH N HOPE tucked in off the leaders for six furlongs, and was empty through the stretch.

Footnotes
PINK LEMONADE quickly cleared on top and crossed over to the inside, widened to a clear advantage around the turn then put to a drive three to four wide
in the stretch run and kept clear. LUCK OF THE CROOK got bumped repeatedly at the start, raced near the rear in opening quarter then shifted out wider
entering the far turn, raced wide into the lane, produced a solid bid along the far outside, cut into winners margin and cleared second best. BULKCARRIER
hustled along racing behind the clear leader around the turn, pushed along under a drive four to five wide in the stretch run and prevailed for a share. KING
WADE got bumped just after the start, hustled along five wide through early stages, chased after the clear top pair around the turn then flattened in the lane.
SWEET GIANT bumped with foe at the start, raced under steady pressure, moved into upper stretch four wide and lacked the needed response for impact.
DRAMATIC KITTEN bumped repeatedly with rival at the start, was under a drive along the rail on the turn and failed to move into close contention.
SEVERUS brushed repeatedly with rival at the start, hustled along from the get-go, stayed under pressure along the inside around the turn and failed to
move into threatening range. MR STARLIGHT raced five wide near the rear, drifted in a few paths upper stretch and lacked response. FILM FAN showed
response in the opening quarter then retreated and allowed to ease up in stretch run.
