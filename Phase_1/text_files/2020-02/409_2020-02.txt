Footnotes
BAYTOWN GLORY didn't break sharply, angled in early on the backstretch when COLORADO GRANDSLAM angled in, was sent to vie in the four path
outside the early leader before a half, was carried wide into the stretch, ran clear into the final sixteenth and was kept to urging. RUN AWAY was unhurried
inside, made a mild run into the stretch but failed to sustain. STORM TALES steadied and angled in early on the backstretch when the winner came in,
swung wide into the stretch while trailing and finished fastest outside. SIR ROCKPORT showed speed inside, moved clear before going a quarter, began to
get out on the turn, ran out into the stretch then tired. COLORADO GRANDSLAM broke in the air, angled in early on the backstretch, pressed outside the
early leader into the turn then tired.

Footnotes
TEAM RIBOT settled off the pace in the four path, commenced a five wide rally around the turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was spun widest
and lost ground to the inner leaders turning for home, but determinedly sustained his rally under a long drive, and prevailed in the late stages. OMI'S BOY
set the pace while staying in the two path, met a challenge from NORMANDY BEACH to his inside turning for home, dueled with that rival through the lane,
but was outfinished by the oncharging TEAM RIBOT in the late stages while prevailing over his inner foe for place. NORMANDY BEACH stalked along the
inside, made a bid for the lead along the rail turning for home and dueled inside of the leader through the lane, but got outfinished by TEAM RIBOT and his
dueling counterpart in the late stages. GET THE POINT prompted the pace in the three path between horses, but failed to keep pace with those rivals
turning for home. KONKIE prompted the pace four wide, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. TWO RED CENTS settled in midpack in the two
path, but failed to make a rally. SUGAR TRAIN had a slow start, trailed throughout, and showed little.

Footnotes
LOVE THAT JAZZ went in the air at the break, advanced outside early, was sent four wide to a short lead early on the turn and held stubbornly following a
long drive. HAY SEEKER broke sharply for the early lead outside, angled to the rail on the turn and continued with good courage. MAGRITTE stayed inside
horses in the second flight, angled out entering the stretch, gained mildly then was vanned off following the race. ANYTIME ANYPLACE made a run
between horses while inside the winner into and around the turn then faded after five furlongs. GEORGE JET was slow to settle then passed tired ones.
NOTABLE was close up between horses into the turn, stayed in the three path into the stretch and tired. HAYNESFIELD BEST was fractious in the gate,
reared up at the break then was outrun while three wide. SCRAP IRON PHIL was outrun. PLAINS WARRIOR was hustled from the gate, pressed inside the
early leader into the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
OGEECHEE prompted the pace three wide from the five path, cleared an inner foe and bid for the lead in the four path at the five sixteenths pole, dueled
outside of a pair of foes through the lane, and prevailed under a long drive. BLACK STETSON dueled inside of a pair of rivals while staying in the three
path, left ample room for TO THE VICTOR to bid for the lead towards his inside while OGEECHEE made an outside bid at the five sixteenths pole, dug in
turning for home and dueled gamely between those foes through the lane, but was bested by his outer rival late. TO THE VICTOR split foes in the two path
and made a bid for the lead inside of the leaders at the five sixteenths pole, sustained her bid and dueled inside of a pair of foes through the lane, but got
outfinished in the late stages. DA WINNER IS shifted from the two to the four path turning for home, but lacked a kick to threaten the leaders.
SWITCHBLADE dueled outside of the early leader while being kept in the four path by that rival, but weakened between horses passing the five sixteenths
pole. BIG CITY BLUES was off a step slow, saved ground while in midpack around the turn, but weakened.

Footnotes
BANTY'S GIRL established a clear margin early on while in hand, stayed in the three path around the turn, widened her margin approaching the quarter
pole under light urging, then held sway under a mild hand ride through the lane. LITTLE CHERIE shifted off of the inside to the four path for clear racing
room outside of rivals into the turn, forged place while drifting to the five to six path in upper stretch, and stayed on to prove second best. HEADED FOR
HEAVEN swung to the six path turning for home while far off the pace, then stayed on mildly for a minor share. GIZMO'S DESTINY saved ground while
trailing around the turn, advanced mildly inside of foes in upper stretch, but failed to threaten. CHARITY STRIPE raced between horses in the two path while
far off the pace, and failed to factor. PARANOIA tracked the loose leader from the two path around the turn, shifted to the three to four path turning for home
to be outside of the leader, but weakened.

leaving the gate, was slow early, raced wide around the turn and was best of the rest while no threat. TIZ PROMISING RVF lagged early, made a run along
the rail into the stretch but failed to sustain. UNEMOTIONAL chased the winner early, came out into the three path on the turn then tired. MOHANIE wasn't

CRAZY IDEA slipped inside of the weakening INDISPUTABLYLINKED around the far turn, surged through a large rail opening turning for home to bid for
the lead inside of CARGO SHIP, dueled inside that foe through the lane, and prevailed in the late stages under driving pressure. CARGO SHIP stalked the
loose leader from the three path, took over from that foe at the five furlong pole while being hounded by BLAZE A TRAIL, held a slight advantage from that
rival around the far turn, but left the rail open for CRAZY IDEA to surge through turning for home, then gamely dueled with that foe through the lane, but was
bested by him in the late stages. BLAZE A TRAIL stalked in the four path through the first turn, tracked CARGO SHIP's move to the lead down the
backstretch, chased that foe while being kept in the four path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace turning for home, then held show through the lane.
JOINER moved to the four path while racing in midpack into the far turn, tipped to the five path turning for home, then stayed on mildly while failing to keep
pace with the leaders. MENLO PARK raced far off the pace in the two to four path, and failed to factor. HARPY EAGLE was antsy in the gate, settled in
midpack in the three path, shifted to the four to five path around the far turn, but weakened approaching the quarter pole. POKER CHIPS saved ground
while far off the pace, and never got involved. INDISPUTABLYLINKED was a bit antsy in the gate, set the pace in the two path around the first turn, but was
headed by multiple rival passing the five furlong pole, weakened passing the half mile pole, and was eased through the lane.
