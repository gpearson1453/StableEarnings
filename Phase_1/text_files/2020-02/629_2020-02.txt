Footnotes
PRETTY EDGY , fractious behind the gate, broke a step slow, settled off the early lead, cruised up and bid four deep into the turn, cleared without effort
past the three eighths, controlled the issue from there and won under a mild hand ride. HUFFLEPUFF drifted in at the break, quickly corrected and sped to a
short lead outside COME AND GET IT, handled pressure into the turn, ceded to the winner shortly thereafter, gave hard chase into the lane and kept on
willingly to be clear for the place. COME AND GET IT disputed the early pace along the rail, eased back off the leaders into the turn, steadied off heels
nearing the lane, angled out and kept trying to the line. BETHABARA , three wide, moved up between rivals to briefly bid into the turn, failed to keep pace
leaving the three eighths and faded.

Footnotes
AMERICAN STAR grabbed command early and set a rated pace towards the rail, handled outside pressure into and around the turn, shook clear under a
drive leaving the three sixteenths, wandered outward in deep stretch and was fully extended to prevail. IAM A DANCER saved ground, angled three wide
advancing into the lane, ranged up nearing the sixteenth marker while on her left lead and hung late. ESTRELLA GRANDE forced the pace outside the
winner, was under pressure into the lane then lacked the needed finish through the final sixteenth. TRADING CENTS chased outside a rival, was under a
drive past the three eighths, raced four wide in upper stretch and came up empty. PERFECT PARTY GIRL steadied repeatedly off heels the opening
quarter mile, circled into the lane and lacked a bid.

TOWSON broke well, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and edged clear late. FRISKY WHISKEY prompted the pace outside the winner
in a game effort. HOLA PRINCESS , two wide between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. DAH PHILLY
saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and flattened out. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE circled the turn three wide, angled to the six
path in upper stretch and offered a mild, late move. NOTHIN BUT A SMILE worked between horses in the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SHECOR ,
under urging three wide on the turn, weakened. EMMA'SDIAMONDDIVA broke very sluggishly then was outrun. WILKO LOVESONG was outrun.

MILITARY HOP stalked three wide, came four wide into the lane, closed in under strong handling, forged ahead in deep stretch and held sway. ZIGGY
MON , fractious pre race, was returned to the paddock for a rider change, bobbled at the break, recovered and pulled his way to command inside rivals,
edged clear into the turn, set a brisk pace, came three wide for the drive, dug in when confronted past the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly.
REVOLUTIONARY ROAD broke outward and was away last, corrected and edged up outside rivals, took closer order near the five sixteenths, chased four
wide into the lane and came up empty. DIRTYFOOT flashed speed then eased back off rivals, chased around the turn, came four wide into the stretch but
lacked a bid. YOU CAN NEVER TELL showed some speed, chased into the turn, dropped in and gave way nearing the quarter pole.

SACRED LADY stalked the pace three deep down the backstretch, moved up outside the pace setter leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch,
was whipped once near the eighth pole and pulled away under a hand ride. DAJEM sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, weakened through
the stretch but was best of the others. SAND IN MY SHOES , fractious in the starting gate, circled the turn four deep and failed to rally. BANKIN ON AN
ANGEL chased the pace, took the turn in the two path and weakened. DEVIL'S REVOLUTION hugged the inner rail down the backstretch and on the turn
and failed to be a factor. CINNAMON LATTE , outrun, was four wide turning for home. VICTORY TIME , outrun, was five deep in upper stretch. LUCY'S
JOURNEY was no factor.

Footnotes
TRIMMED IN GREY tracked inside, got through in upper stretch and spurted clear near the eighth pole, kept on under left handed rousing and held sway.
HAND RAIL settled in the clear while off the rail past the three eighths, circled four to five wide into the lane and closed willingly to bridge the gap.
CROSSINGTHEVALLEY , three deep chasing the pace, lacked a solid response. R TRUE SENSATION set the pace two wide, moved clear leaving the far
turn, was joined from her inside soon into the lane then weakened late. JAH GRACE , four to five wide, failed to menace. DETERMINED MISSION pursued
between rivals, stayed in range to mid turn then gave way. STARR DESIGNER lacked speed, raced three deep leaving the far turn and failed to respond.
FIFTEEN K , bumped and in tight at the break, saved ground nearing the turn and came up empty. DOCUMENTED was outrun. ACIANO broke slowly and
was outrun. ORBITING THE MOON , bumped at the break, failed to keep pace and faltered.
