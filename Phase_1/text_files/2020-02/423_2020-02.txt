Footnotes
POINT RECEIVED broke well and pressed the leader early then stalked from the inside, moved out and entered the turn two wide, bid outside the leader
and was carried wide around the bend, kicked clear into the stretch and drew away under urging. KATHIA off a bit slow to begin, reserved along the inside,
saved ground to the lane, lacked the needed late punch to threaten the winner but proved second best. LADY LECLAIR broke out and bumped rival,
dropped to the back of the field, saved ground around the turn, rallied up the inside and gained the show. MOTHER SUPREME sped to the front then
cleared and set the pace to the turn, lugged out around the bend and weakened. ZACKEE bumped both sides at the start, raced off the rail, bumped by rival
into the turn, went two wide into the stretch and never rallied. LADY MAXI stumbled leaving, chased from the inside into and around the turn, shifted out in
the upper stretch but also lacked a rally. GRACIE'S GIRL bumped at the start, traveled off the rail, two wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch and
could not rally. IN IT FOR LIFE tracked outside a rival up the backstretch, lugged in and bumped foe nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the
stretch and had little left for the drive.

IT'S JUST BOB well placed behind the early speed battle, raced two wide then angled out into the stretch, came out further in the lane, closed outside of
SAN GIORGIO and nailed that foe on the wire. SAN GIORGIO vied between foes for the lead, chased outside a rival and two wide into the stretch, rallied
and gained the lead past the sixteenth pole but was caught on the line. GUTSY STREAK vied for the lead five deep up the backstretch, kicked clear and
angled in on the turn, led two wide into the lane but was outfinished in the final sixteenth. HACK trailed the field from the inside, saved ground to the lane,
shifted out near the sixteenth pole and kept on willingly. MAURICE CODE vied from the inside to the turn, chased while saving ground to the stretch and
weakened. SCULLYISM broke in and bumped rival, vied four deep up the backstretch, chased five wide into the lane and weakened. NOVA bumped at the
start, raced three deep and between rivals, chased four wide leaving the turn and weakened.
