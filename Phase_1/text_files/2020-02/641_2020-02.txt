Footnotes
HALFMOON REEF sped clear soon after the start and set the pace, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the inside, was asked coming to
the quarter-pole, lost the lead briefly to the runner-up while put to a right-handed whip in upper stretch, battled on even terms for the lead into the final
furlong then switched to a left-handed whip and proved best under strong handling. LORD COLLIERY stalked the pace on the outside then in the four path
on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, took a brief and narrow advantage while under a drive in upper stretch, battled outside of the winner
while still on his inside lead in the final furlong and missed while clear for the place. PHAT AND FAST settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while
three wide on the turn, swung eight wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. JALEN HURTS broke out then was corrected with a tug of
the left rein and hustled, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a drive and lacked the needed
kick. DISAPPROVAL was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was given his cue outside the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under
the whip and came up empty. MY CLASSIC BOWTIE settled outside under some urging, was ridden along while five wide on the turn then carried six wide
into upper stretch and had nothing left. GRAND OMEGA bumped with a foe at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on
the turn and tired. FLASH'S ADVENTURE bumped solidly with a rival at the start then dropped back, settled off the pace, was urged along while three then
four wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNERIE settled just off the pace, drafted two to three wide on the turn, waited patiently behind horses into upper stretch, was asked when a huge
hole opened at the three-sixteenths, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady handling. SILENT TRICK was well
placed just off the pace, saved ground under coaxing on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, chased into upper stretch, moved out behind the
winner coming to the furlong marker and proved no match for the aforementioned foe while able to secure the place. LA NEGRA NOCHE bumped with a
rival at the start, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path while still inside of a foe on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch,
lost the lead to the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened but was well clear for the show. LADY MIAH pressed the pace on the outside, vied in
the three path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, chased into upper stretch, drifted out inside the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final
furlong and tired. MAJOR GLADY'S TEAM was taken up a bit just after the start, raced on the outside under restraint early then lagged at the back, went
three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor. ENDLESS ROMANCE tracked the pace on the outside, stalked four
wide on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, dropped back while moving out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. SARAHCAIN
bumped with a rival at the start, moved out early then was hard ridden towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the
whip, came five wide into the stretch, was carried out near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
HIERONYMUS crossed over having cleared the field heading down the stretch the first time, set the pace along the inside through the first turn, was
pressed by an outside foe up the backstretch and into the far turn still saving ground, edged clear of that one into upper stretch under right-handed urging,
switched to a left-handed whip near the furlong marker and drifted out, went back to right-handed and drifted in but less so, found more under urging to hold
sway. PIXELATE broke just a bit awkwardly, raced outside a rival three wide on the first turn and up the backstretch just off the leading pair, continued three
deep on the far turn coming four wide into the stretch, made a mild bid coming up to the hind end of the winner a furlong out but was held at bay.
BODECREAM was taken strongly in hand off rivals while keen heading to the first turn, shifted in from the two path to the inside early on the first turn,
tracked along the inside up the backstretch into the far turn, came out three wide in upper stretch, was in just a hair tight in upper stretch then drifted about a
bit in late stretch while keeping on well. MISHKO broke outwardly and was corrected at the start, switched out heading to the first turn, pressed the winner
outside two deep through both turns making a minor bid late on the far turn, drifted out then in a bit in upper stretch and came up empty. JERSEY CAT
TALE was urged at the break but lacking speed, bore out on the first turn while appearing to travel awkwardly, moved back in up the backstretch before
getting out again on the far turn, at that point was pulled up by the top of the stretch and walked off of his own accord. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
WEIGHTLESSNESS dropped in quickly early, was well placed while hugging the rail, cut the corner into the stretch, was guided out behind the leaders
when NIECE JACKIE DAVIS dropped to the rail at the three-sixteenths, rallied outside to take the lead just inside the furlong marker, kicked clear under a
strong hand ride into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter encouragement while much the best. DESERT THIEF stalked the pace on the outside
then in the three path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a right-handed whip into the final furlong but was quickly overtaken by the
winner and proved no match while clear for the place. NIECE JACKIE DAVIS was away alertly then hustled, set the pace under some pressure to her
outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch, dropped to the rail under a drive near the three-sixteenths, fought on determinedly
until inside the furlong marker then gave in and weakened while able to get the show. DOUBLE DOWN BRITT was off slow and spotted the front several
lengths, lagged well behind, rounded the turn in the two path, moved out some under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and failed
to threaten. LEFTHOOFRIGHTLEFT was coaxed along on the outside, raced in the five path while under stronger encouragement on the turn and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PLAN stalked from outside into the first turn going about three wide through that bend, took closer order outside the leader two then three wide
on the far turn, took a narrow lead in upper stretch, was in command past the furlong marker and drew clear late under steady handling. MOM SAID YES
was under a tight hold in behind runners along the inside heading into the first turn, continued to track near the rail into the far turn, moved out a path late on
that bend before shifting four wide coming into upper stretch, was within striking distance past the eighth pole but was no match late for the winner a
sixteenth out. SEMI CHARMED DAY was bumped into the outside rival at the start but was quick to obtain forward position stalking three wide into the first
turn, continued outside up the backstretch into the far turn going three then four wide and outside a rival through that turn emerging five wide past the
quarter pole, kept on to get show honors. ATLAS MOON bumped the outside rival at the start, raced mid-pack in the three to four path through the first turn,
moved up outside rivals up the backstretch, was closer to the leaders three to four wide on the far turn, moved out a bit in upper stretch and showed mild
late interest. KATAMA BAY moved in from the two path to the rail entering the first turn, set the pace inside up the backstretch and into the far turn
occasionally just removed from the rail, was challenged leaving that bend, headed in upper stretch, fought on briefly before giving way about the eighth pole.
BENELUX bobbled after the break, was allowed to settle into stride racing off the rail in the three then four path on the first turn, moved up outside foes
heading up the backstretch, shifted in a bit going about three wide on the far turn before swinging six wide coming into the top of the stretch, passed rivals in
upper stretch but could not threaten the top ones. DRAX shifted in entering the first turn, raced inside on or just off the rail mid-pack off the leaders, swung
five wide turning for home and needed more. BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI broke inwardly, settled last but one racing just off the fence early, continued in the two
then three path on the far turn and was never near enough to threaten. PHARAOH'S KITTEN was bumped at the break, shifted in mid-pack off the leaders
entering the first turn, saved ground through that bend and the second one still near but off the leaders but weakened in the stretch. NATURAL HISTORY
broke inwardly just a bit, moved in heading down the stretch the first time then angled outside a foe three to four wide early on the first turn, continued
mid-pack early up the backstretch pulling against tight restraint while behind and between rivals, lost position late up the backstretch, continued about three
wide on the far turn and was empty in the stretch. DEGAS AWAY was awkward into stride veering in and out after the break, raced off the inside mostly in
the three path on the turns and failed to threaten. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
DANCE RHYTHMS settled outside just off the leaders, went four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch six deep then was carried out a path and put to a
drive, surged late to get up a few strides from the wire. SHE'S ALL SKEET settled well back early racing off the inside, entered the turn in the two path
moving outside a rival about midway on that bend coming four deep past the five-sixteenths and a further path into upper stretch, put to urging at that
juncture, moved in a bit in upper- to mid-stretch and was gaining on the leaders then moved out a bit while sustaining the momentum to get up for second
outside of MAYBE I CAN, who set the pace racing just off the rail and pressed by outside rivals into and through the turn, edged clear of those foes in upper
stretch but was simply outfinished. QUICK QUICK QUICK was within range outside rivals into the turn going four then five wide through that bend, was
within range past the quarter pole, carried out a bit in upper stretch, still within striking distance but could make no headway while outkicked by rivals late.
REDEEM MY HEART was fractious in the gate, devoid of early speed despite urging, raced off the inside in the three to four path on the turn still far back,
swung seven deep turning for home then moved out a further two paths in upper stretch, was running best late but with too much to do. VOMBA exchanged
a light brush at the start, was forwardly positioned just off the leaders racing off the fence till leaving the backstretch at which point she was guided to the
rail, saved ground inside through the turn and lacked the needed late kick. HOLLY GO LIGHTLY raced off the pace outside foes going three to four wide on
the turn, came into upper stretch seven wide and ran on same-paced late. WINANDYOURIN GIN exchanged a light brush at the break, pursued the leader
three wide then three deep and between foes on the turn, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and faded thereafter. DOMONETTE was encouraged forward
racing two to three wide between foes into the turn but was never a threat. COBRA CASABLANCA broke through the gate and ran off about a furlong, was
brought back by the outrider, hopped slightly at the start, raced in behind rivals not too far off the pace along the inside, dropped back and faded. (Rail at 16
Feet)

Footnotes
CAJUN CREED went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, saved ground early on the far turn, waited passing the five-sixteenths,
switched out three wide shortly thereafter then was roused, rallied six wide into the stretch, moved in while gaining quickly on the outside, closed fast to get
the lead at the three-sixteenths, drifted in while moving clear under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker and drew away
under steady urging. DUTCHMAN bumped with a rival at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three
to four wide on the far turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, was carried seven wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the
winner. LOOKING FOR BULL went four wide on the first turn, dropped in early on the backstretch, settled under some urging, saved ground on the far turn,
was driven three wide into the stretch under the whip and came up empty while best of the rest. BEAUTY BOY broke a step slow then was rushed to the
lead, went around the first turn in the two path, contested the pace on the inside of a foe while in hand, was asked in the two path on the far turn, moved
clear at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under the whip, lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths and tired. FROM NOW ON
brushed with a foe at the start, went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn then carried
eight wide into the stretch and had nothing left. MYBLENDOFWHISKY raced inside early on the first turn then shifted three wide, was well placed down the
backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and capitulated. BOSTON BOB bumped with a foe after the
start, saved ground while well back and was no factor. DUDE GREELEY went around the first turn in the five path, contested the pace on the outside, was
urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths, came five wide into the stretch and faded. HANSEN'S
HOLIDAY brushed with an opponent at the start, went five wide on the first turn, was urged along on the backstretch, raced five wide on the far turn and
failed to respond. OHMYMY OHMYYES bumped with a foe at the start then another rival shortly after the break, went two to three wide on the turns and
