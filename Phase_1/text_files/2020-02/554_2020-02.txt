Footnotes
HONEY BOURBON came in after the start and bothered multiple foes, back early early on, started a rally along the far turn, was widest into the lane,
continued wide down the lane, made a late bid, came in and bothered MOUNTAIN MELODIES then edged past the leader and jumped the photo finish light
right before the wire. SISTER DIABLO was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early on, was off the rail into the lane, lugged out and steadied up
MOUNTAIN MELODIES nearing the eighth pole then inched clear but drifted out even more inside the sixteenth pole and caused MOUNTAIN MELODIES
to steady up even harder then yielded in the final stages. MOUNTAIN MELODIES chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid
in the stretch but was bothered by SISTER DIABLO and steadied nearing the eighth pole, continued the bid and while between horses was bothered again
by SISTER DIABLO and also by HONEY BOURBON then steadied harder inside the sixteenth pole then gave in during the final stages. WEST VIRGINIA
PAM was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. TINGSTHATMAKESENSE set
the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane and gave way in the stretch drive. PRINCESS MARYKATE was slow at the start and raced back early on,
was in the five path into the lane and improved position. SHE'S FLASHY was bumped and bothered early on, no factor thereafter. DEAR THEODOSIA was
through after a half. YELLOW BIRD was bumped and bothered early on. LADY OF LAHTI tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and faded in
the stretch. TEMPLEMENT was never involved. MADAM NOVETZKE had early speed then folded up. The rider of MOUNTAIN MELODIES claimed an
objection against the riders of SISTER DIABLO and HONEY BOURBON for interference in the stretch run and after review by the stewards, SISTER
DIABLO was disqualified and placed third for the infraction.

CENTERFOLD ANGEL stalked the pace early on, took over command outside the half mile pole, cleared the field nearing the lane and drew off late in the
stretch under a steady drive. GOING TO TEMPLE chased the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and no match for the winner in the stretch
run. HOOSIER GOLD CASE tracked the pace early, was off the rail into the lane and was no match for the top two in the stretch drive. ROLLOVER RISK
raced back early on, was on the inside into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. ON STRIKE was never a factor. TRICKY TUNE set the pace early,
was off the rail into the lane and gave way. REMISSION was done early. MORE COWBELL was through after a half. LAKE BARKLEY was unprepared at
the start and was through early.
