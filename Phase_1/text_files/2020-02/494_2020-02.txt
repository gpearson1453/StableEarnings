Footnotes
PERCEIVED pressed the issue from path three in between rivals until the five-sixteenths pole, was set down spinning into the lane abreast of the second
place finisher, battled on gamely with that foe and got the job done. OWNITIFYOUWANTIT remained towards the two path after the field had been sent off
and running, was under some hand urging holding of a pair of opponents to the outside for nearly three-quarters, got called upon locked in an one on one
contest with the eventual winner, fought fiercely but wound up the one denied. ROAD HOME steadied getting pinched coming up to the conclusion of the
chute, gradually shifted to the inside route upon recovery, getting there by midway on the backstretch, kept watch on the front runners contending for the
lead, getting placed to stronger and stronger encouragement himself during the run around the bend, was driven four wide into the stretch, got outkicked.
MUTAKAAMIL argued for the advantage from path four as the widest of a threesome until the general area of the five-sixteenths pole, had already become
well detached entering the stretch, backed away readily afterwards.

LOVE AND LOVE four then three wide in aim stacked outside of the top pair, took over command set down for the drive angled four to five wide into upper
stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. DAZZLE ME coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide for home displaced from the front, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. MISS MI MI broke in at
the start bumping HAPPYCREST, chased three then two wide, got let out spinning four wide into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. GIRL
OF TOSCONOVA broke out at the start brushing HAPPYCREST, chased four then three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung five wide into
upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. BOSSY BRIDE dueled in hand from the two path down the backstretch with DAZZLE ME to her
outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
HAPPYCREST got bumped by MISS MI MI breaking inwards and was brushed by GIRL OF TOSCONOVA breaking outwards at the start, chased just off
the inside until tucked to the rail at the half mile pole, came under coaxing three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
INVETERATE stumbled badly at the break, recovered after that miscue and after some coaxing grabbed the advantage by the end of the chute, showed the
way from along the inside route, lightly urged, felt the presence of the second place finisher as three-quarters was being completed, waited an additional
sixteenth before being asked for more herself, gave the desired response and drew off. SENGEKONTACKET stalked the pace from the two path, crept up
to the winner late on the bend, got put to a drive for the drive home, was staved off, then narrowly held the place. HEAVENLY CURLIN at a considerable
distance from off the rail, sat strung out four wide on the turn, swung into the lane, mustered up a mild response that fell short of snagging away second
from a tiring rival. SKY QUEEN underwent a three wide on the turn, appeared through as the third fraction was being finalized, moved out into the five path
stepping into the stretch, ventured onward to the wire lightly urged. SUPER TWENTY SEVEN saved ground until the quarter pole, went about the turn under
strong handling, had no rally after being spotted in the two path at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
UNION BANKS secured the pocket after being lightly urged during the very earliest of stages, was kept in reserve keeping an eye on the front runners for
the opening half, got cued angling to the outside for the drive home, settled in towards path three by the three-sixteenths pole and took off in earnest after
the leader, shifted about, at times from strong stick work, while closing the gap, battled between rivals in deep stretch and got up. IMPLIED VOLATILITY
remained stationed along the inside route after the field had been sent off and running, was eased to the outside at the midway point of the turn, angled
approximately five wide stepping into the lane, kicked into its best stride and narrowed in, was the outermost of a threesome vying with vigour for the front
end late, missed. DETERMINED ONE attained a prominent position in short order, cut over towards the inside route, showed the way while being prompted
by GRATTO SWING from the outside, pulling on the right side all the while, moved out in the direction of path two coming into the lane under a ride, isolated
from the others however, with each of them having chosen much wider routes into the stretch, came in and was back onto the rail by midlane, was forced to
defend the advantage under heavy pressure from a twosome to his right in the final stages, came up short. LORCAN took up the chase from path two on
the turn, got set down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths marker, commenced the stretch one path farther off the rail, mustered up a mild response sufficient
enough to claim the last major check. GRATTO SWING hustled along after making light contact with ALERT THE MEDIA in the shadow of the starting gate,
sparred for control from the two path for a half and gave way. GONGHEIFATCHOY broke last after lunging out, departed the backstretch from the three
path, got sent out six wide from upper to midstretch, lacked the needed response then was vanned off after crossing the wire. BLESSED HONOUR two
wide stepping onto the turn, was in the five path exiting it, failed to menace. ALERT THE MEDIA brought up the back of the pack after brushing with
GRATTO SWING at the start, travelled two to three wide on the turn, strolled into the six path for entrance into the stretch under a protective hold and was
allowed to fade away.

Footnotes
QUEEN KAHEN five then four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths advancing on the front, swung five wide into
upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge and take narrow command a furlong out, dug in dueling with SEA SPARKLE from the eighth pole to the sixteenth
marker when joined by CARRIZO inside, vied outside that pair knocking heads to the finish and got the nod gamely on the wire. CARRIZO shied away to
the inside in reaction to FORGOTTEN HERO getting off in a tangle to the outside and was coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive rallying up the rail to vie inside a pair of rivals through to
the finish and just missed at the end losing the bob on the wire. SEA SPARKLE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under threat near the eighth pole, got headed at
that station by the top one, fought on dueling with that rival and then vying between foes knocking heads to the finish in game fashion but was ultimately
bested on the wire while clear for the show honors. AUNT BABE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide
into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. BREAK CURFEW chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. MY ROXY GIRL three to four wide in pursuit, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and weakened. SHE'S A BLACK BELT three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and
weakened. FORGOTTEN HERO grew fractious and was off in a tangle lunging and striking the near side stall before brushing with CARRIZO in the hind
end very lightly conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside for home
and was unable to make an impact. DATING GAME six paths off the inside in pursuit, tucked four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
I LOVE JAXSON guided over to the rail early on the backstretch, rode it for three-quarters, advanced into contention during the run around the bend, mount
not in any need of encouragement, glided three wide into the lane, settled in at the three-sixteenths marker and was switched over to stronger handling,
chipped away at the deficit, enough so as to begin the final furlong vying as the widest of three front runners for the top, worked his way past them over the
course of the next sixteenth and edged away. SCORESWHENHEWANTS was rated along stalking the pace towards the two path, got roused coming up to
the three-sixteenths pole, vied from between rivals from midlane until the sixteenth pole, forged to a slim lead, saw the winner grab command soon
afterwards, held on well to salvage second. HIGH AMPLITUDE took up position in midpack, underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, got asked for more
spinning into the stretch, inched his way into the five path from upper to midstretcjh, flashed some late foot en route for the show. HIP HIP JORGE
established the top shortly after the field had been sent off and running, went onto the inside route, shook free after picking up the tempo a few ticks
between calls on the backstretch, felt an uptick in pressure late on the turn, waited until around the three-sixteenths pole before being turned loose, battled
back against a two-ply assault from the outside starting in midlane, gave in with approximately a sixteenth to go and weakened. CREA'S BKLYN LAW hung
out two to three wide on the turn, made no impact. ZEALOUS chased the pace towards the two path on the turn, lacked the necessary response.
SINGAPORE TRADER a forward factor until the conclusion of the backstretch, sat parked out five wide on the turn, swung slightly wider into the stretch
having been put to a protective hold, was allowed to fade away. HOUSE LIMIT forwardly placed for the opening half, began a steady retreat once on the
turn, was under a protective hold coming five wide into the lane, got eased, then after being pulled up quickly past the wire, walked off the track without need
of outside assistance.

Footnotes
CHOWDA bumped at the start by MICROSCOPE who recovered outwards from a bobble, established the front and showed the way in hand three wide
down the backstretch and then from the two path through the turn coming under pressure from a flanking pair nearing the quarter pole when placed to
coaxing, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in loosely between foes and was headed a furlong out, dueled through to the finish with BANK ON SHEA
fighting on gamely through to the finish taking back narrow command a sixteenth from home, then inched away in the late stages to prevail. BANK ON
SHEA chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced through the latter portion
of the turn to issue a challenge near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, rallied to poke a head in front a furlong out, dug in dueling through to
the finish, got headed for the front a sixteenth out before being ultimately shaken off late and bested at the end. BOURBON BAY two to three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, kept on for the show honors. SCILLY CAY four to five wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong. MICROSCOPE bobbled at the start
recovering into CHOWDA, chased along the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response.
COLORMEPAZZI chased four then three wide, came under light brief coaxing midway on the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ZONIC along the outside, kept an eye on the front runners from the four path on the turn, swung out one path farther off the rail during the early stages of
the stretch drive, moved up on the ones to catch in a steadfast manner, got locked up in a duel with the runner up as each went by the leader with
approximately a sixteenth to go, gamely reached the finish line first. HIZAAM stalked the pace from the two path in midpack, was being urged along
travelling on the turn, angled about three wide into the lane, narrowed in, overhauled the leader in tandem with the winner in the general area of the
sixteenth pole, went at it on near even terms with the top one from that juncture onward, wound up on the short end of the win photo. DOOLEY chased the
pace from path three on the turn, got steered out six wide from upper to midlane, rallied with willingness to earn the show. WOODBURY prompted the
pacesetter two to three wide, got cued for the drive home, wasn't able to cement himself to the front end, weakened in the final sixteenth. JACK BO grabbed
the advantage in short order, cut over to the inside route, showed the way, tailed by WOODBURY from the outside, was asked for more spinning onto the
top of the lane, gave in to heavy pressure with approximately a sixteenth to go, then steadily backed away. LOCAL EDITION tracked the leader from along
the inside route, pulling a bit on the bit during the initial stages, cut the corner into the stretch and faltered. PURCHASING POWER out a bit springing from
the gate, was pulled away from the closest opponent, got guided over to the rail soon afterwards, rode it for three-quarters, was moved out four wide for the
stretch run, came up empty. SOUNDS GOOD saved ground until the quarter pole, failed to fire appreciably after being tipped into the two path. LE GROS
BILL pursued the front runners from path two on the turn, shifted out four wide entering the stretch, lacked the needed response. BOOBY TRAP three wide
on the turn, gave way.
