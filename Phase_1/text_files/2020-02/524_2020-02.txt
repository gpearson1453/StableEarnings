Footnotes
PAPA'S MELODY showed speed outside of a pair of rivals, forged clear and crossed over into the turn, widened her advantage turning for home, and was
kept to task late. DAIRY KID had a slow start and was rated off of the pace in the four path through the turn, angled inwards as rivals drifted out turning for
home, then rallied inside of foes through the lane to be second best. LAYLA'S WILDCAT vied early on between horses, but failed to keep pace with PAPA'S
MELODY into the turn, chased that foe from the two to three path through the turn, but bore out to the six path when straightening for home, and got
outfinished by an inner rival for place. JADEY AT THE BAR vied along the inside of a pair of foes early on, but failed to keep pace with PAPA"S MELODY
into the turn, chased that foe while angling off of the rail through the turn, came into the lane in the four path, but lugged out while weakening on her left lead
through the lane. RIDE LADY RIDE stalked from outside of the trio of early leaders, but was floated out to the seven path by the bearing LAYLA'S WILDCAT
turning for home and weakened thereafter. ARTOIS SUNSET was outrun with a duel effort.

Footnotes
MR RIGHT NOW rated far off of the eventual collapsing pace, drifted from the three to the seven path turning for home, and surged past inner rivals late.
BEYOND PRECHER saved ground around the far turn before shifting to the four path in upper stretch to rally outside of the leaders, but was bumped and
impeded by DOUBLE ONE SHOT drifting outwards approaching the sixteenth pole, and got outfinished. YHA YHA tracked the loose leader from along the
inside, bid for the lead two wide and between horses into the far turn, dueled between those foes in upper stretch as both rivals were game, but got
outfinished late by multiple oncharging outer foes late. DOUBLE ONE SHOT was forced to the five path while far off of the pace into the first turn,
commenced a rally down the backstretch to bid for the lead three wide into the far turn, dueled outside of a pair of rivals in upper stretch as those foes dug
in, but drifted outwards when the rider switched to left handed pressure approaching the sixteenth pole, bumped BEYOND PREACHER, and subsequently
weakened. TOP HAT TITAN spurted clear early on while a bit keen through the first turn, held a long lead down the backstretch, but was collared by multiple
rivals into the far turn, dug in and was game until the sixteenth pole, but gave way late as the pace collapsed. DESPOTIC failed to factor while off of the
pace in the two to three path. DIIACHI trailed early on, advanced slightly four wide around the far turn, but was floated to the six path turning for home,
lacked a rally, and weakened. Hand timed.

SMOKED PAPRIKA showed good early speed inside of a pair of rivals, was put to tight quarters by CUSHMAN ROAD trying to cross over into the turn
causing her to steady, stalked from along the inside through the bend, made a rail bid turning for home as the leader drifted outwards, and drew off under
driving pressure. ROSES FOR DOUG angled from the three to the two path turning for home to split foes at the furlong pole and prevail for place.
THECHAMPISFLORING took a slight bump at the start, hugged the fence while advancing through the turn, then sustained a rail rally through the lane, but
was outfinished for place. PARIS AT NIGHT took a bump at the start, sparred outside of the early leader while in the three path around the turn, was floated
to the four path turning for home, where she got outkicked by inner rivals, then hung on her left lead and lugged in through the lane, and got outfinished.
CUSHMAN ROAD had a rank start but showed good speed outside of a pair of rivals, cleared a crossed over into the turn, but put SMOKED PAPRIKA in
tight quarters by doing so, held an advantage through the bend before drifting to the three path turning for home, and weakened. ANXIOUSLY ENGAGED
broke in and bumped a foe at the start, but was hustled up and quickly rushed to made a bid for the lead in the four path into the turn, but flattened out and
weakened turning for home. STAR FEVER saved ground while trailing and was no factor. BESS EVER weakened to trailed the field while drifting from the
three to the six path turning for home. SPARKLING BID raced outside of horses in the four path in midpack, and weakened.

Footnotes
NORM'S PLACE stalked two wide, bid for the lead passing the half mile pole and built a clear advantage into the turn, shifted from the two to three path
turning for home, and held sway under driving pressure. SOLAR HEAT saved ground far off of the pace, gained ground inside of rivals turning for home,
shifted off of the rail in upper stretch to bid for place, sustained his grinding rally to attempt a late bid inside of the leader, but did not have enough.
SILVANUS shifted from the three to five path in midpack turning for home, but angled inwards in upper stretch, and made a late surge in the final sixteenth,
but missed place while achieving show. DARRENATOR was hustled in the two path to set the pace, dueled inside of NORM'S PLACE at the half mile pole,
but failed to keep pace with that foe into the turn, held place turning for home, but gave way through the final furlong. THAT DOG WILL HUNT shifted off of
the inside to the four path turning for home, but finished evenly. AQUAMARINE stalked close to the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail around the
turn and came into the lane in the five path, but lacked a rally. COLONEL GOTHAM was off slow, trailed in the three path around the turn, then failed to
threaten through the lane. SYNNIN swung from the five to the nine path turning for home while far off of the pace, and never got involved. MIGIWEWIN
stalked in the five path, but weakened while drifting the eight path turning for home. PRINCE OF PARIS stalked in the four path, but weakened while drifting
to the seven path turning for home.

before swinging to the eight path turning for home, offered a strong late rally, but just missed at the wire. CREATIVE ART drifted from the four to six path

hanging on her left lead. SHE GOT AWAY prompted the pace then dueled for the lead in the four to five path around the turn, but was floated to the six path

Footnotes
MITCH AND JOHN E hopped at the start, advanced out of trailing position while in the six path into the turn, forged show turning for home, sustained his
rally through the lane, and wore down the leaders late. HOT RODIN prompted the pace from outside of the leader, inched forward to vie for the lead passing
the seven sixteenths pole, was floated from the three to the four path around the turn, edged a lead from his inner rival at the sixteenth pole, but was worn
down in the late stages. READY TO FORGIVE had a sharp start, set the pace inside of HOT RODIN around the turn, dug in and held a narrow lead passing
the furlong pole, but gave way through the final sixteenth. DRAYMAGIC stalked in the four path, but weakened turning for home, then held fourth through
the lane. WIT AND WISDOM shot from the two to the eight path turning for home, but had no rally. SUM CANDY saved ground from midpack, but
weakened. HURRICANE FORCE weakened to trail the field in the five path at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
THRASHER had a slow start and trailed the field down the backstretch, took the far turn in the six path, shifted to the eight path to be outside of rivals
turning for home, lugged in while rallying passing the furlong pole, brushed with I'M AN EIGHT, but sustained her bid and got up at the wire. TYLER'S TEK
shifted off of the rail to the three path turning for home, commenced a rally and split foes at the sixteenths pole to make a late bid, but missed. XTREME
LYRA vied outside of PULPITS POWER, inched a slight lead while being floated from the three to four path at the five sixteenths pole, but was hounded by
I'M AN EIGHT turning for home, dug in and was game between horses through the lane to the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished between horses in the late
stages. SIX POINT RACK saved ground from midpack, got outmoved by multiple rivals at the quarter pole, but found racing room along the rail turning for
home, commenced a rail bid, but drifted inwards at the chute opening and had to be corrected to avoid the railing. PULPITS POWER set the pace inside of
XTREME LYRA, shifted to the two to three path while relinquishing the lead to that rival at the five sixteenths pole, but dug in gamely in upper stretch before
getting outfinished in the final sixteenth. SURPRSINGLYPERFECT shifted from the four to seven path turning for home, but got outkicked by an outer rival
in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. I'M AN EIGHT rallied in the four path around the far turn to grab a lead turning for home, but shied out from
inner drifting rivals while hanging on his left lead, brushed with THRASHER at the sixteenth pole, and weakened. SKYCHIEF stalked three wide, shifted to
the five path turning for home, and got outfinished while among traffic. NUDIAMOND retreated to trail the field in the five path into the far turn, angled to the
nine path at the furlong pole, but lacked a rally. HANDSOME JOHN raced in midpack in the four to five path, but weakened around the turn.
