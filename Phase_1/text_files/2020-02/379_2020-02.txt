Footnotes
GLADTOBEHERE to the lead quickly, in hand early on, urged into final turn and ran way from the field in a mild drive to dominate. PEEKACHO chased
runaway winner throughout while no match and best of the rest. HAUTE PROSPECT raced outside all the way but finished up a distant third. CRUZ DIEZ
bothered and bobbled after the start and only improved position in the stretch. NORTHERN LUCK stayed close for a mile but gave way thereafter. BARIN
dropped far back after the mile. MACHA'S REWARD lunged in at the start and bobbled, rushed while used up and faded back. Due to a timer malfunction
the mile and one quarter fractional time was not available.

pole but outfinished while best of the rest. ENGLISH ESCORT unhurried to far turn, inside run to quarter pole to get up for show. DREAMIN' OF MUNNY
raced evenly with no late response when needed in the drive. BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE no speed to far turn, improved position inside through stretch.
EXCELERITA raced evenly to deep stretch, faltered back late. BELLE MAGIE no speed far back to far turn, floated widest and improved only.
ENTHRONED good inside speed to the far turn, gave way from inside late. WHATAROCKET never a factor. WORTHAPRETTYPENNY never menaced
throughout. EOWYN chased to the half, stopped badly.

Footnotes
A. P. PRINCESS stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied late down the stretch and drove past the leader in the final stages.
URBAN INSIGHT vied for the lead early on, took over command, was in the three path into the lane, drew clear in the stretch but was ran down in the final
stages. HEY NEGRITA raced back early on, waited from the quarter pole to the three sixteenths pole, was finally asked with a bid down the lane and
finished willingly. SYSTEMIC RISK chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. GIRO KATE stalked the
pace early, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. LUCKY AT JUSTICE was rushed up early along the inside, raced off
the rail into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. SAY IT SWEETLY was never a threat. HEAD FOR THE SHORE was never a factor. MONSOON
RAIN was never involved. DON'T STOP MARIA showed little. GIFT WRAPPED had early speed then folded up.
