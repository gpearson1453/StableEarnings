Footnotes
KIWITAHI set a pressured pace, came in and bumped along the backstretch, drew clear on the turn and held safely while kept to task. SAMURAI JACK
pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, continued willingly, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. TOTALITY raced close to the pace in an outside
trip, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and was along for show in a steady effort. SCRAPPY DEVILLE pressed the pace while racing along the rail,
was bumped and checked along the backstretch, continued inside, and came up empty late. DOMENICO trailed the field, went seven wide at the top of the
stretch, offered a mild bid under steady urging and did not threaten. VIRGHAZI was not a factor. THE GREAT LEBOWSKI failed to contend. The stewards'
posted an inquiry and the rider of SCRAPPY DEVILLE lodge an objection against the rider of KIWITAHI for alleged interference on the backstretch. No
change was made.

MORNING BLURS set the pace and drew off in the drive under urging. PAPA MAMBO pressed the pace, fell back leaving the turn, closed steadily and got
up for place while no threat to the winner. NOT THAT I RECALL was void of early speed, bid off the rail leaving the turn and got up for show. FELDY
pressed the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail to threatened, came up empty late and lost position. PARTY HOSTESS raced close to the pace,
went six wide at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. BLUE CHIP BETTY was never far back, raced outside, went seven wide entering the stretch and
lacked a bid. SLEIGH RIDE broke slowly and did not threaten in an even effort.

the turn and weakened. BROOKSIDE BELLE was void of early speed, widest in the drive and improved position. LUCKY CARLENE was steadied at the
start while getting away well, showed speed to the turn and gave way. CHANTE showed speed to the turn and gave way. BONES AND ROSES raced
outside and was not a factor. GOVENESS SHEILA raced inside, showed speed to the turn, stopped and was not urged late. The timer was prematurely

Footnotes
SKYCHIEF saved ground, angled out entering the far turn, bid seven wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to up in the final
strides. XTREME LYRA set the pace while racing in hand, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, responded to duel through the stretch and was outnodded to
just miss. BENTLEY'S SHOW rallied around the turn, bid six wide, dueled late and was outfinished in a game effort. RAOFTHESUN raced close to the pace
inside, challenged into the stretch, contended to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE raced mid pack, finished well inside and
failed to menace. WHY FRANK raced in the back, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid only. BOURBON N LIME raced inside in an even effort and
did not threaten. SPOON BOSS pressed the pace to the second turn and flattened out. TEMPLE KEYS trailed the field and failed to contend. Hand timed.
