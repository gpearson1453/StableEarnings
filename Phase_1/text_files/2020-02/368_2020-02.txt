Footnotes
THORCERESS, reserved along the inside dropping into last racing to the first turn, continued under patient handling through the backstretch, shifted out
four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance and continued with a steady bid in that path to wrest the advantage in time under some firm right
handed pressure. AND I KNOW ,forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter under light reserve, moved to wrest the advantage racing past the three
sixteenths marker while shifting inwards but was collared nearing the wire. KELCIE'S MANDATE tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the far
turn, shifted out to bid three deep racing into the lane but had no final kick. VUYELWA tracked off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out in
upper stretch but had no late bid. AMERICA'S QUEEN sprinted to the lead while angling inside, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn and gave way
once headed racing into upper stretch. SUNSHINE JOY was a brief factor tracking the leaders three deep to the backstretch but dropped out early.

Footnotes
JUANANDORA ducked out at the start, was settled out of striking distance racing to the far turn, gathered momentum entering upper stretch while shifting
out to bid three deep between foes leaving the furlong marker and wrested the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. VALERIE FIRST,
reserved last near the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out to split rivals just off the inside bidding for command in
tandem while just inside the eventual winner, altered inside a rival to continue along the rail but was just outkicked. LIL'S TURN, urged to a forward placing
racing just off the pacesetter into the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes through the far turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into
upper stretch but was collared by the top pair late. BLAZING BROOKE tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in the opening half, lost some ground to the
leaders nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide entering the lane bumping WEST HORIZEN and lacked the needed final kick. WEST HORIZEN was
rated just off the second flight in the opening half, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide into upper stretch, then was bumped near the
three sixteenths marker and soon flattened out. DILLY DOES IT was rated off the second flight from between foes in the opening stages, shifted out three
deep on the far turn to lodge a bid nearing upper stretch but had no final kick. GO GIRL GONE broke sharply, set the pace on a narrow margin along the
inside racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
MELISSANI, unhurried in the opening stages while angling to the rail to track off the first flight into the backstretch, shifted out after a half to gain some
position between rivals, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and went clear late under
firm encouragement. GUILTY LADY, reserved off the second flight while angling inwards a bit racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position between
foes to lodge a brief bid inside the winner racing into upper stretch but proved no match. SPLENDOR BEACH was rated off the first flight just off the inside
racing to the backstretch, lost some position when steadied sharply when becoming rank between rivals midway through the backstretch, shifted out four
wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, gained some position in that path racing to upper stretch but had no late kick. CHICA
DIFISEL, reserved along the inside racing to the first turn, was prompted to advance inside foes nearing the midway point of the backstretch, briefly awaited
an opening entering the far turn, then swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and finished evenly. SWEET LEAF, reserved last to the far turn, split
foes just off the inside racing into upper stretch to gain some position while making no real impact. BAD PAY, urged to a forward placing three deep
between foes racing to the first turn, pressed the pace between foes into the far turn and gave way into the lane. MIGHTY FROSTY, pulling a bit against
restraint, was caught wide racing into the backstretch and proved no threat. MOMS PINK RIBBON, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into
the backstretch, gave way after a half. STRAND DE ORO, urged to contend with the first flight four wide leaving the chute, drifted wide into the first turn and
soon dropped out. CALL ME MOONSHADOW, restless in the gate, flashed brief pace between foes racing to the first turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
MIAMI SMUGGLER switched just outside the pacesetter tracking that rival from just out of striking distance, advanced to challenge for command between
foes nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards once gaining the advantage and held sway to the end under firm left handed encouragement. KALU tracked the
pacesetter between foes in second flight, advanced in tandem with the eventual winner to challenge for command three deep nearing upper stretch but
proved no match for that rival. ETERNAL CROSS sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail, held sway on a clear margin into the bend, dueled inside foes
on the turn and gave way into upper stretch. MAYBEYESMAYBENO angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders, shifted out nearing upper stretch but
lacked the needed final bid. DIG IN bobbled at the start while exchanging some light contact, was settled outside foes, then angled five wide racing into the
stretch but had no rally. BRANDY CHASER settled out of striking distance near the inside, never seriously menaced and was gathered up in late stages.
PERSISTENT RUN tracked off the second flight four wide in early stages but soon retreated.

Footnotes
WISH UPON tracked the pacesetter outside a rival from just out of striking distance under light reserve racing to the backstretch, was fanned three wide
after a half, continued in that path while being prompted to advance nearing upper stretch, lost some ground to CROWN AND SUGAR in upper stretch but
continued with a steady late response to edge that rival in time under firm handling. The latter, pulling a bit against restraint tracking the pacesetter along the
inside to the first turn, closed the gap on that foe entering the backstretch while shifting off the inside, continued stalking just off the pacesetter to the second
bend, steadily gained terms leaving the far turn, was roused to wrest command near midstretch and just failed to contain the winner on the wire.
DISTINCTIVE FLOWER sped to the fore from the break while angling to the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch into the far
turn, couldn't contain the top pair late but continued willingly to hold a rival for a share. MAGIC HATTER settled last near the inside early, came around a
rival on the far turn gaining position, angled inside racing into the stretch while being roused to advance but lacked the needed final kick. PURE PRAISE,
pulling a bit against restraint, tracked off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the far turn but
steadily faded into the stretch.

TALE OF V K came through close quarters at the break, sprinted clear of the field racing a bit off the rail on the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin
into upper stretch and maintained a safe margin to the end under firm handling. MY COTTON CANDY tracked off the second flight along the rail in the
opening stages, saved ground through the turn and continued with a steady effort to bid inside the pacesetter late while proving only second best. MS.
GENUINE, bumped soundly by ONE SLICK FACT at the start, was righted to track the pacesetter between foes and continued with a mild bid. ONE SLICK
FACT swerved inwards bumping MS. GENUINE at the start, was righted to track the pacesetter three deep leading the second flight on a narrow margin into
the turn and faded in late stages. OURHANDSOMEGAL angled inwards to track off the second flight between foes racing into the turn and continued
evenly. SPICED RUM PUNCH tracked the pacesetter just off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and faded into upper stretch. THEY CALL ME
LUCKY broke slowly, was steadied avoiding traffic just after the start losing position to the field and never gained contention.

Footnotes
MR. MAURICE was settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the far turn, split foes just off the inside entering the
second bend, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch readily advancing on the leaders, then took over late and went clear under firm left handed
encouragement. G FRIDAY tracked the leaders inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the far turn, lost some position nearing upper stretch,
shifted out five wide near the furlong marker and continued with interest to secure the place honors late. PAPA RALPH J, urged to gain a forward racing just
off the leaders to the backstretch, shifted three deep racing into the far turn continuing in pursuit, was held up momentarily avoiding tight quarters midstretch
but continued with a mild late response to prevail for a share. HELLFIRE BOB settled off the second flight racing well off the inside to the backstretch, was
caught four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, then was fanned six wide entering the lane while finishing evenly in the closing
stages. MIKE MIKE sped to the fore along the rail, then was urged inside a rival dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, continued under
prompting to maintain a narrow advantage racing through the far turn to upper stretch and abruptly gave out nearing the sixteenth marker. I HAVE HOPE
angled inwards to track the leaders between foes to the far turn, shifted to the inside nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but proved empty in the
closing stages. STEALADEAL tracked the leaders outside foes in the second flight in the opening half and came up empty racing into the far turn. UNCAGE
THE CAT, rank from the outset and pulling hard against restraint, pressed a rival's pace through the first turn to the far turn, then gave way. ALL STARR
RUNNER broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HIGH ROLLING DUDE was rated just off the first flight tracking inside foes racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was taken in hand
awaiting an opening racing past the quarter mile marker, then came through once gaining a clear path to wrest command from inside the pacesetter and
went clear in time under firm right handed encouragement. GUERRERON, in touch with the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, was held up to
track just off those rivals between foes entering the backstretch, continued between foes into the far turn, angled out four wide nearing midstretch and
produced a steady late response to secure the place honors. FOURTH DESIGN popped through the gate just before the break, was held up off the first
flight while shifting to the three path racing through the first turn, was taken in hand again entering the backstretch when shuffled a bit avoiding close
quarters, switched out four wide nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance, circled foes in that path to gain the advantage in upper stretch while
shifting inwards but faltered leaving the furlong marker. UPPER CROWN, forwardly placed three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, conceded
some position entering the far turn, then angled five wide racing into the stretch to regain some position while making no real impression.
FOUNTAINSTREETKID, held up last racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn but offered no rally. ERIC THE SALESMAN,
caught five wide racing into the first turn while urged to terms with the first turn, angled inwards racing into the backstretch crossing the paths of several
rivals to join a rival on the pace, pressed the issue outside that foe into the far turn and gave way between foes in upper stretch. PATCH'S LUGH, forwardly
placed four wide between foes racing to the backstretch, gave way into the far turn. ACCOUNTANT Q, urged to dispute the pace just off the inside from the
outset, dueled for command along the rail racing through the far turn and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
PEACE TAKER broke readily to gain a position just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, was prompted to close the gap on the leaders three deep
between foes racing into the far turn, shifted in while moving to wrest command racing into upper stretch, then drifted out under left handed pressure in the
closing stages fending off a bid from PERT and just held that rival under strong handling. The latter, reserved inside foes to the backstretch, advanced to
contention along the rail racing into the second bend, angled out racing into upper stretch, moved to challenge the pacesetter in the four path leaving the
furlong marker but shied from that foe, then was steadied losing momentum nearing the wire. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL tracked the leaders outside foes in
second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance in tandem with several rivals nearing the far turn, lost some position when exchanging
bumps with BELLA LINDA entering the second bend, but continued willingly between foes to late stages to regain position to the end. DAKOTA BEACH was
settled three wide between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards avoiding some traffic racing into the far turn and continued between foes just off
the inside to improve position. IMAGINARY FRIEND (IRE) tracked off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing into the backstretch, moved to prompt
the leaders four wide racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. IVORYSGOLDTREASURE, restless in the gate, was held up avoiding tight
quarters at the start, shifted out four wide in the first turn, settled outside foes, then angled inside racing into the stretch while gaining some position but
making no real impact. CLEARLY SEEN settled last and never gained contention. MERMAID KISSES, forwardly placed stalking the pace under light rating
for a half, advanced to press the issue between foes, then inside the winner racing through the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. BELLA LINDA
angled inwards in early stages to track well off the leaders between foes, shifted out on the backstretch, was prompted to advance exchanging contact with
ALL AMERICAN JEWEL while caught five wide racing through the far turn and quickly came up empty. MOR BREEZE sped to the lead along the inside, set
the pace to the far turn and gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO
ACTION.
