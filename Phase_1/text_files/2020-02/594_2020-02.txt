Footnotes
KID MAC COOL stalked two wide, took the lead near quarter pole, drew off under steady pressure while drifting out. SIGHT LINE set the pace just off the
rail, was no match but clearly best of the others. PRINTER, very wide early, moved closer to rail on the final turn, drifted out entering the stretch and tired.
ARRIVEDERCI saved ground throughout and tired. SALUTATION, very wide early, also moved in after a half, drifted out leaving the final turn and tired.
GINNER, bothered badly leaving the gate, passed faders. FINGLAS was also bothered leaving the gate, saved ground and never threatened. GORSUCH,
between foes, stopped. FLYING ROCKET came in sharply leaving the gate bothering foes, was very wide and stopped. SLOT was wide and stopped.

Footnotes
HEROIC OFFICER tracked close up inside, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong and edged away, driving. SOUR
MASH set the pace on the inside, dueled into the lane, dug in gamely between rivals in the stretch drive and battled back gamely to the the place spot. ELL
BE EYE stalked two wide, rallied three wide into the lane, gained a short lead, dug in and was outfinished in deep stretch. WINNISH stalked between rivals,
lacked a bid and weakened. MORE DIAMONDS chased outside, came four wide into the lane and weakened. ROSIE SUMMER raced off the pace, went
four wide past the quarter pole and failed to threaten. DUBLIN MEGAN raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn and did not factor. YOURINDENIAL
raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to respond. PROUD SUPPORTER was outrun early, dropped far back and vanned off after.

strides after the start, split rivals on the backstretch then was left with the rail and was no match late. FLIPPITY FLOP saved ground and tired. FIDUCIARY
VALUES, three wide in second flight, tired. ABUELA LOCA was fractious in the gate and broke slowly, raced wide and stopped. SWEET AUGUST LADY
had only brief speed.

Footnotes
V. I. P. CODE was extremely wide dueling for the early lead, moved in on the turn, took the lead near mid stretch and drew off driving. FACTOR THIS IN
recovered quickly after being bumped leaving the gate, set the pace racing in the five path, was unable to keep pace. EMPEROR JOHN broke slowly and
was outrun early, swung very wide into stretch and was much too late. PHISH FAN bobbled and then came out and bumped foe leaving the gate, raced in
five path and tired. FIRE MISSION broke slowly and was outrun early, passed faders. MARCH SCREAMER broke slowly, raced wide and showed little.
WORTH HIS SALT, three wide and just off the pace, tired. ADULATION was never a serious threat. OFF DUTY dueled for the early lead in the four path
then had nothing left. DON'T MAKE IT EASY was very wide and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
FRAN'S WORRIER racing in the five path on the backstretch, moved out wider on the turn and into stretch, quickly took the lead leaving furlong grounds
and drew off. BRADSHAW, wide early, made his way to the rail on the far turn, split foes in mid stretch and was along for place. HIGH RIDER broke slowly,
raced between foes while outrun, swung wide into stretch and finished with good energy. RULES was two wide dueling for command and tired.
TIZANOXBOW, racing in the four path, failed to menace. FINN'S POSSE, outside, passed tiring foes. ZEN ARCHER saved ground setting the pace, edged
clear on the turn, offered little resistance when challenged and faltered. SUCCEED QUIETLY was very wide and tired. KING VICTORIA saved ground and
never threatened. DEVILRY was wide and no factor.
