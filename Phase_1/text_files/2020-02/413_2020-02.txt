FLAXY LADY pressed the early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, took control at the three furlong marker, met the bid of SHERRY'S JEWEL shook
clear from that rival, opened up and edged clear for the win. MISS RULES was void of any early speed, saved ground into the second turn, was no match
late and finished second best. SHERRY'S JEWEL was allowed to settle early, went five wide into the second turn, made a bid on the winner, couldn't
sustain the run and flattened out. MCADOO was unhurried early, went six wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. DELSMOKE was reserved
early, advanced between rivals and was empty late. CHARLIE'S MEMO set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the first turn, was finished early and
faded.

Footnotes
CHARLIE COMANCH was away in good order then hustled along to set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear lead into the stretch and drew off
with complete authority. STRAWBERRY WHISKY settled off the leaders early, advanced six-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. DATILS
NATIVE LADY pressed the pace of the winner while racing five-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but finished willingly. THIRSTY MONKEY
pressed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. BABY SHAMU settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. DRIFTERS CHOICE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn and
failed to menace. CAUSING CHAOS pressed the pace from between rivals, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. CHET WHO broke sharply to
press the pace from the inside and weakened after going a half. TALKABOUTNAVARONE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the
turn and gradually weakened. FLY WITH PRIDE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. NAVARONES BABYBOY was void
of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. PAPER ROSES showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and
did not offer a bid.
