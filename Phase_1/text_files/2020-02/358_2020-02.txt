LUCKY HERO vied four wide for the early lead, took over on the turn, dueled with KELLI'S SMILE into the lane, dug in gamely inside and prevailed
determinedly late after a long stretch drive. KELLI'S SMILE reluctant to load, vied three wide for the early lead, then chased, bid at the quarter pole, dueled
and dug in gamely between rivals in the final furlong. MR CLASSICAL raced off the pace inside, moved three wide on the turn, rallied four wide into the lane
and dug in gamely outside rivals in the stretch drive. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE vied inside for the lead, then chased and weakened. LITTLE SIETE vied
between rivals for the early lead, then chased between rivals on the turn and tired. PROUD AND FURIOUS raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to
respond.

TARALLUCCI set pace between foes, shook loose on the turn and widened fully extend. SYMPHONY OF LOVE chased the winner racing just off the rail
and couldn't gain. DRIVER'S LICENSE prompted outside winner then tired. GEEWHATSINURWALLET, very wide on the backstretch, tired. FLYING
PLEASANTLY, in the five path, failed to threaten. ALL RIGHT GIRL, between foes, showed little. RED HED SPEIGHTS broke slowly then saved ground.
WROTE TO A DIVA, off slowest, raced wide.

wide at the quarter pole and weakened. TIZ A SHARPIE raced off the rail, off the pace and lacked a rally. RISQUE'S TREASURE chased between rivals

CREATIVE PRINCESS set pace in four path, edged away on the backstretch, drifted out near stretch, extended the lead near mid stretch then was all out to
hang on. IWISHIRISH, just off the rail, moved two wide after a half, drifted out in early stretch, was straightened and closed. RESONATE didn't break
sharply, saved ground to the final turn, moved out three into stretch and rallied. GALILEO'S AFFAIR raced two wide and was not a serious threat. VESTED
VENTURE staked the pace inside winner before tiring. YES MZ ADAH broke slowly, was very wide on the first turn, remained outside and was no threat.
MISS AL DILA, three wide early, dropped back steadily.

Footnotes
JACKS A WARRIOR set the pace in three path under rating, opened a long lead leaving the turn and extended under mild handling. TRULY A MOON
SHOT was five wide and outrun early, was carried wider into and through early stretch, closed strongly to gain place. IRONBOUND, three wide and just off
the pace, tired. CAPE MAY FERRY, racing just off the rail in second flight, gave way. STORMY HIGHWAY took up after the start, saved ground early then
drifted out badly through stretch. REFUNDED saved ground and tired. POLISHED STEEL racing outside, failed to menace. SMART AND TOUGH was three
wide in second flight then had little left. LUNAR ROVER, very wide, showed little. CLEVER CALIBAN raced between foes and failed to threaten.
HUASCARAN was never a serious threat.
