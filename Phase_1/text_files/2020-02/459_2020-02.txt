Footnotes
YOUNGBOY raced within striking distance, moved up on the rail around the turn, challenged for the lead down the stretch, dueling with JAZZY G, drifted in
deep in the stretch, bumping rival and proved the best late. JAZZY G vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, took command around the turn,
dueled late with YOUNGBOY, was bumped repeatedly deep in the lane and outfinished for the win. DISCREET RANDY dueled for the early advantage,
raced three wide around the turn and couldn't keep up with the top two late. MAX PANDOWDY pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn and
finished evenly. INSTAN WIND reared at the break, racing in the back, moved up on the inside, but was no factor. CUSTOM PETE void of early speed and
showed little. HALO CARLOS challenged for the early lead and made a steady retreat. THE JOCKEY OF #3 JAZZY G LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST #4 YOUNGBOY FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE STRETCH. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #4 FROM FIRST
AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
RESILIENCE OF LOVE dueled for the early lead, dueled with THEBOYZDELIGHT around the turn, pulled away and finished well. THEBOYZDELIGHT
challenged for the early advantage, dueled with RESILIENCE OF LOVE, couldn't match strides, but was a clear second at the wire. DIXIE BEAT raced
within striking distance, putting forth an even effort in the early going, made a mild bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for the show. MR RED
SENSATION dueled on the front end, weakened and got caught for third. PERSONAL DOUBLE raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain,
but hung deep in the stretch. AZTEC DELITE vied for the early lead and weakened. HANDFUL OF STRIPES lacked early speed and showed little. IT'S A
SWEET ONE raced in the back and was never a threat. C C HARRIS raced in the middle of the field in the early part and faded. BLACK JUSTICE pressed
the early pace and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
CHAOSMOS challenged for the early lead, drove clear, led throughout and finished well. CRIDER CASH unhurried in the early going, made a late bid and
was just up for second. FREEDOM FACTOR pressed the pace, followed CHAOSMOS throughout and was just caught for second by CRIDER CASH.
LANDING MAN raced in the middle of the field in the beginning, eased back, made a mild bid after turning for home, but was no factor. INTIMIDATING
raced within striking distance, saved ground around the final turn, finished evenly, lacking a late kick. MESETA DIABLO lacked early speed, finished wide
and was no late threat. ACTIF ONE always raced near the back and was outrun. KING'S SHARE showed brief speed and dropped to the back.

the field, made a bid and hung. RHETT'S RACER lacked early speed and was never a threat. CUSTOMS IN DIXIE void of early speed and showed little.
