Footnotes
FIRST EMPRESS angled in and prompted the pace inside then stalked a bit off the rail, re-bid alongside the pacesetter on the second turn to gain the lead
and drew off under a crack of the whip and steady handling then a long hold late. VANNAVANNA BO BANA angled to the inside early then came out on the
first turn and stalked just off the inside to the stretch, drifted in a bit late but edged a rival for the place. SUBTLE RIDE chased outside a rival, came three
wide into the stretch and was edged for second. QUEEN ARYA had speed outside the winner then inched away and angled in on the backstretch, set the
pace along the rail, fought back on the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. CIRCLEOFCOLOR saved ground chasing the pace throughout and
weakened in the drive. TURKISH ANGEL sent between horses early then pulled under a hold, chased outside a rival, dropped back into and on the second
turn, gave way and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
QUERELLE stalked between horses then a bit off the rail into and on the turn and into the stretch, came out in upper stretch and rallied under urging to the
front three wide in late stretch to prove best. SMILING ANNIE prompted the pace outside a rival, stalked just off the inside on the turn, re-bid alongside that
one in the stretch, put a head in front between foes a sixteenth out but could not hold off the winner. ROSES AND CANDY bobbled slightly at the start,
dueled inside, inched away on the turn, fought back a bit off the rail in the stretch and was edged for the place. REMEMBER TO SMILE broke out slightly
and a bit slowly, saved ground stalking the pace throughout and could not quite summon the needed late kick. HOT ON THE TRAIL stalked three deep then
outside a rival on the turn, was between foes in midstretch and also could not quite offer the necessary late response.

BEST CHANCE saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch, bid three deep in midstretch under urging, gained the advantage in deep stretch
and inched clear. RAILSPLITTER had speed between horses then set a pressured pace inside, fought back along the rail in the stretch and just held
second. BROTHER REID chased three deep, came four wide into the stretch and finished well to be edged for the place. CHAMPERS three deep early,
prompted the pace outside the runner-up, fought back between horses in midstretch and was outfinished for a minor award. MASTER RECOVERY pulled
and steadied off heels early, angled in and steadied in tight again on the first turn, saved ground stalking the pace to the stretch and could not quite summon
the needed late kick. NEGOTIATOR angled in and tugged early, chased between horses to the stretch and also lacked the necessary late response.
PALACE PRINCE between horses early, stalked outside a rival, came three deep into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. CANADIAN PRIDE four wide
into the first turn, chased outside a rival, came out into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response in the drive. DR. HOFFMAN broke slowly then
steadied when squeezed back, angled in then came out on the backstretch went outside a rival on the second turn, angled out into the stretch and lacked a
further response. DUDE'S DREAM broke out and bumped a rival, drifted out early then angled in, pulled and steadied off heels twice on the first turn, came
out into the backstretch, saved ground off the pace, angled out a bit into the stretch and had little left for the drive.
