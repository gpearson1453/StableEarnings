Footnotes
WARTIME LADY saved ground from midpack around the first turn, shifted off the rail and commenced a rally in the three path and between horses around
the far turn, swung to the five path to be outside of the leaders turning for home and swept past inside the final furlong. SHINE ON ME pulled two to three
wide in midpack and between horses before settling down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, surged up the rail inside of the leader turning
for home, reached the lead passing the furlong pole, but was quickly worn down by an outer oncharging rival. LADY IN GREEN stalked in the three path,
vied into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with GEE CEE CEE into the far turn, kept on and rebid in the four path turning for home as that rival
weakened, but got outfinished by multiple rivals. GEE CEE CEE set the pace in the two path, drew clear of rivals into the far turn, held an advantage while
drifting to the three path turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch, was headed at the furlong pole, and wilted between horses late.
WILLINLILVILLIAN vied along the inside into the first turn, but was wrangled off the pace into the backstretch, saved ground in midpack around the far turn
before shooting to the seven path in upper stretch, then came up empty in the late stages. IMLITTLEBITCOUNTRY was never involved while in the four to
five path. ABRAAJEENA trailed while caught five wide into the first turn, then failed to factor thereafter. SATTA prompted the pace in the four path into the
backstretch, but weakened passing the half mile pole and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PEACEABLE KINGDOM pulled through a rail opening inside of ANCONA to reach the lead around the first turn, settled into stride while under a tight hold
into the backstretch, maintained an advantage until being collared by ANCONA at the five sixteenths pole, dueled gamely inside of that foe through the lane,
and won the headbob at the wire. ANCONA set the pace in the two path into the first turn, allowed a headstrong PEACEABLE KINGDOM to take the lead
into the backstretch, stalked that foe until inching forward into the far turn, hooked her inner rival and commenced a duel at the five sixteenths pole, dueled
gamely through the lane and PEACEABLE KINGDOM dug in, but lost the headbob at the wire. ITSTHE BLACK DALIA trailed her trio of foes around the first
turn, advanced into show at the half mile pole past a weakening ANNA SIOUX, but failed to keep pace with the dueling leaders around the far turn and was
no threat thereafter. ANNA SIOUX broke inwards, saved ground off of the pace, but weakened to trail the field at the half mile pole, and showed little.
