Footnotes
HARPER'S DEELITE was coaxed along on the outside, tracked five wide on the turn, was roused while six wide at the top of the stretch, came under a
right-handed whip near the three-sixteenths, chased into the final furlong, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then switched to a left-handed whip and
moved clear under strong urging. SOUTHERN LIGHT was ridden along towards the rear, went three then four wide on the turn, came under the whip
outside the quarter-pole, angled seven wide into upper stretch under a drive, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the
place. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, was urged along passing the five-sixteenths, shook
clear under a drive in upper stretch, was collared by the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened while able to hold the show. DOUBLE PRIORITY
settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the turn, dropped in under a right-handed whip in the stretch, reached the rail into the final furlong
and failed to rally. FIRST METAL COUNT showed good speed and disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into
the stretch, dropped back under a drive past the three-sixteenths and tired. EEPOPPORK TIME tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased four wide
on the turn, was carried five wide into the stretch and came up empty. INCASED IN TIME settled towards the rear of the field, was urged along while saving
ground on the turn and failed to threaten. BOSTON LOVER was urged along at the rear, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path and was
no factor.

Footnotes
PRINCESS TRINA broke out then was corrected by the rider, stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, engaged the leader in the two to three
path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, moved to a length advantage while put to a drive into upper stretch, drifted in some coming to
the furlong marker then responded well while put to a left-handed whip and held under strong urging. SENSIBLE MYTH brushed with a foe at the start, was
well spotted just off the pace while outside of FOR REEF'S SAKE, moved out some leaving the backstretch, chased three to four wide on the turn, pursued
the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. BANSHEE BIRDIE was carried out at the start, settled off the pace, moved in near
the half-mile pole, came out into the turn, went four to five wide on that bend, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased under a left-handed whip in upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick while able to get the
show. MARQUEE MOMENT showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside while challenged to her outside on the turn, lost the lead under urging
outside the quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch, kept on in the battle for the show position in the final furlong but missed that position
while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. FOR REEF'S SAKE raced just off the pace under some restraint, was taken up while trying to get out some
leaving the backstretch, saved ground while guided around the turn with extra left rein pressure, turned into the stretch in the two path, was asked for her
best under a strong hand ride before the three-sixteenths, moved out inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. KRAFT'S RATE broke out
and awkwardly then brushed with a foe, was reserved off the pace, drifted out near the seven-sixteenths, was roused while three to four wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BAYLOR settled at the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path on the turn, moved out in the final
furlong and failed to threaten. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
KATZARELLI was fractious in the gate, pressed the early pace from inside and just off the rail, eased back late up the backstretch content to track, saved
ground shifting nearer the rail into the turn, came out a path leaving that bend in behind rivals, moved out four wide nearing the three-sixteenths, put to
urging and drew even a sixteenth out then edged away willingly late. DAGGERS ARCH bobbled inwardly and a half-step slow at the start, had some
awkward strides about the five-eighths pole racing inside, switched off the rail dropping back at that juncture, moved out three wide entering the turn and a
further path near the midpoint of that bend, struck the lead in upper stretch but was overtaken late while clear of the rest. ARCHRIVAL broke a half step
slowly, raced outside foes at the rear going five wide on the turn, appeared to shy outwardly from a left-handed whip, received a correction in the reins and
no further use of the whip and ran on willingly to get up for show honors. BUY IT vied between rivals early then inside a foe but off the fence shifting in early
on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch but fought on late to outfinish a rival for the minor award. RED HOT DEVIL pressed the pace from outside going
three then two wide through the turn with a narrow lead leaving that bend, lacked the needed late kick. SEMI CHARMED DAY raced between foes and
steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths as the inside rival came out losing about a couple lengths in the process, trailed through the turn racing removed from
the rail in the two to three path and shifting four to five wide out of that bend, passed a tired foe in the stretch. TRAELEE was inside rivals toward the back
early, began to move out a bit then was forced out a little bit early entering the turn, went three then four wide but mostly four deep through that bend, tired
in the lane.

Footnotes
CIRRUSLY was bumped lightly shortly after the start then taken in hand, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back of the field, went
three wide early on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, came five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final
furlong and closed fast to go past the dueling leaders late and prevail under strong handling. SEVEN JEWELS was carried out into the first turn then caught
five wide on that bend, settled towards the front on the outside, went four to five wide on the far turn, was put to a drive into upper stretch, made an outside
bid inside the three-sixteenths, dueled with PRICELESS NELLIE in the final furlong, got the best of that foe late but was caught by the winner while just able
to get the place. PRICELESS NELLIE went to the front, set the pace on the inside while in hand, extended the advantage with a half-mile to run, controlled
the action while against the rail on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch then challenged by SEVEN JEWELS, dueled with that foe in the final
furlong and just missed the place while clear for the show. CELESTIAL DREAM broke out at the start, was guided in early, rounded the first turn in the two
path, was rated just off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. EVERY SINGLE DAY traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch under the whip, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, dropped in inside the furlong marker
and tired. OXBOWINDY broke out and bumped lightly with ENDLESS ROMANCE then was bumped by that foe shortly thereafter, went four wide on the first
turn, settled towards the back, saved ground on the far turn and failed to rally. KORAT QUEEN went three wide for most of the first turn then moved to four
wide, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while four then five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. ENDLESS ROMANCE was bumped
lightly by OXBOWINDY at the start then came in and bumped that foe early, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside under a snug
hold, dropped back three wide on the far turn and retreated. SILENT TRICK saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped well behind late on
the backstretch, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path and was distanced in the stretch. (Rail at 25 Feet) HALF-MILE FRACTION

CITY PARK lunged just slightly then was taken up in tight quarters a few strides out of the gate dropping back to last and tucking in to about the two path
into the first turn, edged closer into the far turn coming three wide into that bend but quickly shifting to the five path while sweeping past rivals, struck the
lead in upper stretch under urging and quickly drew clear, was taken in hand near the sixteenth pole but then re-asked nearing the wire to ensure the victory
over GUITAR SLIM, who got away a half-step slowly, raced mid-pack along the inside just off the rail through the first turn in the clear, advanced inside foes
late up the backstretch then two wide and between foes early on the far turn before shifting out a further path on that bend, swung six wide turning for home,
drifted in a bit in mid-stretch and closed the gap inside the aforementioned but was strictly second best. DRILLING REPORT was four wide between foes
into the first turn, continued four wide outside through the remainder of that bend as ARCTIC ROSE moved forward to dictate terms, stalked from outside
that rival moving up to apply pressure three wide on the far turn, made a mild bid late on that bend but could not sustain the effort and proved no match for
the top two. THUNK raced behind foes early then settled into stride last but one racing off the fence two to four wide through the first turn, continued to trail
up the backstretch going in the two to three path on the far turn and advancing inside a rival out of that bend coming four wide to the quarter pole, drifted a
bit in upper stretch receiving some correction and ran on to pass tired foes. FLAT OUT CAT was forwardly-positioned three wide between foes into the first
turn, eased back leaving that bend and moved out a path early up the backstretch, lost ground heading to the far turn racing outside foes late up the
backstretch, continued four wide on the far turn coming a bit closer to the leaders but lacked the needed late kick. ARCTIC ROSE had heels clipped behind
soon after the start, was mildly coaxed forward outside foes five then four wide on the first turn coming in a further path up the backstretch while dictating
terms in the clear, was challenged from outside on the far turn going in about the two path through that bend then gave way in the stretch. LILRASCALMAN
was forwardly-placed inside foes but in the two path early, continued to track behind the leaders up the backstretch, dropped back inside foes on the far turn
and came up empty. BRITTS A CLOSER clipped heels of a rival shortly after the start, went in the three path in the clear on the first turn, edged closer up
the backstretch three wide and between runners nearing the nine-sixteenths, continued three to four deep on the far turn while dropping back and faded in
the lane.

prevailed. MAJESTIC JOHN'S was hustled to the lead, set the pace on the inside, was asked while headed at the quarter-pole, dueled gamely inside of the

Footnotes
BY MY STANDARDS stalked the pacesetter from outside going three deep through the first turn, edged closer willingly and without urging still three deep on
the far turn, took charge past the quarter pole, was mildly shaken up near the three-sixteenths, the rider looked back nearing the furlong marker for
competition and saw none, extended the margin through the lane without subsequent encouragement. TWO EMMYS broke on top and dictated terms inside
just off the fence shadowed by the winner, continued just removed from the rail on the far turn, was asked for more at the quarter pole but overtaken at that
juncture, ran on to preserve the place while no match for the winner. BROTH was kept well outside a rival in the three to four path through the early going,
continued three deep on the far turn and asked for more by the five-sixteenths, moved between foes turning for home and kept on under urging late. SO
ALIVE broke inwardly just a bit and a half-step slowly, raced inside just off the rail, asked for more past the three-eighths but failed to produce a rally. ONE
MEAN MAN pursued the leaders from outside four wide on the first turn and closer to the five path while appearing not to corner that well, continued four to
five deep on the far turn and was empty thereafter.

Footnotes
DAWN'S DANCER was rated on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, wandered five wide into the stretch,
was put to a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, chased the leader into the final furlong, took over while drifting out in the final sixteenth and went
clear under steady urging. RAIN DANCE pressed the pace on the outside while under a snug hold, vied three then two wide on the turn, took a short lead
outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear into the stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to hold the place. QUEEN
OF THE LANE was hustled from the start, showed speed then dropped just off the pace, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path,
shifted three wide under urging into the stretch, pursued the top two in the drive and finished with good courage to just miss the place while clear for the
show. MOM'S PASS bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, angled out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed response while gaining some ground. ONE STEP set the pace while getting pressure to her outside, vied in the two path
early on the turn then dropped to the rail, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back while crowded a touch nearing the quarter-pole, moved off
the rail under a drive into upper stretch and weakened. GLOBAL BRAND broke a bit slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn,
drifted inward in upper stretch, showed good interest while gaining in the final furlong, moved out late and missed the superfecta. WELL RESPECTED
bumped with a rival at the start, settled under some urging, was ridden along while three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to
threaten. TALE OF MONA broke out then was corrected with a tug of the left rein, settled under some urging, was ridden along while saving ground on the
turn and was no factor. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
TWO UTES settled just off the pace on the outside, made an outside bid while asked in the four path on the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole,
shook clear under a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a right-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then drifted in close to the rail
and held under steady urging. MR. PRODUCTION pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path early on the turn, took the lead outside the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage while between horses outside the quarter-pole, dropped back inside the three-sixteenths then was switched out near the
furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. JADE'S AUTUMN SKY settled just off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, shifted three wide
into the stretch then tipped out a path further, chased into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. ALAN'S ARGUMENT set the
pace under pressure from his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch, steadied
while in tight against the rail at the three-sixteenths and weakened. BARROW ROAD moved out while towards the rear, shifted further out leaving the
backstretch, was urged along while five wide on the turn and failed to rally. CARLOS PUNCH was slow into stride, settled at the rear, went three wide on the
turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to respond.
