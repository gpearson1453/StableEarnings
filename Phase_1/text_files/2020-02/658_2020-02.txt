MISS SHAWHAN was well place, bid five wide, closed steadily, got up late and inched away. IS IT GOLD pressed the pace, bid between horses into the
second turn to challenge for the lead, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. TANAGER was steadied into the first turn, saved
ground, bid willingly and got up for show. DONTTELLMYHUSBAND was never far back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, finished well and gained
late. GATTAIA set the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to duel and faltered near the sixteenth pole. SLEIGH RIDE pressed the pace,
challenged three across on the second turn, bore out and gave way. HOUSEMAKER (GB) broke awkwardly to be off slowly, trailed the field and was not a
threat.

rival to get up in the final strides. MIDNIGHT REVERIE pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, inched away for a short lead and was
caught near the wire. EDDYSHAK raced close to the pace inside, angled out on the turn, went willingly to the wire and got up for show.

late. TODO ES TORO saved ground, was rated early and lacked a late response. CHRISTINE'S JACK bumped at the start, raced in the back and lacked a
stretch response. CATS SURFIN trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. MY LUCKY MARK set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and stopped.

Footnotes
LUCKY CARLENE veered in and was steadied at the start, raced in the back, advanced to the turn, bid eight wide, closed willingly and wore down her rival,
got up late and drew clear. SIERRA SUMMER bumped at the start, assumed command into the backstretch, drew off for a clear lead, led past the sixteenth
pole and was outclosed to finish second best. EASY DOES IT was crowded at the start, raced mid pack, closed under strong urging and got up for show.
MY MIA MYAH bumped at the start, settled off the pace, bid four wide and hung late. LADY ELSA lagged early, went widest in the drive, offered a mild bid
and didn't have enough left. OWEN'S SHOT broke out, showed speed to the second turn and flattened out. SEVEN POINTS led around the first turn, fell
back, saved ground, bid and came up empty. GOVENESS SHEILA failed to respond. HAY BELLES was not a factor. BONES AND ROSES was through
after a half, tired and stopped. Hand timed.
