came three wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. WHATA FLIRT was outsprinted to the turn then saved ground to no avail. REBEL AT

Footnotes
NORWEGIAN went right to the front, set the pace off the rail to the second turn, was three wide into the stretch, edged away to mid stretch then was tiring
and was under strong urging to hold. FLORISTA (IRE) had no speed, settled to the second turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch then closed with a rush
but was too late. FRUITFULLY chased the winner to the backstretch, pushed up inside that one to try to engage for the lead, was outkicked on the second
turn while saving ground and finished willingly. STORMY MIST threw her head and broke about four lengths last, tracked the pace from the rail for six
furlongs but lacked a closing response. TIZ ALWAYS MUSIC pressed the pace to the backstretch, raced two wide on the second turn but came up empty in
the drive. LUCILLE had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SITTIN AND THINKIN pressed the leader three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down, took over leaving mid stretch and held driving. PRORIKA set the
pace two wide to the stretch, could not stall the winner in mid stretch but had enough left to hold second. HOPSCOTCHY was slow to settle into a
comfortable stride and trailed two wide, tried to rally when roused for the drive but finished evenly. RAMONCITA LIGHT tracked the pace to the turn, was
caught four wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late response. BABY'S GOT CLASS chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then came up empty.

Footnotes
PREMIUM FOREST was unhurried to the second turn then was put to a drive leaving the three eighths, rallied two wide to the stretch, shifted out and
continued to respond in the drive to win going away. SHOT OF A LIFETIME was allowed to settle off the fast pace to the half, raced two wide to the stretch
then could not match the winner but finished steadily for the place. MONSAJEM ACCRETE was also unhurried for a half mile, raced two wide while closing
the gap to the stretch but was outfinished in the final furlong. BAM BAM BRYAN hustled to contest a fast pace outside of LA WAUN, dueled for six furlongs
but tired in mid stretch and gave way. GOBSMACK lagged to the second turn, closed the gap three wide to the stretch but could not threaten in the drive. LA
WAUN hurried along early to set a sizzling pace, saved ground on the second turn but tired through the drive.

Footnotes
SWEET BOY broke alertly and went right to the front, set the pace under pressure from MAHI MAHI for six furlongs, responded to hold the lead to mid
stretch then battled doggedly inside to hold by a whisker. MAHI MAHI pressed the winner throughout, was two wide to the stretch then dug in determinedly
but just missed. DIRT ROAD RED was settled to the half, moved up to loom a threat three wide on the second turn but got outkicked to mid stretch and
weakened. DEEPINGREEN stalked the top two to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. TIZ EMMA had no speed, settled
to the half, was two then three wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE had no speed and was never a threat.
