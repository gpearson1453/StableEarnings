Footnotes
STORM RISK was allowed to settle early two to three wide, angled widest leaving the far turn, and surged late on the far outside to overtake CROI MOR in
the closing strides. CROI MOR stalked the leaders outside, bid three wide at the top of the lane, forged clear in deep stretch but could not hold off the top
one. FARM STRONG came under a ride midway on the far turn three wide, gained only minimally into the stretch, then found his best stride late to be along
for the show. AT THE BEACH pressed the pace outside SULTANNES CROWN, reached a short lead approaching the stretch, but weakened in the late
stages. SULTANNES CROWN set a brisk early pace inside, battled on in the two-path turning for home, but weakened through the last furlong. TAP
MEMORIES found his way to the inside early, lodged a mild bid along the rail through the furlong grounds but did not have enough late. STILL SCHEMIN
saved ground outrun for six furlongs, angled wide into the stretch and gained mildly. LOVEDISC broke open the gate unseating the rider prior to the start,
got away without further incident, raced two wide on the turns, and was in traffic not fully set down through the last sixteenth of a mile. AVANT GARDE had
the rail on the turns, moved to the two-path at the top of the lane and posed no threat. ROAN MOUNTAIN was outrun inside. ULTRACONFIDENT raced
widest up the backstretch, and was done before reaching the stretch. FRANCO'S TEAM broke open the gate prior to the start, lost contact with the field
early, was pulled up early on the backstretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
PANGO raced in contention near the inside and settled under slight restraint, tipped out and headed in pursuit mid-way around the turn, moved up to race in
striking distance with a furlong left to run then edged away deep stretch under a driving finish. DISCREET HEAT was forwardly placed out of the chute and
continued in close range tracking the leader down the backstretch, launched a bid for command near seven-sixteenths pole and vied for the lead with
ANIMAL TRICK around the turn, continued to battle back with the added challenge of PANGO in stretch run, kept on with good response but got outkicked
in final stages. ANIMAL TRICK held a slim lead out of the chute then set the pace along the rail down the backstretch, took on the challenge from
DISCREET HEAT and vied around the turn, fought back gamely from inside position into final stages then lacked closing kick. TOTONO raced six wide
through early stages sitting off the early front-runners, hustled up along the outside around the turn then kept under a ride five to six wide in the lane and
failed to make and impact on the top trio. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) was forwardly placed in opening stages and stalked through the backstretch, roused for
more upon entering the turn but came up empty and gave way. ARRIVEDERLA drifted out sharply at the start, quickly corrected and angled to the inside,
tugged up a bit closer then steadied nearing the five-eights pole, raced wide into the lane and had no late response. MR CHAPLIN raced three to four wide
in early stages and raced in the last flight although not too far off the early pace then had no response when called upon in the turn.

ATTACHMENT RATE moved fast in tandem with RAG TAG as they overtook the spent pacesetter midway on the turn, dueled inside RAG TAG in the
two-path past the quarter-pole, kicked away in upper stretch and drew off under pressure on the wrong lead. RAG TAG gained rapidly outside
ATTACHMENT RATE as they rocketed past BYCHANCE on the turn, could not match strides into the stretch, and ran on second best. TONS OF GOLD
brushed with BRAND while swinging out four wide at the top of the stretch, and offered a mild response to pick up a share. SEVEN AND SEVEN chased
three wide for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late bid. BRAND was slow into stride, brushed with TONS OF GOLD while outside that one in the
five-path at the top of the stretch, and could not gain. SAG HARBOR raced two then three wide on the turn, and could not menace. BYCHANCE sped off to
a lengthy lead through fast early fractions, and stopped abruptly midway on the turn. MR. PHILLY DILLY broke in and bobbled at the start, took a bad step
at the quarter-pole and lost the rider, was apprehended and vanned off. Due to a timer malfunction all times have been omitted.

Footnotes
EARTHQUAKE raced five wide in the back through early stages then edged closer to race four deep going by the half mile marker, prompted and advanced
into the position behind the leader around the far turn, remained in game pursuit for MY GPS entering the lane, kicked by rival past the furlong marker then
grew sharp on top and finished going away. MY G P S held a slim lead in the opening quarter then cleared on top and raced three wide down the
backstretch, was put to a drive mid-way around the far turn and kept under steady pressure into the lane, got collared by the winner past the furlong marker
and settled for second best. L' CRISTABAL was away in good order and stalked the pacesetter through early stages, hustled up racing between foes at thee
eighths pole, weakened off the top pair leaving the far turn then churned on for share. MR. CESCO settled in opening quarter then was hustled up along the
inside and gained position nearing the half mile marker, kept under a ride around the far turn then tired in the drive. QUICK ENOUGH tracked the early pace
then was ridden along to maintain tempo at half mile marker then came up empty three furlongs from home and dropped back.

Footnotes
MONEY MOVES broke a step slowly, recovered to the middle of the pack early, was ridden along midway on the turn not gaining appreciably, swung four
wide at the top of the stretch, and kicked in late to wear down SAGAMORE MISCHIEF and draw clear. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF hustled up to grab the early
lead, shook off SKY MISCHIEF and TOUCHPOINT after a half-mile, remained clear to 70 yards out and was run down from there. MUKULWITZ bumped
with TAPI FROST at the start, raced in midpack early, swung five wide off the turn and rallied mildly. TARTUFO lagged well back three wide to the stretch,
and was up late outside for the last major share. SKY MISCHIEF pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, and yielded larger shares through the last 50
yards lightly urged. PIANZI was two wide on the turn and did not factor. TAPI FROST bumped with MUKULWITZ at the start, steadied behind PIANZI
heading into the turn, and made no headway inside. TOUCHPOINT pressed the early pace, lodged a mild three-wide bid a quarter-mile out, and gave way
through the lane. METCALF angled to the far outside leaving the far turn at the back, and remained outrun. ASTAIRE was always outrun. TERIYAKI headed
up the second flight three to four wide into the turn, could not maintain position after a half and faded steadily.

Footnotes
STARSHIP APOLLO shifted off the inside and hustled up from the get-go, advanced to join the second flight near the half mile marker then moved up to
challenge RAY'SWARRIOR for the lead mid-way around the turn, vied into stretch run, dug in determinedly under steady pressure then forged ahead in final
stages. RAY'SWARRIOR hustled up out of the gate and led the way down the backstretch, took on the challenge from STARSHIP APOLLO midway around
the turn, dueled for the lead into stretch run, fought back from the inside position then failed to move on with foe in final stages. KYLE was forwardly placed
and raced along the rail through early stages then angled out around the turn, shifted out wider under left handed pressure in stretch run and continued a
steady effort to prevail for a share. BLACK PEPPER positioned off the early leaders and raced widest through early stages, coaxed along the outside
around the turn, continued to prompt racing wide in the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. RESIDENT raced off the pace and saved
ground through early stages and around the turn, urged two to three wide top stretch but failed to kick on. PARTICULARITY chased in a forward position
through the backstretch then gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
TAPAGE stroke awkwardly along the rail heading into the first turn, began taking better hold of the footing tracking behind the leaders inside up the
backstretch, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, battled outside OXIDE and OR'EFFICE through a long drive and gamely prevailed. OR'EFFICE
had aim off the leaders four wide early, vied for command outside OXIDE past the three-eighths, had TAPAGE join the party from outside turning for home,
and battled on with good courage between those two to the finish. OXIDE got the best of an early tussle with WALK UP MUSIC into the far turn, was
confronted soon after that by OR'EFFICE, fought inside that one and TAPAGE through a long drive and was edged near the wire. TURN OF EVENTS
stayed in range for six furlongs, made no headway through the stretch under pressure, and had the rider lose both irons coming to the wire. SANDRO THE
GREAT bumped lightly a couple times with HOOYAH at the start, raced in the second flight three then four wide to the stretch, and passed only tired horses.
ELUSIVE RULER raced four wide into the backstretch, and was finished after six furlongs. WIN D'ORO had no response two wide. PAINTSVILLE was
never prominent. WALK UP MUSIC vied inside OXIDE to the end of the backstretch, and faltered into the far turn. HOOYAH bumped lightly with SANDRO
THE GREAT a couple times at the start, lost contact with the field soon after completing a half-mile, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CARRIGAN raced in close contention sitting just off the top pair in early stages, moved up to challenge SECREST MISS for the lead near the
quarter pole, shifted out wide under left handed pressure in stretch run, dug in determinedly and cleared in final stages. SECRET MISS held a slim lead over
R LOVELY JULZ in early stages then began to edge away from rival while taking on PRINCESS CARRIGAN near the quarter pole, vied into stretch run,
stayed game in response but could not match with the winner in final stages. R LOVELY JULZ was sent hard at the start and raced a half length off of
SECRET MISS through early stages, was put to a drive but could not reach equal terms with foe around the turn but stayed on with interest in the lane and
cleared show. CATALINA R raced under steady urging through early stages, kept under strong handling racing four wide in upper stretch but lacked the
needed response for impact. ANGELIC KNUGGET bumped the side of the gate then raced two wide in range through early stages, flattened off the top trio
late turn then swung wide entering top stretch and had no late response. KERRY IT raced wide in the back throughout and failed to make a bid.

SOUPER JAGUAR got clear early, rated along removed from the rail into the turn, came into the stretch moving steadily wider, and prevailed while winding
up well past the middle of the track. FIRST AND THREE advanced three wide after six furlongs, finished willingly while a considerable ways inside SOUPER
JAGUAR, and settled for second best. GRAY BEAU was outrun four wide to the top of the lane, and kept on well enough in the middle of the track to get up
for the show. MOZO BELLO chased after the winner three wide to the turn, moved inside approaching the stretch and could not gain, and yielded third near
the finish. UNDAUNTED raced three wide around the turn, and was not a factor. TRANSISTOR showed speed inside for a half-mile, faltered around the
turn, was eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
HIGH ROAD broke on top and led the way around the first turn, set the pace near the inside with ENJOYITWILLWECAN racing in close contention,
challenged by rival and maintained a narrow lead near the half mile marker, vied inside around the far turn then got headed briefly upper stretch, fought
back gamely, took back a slight edge and just lasted. ENJOYITWHILEWECAN was forwardly placed and raced just off the leader through early stages,
moved up to apply pressure to HIGH ROAD near the half mile marker, vied for the lead around the far turn then continued to battle back into stretch run,
stayed on gamely and just missed. CODRINGTON was allowed to settle out of the gate then continued unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch,
responded sharply when prompted and moved up the inside into contention around the far turn, urged left handed and drifted out very wide in stretch, kept
on with good response and was getting to the winner in final stride. SOUL SPIRIT was unhurried and raced two wide down the backstretch, stayed in same
path and put to a drive top stretch but failed to kick on. ISLA ROAD raced in contention and tracked the top pair down the backstretch then failed to advance
when called upon in the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
COOKIE DOUGH tugged intently outside TWEETING under a snug hold early, ran past that one when given her cue midway on the far turn well out in the
track, shifted wider still with GOLDEN AWARD looming to her outside and QUEEN NEKIA to her inside at the top of the stretch, and repelled those threats
under steady pressure. GOLDEN AWARD was four wide up the backstretch eyeing the pacesetters in the clear, moved after COOKIE DOUGH from the
outside past the three-eighths, got floated out a bit by the leader turning for home, neglected to change leads until very late and was just up for second
outside. QUEEN NEKIA bounced off the left side of the gate lightly at the start, steadied briefly inside COACH ROCKS heading to the first turn, crept closer
to the leaders after six furlongs, rallied in the two-path into the stretch and finished with good courage inside the top two. TWEETING set the pace inside,
yielded to challengers after six furlongs, stayed on the rail and ran on late. COACH ROCKS was taken well out in the track leaving the first turn, and could
not keep pace after six furlongs while remaining outside. RESTLESS RIDER trailed to the stretch and was allowed to fade away steadily. AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF GOLDEN AWARD ALLEGING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

SECOND COMING raced off the speed and positioned widest through early stages, prompted near the half mile marker, responded willingly, quickly
advanced to the lead past five-sixteenths then widened to a clear advantage top stretch then stayed sharp under steady encouragement. TIZAHRA raced in
the last flight and ridden along two wide down the backstretch, hustled up along the outside around the turn, put to a drive six wide top of the lane, could not
reach the winner but produced a solid bid. BEAUTY BUZZ raced off the top trio in opening quarter, hustled up and raced along inside late turn, switched out
a path top stretch and raced along for show. BAY HARBOR raced up close three wide down the backstretch, flattened under pressure around the turn then
faded in the lane. MARIPOSA BELLE raced in the last flight and saved ground down the backstretch, angled out around the turn and failed to move into
contention. JEANA'S GEM was away last then quickly moved up the inside to take a slim lead, continued on top then got collared by the winner near
five-sixteenths and had nothing left in the lane. LA MEILLEURE raced up close just off the leader down the backstretch, continued in striking range three
furlongs from home then faded late turn.
