Footnotes
ALWAYS TALKING set the pace along the rail, kicked clear while stuck on the left lead, finally switched past the eighth pole and drew off under a drive.
LILLY'S LIL GEM prompted the winner two wide, could not keep pace in the lane but held well enough to be clearly second best. ALPHA GIRL chased the
pace two wide, could not keep pace around the turn, lacked a rally and held for the show. WILD CAPPUCINO had some speed inside, angled out early on
the turn, dropped around the bend, angled four wide nearing the lane and lacked a closing bid. BIGDADDYSGLORY was outrun inside. DOWN WITH
BROWN had only brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
ORDER FOR PORKY accelerated to the inside of rivals and took command leaving the chute, rated kindly while handling some outside pressure, moved
clear mid turn, dug in when confronted by TOY near the three sixteenths, responded to solid handling to edged back clear then held firm while under steady
hand encouragement the final yards. TOY rated back off foes soon after the break and dropped towards the rail, tracked under patient rating, shifted out
three wide for room entering the lane, ranged up to threaten the winner, failed to match strides past the eighth pole, continued willingly and was clearly
second best. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE broke a step slow, was hustled up and forced the issue outside ORDER FOR PORKY, kept that one honest to about
mid turn, shifted in to pursue into the lane, faded but outdid OUR FLAG for the show. OUR FLAG stalked the leaders three wide, was still under some rating
with aim mid turn, failed to seriously kick on when put to asking and faded in the final furlong. LORD TIZ rated off the pace, lost ground three to four wide,
shifted in and came up empty. YIKES broke a bit awkwardly and failed to menace.

DON'T MAKE IT EASY pressed the pace in the three path, slowly gained through the stretch, seized command inside the sixteenth pole and edged ahead
under a drive. TAMBORA set the pace in the two path, drifted out a bit in the lane, led past the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. SOUND OFF settled
off the pace along the inside, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. FIRE MISSION lacked early speed, raced two wide between foes around
the turn, angled widest in upper stretch and had a mild rally. RELENTLESS LION chased the early pace three wide and faded around the turn.

PITCHING ARI rated two wide and just behind a contested pace, dropped in leaving the far turn and got through along the rail to bid, moved clear of rivals
past the five sixteenths and was guided out a bit, opened up under solid handling in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. MY FRIENDS BEER ,
taken to rate off the pace while saving ground, advanced to the inside of rivals nearing the furlong marker, eased out and closed steadily on his left lead.
INDY'S JEWEL took command early and set a pressured pace in the two path, had the winner get through to his inside leaving the far turn, forced the issue
between foes past the three eighths, gave way grudgingly and saved the show. COURT SKY disputed the pace three wide outside INDY'S JEWEL, came a
bit wider under pressure into the lane and lacked the needed response. TAPPING THE GLASS , in range while off the inside, angled out four to five wide
past the quarter pole and came up epmty.

GROUP TEXT was soundly bumped at the start, trailed early, circled four wide around the turn, came six wide into lane, closed strongly, seized command
leaving the eighth pole and powered clear. TRULY HOT broke awkwardly, saved ground in midpack to upper stretch, slowly angled out through upper
stretch, was in the clear four wide past the ieghth pole and rallied for the place. COCKTAIL WAITRESS was bumped at the start, prompted the pace two
wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, vied past midstretch and weakened late. CASTLE RIDGE stalked the pace from the rail, steadied near the
half-mile pole, angled three wide leaving the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch, was abreast for the lead in midstretch then flattened out. MY T TALK bore in
and bumped GROUP TEXT into several other foes at the start, raced off the pace outside, made a three wide move between foes around the turn but failed
to sustain in the lane. VANIDOSA was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. DAT DARES GOLD set the pace along the rail and tired
through the stretch.

Footnotes
SIERRA LEONA saved ground while well within range early on, dropped back under some coaxing mid turn, swung five wide into the lane, came back
under left handed encouragement leaving mid stretch, forged ahead of HASHTAG SELFIE inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. KABUKI vied inside
early on, allowed HASHTAG SELFIE to go on leaving the three quarter pole, shifted out to pursue around the turn, raced three wide into the lane,
challenged between foes nearing the sixteenth pole and continued willingly. HASHTAG SELFIE sparred outside KABUKI before going clear past the six
furlong marker, opened up a lengthy advantage while under a light hold mid turn, saw her lead dwindle near mid stretch, failed to resist rivals leaving the
sixteenth marker and faltered. LETMESLIDEBYYOU , well back early, fanned six wide into the lane, had some late interest but failed to seriously threaten.
EMMA'SDIAMONDDIVA hesitated at the break, lagged far back, raced four wide into the lane, shifted in and came up empty.

ELIZABETH T set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. ROMA DELIGHT tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out to bid between rivals in
upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on well enough to be a clear second. ANY MINUTE NOW stalked the pace two wide, bid three deep
in upper stretch but flattened out. PALACE CHECK chased the pace three wide and faded nearing the lane. HOME BY SEVEN failed to menace while
racing two wide.
