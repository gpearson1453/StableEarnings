Footnotes
KULANI came away a step slow and settled close through the backstretch, raced three wide through the turn, took the lead mid-stretch and drew clear later
yards. GATTOSING set the pace inside, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch then flattened stride later yards.
ORILEYS TYPHOON gave chase off the rail then came through the turn in the four path and finished evenly. HOLD MY BEER veered out at the break then
angled in to give chase two deep, dueled at a close disadvantage to mid turn but dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened.
TEXMAGEDDON lacked speed through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little more. WINDSOR HILL lacked speed inside
through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then drifted outward down the lane.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN BARBECUE stalked the early pace two deep then took the lead between horses nearing the three eighths pole, briefly ceded to Upperville
approaching the quarter pole but battled back at the rail mid turn, raced clear into the lane, was steadily encouraged to mid-stretch then taken in hand later
yards. STEPS TO GLORY saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide, dueled for second mid-stretch
and was gaining on the winner. UPPERVILLE raced in the three and four paths the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, challenged toward the three
eighths and dueled to a slim brief lead two deep nearing the quarter pole then weakened leaving the far turn. MIGHTY BOP raced outside into the
backstretch and bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little more. QUALITY TIME was never a factor. STAR
HAWK raced with the pace inside through the front stretch then showed the way from the five eighths pole, gave up the advantage approaching the three
eighths, raced at the rail into the far turn then weakened while losing ground approaching the top of the lane.

Footnotes
IT'SMYINTENSION gave early chase toward the outside and raced in the six path of the turn, dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear nearing the wire.
THUNDER PUNCH was hustled along with the early lead then gave chase past the three eighths pole and recovered the edge nearing the quarter, dueled
clear approaching the head of the lane then flattened stride later yards. COMMCAT gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn in the three
path, then finished evenly. NIGHT FLIGHT chased the pace and rounded the turn in the five and six paths, angled widest into the lane and finished evenly.
RUSH EXPRESS gave chase off the rail then checked while boxed in at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the turn two deep and finished evenly.
COPELANQUIKZIP gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then faded. PIPERS GOLD was shuffled back at the start and rounded
the turn about the five path. MAKIN US LOOK GOOD was hustled along to take a slim lead past the three eighths pole, dueled close to mid turn but drifted
out while weakening toward the head of the lane. CEDAR RUN'S FIRE saved ground. WHOSE THAT LADY was never a factor.

HARGUS set a pressured pace inside, raced clear into the turn and dug in under steady stretch encouragement to hold on well. SOUL MACHEN chased the
pace through the backstretch and raced at the rail rounding the turn, angled out mid-stretch and held on for second. SHACKLED pressured the early pace,
dropped back into the turn, came through the turn in the three path then flattened out late. FASTER THAN CHROME chased the pace toward the inside,
rounded the turn off the rail and showed little more. QUICKHATCH was bumped off stride at the start then picked up the chase toward the outside and

Footnotes
LETCHER saved ground off the early pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead past the five sixteenths, raced clear midway on the far turn
and was steadily encouraged to hold on. BURNIN RING O FIRE angled in entering the first turn and settled off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and was gaining through late yards. FIRE TIGAR raced in the five path on both turns, bid leaving the three eighths
pole then flattened late yards. JUST A LIL LUKEY saved ground off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three
path then weakened. POET WARRIOR stalked the pace two deep and took a slim lead toward the three eighths pole, gave chase from the five sixteenths
but weakened leaving the far turn. SALT MINE raced in the five path the opening turn, was well back leaving the turn and showed only mild response from
the three eighths pole. TECHNICALLYSPEAKIN settled back in the three and four paths the opening turn, entered the backstretch outside and showed little
response. ELLO GOVNA checked off the inside flank of Burnin Ring O Fire into the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. KATMAN
QUICK settled close inside the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. HE'S SPECIAL accelerated to the
lead and angled to the inside past the three quarter pole to rate the pace, came under pressure from the seven sixteenths, ceded the lead nearing the three
eighths, gave chase from that pint then faded into the far turn.
