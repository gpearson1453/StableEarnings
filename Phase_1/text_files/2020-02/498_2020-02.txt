Footnotes
REMANDED broke a step slowly and was allowed to settle, began picking off rivals rapidly four wide past the half-mile pole, took over outside
STONEWOOD in upper stretch and drove clear. ROYAL MEGHAN stayed close inside to midway on the turn, moved out for the drive and finished well to
get up for second. BE PRESENT pressed the pace outside STONEWOOD from the outset, and weakened on the wrong lead through the late stages.
STONEWOOD set a pressured pace in the two-path, could not match strides with the winner turning for home, moved to the rail and gave way. UNION
MAIDEN hit the left side of the gate and came out slowest, lagged far back for a half-mile four wide, and was going well belatedly out in the middle of the
track. VALLETTA was reluctant to load, raced in the second flight not too far back early, made no progress under urging past the three-eighths, and faded.
CASSEY'S GIRL broke out at the start, raced forwardly three wide to the turn, and faded after a half. NOT A PROBLEM saved ground to no avail. GREY
JAZMINE stayed in range early, and dropped back steadily through the turn.

Footnotes
MATURIN raced off the opening quarter speed and prompted near the inside down the backstretch, gathered momentum and roused forward gaining closer
contention around the turn, was set down for the drive, raced in striking distance three wide mid-stretch, stayed game in pursuit and forged ahead in final
stages. VINESTONE rated under slight restraint just off the embattled trio in early stages, moved up to challenge GAMBIT for the lead at the quarter pole,
took command and led the way under pressure near furlong grounds, fought back to maintain position but got outkicked deep stretch. GAMBIT match
strides for the lead out of the chute, continued to vie for the lead racing inside outside of SEVERUS into the turn, edged away from rival near five-sixteenths
and took on the challenge from VINESTONE, could not maintain equal terms for the lead but remained in steady pursuit up the inside and secured share.
DARDANELLOS raced off the early leaders while ridden along down the backstretch, kept under a ride three wide into upper stretch, switched out wider and
improved position without threatening. STARSHIP FONZY raced near mid-flight through early stages then lost some position, hustled up along the outside
around the turn, moved into stretch six wide, came out wider and had no late kick. SEVERUS matched strides for the lead out of the chute, continued to vie
for the lead GAMBIT down the backstretch, could not move on for the lead nearing the quarter pole then tired in the drive. TITERE raced in the back, saved
ground around the turn and failed to move into contention. INDY RULES vied for the lead through early stages, could not keep pace with top pair late
backstretch then bore out around the turn and eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
FRENCHMEN STREET was sent from the gate and dashed clear, rated along well removed from the rail around the turn, remained out in the track into the
stretch and responded well to preserve the decision. THE CRITICAL WAY hugged the rail throughout, finished gamely but could not reach the winner while
clearly second best. HARD BELLE was outsprinted two to three wide early, moved further out in the drive and rallied mildly. PHANTOM RO raced three
wide around the turn, could not gain through the stretch and was outfinished for the show. XY SPEED stumbled badly at the start, recovered to give chase
two wide going to the turn, and gave way after three furlongs. POCKET CHANGE showed little trailing throughout.

Footnotes
HOW SWEEP IT IS was off to a good start and matched strides for the early lead, continued to vie for the top spot positioned a path outside of SIZZLING
ROMA into the turn, began to edge away still unleashed past the quarter pole, came out wider entering top stretch then cleared on top under a strong hand
ride, shown the right handed whip near sixteenth pole and stayed sharp while going away. SUSIKIN settled under a mild rating while positioned off the top
trio, edged a bit closer along the outside around the turn then put to a drive top stretch, hustled along five wide a furlong out, was no match for winner but
kept on with response and gained place. SHES ONE MAD MOMMA raced in contention and sat off the embattled duo, launched a bid racing three path
near the quarter pole then raced widest into the lane, continued a steady outside bid and prevailed for a share. STRONGER KAT raced off the early pace
and saved ground, was under a drive along the rail on the turn, edged a bit closer, gained position then flattened late. SIZZLING ROMA vied for the lead
with HOW SWEEP IT IS at the start, continued to match strides along inside around the turn, could not move on with winner turning for home then gave way
a furlong out. NOTE TO SELFIE veered inward and came away slow at the start, was not terribly far back then put to a drive two wide entering the turn and
failed to respond. DUDE'S SECRET broke out at the start then moved out to race widest, continued in the rear and had no response when prompted at the
head of the lane.

Footnotes
MRS. S grabbed the lead at the start, rated along in the two-path, kicked away turning for home well in command, drifted out approaching the sixteenth-pole
and jumped back to her left lead, and held sway. JUSTLEAVEITALONE backed off the leaders and moved to the rail entering the first turn, stayed in close
attendance to the top of the stretch shifting to the two-path, moved back to the fence entering the final furlong and continued on willingly. GIRARDI pressed
the pace outside MRS. S, made no impression on that one despite vigorous urging after six furlongs, and faded. JEWELED PRINCESS hit the left side of
the gate lightly at the start, stayed in range for six furlongs and came up empty when roused. MISS CHEENY raced three wide early, and dropped well back
before reaching the stretch.

MONEY NEVER SLEEPS raced five to four wide positioned off the top trio down the backstretch, moved up to challenge ABOVE PAR for the lead near the
three-eighths pole, took command then repelled bid from OUR FANTASY leaving the turn, stayed sharp in response and drew off. OUR FANTASY settled in
early stages then picked up the pace and loomed a threat racing wide near the quarter pole, could not reach equal terms with eventual winner then angled
closer to inside upper stretch and finished clearly second best. NO BULL JACK tracked the pace racing along the rail in early stages, lost position then
hustled up around the turn, kept under a ride along the rail entering the lane and cleared the rest. UNIQUELY MINE trailed through early stages, race four
wide into upper stretch and had no response. ABOVE PAR quickly cleared on top and dictated the pace racing near the inside down the backstretch, got
collared for the lead by winner mid-way around the turn then retreated. MANE ATTRACTION stalked the leader down the backstretch, remained forwardly
placed just off rival entering the turn then failed to keep pace near five-sixteenths pole and dropped back.

MILES AHEAD went up to vie for command outside MIAMI CROCKETT shortly after the start, edged away from that one and BAHAMIAN PRINCE turning
for home and remained clear under a drive despite neglecting to change leads. BAHAMIAN PRINCE pressed the pace three wide in the clear, was losing
ground to the winner as the rider dropped the whip past the eighth-pole, and was lightly urged through the final strides barely saving the place. SILVERLY
ENOUGH was outsprinted early inside, moved out four wide approaching the stretch, lugged in through the furlong grounds, shifted into gear late and
closed fast outside BAHAMIAN PRINCE coming up a stride short for second. LIKE YOU raced well back in the two-path for three-eighths of a mile, moved
out for the drive and could not menace. FLASH PASS faded past the quarter-pole in the two-path. MIAMI CROCKETT popped out of the gate clearing the
field after a few strides, was soon joined from the outside by MILES AHEAD, could not go with that one leaving the turn and faded through the late stages.
BROADWAY PETE was outsprinted three wide to the top of the lane, and faded away.

PRINCE OF ARABIA was forwardly placed out of the gate and continued in striking distance of RODDICK down the backstretch, roused to race on equal
terms with RODDICK around the final turn, kept on determinedly through the lane and drew by foe in final sixteenth. RODDICK held a slim lead entering the
first turn then continued on top with PRINCE OF ARABIA applying pace pressure, vied for the lead along inside around the far turn, got headed then battled
back gamely but could not move on with winner in late stages. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) stalked and saved ground down the backstretch, launched a three wide
bid around the final turn, continued with response along outside in stretch run but needed more to gain equal terms with the top pair.

ENLISTING stalked outside SHE TAKES HEART up the backstretch, closed in with every stride around the turn without need of encouragement, wrested
command after six furlongs and drew off kept to a drive through the stretch. SHE TAKES HEART sprinted clear early inside, could not stave off ENLISTING
through the third quarter, got steered off the rail entering the final furlong and was able to salvage the place. VICKY APPLE bumped with DENVER at the
start, advanced mildly approaching the stretch while moving off the inside, finished evenly outside SHE TAKES HEART and came up short in the battle for
second. BABIE MONSTER gave chase two then three wide for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. DENVER got pinballed and squeezed
back between VICKY APPLE and MOTION'S FIRST at the start, and was never close. GRACE'S DRAMA raced three then four wide around the turn, and
retired into the lane. MOTION'S FIRST bumped with DENVER at the start, raced in the two-path heading to the turn and was done shortly after that.

COMPENSATE was forwardly placed in opening stages and continued to loom a threat on QUEEN OF SHADES around the turn, kept on determinedly in
the lane and edged foe on the wire. QUEEN OF SHADES broke readily and quickly established the lead, continued on top with COMPENATE looming a
threat along the outside into the lane, maintained a slim lead under firm right-handed pressure then got edged for victory in final stride. GLORY DIA raced in
the rear and prompted two wide around the turn, stayed two wide and gained closer contention in stretch run and nipped foe to take show. DROP A HINT
raced under steady urging and gained position to race off the top pair around the turn, remained in steady pursuit racing wide in the lane and got by nipped
for show. ROYAL MISTRESS showed early response then steadily faded.

Footnotes
WINKING AT THEDUDE went along in the second flight to the turn, was put to a drive shifting out four wide past the five-sixteenths, overhauled GUY
CABALLERO from the outside entering the final furlong and drew clear, and had enough to hold on late. GO AWAY broke out in front of MARYLAND
PRIDE, stayed in range toward the inside approaching the turn, moved out three or four paths from the rail into the stretch and was briefly in tight between
AEQUOR and WINKING AT THEDUDE, idled through the furlong grounds on the wrong lead, and drifted out while getting to the winner too late. GUY
CABALLERO set a pressured pace slightly off the inside, shifted out a bit further edging away into the stretch, could not hold off the winner past the
eighth-pole and just salvaged the show while weakening. THIRD ARMY steadied slightly behind GO AWAY going by the six-furlong pole, shifted out three
wide entering the stretch, and got floated out by GO AWAY while gaining on the far outside near the wire. AEQUOR eyed the battling leaders into the turn,
loomed three wide past the five-sixteenths, altered course inside coming to the eighth-pole and flattened out. BEAST MODE pressed the pace outside GUY
CABALLERO to the turn, and dropped back before reaching the stretch. MARYLAND PRIDE got shut off behind GO AWAY at the start, and trailed
throughout.
