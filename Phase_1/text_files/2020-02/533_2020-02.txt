HALF OURS N STORMY vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and won under steady urging. LAKEN LONGLEGS challenged
for the early lead, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. WESTERN STAR unhurried in the early part, made a late bid, proved no
match for the top two, but got up for third. EEPOPPORK TIME pressed the early pace, racing evenly behind the top two and lacked a late kick.
RUNTOTEXAS bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and hung. CARLOS FINE CUSTOM bumped at the start, raced in the back,
moved up, but was never a factor. CASTLEMAN raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and weakened. IMPRESSIVE GREELY
bumped start, pressed the pace, finished wide and faded. HALF TAG was bumped at the start, raced in the back and was never a threat. STEVE'S VISION

Footnotes
CONTRABAND vied for the early lead, took command, drove clear and was kept to the task. AW SHUCKS raced within striking distance, made a steady
gain, angled to the inside down the final stretch, couldn't catch the winner, but outfinished SMOOTH MAN for second. SMOOTH MAN raced near the back,
came around the turn on the outside, made a late bid and was outfinished for place. ALYS APPOINTMENT pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout
and lacked a late kick. HOLY SUNRISE lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. NICKELONTHETRACK dueled for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn and weakened. SEE CARLOS RUN raced within contention, faded and finished evenly. WHISTLING WIND lunged at the start,
racing in the rear and was never close. SUCCESSFUL SHOT void of early speed, finished wide and was outrun. EMMA'S LOGIC raced within striking
distance and dropped back.
