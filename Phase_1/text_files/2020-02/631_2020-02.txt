Footnotes
BURTNJOE with the pace up the backstretch when between foes, disposed of the other speed entering the stretch in the two path, clear past the furlong
marker when rider lost whip, confronted late, gained nod under a vigorous hand ride. SUSPECT A STORM off a bit slow, raced in the second flight off the
inside, roused for the drive, late bid outside, missed. GUSKA MON SHOES lacked speed inside, continued to save ground through the turn, moved out a bit
for the drive, staged a mild rally to earn the show, not a threat to the top two. MOSTLY SUNNY vied up front closest to the inside, gradually weakened in the
drive. MEANBONE four wide through the turn when in the second group, lost some position exiting the turn while remaining widest, picked a couple of foes
up late while not a serious threat. COWBOY CACTUS JACK off a bit slow, stalked the leaders while racing outside, had little left for the drive. BUD RO fell
back to trail after the start, moved out, failed to menace. HAMAZINGLY RICH set or forced the pace three wide, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
CORRANA EN LIMEN broke alertly, dueled up front into the turn off the inside, clear midway on the bend, continued to hold a daylight advantage upper
stretch, responded when the runner up came alongside past the furlong marker, dug on late to narrowly prevail. SCOOTER'S BOY in the main group while
well wide, five path through the turn, roused, late bid outside the winner, outfinished in the late going. SUPER TERRIFIC raced in mid pack while racing
inside, behind traffic into the turn, shifted out a bit early in the bend, clear for the drive, came up empty. BELMONT HILLS in the second flight outside, four
wide through the turn, continued on the outside, went evenly through the stretch while also lacking a closing kick. MARSHALL HILL back off the pace in the
two path, in some traffic while three wide late in the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. ICE SPHERE within striking distance in the second
group, remained forwardly placed into the lane off the inside, had little left in the final furlong to lose some position. NEGRONI UP fell back, trailed for a half,
picked off some tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TELETAP four wide with the second flight into the turn, tired in the drive. STRONG ARM off
slowly, remained always back. JOHNNY CHADDA off slowly, raced back, never a threat. ELITE AND BIG dueled up front up the backstretch and into the
turn, stopped.

JEWELED CROWN off slowly, raced well back early outside, four wide when beginning to advance out of the turn, finished willingly down the middle of the
strip to be up in time. LOVELY LOU forwardly placed off the inside, three wide bid turning for home, put a head in front past the furlong marker, led late,
caught in the final strdies. MISS CASEY BETH broke in but toward the front, dueled early, briefly got clear midway on the turn, vied past the furlong marker
inside the runner up, weakened but managed to comfortably saved the show. DENA'S BOLD MOVE broke back, void of speed, two path into the lane,
improved position with some mild, belated interest outside, no threat to the top three. COMANCHE MOON went one paced while racing off the inside.
HIGHTAIL RUNAWAY lacked early foot, moved out to be three wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. JULIE
ARKANSAS in mid pack early, had little for the drive. LORI'S EYES flashed early speed along the inside, gave way before four furlongs.

Footnotes
COAL TRUTH behind the pace while well off the inside, angled out four wide turning for home, outside bid past the furlong marker, wore down rival late to
be edging away at the end. WHISKEY ECHO with the pace while between horses, narrowly showed the way into the lane, slightly larger lead midstretch,
gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, remained clear for the place. GRAY SKY void of speed under restraint, continued reserved through the /bend,
shifted out a bit for the drive, finished willingly while too late. REASON TO SOAR with the pace while along the inside, held a narrow advantage late in the
turn, weakened in the drive. I'M CORFU broke on top, set or forced the pace three wide, weakened in the drive. FASCILITATOR in the second flight well
wide, five wide through the turn, tired in the drive. KNIGHTS KEY steadied in traffic just after the start, trailed, remained back. JUNIOR GILLIAM in mid pack
early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
HESLUCK away in good order, got clear before a quarter, showed the way up the backstretch under light restraint, continued to show the way into the
stretch, held foe at bay in the late going. ROCKTHEPULPIT broke out, was straightened to race closest to the winner, continued to pursue that one the
middle half, moved closer into the stretch, reached the winner in midstretch from the outside, could not get by. LISTEN TO ROSE settled off the pace while
four wide into the first turn, continued outside, four wide again in the second turn, mild interest to be clear of the others. MOON IN THE SKY settled off the
pace inside early, came out to bump with MY SUGAR TOWN into the first turn, continued to save ground through the second bend, went evenly through the
stretch to be outkicked for the show. MY SUGAR TOWN bumped into the first turn in the two path, settled, advanced off the inside to be closest to the top
pair in upper stretch, flattened out to lose the show. HOT IRON void of speed, saved some ground in the first turn, two path through the second turn,
improved position, no real threat. R V T THUNDER ROAD lacked early foot well out in the strip, four wide in the first turn, five out to six wide turning for
home, lacked serious kick. HOLY TRUTH bothered at the start, was used to chase the top two for six furlongs and then gave way in the drive. UNBRIDLED
SHOES failed to menace. ARKANSAS RED five wide into the first turn when well back, four wide into the second bend, remained back in failing to rally.
TROPHY DADDY was off slowly and never involved. REVEREND DON was finished after a half.

Footnotes
WILD POPIT broke out to bother an outer rival, was straightened to vie up front between foes, narrowly showed the way upper stretch, drifted out to brush
with GALLANT PLUNGER on two occasions after feeling a left handed stick, dug in late to outkick that one in a determined effort. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF GALLANT PLUNGER AGAINST WILD POINT
FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND. GALLANT PLUNGER pressed the issue three
wide, vied three wide into and through the turn, dueled with with the winner past the furlong marker, brushed floated out by that rival twice late, could not get
by. MAJESTIC JAZZ broke alertly, narrowly showed the way early inside, continued to contest the issue while saving ground turn, could not match the top
two in the drive, saved the show. BOBBY AXELROD back off the pace outside, moved closer four wide midway on the turn, failed to sustain that advance in
the drive. SWINGIN' SAM went one paced in the two path. UNIMAGINABLE U off a step slow, was not a threat while r. LITANY void of speed outside, four
wide turn, remained back. TIZ APPROVED bothered, off slowly, tired after saving ground.

Footnotes
STROLLING off a step slow, raced well back early, swung out five wide turning for home, finished full of run down the middle of the strip to win going away.
NUCLEAR OPTION broke sharp, cleared soon after, set the pace, extended advantage with a furlong to run, could not contain the winner, clearly second
best. BATTLE STATION void of speed in mid pack, three wide trip through the turn, shifted out a bit from behind horses nearing midstretch, late surge to be
in time for the show. SPIKES SHIRL back off the pace out in the strip, four wide through the turn, crept closer exiting the bend, lacked a further advance on
the top pair late and was caught for the show in the final strides. TIZ ALLUPTOME NOW in the second flight in the two path, lacked a closing punch. IMMA
BLING in the second group in the three path, moved closer in some traffic exiting the turn, flattened out in the run to the wire. CONTROL STAKE saved
ground to no avail. OURBESTFRIEND D L broke out, chased the runner up just off the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
BLUE MOONRISE took command after the start, got clear in the first turn, rated while showing the way up the backstretch, remained well clear while being
kept to task. GETRIDOFWHATAILESU settled off the pace while inside, steered out to be three wide out of the final turn, proved no match for the winner,
second best. ROYAL GEM void of early foot, trailed well back, two path into the lane, rallied through some traffic to annex the show. GLAMORIZED closest
to the leader, asked along in to the stretch, had little left in the late going to lose a couple of positions. BLESSED AGAIN settled off the pace toward the
inside, had little for the drive. CARISSA CRISMAS forwardly placed for six furlongs, faltered in the drive. INDY UNION outrun in the two path early,
continued back the middle half, lacked a response in the drive. RAHWAY settled in mid pack in the three path, faded. CALF MOON BAY four wide in the
first turn, gave way in the stretch, eased, walked in.

Footnotes
SONNY SMACK took back immediately after the start, angled in sharply into the first turn, unhurried, angled out late in the final turn, bid, going away well
out in the strip. PICKFORD in the second flight off the inside, four wide in the final turn, moved a bit closer, no match for the winner the final furlong, up late
for the place. INCORRIGIBLE pressed the leader from the outside, dueled the middle half in the two path, continued to vie into the stretch, had little for the
winner the final furlong, could not contain the runner up, saved the show between rivals. MO GOTCHA set the pace along the inside, held a narrow
advantage into the stretch, weakened, not enough for the show late. NEW MEXICO within striking distance along the inside, had little left for the drive.
CARTE BLANCHE lacked speed while in some traffic first turn, lacked a serious response off the inside. CABERTOSS mid pack and outside early, moved
closer before a half, second flight into the far turn, retreated. STARSHIP ZEUS weakened after a half. HIDDEN TALENT was never a factor outside.
