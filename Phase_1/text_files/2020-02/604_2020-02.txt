Footnotes
YOUNG RAYMOND broke to the lead and moved inside, shook off his pursuers turning for home, and had plenty left drawing away through the late stages.
PUTMAN raced three wide in the middle of the pack to the lane, and rallied to go clear of the remainder in the last furlong. PALACE KID bumped with
OFFICER COUNTRY at the start, chased three wide to the stretch, and weakened. HAPPY DANZA saved ground into the turn, paused momentarily inside
YOUREOUTOFCONTROL a quarter-mile out, and lacked a solid late response. OFFICER COUNTRY bumped with PALACE KID at the start and was slow
into stride, lagged well back for three furlongs, moved out through upper stretch and passed tired horses. MAQUIAVELO was outrun early, angled to the far
outside for the drive and passed tired horses. PUMP ROOM raced in the second flight two then three wide around the turn, and had no response. ELITE
MISSION was forwardly placed four wide to the stretch, and tired. SWIPE LEFT was outrun inside. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL prompted the pace outside
YOUNG RAYMOND, and steadied while in the process of giving way at the quarter-pole. FUEGO broke a couple lengths behind the field, and showed little
at the rear.

Footnotes
ROAN MOUNTAIN settled two wide through early stages, prompted to pick up the pace around the far turn, got brushed between foes entering top stretch
then continued to advance under steady urging and cleared in final stages. BAMBINO raced wide while unhurried in the early going then switched in a few
paths mid-way down the backstretch, prompted along the outside around the far turn, continued a bid along the far outside and produced a solid finish.
TOOK A CAB vied for the lead in opening stages and continued to duel for the lead with BRIANS AVENUE down the backstretch, shook clear midway
around the turn, stayed on with good response upper stretch then got worn down late. BEACH TRAFFIC tracked the embattled pair down the backstretch,
produced a three wide bid and advanced closer on the leader near the quarter pole then flattened and raced evenly in late stages. ENANO ASTRAY raced
widest while settled through early stages, gained position along the outside around the far turn then gave way in the lane. BRIAN'S AVENUE vied for the
lead in opening stages and continued to battle with TOOK A CAB into the turn, could not match strides near the five-sixteenths pole and weakened. IRON
DRILL raced inside to two wide down the backstretch and into stretch run and lacked the needed response for impact. ATAKAN was unhurried and saved
ground down the backstretch, raced wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. SILENT MISCHIEF was reserved in the back, moved into stretch
three to four wide and lacked response. PREFONTAINE settled off the early pace then failed to move on when prompted, raced seven wide into lane and
offered no late run. DRY LAND raced in early contention but failed to keep pace and steadily retreated. BIP BIP FULL POWER got brushed between foes at
the start, raced off the pace and failed to menace.

JOYOUS TIMES broke out bumping with GLORIOUS GAL, then was bumped by QUEEN FIELD to get away last, trailed unhurried for six furlongs, swept up
with a quick four-wide move to contention approaching the stretch, lugged in a bit taking over outside rivals through the furlong grounds and drove clear.
DIENDA broke on top, showed the way inside to the stretch, could not withstand the winner but dug in along the rail to hold second. GLORIOUS GAL
bumped with JOYOUS TIMES at the start, went along in range three wide early, bid between horses after six furlongs, and weakened through the late
stages. QUEEN FIELD bumped with KIMURA coming out and recovered outward bumping into JOYOUS TIMES, checked taking a couple awkward steps
on the rail midway on the first turn, continued inside to the stretch and could not kick on with the leaders. KIMURA bumped with QUEEN FIELD at the start,
pressed the pace outside DIENDA to the far turn, and dropped back between horses approaching the stretch. LIL MISS HOT MESS was reserved within
range to the far turn, lodged a bid between foes in the two-path after six furlongs, but gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BEAU LUMINARIE shied a step and steadied while going by the gap then led the way by a narrow margin over DERBY DATE, widened advantage under
mild prompting past the quarter pole then pulled away to clear command upper stretch, tapped a couple times past the furlong marker then finished ridden
out while going away. FELIX THE FOX stalked the top two leaders down the backstretch, launched a bid racing three wide around the far turn, continued
with response in steady pursuit for the BEAU LUMINAIRIE in the lane, was no match for pulling away winner but finished clearly second best. NEW HOPE
ROAD raced outside in the last flight down the backstretch, prompted four wide around the far turn, gained position then churned on through stretch run and
gained a share. DERBY DATE was forwardly placed from the outset and positioned just off the early leader, chased after the eventual winner two wide
around the turn then tired in the drive. ARMANDO R broke out at the start, raced in range three wide near the half mile marker then failed to keep pace and
weakened around the turn. UNILATERAL hustled along the inside position mid-way down the backstretch, was not too far off the pace then came up empty
on the far turn. MAGICAL MIKE raced in the last flight near the inside, was put to a drive on the rail around the turn and lacked a needed rally.

Footnotes
MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT bumped with SEA ANNA DREAM in tight quarters going to the first turn, came away to a stalking position three wide, rallied to
challenge outside UNEXPLAINABLE turning for home, and drove clear through the final furlong. UNICORN SALLY broke out considerably at the start,
checked behind horses going to the first turn, came under a ride three wide before completing six furlongs, and rallied with good determination to be clearly
second best. FLORADO broke on top, then came under a firm hold as the rider saw UNEXPLAINABLE intent on getting the lead, tugged anxiously into the
first turn, settled down through the middle stages inside, and finished willingly to get up for the show between horses. UNEXPLAINABLE sped to the front
soon after the start, rated along inside for six furlongs, could not handle the winner through mid stretch and gave way. NOBLE ENTERPRISE had the
three-path for much of the way, and raced evenly without threatening. STRIKE MAGIC got carried out by UNICORN SALLY at the start, went to the first turn
five wide before moving in some, prompted the pace for six furlongs and gave way. SEA ANNA DREAM bumped with the eventual winner and checked in
tight between horses going to the first turn, checked sharply again midway on the opening bend in the three-path, and never reached contention. AMALFI
QUEEN raced three wide on the turns, and did not become a factor. MIDNIGHT BELLA was outrun toward the inside throughout. CRYSTALINA steadied in
tight on the rail heading to the first turn, and dropped steadily farther behind after completing a half-mile.

Footnotes
GOLDEN DECISION was away in good order and raced two to three wide around the first turn, settled in range and tracked the pace to the far turn, edged a
bit closer on top pair near the quarter pole, tipped out a couple paths and put to a drive four wide top of the lane, steadily advanced under right handed
urging and drew clear. FARAWAY KITTEN was allowed to settle out of the gate and angled to the inside, raced in the last flight and saved ground down the
backstretch, picked up the pace racing between foes late far turn, angled inside and raced in traffic upper stretch, shifted out wider and got up late to take
place. SUBLIME APPEAL led the way around the first turn then set a pressured pace down the backstretch, challenged and vied for the lead with
HIEROGLYPHICS around the final turn, continued to battle at the furlong marker then got outkicked when the winner charged by, gave way grudgingly and
lasted to finish on equal terms for a share. HIEROGLYPHICS was forwardly placed and stalked the leader down the backstretch, advanced to challenge
SUBLIME APPEAL for the lead on the final turn, dueled for the top spot to the furlong grounds, could not match when the winner kicked by but stayed on
and finished on equal terms with SUBLIME APPEAL for show. AMBASSADOR JIM was allowed to settle in early stages and raced in the last flight,
prompted around the final turn, showed response and kept under a ride five wide entering top stretch then chased on evenly through the lane. FIFTH TITLE
quickly angled to the inside and was a bit keen racing under a snug hold to settle more on the first turn, settled in range and tracked the pace, sustained run
while racing along rail entering the final turn, waited briefly then prompted past the quarter pole, was a bit tight then gave way top of the lane. DISCOVERED
applied pace pressure to SUBLIME APPEAL out of the first turn, continued to press the pace down the backstretch then came up empty in the final turn.

Footnotes
KARMA KING battled in the three-path between rivals for most of the first half-mile, outdueled SIGHTED through mid stretch and gamely edged clear late.
VALDOCCO was crowded between horses a few strides from the gate, trailed out in the track before moving in around the turn, waited behind a wall of
horses at the top of the stretch, altered course to the three-path into the last furlong, jumped back to his left lead 70 yards out and was along for the place.
SIGHTED contested the pace innermost of a foursome to late on the turn, could not match strides with KARMA KING through the furlong grounds and
yielded on the rail. TIP SHEET was brushed and pushed out by SLEEPING GIANT at the start, moved after the leaders under a drive four wide between
horses past the quarter-pole, and flattened out in the lane. DIAMOND MAJESTY contested the pace outside a trio of opponents for three-eighths of a mile,
and dropped out of the fight late on the turn. PASSIONATE HACHI joined the fray with a brief five-wide run late on the turn, but weakened through the drive.
SLEEPING GIANT came out a bit brushing and pushing out TIP SHEET after the start, vied between horses in the two-path for a half and gave way.

the lane, roused forward to battle for the late lead, dug in gamely and got a nose up for the win. PUT POSITION was forwardly placed and raced just off the
pace setter to the far turn then moved up and vied for the lead with SPICY NELLY, continued to battle back into stretch run, fought back gamely when
AVIENIDA MANANA moved up to challenge for the late lead, stayed sharp but got nipped on the wire. SWEET STORY rated two to three wide off the early
pace, prompted in two path at the quarter pole, urged into upper stretch then shifted out wide, remained in game pursuit and was inching up on leaders in
final stride. VITAEMI was unhurried and raced along the outside in the last flight, continued near the rear entering top stretch then prompted three wide into
the lane, quickly gathered sharp momentum, angled in a path then took the rail position late, finished with willingly response, was gaining fast but ran out of
time. SPICY NELLY led the way on the first turn and set the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead with PUT POSITION around the final turn,
continued to battle back gamely from the inside, held a slight edge at furlong grounds then got collared for the lead and gave way grudgingly deep stretch.

steadily inched up closer in final stages. BAHAMA KITTEN raced off the pace down the backstretch then launched a bid near three eighths pole, swung
wide into upper stretch, kept along the far outside with interest but lacked the needed kick for serious impact. VENEZUELAN FOREVER tracked the pace
through early stages, prompted in two path near the quarter pole, came out wider for the drive then chased on evenly through the lane. JUST SASSY raced
off the pace and saved ground, shifted out wider for the drive, edged a bit closer but lacked the needed response for late impact. HOPONTHEBUSGUS

Footnotes
W W FITZY sped clear early on the rail, had DAY BY DAY range alongside midway on the turn, dueled with that one the rest of the way and gamely
prevailed while drifting out late. DAY BY DAY hooked W W FITZY from the outside coming to the three-eighths, tried to get by from there to the finish but
could not do so while also drifting out. BACCARAT FASHION chased three wide early, briefly took closer order after three furlongs, but could not keep pace
with the top two into the stretch. SEAN'S IDEA broke with her head turned to the left and bobbled a stride from the gate, moved inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
FRIENDLY FELLA was away quickly from the widest position, cleared and crossed over to the inside nearing the first turn, opened up to a clear lead on the
first turn, continued to hold a commanding lead into stretch run and kept clear along inside under steady encouragement. CRYPTO GOLD raced three to
four wide off the pace to the far turn, prompted along the outside near the quarter pole, continued in game pursuit for the leader in stretch run, shortened the
gap on rival and finished clearly second best. BRAHE rated along inside down the backstretch, launched a bid around the final turn, came out wider for the
drive and stayed on with interest to gain a share. CASTILLETE tracked the clear pacesetter to the far turn, prompted racing two path near the quarter pole
then came out wider for the drive then flattened out. TRAFFIC TROUBLE brushed and steadied slightly with rival nearing the first turn then steadied sharply
around the first turn, rated through early stages then hustled up on the final turn, raced five wide into lane and had no late kick. MORNING TICE was
unhurried three to two wide down the backstretch then saved ground around the final turn, angled out top of the lane and lacked a needed rally. BELLAS
FELLA raced in the back then moved into stretch wide and passed tiring foes. LONGSHIPS was the closest pursuer of the clear pacesetter down the
backstretch, was hustled up along inside around the final turn then gave way in the lane. KEEP MARCHING got bumped at the start then steadied nearing
the first turn, raced three to four wide off the pace to the far turn then failed to move on when called upon. RIGHT ON KID raced three wide in contention
around the first turn, raced along the outside and tracked the clear leader through early stages then gave way on the final turn.
