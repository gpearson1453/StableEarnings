accelerated to the lead at the quarter-pole, battled outside of the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. MR.
FOUR SEVENS went around the first turn in the five path, moved up late on that bend, contested the pace on the outside, dropped in while going clear
outside the half-mile pole, raced inside on the far turn, was asked after being headed at the quarter-pole, battled inside of the winner under a drive into the
final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. RICHIE GARY was carried seven wide into the first turn then dropped to the four path, settled at
the rear on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, switched back to his inside lead
outside the furlong marker and improved position to get the show. CONFEDERATE YELL bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the inside, was roused
on the far turn, hesitated for a few strides inside the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. STUCK IN
VEGAS was guided into the first turn under extra left rein pressure with his head cocked to the side, went four wide on that bend, dropped back onto the
backstretch, settled on the outside, was asked while three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch under the whip, drifted in some near
the furlong marker and also lacked the needed response. GUITAR KING moved in early, was well placed on the inside, came under urging late on the
backstretch, moved to the two path under a strong hand ride midway through the far turn, hesitated for a few strides inside the five-sixteenths, was driven
three wide into the stretch and failed to respond. THREE RUN HOMER went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, contested the pace on the
inside of an opponent, dropped back outside the half-mile pole, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole then shifted

turn then dropped to the two path, settled near the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and was no factor. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
CHOP CHOP CHARLIE, just a bit fractious behind the gate, was slightly coaxed from the start to make the lead, set the pace racing in the two path, edged
away up the backstretch, was put to a drive by upper stretch and held well under steady handling. SOCIAL MISFIT saved ground in behind the leaders
through the first turn, advanced inside foes leaving the backstretch and came out early on the far turn going in the two then three path on that bend, was
within striking distance and under urging turning for home, chased the winner but could make no headway. GOT GOLD was a bit reluctant to load, raced
outside in the three path off the early leader through the first turn applying moderate pressure to that one leaving that bend, lost ground up the backstretch
running between rivals before entering the far turn going four wide through that bend, fought on in the lane to maintain show honors. GRAND MARAIS raced
mid-pack into the first turn off the fence entering that bend in the two path and emerging three deep for the run up the backstretch, moved out further
heading up the backstretch to advance outside rivals, went five wide on the second turn, and failed to rally. WOMAN WITH A BOOK was well back early
racing off the fence in the three to four path on the first turn, moved in heading up the backstretch, trailed in the two path on the far turn, was checked
sharply and altered to avoid a stricken foe just past the quarter pole then was pulled up and walked off. FIST OF RAGE angled in early, saved ground on
both turns, went wrong just past the quarter pole and fell, was vanned off. Following a stewards' inquiry no action was taken.

Footnotes
RED HOT DEVIL stalked the early leader from outside, edged closer three to four wide on the turn, was asked for run past the quarter pole, struck the lead
outside the furlong marker, drifted out a bit in the late going while clear and under steady handling. ARCHRIVAL was ridden along early but lacking speed,
raced in the three path through the turn well back from the leaders, angled seven wide in upper stretch and gained late. MOVE IT angled in early, saved
ground on the turn racing on or just off the rail, swung out leaving the bend coming into upper stretch four to five deep, ran on with some late interest but
making no headway on the winner. MAGI bumped the outside rival at the start, set the pace in the clear up the backstretch and into the turn, was challenged
leaving that bend and overtaken in upper stretch then weakened through late stretch. SOUTHERN LIGHT came out slightly at the break, raced mid-pack
while outside, went in the four path on the turn coming wider into the drive, was six deep near the three-sixteenths and came up empty thereafter.
SUVOROV'S HERO broke a half-step slowly and was lacking speed, raced inside through the turn coming out a path late on that bend and to the three path
into upper stretch, moved out further past the furlong marker and ran on. TRINITY N ROUX was bumped at the start, pursued the pacesetter from outside in
the two to three path through the turn but was empty in the stretch. GROOM LAKE trailed while outside early, went in the five to six path through the turn
and was never a threat.

A SONG FOR ARCH broke in and brushed with a foe then was hustled, moved up on the outside then was taken in hand while prompting the pace, vied in
the three path on the turn, took the lead in the four path into upper stretch, responded well while remaining on his inside lead throughout the drive and held
under strong urgig. EDEN GREY'S KITTEN was taken back along the rail early then settled at the rear, moved out from the rail leaving the backstretch,
shifted three wide before the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied on the far outside and closed fast to get the place but was too late to
catch the winner. ASONGFORYOU showed good speed and set the pace, vied inside of the winner while in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch, fought on into the final sixteenth and was caught for the place but held the show. MR. PRIORITY was
rated just off the pace, tucked into the two path while asked on the turn, shifted four wide into upper stretch, dropped in behind the winner outside the furlong
marker and was out-kicked. OVERRULING was taken up early, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused while swinging four wide into
upper stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and improved position. QUEETEN jostled with JAKE THE BAND MAN early, settled off
the pace, was asked while inside on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and failed to rally. PAY THE DREAM bumped with a rival at the start,
jostled with JAKE THE BAND MAN early, settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged along while four wide on the turn, drifted
in outside the three-sixteenths and came up empty. KID CREOLE bumped with a foe at the start while brushing with another rival, settled on the outside,
moved in leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. FUTURE RULER bobbled at the
start but recovered quickly, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, moved out just after turning into the stretch and also

wide on the turn, drifted inward after turning into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRAZY settled at the rear racing just off the inside, entered the turn still at the back racing in the four path but moving in a path quite early on
that bend, came out four deep past the five-sixteenths and nearing the top of the stretch, took aim under urging in upper stretch widest of all, struck a narrow
lead at the sixteenth pole and was kept to task late. PLAY UNIFIED set the pace in the clear from the two path up the backstretch and into the turn, came in
a little bit on that bend and then again at the top of the stretch still with the lead, rebuffed the challenge of FUGUTIVE LADY nearing mid-stretch while
beginning to drift out a bit under left-handed encouragement but could not fend off the winner while fighting on gamely in defeat. FUGITIVE LADY switched
off the inside heading up the backstretch, entered the turn in the two path but quickly moving out a path behind runners prior to moving out four wide nearing
the three-eighths pole, made a mild bid in upper stretch, was carried out a bit in mid-stretch and needed more late. MR. AL'S GAL tracked the pacesetter
along the rail, continued in behind that one on or just off the rail through the turn, was in behind rivals just off the fence and waited for a bit in upper stretch,
found greater room at the rail by mid-stretch and ran on evenly. SAINTS N MUSKETS stalked the leader, was within range outside three wide into the turn
and between foes late on that bend but was empty for the stretch.

far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed well to get the lead outside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved

third position, drafted inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked in the two path at the quarter-pole, made a bid inside the three-sixteenths, battled
with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the place. KITTEN'S BOY settled towards the rear while saving ground, was

inside while getting company to his outside, was asked at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage under a drive into the stretch, battled into the final furlong
and weakened. RESCIND broke a bit slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked a bit leaving the backstretch, went three then
four wide on the far turn, was roused for more at the five-sixteenths, came seven wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position in the center of the
course into the final furlong but flattened out. TOM MANAGEMENT bumped with a rival at the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, prompted the
pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the far turn, drew even with the leader at the five-sixteenths, took the lead while four wide into the stretch, lost
the lead under a drive just outside the furlong marker and weakened. TAKE THAT FOR DATA bumped with an opponent at the start, went three wide on the
first turn, was reserved on the outside, went three to four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CADE'S ON THE BUMP was
guided with a bit of extra left rein pressure into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, settled off the pace, was taken in hand behind horses
coming to the half-mile pole, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, swerved out near the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response. (Rail at 16 Feet)

outside in upper stretch, battled with the top two under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the show. SPRING VALUE dropped

improved position. IT'S MIKE'S TURN settled off the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed response. PAPA'S BIG BOY bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn,
