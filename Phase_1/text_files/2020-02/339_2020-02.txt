Footnotes
CHEST CANDY raced unhurried early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and was up with a late rush to prevail in the
closing yards. LUCKY WITH YOU was away in good order to set a pressured pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and just failed to last. ABIQUIU
was off a step slow, rushed to contend, pressed the pace of LUCKY WITH YOU while racing three-wide, stayed on well in the drive and gave way
grudgingly. DAWOOD showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with some late run. BASHFUL BOB chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. SKEETER WHO broke sharply then was forwardly placed, moved three-wide through the second turn and
weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
MANOSO set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, opened up in early stretch and held for the win. MASTERCLASS raced in mid pack
early, went five wide into the second turn, was gaining late and finished second best. ESTEEMED was unhurried early, raced six wide into the second turn,
was closing late and needed more ground. POLITICAL LOOPHOLE followed the early pace, went three wide into the second turn and finished evenly late.
WISKEYS DREAMS was taken back early, advanced between rivals into the home turn and offered a mild late rally. SMOKEN HOUDINI was void of any
early speed, circled seven wide through the second turn and finished belatedly. VEIW FROM THE BAY was outrun early, raced between rivals into the turn
and offered no late impact. THE LAST FEAT was allowed to settle early, raced along the inside and faded. MAIL MAN M G not far back early, raced
between rivals into the home turn and gave way.

Footnotes
LAUNCH LIGHT DREAM was away in good order then reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong
to run and quickly drew off. BORTSTEIN dueled for the lead with TIMELESS INDY while racing three-wide, vied with that rival into mid-stretch but could not
match strides with the winner through the final furlong. TIMELESS INDY disputed the pace with BORSTEIN from the inside and gave through the final
eighth. SPURR ONE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. TOMEGA lacked early foot, raced
six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. ROMAN PLEASURE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
NUSRET lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. MAXIMUS THE GREAT was forwardly placed early, moved
three-wide through the turn and weakened. CORONA BEACH showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. SUPERPASS
showed brief speed, steadied nearing the half mile marker and weakened. SUPER SWISS chased the leaders while racing three-wide for three furlongs and
weakened.
