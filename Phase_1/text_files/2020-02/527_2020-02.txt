KYLES MARIGOLD pressed the pace along the rail into the turn, slipped through to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, shook clear before the furlong
marker and won under left handed urging. RYOAN stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in from the four path and finished second best. HIDATSA PARK
trailed along the inside into the turn, shifted outside and finished with good courage. BACKSPLASH went evenly. ON THE CLOCK pressed the pace from
the four path into the turn, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then failed to sustain that bid. ANNIVERSARY ROSE broke sharply in front, set
a pressured pace two wide for nearly a half then weakened in the stretch. SHYLA was no threat.

courage five wide. TUBA well placed, loomed boldly three wide on the second turn then was outfinished in a game effort. WILKO FREEWAY sprinted to the
lead three wide on the clubhouse turn, set a pressured pace two wide until the quarter pole then in deep stretch. ISLAND VICE lead along the inside into the
first turn, stalked the pace while remained along the rail into the second turn, came on again to regain the lead past the quarter pole, shook clear in upper

GOLDEN PEARL broke in front, set all the pace and finished full of run to win going away under a strong hand ride. UNTAPPED ENERGY unhurried early,
rallied steadily through the stretch and finished second best. CHAOS bumped at the start, was never far back, swung out to the five path for the drive and
finished with good courage. RISE TO POWER was bounced around between horses at the start, rushed to contention five wide on the turn then came up
empty. VERA'S SMART TRIP vied for the lead three wide into the turn the gradually weakened. IMPAZIBLE MINK chased the winner from the inside into
the stretch then gave way. MISS BOMBON with the second flight three wide, was through after three furlongs. LUTZY LU bumped at the start and was
never close.
