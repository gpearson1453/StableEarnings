raced in the six path of the turn then finished evenly while trailing a hind bandage through the lane. KUSTAAFU steadied early then picked up the chase
toward the inside, angled to the seven path rounding the turn and finished evenly outside. THE MESSAGE R V F was forced in across the path of Prospect
Toy and had his heels clipped, picked up the chase well off the rail then weakened. DOUBLE DERBY PERKS gave early chase from the three and four
paths, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little more in the lane. PROSPECT TOY was shut off and clipped the heels of The Message R V F passing
the half mile pole and lost all chance. After posting the inquiry, the stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Me Darlin Chessie, lodged by the
rider of The Message R V F, and, as a result, the former was disqualified to last place for causing the incident past the half mile pole.

AIN'T MISBEHAVIN stalked the pace past the seven eighths pole, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths and took the lead three wide past the quarter,
drew clear and held on well under steady encouragement. GOTHAM NEWS raced in the five path on all three turns, bid from the three eighths pole and
finished evenly. THEYALLCOMEHOME raced well off the pace then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn in the six path and was along for third inside the sixteenth pole. ENVISION SUCCESS raced five wide the first turn then stalked the early pace,
moved to even terms from the nine sixteenths, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and
weakened. HUNTIN'THEHOLIDAYS settled off the pace in the three and four paths then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four
path and showed little more. CRAIG'S saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole then flattened stride in the three path of the far turn.
WILD DRIVE rated a slim lead inside past the seven eighths pole but was met at even terms leaving the nine sixteenths, gave chase through the
backstretch then weakened at the rail rounding the far turn.

YES IT'S ROO rounded the opening turn in the three path then settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and took
the lead two deep nearing the top of the lane, raced clear into the stretch and held on well under steady handling. KING NEKIA angled in and took the lead
past the three quarter pole then rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the head of the
lane, dropped back leaving the far turn and had to settle for second. GRAN WILDROCKY raced in the five path the first turn and entered the backstretch
toward the outside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path but showed little more. DON'T CARE settled off the
pace and off the rail the first turn then eased to the outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three
path then weakened. GHOST MINE stalked the early pace inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. LUV
THE PAINTER saved ground.
