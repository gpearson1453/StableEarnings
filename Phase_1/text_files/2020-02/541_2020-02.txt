Footnotes
OLIVIA'S DUCHESS unhurried in the beginning, came around both turns wide, angled in down the home stretch, split rivals and proved the best late.
LINDA'S LEGACY went to the front, drove clear, but couldn't hold off the winner at the wire. DIAL EM IN broke out, raced within striking distance, made a
late bid and got up for third. SILVER SIREN pressed the pace, raced close throughout and was outfinished. SALESGIRL bothered at the start, racing in the
rear and was never a threat. MISS INVADER pressed the pace, raced outside around the final turn and faded. MISSHOLYSENSATION void of early speed
and was never close.

PAPA BRO went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and proved much the best. ALTERANA pressed the pace, saved ground, made a late bid, four wide
and was just up for second. HOSTILE AFLEET challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. SATURDAY'S
GOLD raced within contention, weakened and lacked a finish. WILD FIREMAKER broke in, raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
PRINCE CARLOS lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. SHACK PARTOUT raced evenly near the back and lacked a bid. REAL BRAVE raced
in the middle of the field in the early part and faded. BOURBON REVENGE bumped at the start, raced in the rear and was never a threat. SABER RUN
broke in, bumped rival and showed little.

Footnotes
KATIEBMEISTER vied for the early lead, dueled down the stretch and prevailed for the win. VAGARY pressed the pace, made a late bid, four wide, was
outfinished for the win, but got up for second. WISE WOMAN raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and made a late gain. R MARIE
dueled on the front end, saved ground, weakened and was not abused late. CHARLOTTE'S WISH raced within contention and finished evenly. BOSS LADY
MELISSA broke out, racing in the rear, came around both turns on the outside and was never a threat. TEDDERS ANGEL raced within striking distance and
faded. LONELY PETUNIA always raced near the back and showed little.

outside around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. CHARZEE BABY pressed the pace, raced close throughout, but
was no match for the top two late. THEBOYZGALAXY unhurried in the beginning, made a late gain and finished willingly. MEMORY MAGIC lacked early
speed, showed late interest, finished wide, but was no factor. TA KELA WARNING raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside
and lacked a late kick. PROMISE TENDER raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the second turn and was no threat. CUCKOO KENIA
challenged for the early lead and dropped back. PEACE TREATY PAT always raced near the back and was outrun. STAR GAZE raced within striking

Footnotes
ATLANTIC RULER void of early speed, moved up between rivals around the final turn, made a late bid, racing four wide and drove clear. KINLEE'S SONG
pressed the pace, raced close throughout, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE rank early, challenged for the
lead, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. REACH THE CIRCLE went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. NINE IS
MINE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and finished evenly. DOUBLE COOL lacked early speed, raced wide around both
turns and was never a factor. SMOOTH CURRENT raced near the back, moved up, within contention and faded. LAST NITE OUT raced within striking
distance, dropped back and was outrun.

bid and hung. MEMORY OF SWIM lacked early speed, raced outside around both turns, made a bid and weakened. ROBBER void of early speed, moved
up, but was no factor. SAINT DANSANT showed brief early speed and dropped back. GRIP TIGHT raced near the back, moved up and was finished early.
