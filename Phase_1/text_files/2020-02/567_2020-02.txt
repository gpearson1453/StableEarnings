SEVIER with the early pace three wide and outside, dueled through the turn and into the stretch, long drive, fully extended to narrowly prevail. KING OF
THE COURT within striking distance, moved closer three wide late in the turn, slight drift stretch, was straightened and finished willingly late to be up for the
place. RECOUNT vied up front while between rivals early, dueled through the turn inside the winner, continued to do battle with that one past the furlong
marker, gave ground grudgingly to the top two in the late going. HE'S SO ZAZZY last away, in the second flight backstretch, shuffled back in traffic into the
turn, improved slightly in the drive while well out in the strip. CONQUEROR in the second flight up the backstretch between foes, bit closer in the two path
late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. LEROY failed to menace while racing inside. SPOKANE EAGLE flashed brief early speed inside, fell back while
attempting to get out turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
SHOOT ME STRAIGHT with the early pace while racing inside, narrowly showed the way through the turn, shook clear into the lane, well clear, kept to task.
LIL' FANCY settled behind the first flight, two path turning for home, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. TAPIT RIGHT with the pace while
racing outside, vied four wide early turn, had little left for the drive narrowly saved the show. CYBER AFFAIR broke back, lacked speed inside, tipped out in
the two path turning for home, steered out wide when straightened for home, finished willingly while too late. THURSDAY MORNING broke with the main
body, dropped inside early in the turn, saved ground, went evenly in the drive. LAURA BELLE broke out, pulled hard early, void of speed out in the strip,
raced four out to five wide in the turn, also went one paced through the stretch. FIVE QUEENS broke sharp, raced with the early pace, pressed three wide
through the turn, had little left for the drive. LUCINDANSHADY set or forced the pace in the two path, gave way in the drive. DADDY'S STORM remained
always back. FIVE RIVERS in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the turn, had nothing left. SHADYNGRAY off slowly, remained back while racing
three wide. SILENT NIGHT SKY steadily faded inside.

edging clear. FLASH OF SILVER unhurried for a half outside, angled out further to be four wide into the stretch, finished willingly to be in time for the place.
GREATER CAIRO broke on top, cleared to the inside, showed the way through the turn, larger lead in midstretch, fell apart late, narrowly saved the show.
ROAD GAME within striking distance along the inside, came up empty for the drive. MAYAN GHOST in the second flight while just off the inside, also found
lacking in the drive. PFLASH OF RED went one paced while racing three wide. GRAND ATLANTIC off a step slow, remained always back while three wide.
BATTALSTOWN fell back to trail for a half, passed some tiring rivals while never a threat. SPECIAL PRYCE was never involved. DATA CAT broke in, rank

Footnotes
ESPOSITO broke alertly, close from the start off the inside, stalked the leader up the backstretch and into the far turn in the three path, engaged that rival
turning for home and wore that same foe down under firm handling. OMEN OF CHANGE broke in good order, asked a bit to clear into the first turn, rated in
the run up the backstretch inside, continued to show the way into the stretch, proved stubborn to the end, clear for the place. OPPORTUNISTIC prompted
the pace in the two path, bit closer in the second turn, could not match the top two in the drive, narrowly lasted for the show. GOSPEL ABE lacked early
foot, continued back the middle half, raced four out to five wide late in the final turn, showed some late interest down the middle of the strip, narrowly missed
the show. SHAKEDOWN lacked early foot while off the inside, continued in the two path second turn, improved position while not a serious threat. GRAY
PHANTOM settled within striking distance off the inside. SWITHERAL broke back, raced four wide out of the second turn, passed some tiring rivals upper
stretch, not dangerous. STAR DOG void of speed, four wide exiting the final turn, also picked off some faltering foes without posing a serious threat. HIGH
RISK STRATEGY tired after racing four wide. DARREN'S FORTUNE reluctant to load, rank behind horses then steadied into the first turn, recovered to
race in mid pack then faded through the stretch. CITY ALL STAR off slowly, remained back. MONDAY CONFESSION within striking distance in the early
going, staged a steady retreat while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SCRUTINIZER prompted the pace in the two path, asked along late in the turn, took over into the stretch, shook clear, kept to task. DRC ALL INCLUSIVE
back off the pace outside, advanced into a forward position four wide in the turn, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clear for the place. PAT
DADDY off the pace while also out in the strip, dropped inside through the turn, in some traffic turning into the stretch, bit closer then flattened out the final
sixteenth to finish up best of the rest. MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS in good striking position three wide, called on for some run midway on the turn, went evenly
through the lane in lacking a winning response. CARMELO void of speed, raced three wide late in the turn, failed to muster a serious response. FAREEQ
sprinted clear soon after the start, went quick early along the inside, weakened when headed for the drive. SOLOMONIC off a step slow, remained always
back. NICKY NUMBERS in mid pack inside, faded.

Footnotes
KNICKS GO away well, gradually cleared to the inside first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch through legit fractious, shrugged off a couple of mild bids
turning for home, drew off through the lane in a sharp effort. BRUDER BOB settled off the pace and the inside, knifed out four wide late in the final turn
when advancing, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. MY SIXTH SENSE in mid pack off the inside, in traffic in the first turn, continued
one paced the middle half, encountered traffic again in the second bend, came up empty when clear toward the inside for the drive. STREET TO INDY
forwardly placed off the inside, three wide in the second turn, had little left for the stretch run. EMPTY TOMB closest to the winner after moving off the
inside, gave way in the drive. ARRIVAL settled off the pace, saved ground, retreated through the stretch. EXEMPLAR broke back, failed to menace. FORTY
UNDER four wide through both turns, tired. DON'T FORGET last to leave, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TOUGH LOVE lacked speed along the inside, saved some ground turn, eased out to split foes nearing the furlong grounds, dropped back inside, roused
briskly, drove clear. ROYAL DAAHER settled off the pace toward the inside, steered out five wide turning for home, showed some good determination for
the place, no real threat to the winner. AMERICAN MANDATE fell back to race n the second flight inside, in traffic and covered up into the turn, angled out
four wide exiting the bend, long drive for the place, missed that position while gaining the nod for the show while between horses at the wire. CANDY
CORNELL pressed the early leader through a rapid set of early fractions, put a head in front late in the turn, continued to show the way past the furlong
marker, could not contain the winner, narrowly missed for the place spot. FAST TALKING lacked early foot, raced in the two path turn, went evenly in the
drive in lacking a late kick. MARKET KING pressed the issue early from outside the first flight, vied three wide through the turn, was weakening late when
rider lost his right iron. MORNING SNOW moved up to show the way inside, set a rapid set of fractions, roused late in the turn, failed to respond then gave
eway. STORMIN HONGKONG was finished early, well back.

Footnotes
BYE BYE J away well from the outside, pressed in the two path in the run up the backstretch, vied between rivals through the turn, put a head in front when
straightened for home, slowly edged away late under steady handling. MATAPAN away in good order, set the pace inside, vied through the bend while
continuing closest to the inside, gave ground grudgingly to the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. GEORGIA'S REWARD forwardly placed off the
inside, closer three wide through the turn, had little for the top two in the drive, remained clear of the others. PROUD VICTORIA last away, trailed early,
three wide through the turn, improved in upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. DIXIE FLYER within striking distance outside, four wide early in
the turn, had little for the drive. BLUSHING BELLA forwardly placed along the inside, tired in the drive. DUTCH TREAT in a bit tight at the start, failed to
menace. ALL ABOUT CLARA four wide trip, never a threat.

Footnotes
O SERAPHINA broke sharp, set all the pace inside while in hand, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. GLAMOUR GIRL
lacked speed in the three path early, two out to three wide again in the second turn, rallied for the place, no threat to the winner. ISLAND SKY broke with the
field, dropped inside to save some ground, in good position in the second bend, had little for the winner or runner up, narrowly saved the show.;. BEST
INTENTIONS settled off the pace toward the inside, continued to save ground in the second bend, improved position a bit in the drive, missed the show.
CLOUDBUSTER settled outside, went one paced in lacking a closing response. HASHTAG WINNER broke back, lacked speed, improved position never
posing a serious threat. UNBURNT remained back while racing toward the inside. CURLS AND BOWS chased in the two path and gave way.
GRAYSONSMACHO GAL restless in the gate, off slowly, trailed most of the way to be always outrun. BUBBLE LINE showed brief speed off the inside and
stopped.
