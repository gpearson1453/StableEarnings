Footnotes
COOL SPRING showed good speed and set the clear pace, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, was pulled in by the rider in order to get her to
change leads coming to the three-sixteenths, extended the advantage under a strong hand ride into the final furlong then came under the whip, drew off
under the whip into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. KEHRON'S CREED chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on
the turn, pursued the winner under the whip in upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. LADY DATE was well placed towards the
front, dropped further off the pace under urging while inside on the turn, was driven into the two path coming to the quarter-pole, drifted out some in upper
stretch, drifted out more significantly outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. PAPER DOLL broke a bit awkwardly
and was off about two lengths slow, moved up into the middle of the field, was ridden along while three wide on the turn, came under the whip in upper
stretch and failed to respond. LIL MS BOSSY PANTS dropped back after breaking in front, settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the
turn, dropped back while still on her inside lead in upper stretch and also failed to respond. MT. RAIN reared at the start then came outward leaving the gate
while off slow, spotted the front several lengths, moved up under urging at the rear of the field, dropped in near the half-mile pole, started the turn in the two
path then shifted four wide, was driven five wide into the stretch and was no factor. EASTER GIRL was urged along off the pace, began to drop back
outside the half-mile pole, fell to the rear just inside that pole, started the turn in the four path, dropped to three then two wide later on that bend and faltered.

Footnotes
HERO OF THE HOUR was hustled to the lead, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace while getting company to his outside, vied inside on the
far turn, was headed outside the quarter-pole, responded well when asked outside the three-sixteenths, regained the slimmest of advantages under a strong
hand ride into the final furlong, was put to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear in the final sixteenth under strong handling. DELP
went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was asked while shifting four wide into the
stretch, chased the leading duo on the outside while under the whip into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage for the place but couldn't match
strides with the winner. MERLIN'S SONG went around the first turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, vied two to three wide on the far
turn, took a short lead outside the quarter-pole, was asked after turning into the stretch, battled outside of the winner under a drive, lost the lead back to that
foe into the final furlong, fought on into the final sixteenth then was outfinished while clear for the show. CHA VEZ went four wide on the first turn, was rated
on the outside, raced three to four wide on the far turn, was given his cue inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and lacked
the needed response. JACKFRUIT was last away then dropped well behind early, rounded the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, went around the
far turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch, shifted further out inside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM was
hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and came up empty. (Rail at 8

FORTY NINE MODEL was coaxed from the start and moved clear shifting in, dictated terms in the two path, extended the margin through the turn, was
asked near the three-sixteenths and responded to draw away. ORETTA bumped the outside rival at the start, chased the leader from outside going in the
four then five path on the turn and was asked past the three-eighths pole, moved clear of other rivals while drifting in about mid-stretch but was no threat to
the winner. C'ESTBON C'ESTBON was in tight behind rivals nearing the five-eighths pole and switched out at that juncture, pursued the leader in the three
path into and on the turn, was asked for more by the five-sixteenths, exchanged a few light brushes in the stretch with CATCAKE, who raced inside foes on
the turn, exchanged some brushes with the aforementioned in upper- and mid-stretch and had no rally. GOODNIGHT GRACIE shifted in heading up the
backstretch about the nine-sixteenths racing in the three path behind foes into the turn, came out in mid-stretch and failed to rally. JENNIFER'S ARCH
bobbled just slightly and was bumped at the start, raced outside foes close up in the early going, dropped back in the six then seven path on the turn, was
eased through the final furlong and walked off. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY. FINISH MARGIN

Footnotes
SPIDER DANCE broke a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved at the rear of the field, went three wide on the far turn, followed
the runner-up in the four path into the stretch, rallied outside under a left-handed whip and closed strongly to get up late. SHE'S DIVINE bumped with BEE
BIT at the start, bumped again with that foe early, rounded the first turn in the three path, was reserved under a snug hold, raced two then three wide on the
far turn, came between horses at the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed well to take the lead under a left-handed whip into the final
furlong, disposed of BANSHEE BIRDIE outside the sixteenth-pole but was denied by the winner while clear for the place. BANSHEE BIRDIE went clear
early, dropped from the three to the two path on the first turn, set the pace through moderate fractions, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was
asked near the quarter-pole then put to the whip in upper stretch, lost the lead into the final furlong and was out-kicked while clear for the show. BRILLIANT
SLEW veered in at the start, was taken in hand early then rated on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch
and failed to rally. WINGS OF FURY became keen under restraint early, went four wide into the first turn then tucked into the three path, was rated under
tight restraint on the outside, went three wide while let out on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. BEE BIT bumped with SHE'S
DIVINE at the start, bumped again with that opponent early, was caught five wide on the first turn then reserved on the outside, dropped back while five then
four wide on the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, dropped in inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. BREAKFAST POND
went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, dropped back while five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. (Rail at 8 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
ON DECK switched outside the pacesetter approaching the half-mile marker, went three wide through the turn edging closer on that bend to take command
at the top of the stretch, drew clear under a drive. ITS COLD IN DEHERE raced outside foes into the turn going five deep through that bend and off the
leaders, was no match for the winner but held the place under urging. BELLA FALAYA bumped the inside rival at the start, raced at the rear in behind foes
and was slightly steadied and altered course outside a rival about the half-mile marker, came into the turn in the three path, shifted to the rail about the
five-sixteenths advancing inside foes, came out a path for room in the stretch and ran on well but missed the place. CITIBIKE broke outwardly then was
coaxed forward to set the pace shifting in to the two path up the backstretch and in the clear, continued just off the fence through the turn and was
challenged leaving that bend, was overtaken while coming in a bit turning into upper stretch and weakened thereafter. WILD MUNNY was bumped at the
start, fought a hard restraint when in behind a rival passing the half-mile marker, continued to fight till nearing the three-eighths at which point she was
allowed to go racing in the two then moving to the three path early on the turn, quickened briefly at that juncture but was empty in the stretch. SMOKIN HOT
MOMMA pursued the leader from between rivals going four wide into the turn, soon dropped back, however, and faded in the lane while not under pressure
late. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

DR LIZ bumped lightly with a rival at the start, showed good speed and set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the
lead briefly into upper stretch, responded well when asked for her best shortly thereafter, shook off the runner-up approaching the furlong marker and
maintained a safe advantage under steady urging. MOONLIGHT MICHELLE broke a step slow, moved up on the outside under urging, advanced in the four
path on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, spun five wide into the stretch, took a brief and short lead shortly thereafter, was repelled by the
winner nearing the furlong marker and outfinished while able to get the place. YES GORGEOUS was well spotted towards the inside, dropped back along
the rail early on the turn then was shuffled back more behind SUNSHINE DEELITE late on that bend, came under a drive in upper stretch and finished with
good energy for the show. D J SOUL SISTA bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled at the rear, started the turn in the two path, angled four wide near
the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and gained for the last spot in the superfecta. WIDDLE GIANT was bumped at the start and forced in,
settled towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, was carried seven wide into the stretch then dropped in
some, moved back out near the furlong marker and failed to rally. ATCHATA broke in at the start, settled off the pace, was shuffled back behind SUNSHINE
DEELITE in the two to three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TOUGH KICKS broke in at the start, settled
just off the pace, was urged along in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and capitulated. SUNSHINE DEELITE was bumped at the

Footnotes
CHESS CHIEF tracked just off the leaders along the inside through the first turn coming out about a path leaving that bend for the run up the backstretch,
was still within range inside a foe but off the fence entering the far turn moving out to the three path by the five-sixteenths then coming into upper stretch
four wide with room and commencing a bid, took over coming to the three-sixteenths and kicked clear despite drifting in past the furlong marker. IRISH
WIND raced outside the winner into the first turn but in the three path through that bend, continued to race alongside that one three to four wide on the far
turn, came into upper stretch five deep, dueled with CORNSTARCH to share the place while drifting in a bit late. CORNSTARCH exchanged a bump at the
break, was caught outside rivals four wide in the early going racing in the back half of the field, shifted in a path up the backstretch going three deep into the
far turn but gradually shifting out on that bend, came past the quarter pole six wide, ranged up alongside the aforementioned rival and dueled with that one
to share the place also while drifting in a bit late. DR. HIPP exchanged light contact heading to the first turn with an inside rival, went three wide stalking that
foe through that bend then edged closer to prompt the issue early up the backstretch drawing on even terms, continued this way also going about three wide
through the far turn then weakened in the stretch. DREAM HALO raced at the rear well back and removed from the rail in the five path through the first turn,
shifted in heading up the backstretch and moved inside a rival in the two to three path on the far turn, came out near the furlong marker and finished well.
JOB SECURITY exchanged a bump at the break, dropped back from between rivals three to four wide early on the first turn, continued four wide dropping
back to last into the far turn, moved out seven wide near the eighth pole and ran on. SAMARONTI exchanged light contact heading to the first turn, shifted in
while on the lead from the two path early on that bend to the rail, was clear turning up the backstretch but was pressured early up the straight, continued to
be pressured while racing on or just off the rail through the far turn then gave way in the stretch. GALINDO saved ground mid-pack into the first turn coming
out a path on that bend, continued mid-division up the backstretch going in the two to three path on the far turn, failed to produce a rally and tired in the
lane. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
CALL ON MISCHIEF bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled comfortably off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked for her best in
upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, switched back to her inside lead at that point, closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, swapped back to the
proper lead at that point then blew by the runner-up to win clear under good handling. LILLIE DELL bumped hard with a rival at the start while also bumping
with another foe, moved up to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside, moved clear nearing the seven-sixteenths, extended the advantage
along the rail on the turn, drew off under a strong hand ride in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to hold the place.
BET YOUR BANKROLL lost her footing slightly at the start while bumping with a foe then dropped back, settled at the rear of the field, went around most of
the turn in the two path, dropped to the rail outside the quarter-pole then cut the corner into the stretch, was put to the whip shortly thereafter, rallied into the
final furlong, moved out while closing fast late and just missed the place while able to get the show. JOSIE bumped with a foe at the start then swerved in
while slow into stride, spotted the front several lengths, settled towards the rear, saved ground while roused on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path, gained into the final furlong, moved out late and finished with good energy for the last spot in the superfecta. WESTERN TAFFY settled on the outside,
was urged along while four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and lacked the
needed response while gaining some ground. MAGA SUITE bumped with a foe at the start then dropped back, was urged along on the outside, went four to
five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch under the whip and gained some but failed to threaten. HAILEY'S DAY was hustled from the start,
pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back nearing the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch
and tired. SUMMERS HOPE chased the pace on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then moved out more around
the three-sixteenths and came up empty. MOMENTO bumped with a foe at the start then dropped back, settled off the pace, was asked while three to four
wide on the turn and was no factor. SHI O'SHI bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed towards the front, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was
hard ridden while inside on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths and came up empty.
BAYERLY SEEN was urged along towards the front, dropped back while three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing
left. (Rail at 8 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY
