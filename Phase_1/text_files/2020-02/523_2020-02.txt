Footnotes
MULBERRY was hustled along to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, responded when challenged
by SINGING ALLI with a sixteenth to run and gamely held that rival off late. SINGING ALLI was away in good order then reserved just off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn, reached the winner inside the sixteenth pole but could not get by that foe to just miss. MERLIN'S JEWEL broke sharply
to chase the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and finished willingly. JAMAICAN CENTS lacked early foot, raced
five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but lacked the needed late response. AUBREY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. FAITH FACTOR settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
TIZEZZY steadied soon after the start, raced just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run
and drew clear. DAWOOD lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good late
energy. LUCKY WITH YOU stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with BUBBA
NIGHTLINGER and gave way through the final furlong. SEBASTIAN CAPE lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the
drive and finished with some late run. BUBBA NIGHTLINGER was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with KING LEBRON while racing
three-wide, responded when challenged by BUBBA NIGHTLINGER after nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with that foe and gave way through the final
furlong. INCLUDE HOO raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. KING LEBRON broke sharply to dispute
the early pace and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
SPANDEX BRITCHES was void of any early speed, went three wide into the turn, angled out, was gaining late and was up in time for the win.
LAUGHAROO pressed the early pace, went five wide into the turn, took a brief lead, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best. SOPHIA SAID
WHAT was allowed to stalk the early pace, raced between rivals into the turn and offered a mild late rally. TIZ DONNA BELLA was allowed to settle early,
circled seven wide through the turn, was closing late and needed more ground. CRAVING YOU tracked the early pace, went six wide into the turn, took a
brief lead and weakened. SAY HELLO TO HEAT set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn and faded. MUSICALLY was taken back and was
no threat.

SHAKURA was allowed to follow the early pace, went five wide into the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear for the win. TSURUOKA set a
clear early pace, raced off the rail into the turn, angled to the inside, was no match late and was clearly second best. HASHTAG DREAMER was allowed to
settle early, went three wide into the turn and was empty in the drive. FIERY LUCK was taken back early, went five wide into the turn, angled out and
offered no late rally. BACK IN THE DAY was unhurried early, went four wide into the turn and never fired. QUEEN KARYS hopped at the start, raced in mid
pack early, drifted out eight wide through the turn and faded. BRASS COUNTY was void of any early speed and was no threat. KHLOEE'S PRIDE was
away slowly, made a six wide middle move and flattened out.

rail into the home turn and faded. ZACH'S DASH raced in mid pack early, circled seven wide through the second turn and offered no late rally. TAMAIT (FR)
was unhurried early, advanced six wide into the second turn and never fired. SUPER ACCORD tracked the early pace, made a five wide middle move into

Footnotes
ROLLER raced unhurried early, advanced three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly drew off. REBACK HOME
chased the pace of TRUST THE VAN while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner in the drive but finished with good courage to hold the
place. VIC TORIES showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and finished with a late
rally. TRUST THE VAN was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the eleven-sixteenths pole
and gave way through the final furlong. MO ED WHO lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SCOTTY WHO
raced four-wide through both turns and did not offer a bid. VEIL'S VENGEANCE was forwardly placed from the inside, weakened after going five furlongs,
was eased through the final furlong and vanned off.
