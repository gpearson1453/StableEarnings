PRIME HOOK raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the second turn and drove clear before the wire. MAJESTIC SOCIETY void of
early speed, made a steady gain, raced outside around the final turn and was a clear second. SIR ESKE raced in the middle of the field, made a late bid,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. HOPE FOR CHANGE went to the front, drove clear and weakened. RUNCIMAN pressed the early
pace, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CHROMED HEART challenged for the early lead and was finished early. CHARMING BULLET bumped
start, raced near the back, came around the first turn wide and was never close. AURORA PINE broke in, raced in the rear, came around the first turn wide
and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TEZ raced within contention, moved up on the outside around the second turn, took command, drove clear and proved the best. ORO DE TEJANO raced in
the middle of the field, made a late rally and finished willingly. CENTSMYBABYLEFTME dueled for the early lead, saved ground, was close throughout, but
proved no match for the top two. POPULIST pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for third. CANDIZAR bumped at the start,
raced in the back in the beginning, moved up and finished evenly. CAN IF I CAN raced near the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. SAVING
ARGUMENT broke out, raced in the rear and was never a threat. JOHNNYSJOURNEY dueled for the early lead and faded. POPPI IS SMILING void of
early speed and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #9 POPULIST LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #10 TEZ FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE
FINAL TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

LANGS DAY reared at the start, racing in the rear, circled the field and was going away at the end. LOUISIANA HERO raced in the middle of the field, made
a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. PICKENS went to the front, drove clear and weakened late. GUILTY AGAIN pressed the
pace, raced four wide around the first turn and finished evenly. DON LOUIS lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. SLITHER
challenged for the early lead and was finished early. TONI'S STAR raced within contention and dropped back. PALMY SUNDAE void of early speed and
was never a threat.
