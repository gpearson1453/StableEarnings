Footnotes
GOLAZO saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch, bid for the lead near the sixteenth pole and determinedly prevailed.
SELF AWARENESS circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path in upper stretch, gained a short lead near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly.
DESHACKLED chased the pace, was well positioned in the three path turning for home and faded in the drive. ROYAL THUNDER saved ground on the
turn, eased out approaching the stretch, altered course to the five path when caught behind several horses approaching the eighth pole and failed to
menace. COMMISSIONER BIGGS sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened.
GALLINIPPER was no factor. ABUELO PAPS , steadied at the break, was five deep turning for home. SEVILLE ROW was outrun. JIMMY LEGS , outrun,
hugged the inner rail on the turn.

Footnotes
TWIN VALOR shadowed the leader two to three wide and under rating, bid in hand to engage from the outside after a half mile, took over soon into the lane,
was roused clear near the three sixteenths, wandered outward despite efforts with the right stick and held sway. GREEK GOD cleared early and angled in to
set a rated pace, was joined leaving the far turn, dueled mid turn to upper stretch, saw the winner get away a bit in mid stretch but dug in and continued
gamely to the line. PRIME TIME MAN , edged up between foes early on and stalked the pace, was under pressure three wide giving chase into the stretch
but lacked a solid response. DEDICATED , three deep into the turn, was under a ride four wide into the stretch and gave way. FREE TO TRUMP raced
inside rivals into the turn, pursued to the the lane then weakened. SHOTMASTER was outrun.

CHUCK'S DREAM set the pace slightly off the rail and pulled away through the stretch under a hand ride. GOODLUCKCHUCK , pinched back leaving the
starting gate, saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside foes. LITTLE BAY circled the turn three wide,
floated to the five path in upper stretch and offered a slight rally. DEVOTION IN MOTION bore out leaving the starting gate, chased the pace and gave way
the final furlong. LET ME ASK BOB , a forward factor in the two path between horses into the turn, gave way leaving the turn. CARTHAGE , four deep on
the turn, chased the pace and gev way. TRUE SHIPMAN , outrun, swung to the six path in upper stretch. SWAMP WATER , no factor, was steadied when
racing greenly in traffic near the eighth pole. STRAITOUTA CONGTIN chased the pace in the three path between horses and gave way in upper stretch.
LIAR trailed.

Footnotes
ITGOT GRANDMA quickly established a clear advantage, set the pace in the two path, came out when threatened near the three sixteenths, straightened to
hold a clear lead past the furlong grounds, wandered outward with about a sixteenth remaining then held firm after being corrected with right handed stick
work. MY MAN POTS N PANS saved ground, edged up nearing the far turn, remained inside under rating and spied the winner past the three eighths,
altered out for room entering the lane, was floated out some near the three sixteenths, switched over to his correct lead and gave game chase to the wire.
SASSY KING , unhurried early and off the inside, angled six wide for the drive, moved up outside rivals near mid stretch and continued on to bridge the gap.
MARDEN , off the pace, eased back and dropped in leaving the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, moved up between rivals leaving mid stretch and
churned on. PAUL THE WAITER stalked the winner while three wide, was under pressure four wide into the stretch and faded. FLIP , lost ground four to five
wide, was under a hearty ride mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way. TOP ME OFF , three wide pursuing, dropped back near the stretch.
CLOSER LOOK , off last when breaking inward, straightened and advanced inside rivals heading to the turn, remained in range past the three eighths then
dropped back through the drive.

ARTFUL SPLATTER , right to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and drew away through the stretch while kept to her business. TEAM WIN , alertly

wide the first turn, chased the pace two wide around the far turn, faded in the drive and her rider dropped his whip in upper stretch. SALTWORKS , two wide
the first turn and down the backstretch, chased the winner, saved ground the far turn and weakened through the stretch. BIRD TRAFFIC , three wide the
first turn, was fanned four deep entering the stretch and gave way. VOW TO DANCE was outrun. LILO'S CALL gave way entering the far turn and was

Footnotes
MISS ALIPHANT settled four wide, ranged up in hand approaching the stretch, moved to command after six furlongs, was roused clear soon after, drifted in
towards the rail and widened while kept to task. BEATUBYACHUBINOSE stalked off the rail, angled out past the three eighths, raced four wide giving chase
past the three sixteenths, kept on willingly and earned the place. CANOOCHEE saved ground and quickly gained near the five eighths marker, stalked
around the turn, eased out into the stretch, pursued between runners past the sixteenth marker but was out finished. NOTHIN BUT A SMILE saved ground,
steadied briefly when attempting to angled out near the three eighths marker, raced inside into the lane, lacked room past the quarter pole, was guided
outside rivals in the final sixteenth and finished with interest. SOMMER SOMETHING took over early, set the pace in the two path, failed to resist the winner
leaving the quarter pole, stayed willingly to the sixteenth marker while chasing inside rivals then faded. FRENCH NOUGET chased the early pace outside
SOMMER SOMETHING and tired after six furlongs. TOWSON , acting up prior to the gates springing, reared spotting the field several lengths, recovered
while well back, moved up some into the turn, angled out, circled six wide into the stretch and gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of
TOWSON. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
COOL MAN CLETUS pulled his rider to the early lead, set a pressured pace along the rail and drew out through the stretch under urging. MR.
CHESAPEAKECITY prompted the pace outside the winner around the turn, steadily drifted out from the three sixteenths pole to inside the sixteenth pole
and held the pace. ALLTHEWRONGREASONS , in the three path between horses chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. INDIAN
GHOST , five deep turning for home, rallied between horses. LUNAR IMAGE bore out leaving the starting gate, was well placed leaving the turn, swung to
the five path in upper stretch and came up empty`. ALWAYS FORGIVEN , pinched back leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and was
outrun. SING A VERSE raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. BAD ANGLE BURKE hugged the inner rail, was shuffled back entering the
turn then retreated. PAID HOLIDAY , a forward factor four deep on the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
GOTTAFLATHAVEHER stalked the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside ONE ODD STORY in upper stretch then drew off under brisk urging.
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA , a little rank behind horses down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, found room along the rail through the stretch and
rallied late. SILVER SIDES , outside throughout, was not a factor. REDEEMED SPIRIT saved ground on the turn, angled off the rail approaching the stretch
and gave way. ONE ODD STORY sped to the early lead, angled in, set the pace along the rail around the turn, drifted out near the eighth pole and gave
way.
