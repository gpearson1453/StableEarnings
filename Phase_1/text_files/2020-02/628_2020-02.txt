Footnotes
GEORGE TOWN CAT set a pressured pace inside, drew away on the turn and held on well. JAXBRADENRISHI drafted at the heels of George Town Cat
through most of the backstretch, came out a path for racing room nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail rounding the turn then dueled through the
stretch for second. KULANI gave chase and rounded the turn two deep, was then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. LATE CALLER chased the pace
and raced three wide on the turn then finished evenly at the outside poll of Kulani. ROLLING BROOK chased the pace then steadied behind a quickly
narrowing opening nearing the five sixteenths pole, couldn't recover stride and was eased to the outside leaving the turn. Following a stewards inquiry,
Jaxbradenrishi was disqualified to last place for interfering with the progress of Rolling Brook nearing the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
COOL MO stalked the early pace then took over nearing the three eighths pole, was urged clear approaching the quarter then kept alert to steadily widen.
DUDES PICK settled off the pace in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn three wide then dueled for second in
the upper stretch. NEXT SUMMER settled off the pace in the three and four paths, bid nearing the three eighths pole, checked in tight at the rail at the
eighth pole and was along for third. LADY LICIOUS stalked the pace from the three path, challenged at the three eighths pole, came through the far turn
three wide then faded. MIZZBANG mostly saved ground. ONE SMART CALLER accelerated to the lead and angled to the inside to set the pace, but was
caught nearing the three eighths pole, faded readily from that point and galloped to the finish.

Footnotes
THE PREDICTOR angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, raced clear past the quarter pole and was
steadily handled to hold on well. ROYAL BLUE stalked the pace two deep then challenged at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and
finished evenly. I NEED YOU settled off the pace and off the rail, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path then
flattened stride late. BLAME THE KIDS settled off the pace in the two and three paths then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and passed rivals down the lane. CHARITABLE HERO stalked the early pace about the three path, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path then weakened. EL EMANUEL mostly saved ground. GLEN'S CASTLE raced five wide on the
first turn, made a mild bid on the backstretch then weakened. TECHNICALLYSPEAKIN was not a factor.

THESWEETESTTABOO stalked the pace from the three path, bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the lead three wide nearing the quarter,
raced clear past the pole then steadily widened. SECRET O'LIFE raced well back saving ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved at the
rail rounding the far turn, eased out into the stretch and got up for second the final stride. MATTYICE settled off the pace in the three path then eased out
into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the three path and was nipped from second under the wire. OH
BABY BABY raced well back through the first turn then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and could only improve
her position. MISS TSCHETTER rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met at even terms then caught
approaching the quarter then weakened leaving the far turn. KIM'S PET bobbled leaving the gate and rated off the pace toward the inside, then faded
through the backstretch. PRIME LIME was hustled along early and stalked the pace, challenged nearing the three eighths pole, moved to even terms past
the three eighths but dropped back approaching the head of the lane, showed no further response and was not encouraged further.

Footnotes
SIENTE EL VIENTO saved ground off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, progressed steadily at the rail on the far turn and dug in through the
stretch to get up the final yards. TRUFFLES AND GOLD angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, dug in
under steady encouragement leaving the far turn but was caught the final yards. SIR LONGWOOD raced well reserved in the two and three paths then
started a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved at the rail rounding the far turn, angled out leaving the eighth pole and finished evenly for third.
SCOTTISH MAN raced in the seven path the opening turn and was well back leaving the turn, bid past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn eight
wide and passed rivals down the lane. SILVER CASTLE stalked the pace two deep and challenged leaving the three eighths pole, but dropped back toward
the head of the lane and showed little more. BIZ NASTY raced in the four and five paths the first turn and was well off the pace into the backstretch, came
through the far turn in the seven path and passed some faders. SUNBRIDLED rounded the opening turn in the five path, showed only mild response
through the backstretch then flattened six wide on the far turn. COMPROMISO raced in the six path the opening turn and was not a factor. THE NAMES
BILLY came through the first turn in the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, left the far turn in the five path then weakened. ORACLE OF OMAHA
saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn.
