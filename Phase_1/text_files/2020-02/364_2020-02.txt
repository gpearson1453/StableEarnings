Footnotes
CARTER'S RUN raced in the five path the first turn then settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, drew to even
terms three wide on the turn, was carried out approaching the top of the stretch but dug in to recover the advantage mid-stretch then drew away through
later yards. CHARITABLE SPENNY stalked the early pace two deep, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim brief lead while between horses
approaching the quarter pole, drifted out toward the head of the lane then dug in for second while proving no match later yards. GATTOSING rated a short
lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, dug in when met at even terms toward the quarter pole and contested the edge nearest the
rail most of the far turn, was caught again mid-stretch and weakened the final sixteenth. WHERE'S THE LIME settled off the pace in the two and three paths
then bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but showed little more. ROCKAROUND rounded the opening turn in the five path, bid
leaving the three eighths pole then flattened stride in the three path of the far turn. WINDSOR HILL showed little response past the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
HOMER J settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and dueled to even terms four wide at the quarter pole, was carried out nearing the
head of the lane then dug in through the stretch to get up the final strides. BANISHMENT settled off the pace in the three and four paths then stalked into
the backstretch, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, drifted toward the head of the lane, dueled to the lead mid-stretch but was caught the final
strides. STEP OUT DANCING raced off the early pace then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled to a slim lead approaching the five sixteenths
pole, contested even terms from the quarter pole, was caught mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded the final yards. CASTLEFINN raced in the four path the first
turn then settled back off the rail into the second turn, eased out entering the backstretch, started a bid from the three eighths pole, came through the far
turn in the five path and finished well. OUR CHARITABLE came through the opening turn in the five path then settled off the pace, bid toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished well while between horses late. JACKY'S MAN settled off the pace and off the rail then bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then weakened while drifting outward. JOEY GOTCHA rated the pace off the rail,
was pressured toward the three eighths pole, caught toward the five sixteenths, dropped back into the far turn then weakened the final sixteenth.
SEVENTYSEVEN FORCE showed little response through the backstretch.

DARK TRICKS rated a slim lead inside, raced with the edge at the rail to mid turn, drew clear at that point and was steadily handled to hold on well.
ZIRCON ZLOTY broke in to exchange contact with Treasured Info then engaged in close chase, rounded the turn two deep but drifted toward the top of the
stretch and had to settle for second. GINGER IN DISGUISE was unprepared for the start and came away a step slow then angled to the outside to give
chase, came through the turn in the four path and finished evenly. DOCUMENTED engaged in close chase through the backstretch but dropped back
toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail through the turn and showed little more. MRS POOCHIE gave chase toward the inside and showed little in the
lane. TREASURED INFO broke out to exchange contact with Zircon Zloty, picked up the chase inside, though never factored.

Footnotes
RAVENEL raced in the four path the opening turn and took the lead three wide leaving the turn then moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under riders'
pressure midway on the far turn, was steadily handled to just inside the sixteenth pole then taken in hand later yards. IM A TRICKY ONE saved ground the
opening turn and settled off the pace into the backstretch, eased out with a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and raced
evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. SHARPIN rated close while saving ground into the first turn then eased four wide into the backstretch, bid from
the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride through the lane. CORY'S CUTIE raced well back from early contention while
saving ground, bid past the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and showed little more. HI HI HOLLY saved ground off the pace,
showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the four path. SAINTE THERESE rated the early pace inside but was caught
leaving the first turn, gave chase through the backstretch then faded at the rail on the far turn. SEDUCTIVE rounded the first turn in the five path and never
factored. HANALEI SUNSET rated close to the early pace, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, however, showed no response to
relentless urging.
