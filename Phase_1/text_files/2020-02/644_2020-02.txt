Footnotes
GUNSLINGER (IRE) broke a step slow, angled to the rail tightening things up on MANHATTAN PROJECT and YEAR OF THE KITTEN into the first turn,
edged closer behind a wall of horses in the two-path leaving the far turn, angled inward finding a seam past the eighth-pole, moved to the rail and outkicked
BONDURANT for the decision. BONDURANT saved ground unhurried early, advanced around the far turn two then three wide, bid into the lane and forged
to the front through the furlong grounds, led to the final yards but could not contain the top one. HOT AND HEAVY advanced on his own courage up the
backstretch, loomed large challenging for command turning for home in the four-path, but flattened out a bit late. PHILO went along in the second flight two
wide for six furlongs, swung further out for the drive and gained mildly late outside the leaders. REMEMBER THE MAINE saved ground around the far turn
well back, shifted out into the stretch and was no threat with a mild response. THE QUEENS JULES vied inside NEVER HAVE I EVER through sharp
fractions to the stretch, and weakened in the late stages. FARLEY hugged the rail for six furlongs, remained inside boxed in behind horses through upper
stretch, steadied trying to get through inside THE QUEENS JULES unsuccessfully a furlong out, and was never fully set down. YEAR OF THE KITTEN was
slow from the gate, steadied in tight going to the first turn in the two-path, wound up well out in the course entering the backstretch, and never made his
presence felt. MISTER MAESTRO was forwardly placed three wide for nearly six furlongs, and gave way. NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) was hard to load,
argued swift splits outside THE QUEENS JULES to the stretch, and tired. MANHATTAN PROJECT was slow from the gate, steadied in tight along the rail
going to the first turn near the back, and showed little. MAJESTIC LUNA was four to five wide throughout, and gave way after six furlongs.

Footnotes
I'LL FIGHT DEMPSEY took the lead just after the start and continued to hold firm over challenger's around the turn, roused for more out of the turn, raced
two wide into upper stretch, stayed sharp in response and kept to task. CANDY MACHINE raced in contention and coaxed along the outside around the
turn, continued with good response in stretch run, could not reach the winner but dug in and prevailed for the runner up spot. EXPENSIVE STYLE raced in
range along the inside in early going, pushed along through the turn, dueled for the second placing with rival in stretch run, got edged for position in final
stride while holding a clear advantage over the rest. ASHIHAM raced widest off the pace in the opening quarter, urged along the outside around the turn,
raced widest in the lane and gained position without threatening the top trio. CENTASTIC chased up close in opening stages, continued to hustle along into
the turn then failed to keep pace late turn and gave way. UNPRECEDENTED broke on top then conceded position but continued to chase in range of the
early leaders, coaxed along into the turn then flattened near the quarter pole and offered no late rally. TIGER'S BACK raced near the rear and quickly
angled to the inside to save ground, switched out a couple paths around the turn, kept under a drive three to four wide upper stretch but failed to advance.
GOOD JUJU raced near the rear and switched in a few paths moving through the backstretch, hustled along and raced three wide into the lane but failed to
move into contention. BREAKAWAY ROMANCE raced in the back and saved ground to no avail. GOLDEN WAVE angled closer to the inside after the start,
coaxed around the turn then moved into stretch five wide and had no late response.

WITH VERVE loped along unhurried at the back for three furlongs or so, swung out four wide taking closer order approaching the stretch, rallied steadily on
the far outside and was along in time. SHIVAREE broke awkwardly to get away slowest, loomed up three wide outside the leaders at the top of the stretch,
and finished gamely just inside the top one. OURNATIONONPARADE ranged up outside KING SNAKE and SMASH FACTOR heading into the turn, fought
with the latter from the five-sixteenths to deep stretch, and yielded grudgingly. SMASH FACTOR vied outside KING SNAKE up the backstretch, disposed of
that one and moved inside behind joined by OURNATIONONPARADE around the turn, fought on to deep stretch and weakened on the rail. PERUVIAN
BOY raced in the two-path within range for a half-mile, and lacked the needed response in the drive. KING SNAKE hustled up along the rail to take a short
early lead inside SMASH FACTOR, lost the advantage heading into the turn and faded gradually.

VITALOGY (GB) was forwardly placed out of the gate and angled in to race two wide around the first turn, raced in tracking mode under slight restraint
positioned behind the pacesetter, edged up a bit closer late backstretch then let out a notch and grabbed a slim lead near the quarter pole while under
attack from FAMISHED, shook off aforementioned foe and cleared on top near the furlong grounds, kept on determinedly and held firm under a driving
finish. TIESTO raced three wide entering the first turn then settled nicely off the pace to the far turn, loomed closer along the outside near the quarter pole,
roused six wide into stretch run and got up late for place. SOUTH BEND got bumped a bit at the start then remained unhurried down the backstretch, picked
up the pace and edged closer racing five wide late far turn, set down driving seven wide in final furlong, finished with response and edged foe for show.
SASSY BUT SMART saved ground on the first turn then raced under slight restraint not too far off the early pace, advanced two to three wide through traffic
on the final turn, moved up to race in range for the lead then yielded in final sixteenth. FAMISHED raced near mid-pack under a snug hold down the
backstretch, moved up to duel for the lead with VITALOGY near the quarter pole, could not match with eventual winner top of the lane but stayed on then
gave way in the final furlong. TURN OF EVENTS was forwardly placed and saved ground on the first turn, stayed inside and tracked the pacesetter to the
far turn, began to launch a bid but was forced to steady while in tight near the quarter pole and gave way. LIFE ON TOP brushed with rival at the start then
angled to the inside entering the first turn, remained off the pace to the far turn, swung out leaving the far turn, was set down driving five wide but lacked a
needed rally. STREET READY raced under a snug hold to take back in early backstretch, tugged up a bit closer and was forced to steady, continued off the
pace then steadied slightly late final turn and failed to launch a bid. FENWICK STATION raced four wide entering the first turn then rated off the pace, raced
between foes and steadied near the quarter pole and failed to move on. BEE CATCHER reared in the air at the start, was reserved in the back, saved
ground then raced five wide into lane and lacked response. ALLGORILLA took over the lead nearing the first turn, held a clear advantage down the
backstretch, got collared around the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
GETMOTHERAROSE got jostled around between CONQUEST HARDCANDY and MISS MUNNINGS at the break and bobbled, advanced through some
traffic around the far turn, came clear in the three-path straightening away for the drive and responded well to collar SILVER KITTEN and kick away.
SILVER KITTEN set the pace inside, shook off VALEDICTORIAN in upper stretch and moved clear, could not deny the winner a sixteenth out but held well
for the place. SISTER HANAN settled near the back for six furlongs near the three-path, maneuvered out five wide past the quarter-pole getting in gear, and
finished with good energy for a share. LA FEVE (FR) saved ground early in midpack, continued inside reserved but moving up around the far turn, was
boxed in past the quarter-pole, remained jammed up behind VALEDICTORIAN as the eventual winner rolled by on her outside, got clearance in deep
stretch and finished evenly. MISS MUNNINGS brushed with GETMOTHERAROSE at the start, lagged in the second flight for six furlongs, cut the corner
into the stretch, and made no late headway in the two-path. VALEDICTORIAN prompted the pace outside SILVER KITTEN for six furlongs, had every
chance turning for home but came up empty and weakened the last eighth of a mile. MUNCHKIN MONEY trailed early two wide, moved out a bit further into
the stretch and passed only tired horses. ATOMIC BLONDE stayed in range for six furlongs, had aim in the three-path into the lane and failed to fire.
CONQUEST HARDCANDY brushed with GETMOTHERAROSE at the start, raced in striking range three then four wide to the far turn, and gave way before
reaching the stretch. SWEET HITCH HIKER saved ground to no avail. STEELIN MAGNOLIAS raced three then four wide, and was finished early.

Footnotes
HARVEY WALLBANGER was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, remained in the back reserved on the inside down the
backstretch, given cue midway around the turn, responded willingly, surged on the rail to quickly gain a clear advantage then kept under a mild drive in
stretch run and finished going away. OLYMPIC VILLAGE raced in range and tracked the pace down the backstretch, prompted and advanced three wide to
race in aim for the lead mid-turn then failed to be a match when HARVEY WALLBANGER surged to command just after, stayed on under a three wide drive
in the lane and settled for second best. SCARS ARE COOL was unhurried and raced off the pace down the backstretch, circled four to five into closer
contention on the far turn then hustled along in stretch run, stayed on with interest and nipped foe to take show. JUST WHISTLE rated off the top trio
through early stages then given cue to advance near the half mile marker, stayed one-paced around the turn then kept under a drive two wide in stretch and
got nipped for show. SQUEEZADIOS attended the pace around the first turn, remained forwardly positioned near the inside down the backstretch then
flattened and lost position around the far turn and offered no late rally. PLUS QUE PARFAIT tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, prompted and advanced
to briefly hold a slim lead at the five-sixteenths pole, got collared strides after when HARVEY WALLBANGER surged to command then gave way. MCERIN
disputed the pace around the first turn then led the way with rival's racing in close contention, got collared for the lead mid-way around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
ELIZABETH WAY (IRE) bumped lightly with EMPRESSOF THE NILE at the start, took control through the stretch the first time, rated along slowing things
down for a half-mile, gradually increased the tempo as needed entering the stretch in the two-path and had ample reserves to remain clear. ROMANTIC
PURSUIT bumped with LEMON ZIP at the start, tracked outside the leaders three wide in the clear up the backstretch, rallied through mid stretch and
finished gamely between horses. LA SIGNARE (FR) stayed in range primarily in the three-path while reserved for better than a mile, had a clear shot
through the stretch but did not have enough. TOURIGA (BRZ) saved ground on the turns, and offered a mild late response in the two-path to earn a share.
LAYLA NOOR hugged the rail staying close to the stretch, and weakened in the late stages under pressure. EMPRESSOF THE NILE was bumped lightly
between horses at the start, raced three wide on the turns and posed no threat. QUEEN OF TIME (GB) saved ground early, had the two-path on the far turn
and failed to menace. CAP DE CREUS bumped with LEMON ZIP at the start, was held up uncomfortable between horses at the back going to the first turn,
was forced to circle five wide on the far turn and could not make up much ground. FERDINANDA trailed inside for six furlongs, moved out three wide late on
the far turn, and lacked a bid. ENGLISH AFFAIR prompted the pace outside ELIZABETH WAY, could not maintain position between that one and
ROMANTIC PURSUIT in upper stretch, and faded. RAINING LEMONS bumped lightly with EMPRESSOF THE NILE at the start, put in a four-wide move on
the far turn but fizzled out. LEMON ZIP was bumped between horses at the start, and never reached contention.

Footnotes
MISTER CANDY RIDE was unhurried out of the gate and remained near the rear down the backstretch, gained position along the inside around the far turn,
tipped out wider top stretch, headed in pursuit for ROGUE ELEMENT, dug in determinedly and got up late. ROGUE ELEMENT disputed the pace out of the
chute then set a pressured pace down the backstretch, dueled for the lead with GIMME SOME MO around the final turn, shook free top of the lane, kept on
gamely and got caught in final strides. GIMME SOME MO was forwardly placed and raced three to four wide in striking range of the pace down the
backstretch, vied for the lead with ROGUE ELEMENT on the final turn, could not move on with rival upper stretch but stayed on and lasted for a share.
FRIED RICE KING raced off the pace three to four wide, gained ground along the inside around the far turn then shifted out three wide and had a mild
improve. AJHAR tracked up close along the rail under snug hold early on, began to flatten off the embattled trio mid-way around the far turn then chased on
evenly through the lane. AWAKENED was reserved racing in the back, moved into stretch run five wide and passed tiring foes. PIANZI vied for the lead out
of the chute then raced just off the leader and forced the pace to the far turn, was under strong handling around the far turn but could not match with the top
two leaders then gave way in the lane. PRECISE DANCER settled two to three wide off the early pace and failed to respond when called upon in the far
turn. TIO WIL raced in contention and tracked the top two leaders down the backstretch, failed to gain position under pressure around the far turn then
steadily faded. HERO D'ORO got brushed by foe at the start, raced off the pace then moved into stretch run five wide and lacked a needed rally.
CENTURION broke out then raced off the pace four wide through early going and had no response when called upon. PEDDLERS PRIDE raced five to six
wide near throughout and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
CHEERMEISTER broke to the lead and moved inside, rated along through an even tempo for six furlongs, put some daylight on ABSCOND turning for
home and responded well to keep that foe at bay. ABSCOND stalked outside CHEERMEISTER from the start, got shaken off a bit into the stretch, kept on
with good courage but could not make up the needed ground. DECLARATIONWARRIOR raced close up inside from the outset, and finished one-paced on
the rail. LUCKY POLLY raced three wide on the turns, gained mildly late between horses but was never a serious threat. WITEZ went along in striking
distance three wide to the stretch, and lacked the needed late response. SUNSET PROMISE raced two wide well back for six furlongs, moved out in the
drive and went by tired horses. IN A HURRY raced two wide covered up to the stretch, and failed to menace. HEY KITTEN saved ground trailing to the
stretch, moved out and remained outrun. LOST TICKET underwent a four-wide journey through the turns, and had no late kick. GINGER KITTY was
reserved early inside, stayed on the rail to the stretch and had nothing when roused. STUNNING SKY broke a step slow and was steadied back between
horses, raced four wide on the turns, and had nothing on the far outside late.

Footnotes
TONALIST'S SHAPE was away in good order and held a slight edge out over a pair of foes out of the chute, continued to set a pressured pace down the
backstretch, vied for the lead with inside running chart nearing the half and continued into the far turn, repelled bid near five-sixteenths pole then turned
back the challenge from SPICE IS NICE near the quarter pole, took clearer command upper stretch and held firm under steady pressure. SPICE IS NICE
was forwardly placed in opening stages and continued up close down the backstretch, race in aim and prompted to go after TONALIST'S SHAPE near the
quarter pole, could not reach eventual but stayed on with response and secured the runner up spot. DREAM MARIE raced six wide in close contention with
the pressured top flight near the five eighths pole, gained position on a five wide run around the final turn then continued a steady effort in the lane and
bested the rest. RELUCTANT BRIDE was unhurried and raced three wide in or near the back, angled out and hustled up on the final turn, swung six wide
into top stretch and improved position without threatening. ADDILYN raced in range along the outside down the backstretch, remained in a forward position
racing four deep around the final turn then failed to sustain bid and steadily weakened. EMILY'S OASIS was reserved along the outside down the
backstretch, raced widest into the lane and passed a few faders. BAYERNESS raced in contention down the backstretch then failed to advance under
pressure around the far turn. NIKKI AND PAPA gained a couple spots while racing between foes near the half mile marker, raced one paced into the far turn
then weakened near the quarter pole. CHART prompted up the inside to challenge TONALIST'S SHAPE for the lead nearing the half mile marker, vied for
the lead with rival until mid-turn then came up empty.

Footnotes
SOMBEYAY got closest to GIDU around the far turn, reeled that one in past the furlong marker and moved clear, and had enough to hold on just inside a
trio of late pursuers. ENGLISH BEE was outrun for six furlongs in the three-path, rallied between horses through the stretch and finished gamely. HAY
DAKOTA advanced toward the inside entering the far turn, moved to the two-path and was kept from moving further out by MR DUMAS, rallied willingly in
upper stretch, and was not fully clear behind the winner and just inside ENGLISH BEE through the closing yards. LOUDER THAN BOMBS trailed far back
early, moved past horses four then five wide around the far turn, and gained steadily outside through the drive to share the show spot. GIDU (IRE) sped off
through a blistering pace removed from the rail to the far turn, remained well clear shiftng inside to the top of the lane, and tired from his early efforts past
the eighth-pole. CARIBOU CLUB saved ground outrun to the far turn, briefly went to the two-path before going back inside, and gained ground on the rail
without threatening. MR DUMAS advanced three wide on the far turn, but flattened out in the lane. HEMBREE was outrun to the stretch, and gained mildly
on the far outside. KRAMPUS raced near the two-path much of the way, and never became involved. MUSICAL HEART gave way four wide before
completing six furlongs. GEMONTEER chased after GIDU to the far turn, and folded up. FLYING SCOTSMAN gave chase four then three wide for a
half-mile, and plummeted to the back through the far turn.

Footnotes
MR FREEZE settled nicely racing five wide in a forward position through early stages, raced three wide in aim for the lead leaving the backstretch then
shook off foes still racing in hand, cleared and prompted at the quarter pole, drifted out wider leaving the far turn, switched back in a few paths then stayed
strong on top through the lane . PHAT MAN settled four wide off the early pace, was ridden along to pick up the tempo going by the half mile marker,
loomed closer racing wide late far turn, remained in game pursuit six wide in the lane and cleared second best. HOG CREEK HUSTLE raced widest near
mid-range down the backstretch, switched in a few paths entering the far turn, edged closer then given cue leaving the quarter pole, stayed on three to four
wide under strong handling in stretch run and prevailed for a share. TRUE TIMBER tracked the top trio through early stages then prompted leaving the half
mile marker, flattened and lost position late far turn but ran on and narrowly missed show. HAIKAL raced off the pace along the inside, shifted out and raced
six paths wide top stretch and improved position without threatening. RARE FORM prompted the pace in two path down the backstretch, vied for the lead at
three eighths pole then failed to be a match for eventual winner at the quarter pole and gave way. EXPERT was reserved in the back and saved ground,
moved out four to five wide and passed faders. DO SHARE raced off the pace then moved into stretch run racing widest and failed to move into contention.
ZENDEN raced three to four wide near the rear and failed to rally under pressure. FOREVER MO raced near midpack along the inside, produced a mild two
to three wide bid on the far turn then fade in the lane. BODEXPRESS set a pressured pace down the backstretch, briefly vied inside verse a duo at three
eighths pole then came up tired and retreated.

Footnotes
ZULU ALPHA was slowest to begin, went along unhurried for a mile slightly off the inside, moved fast five wide following just outside ADMISSION OFFICE
as they pounced on the leaders together at the top of the stretch, outdueled the latter through the furlong grounds and edged away. ADMISSION OFFICE
settled well back for a mile, uncorked a four-wide run to join the leaders just past the quarter-pole, held a short advantage inside ZULU ALPHA through
upper stretch, but could not handle that rival in the late stages. SADLER'S JOY saved ground in the second flight for the first mile, steadied lacking room
coming to the quarter-pole, swung four wide clear into the lane, could not kick with the top two but edged CHANNEL MAKER for the show. CHANNEL
MAKER came up behind the leaders entering the third turn, stalled in rush-hour traffic in the two-path from outside the quarter-pole to upper stretch, gained
clearance in the three-path after the top two kicked away, and was outbattled inside SADLER'S JOY for third. SPOOKY CHANNEL was eased back off the
leaders midway on the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack for a mile, and weakened. A THREAD OF BLUE brushed with NESSY at the start, chased
the pacesetter early, lodged a mild bid three then two wide on the final turn, and faded between foes into the stretch. NESSY brushed the right side of the
gate and lightly with A THREAD OF BLUE at the start, saved ground trailing to the stretch, angled to the far outside and passed two tired rivals. MOROCCO
set a demanding pace to the top of the stretch, and retired inside. ARMISTICE DAY advanced into the final turn three wide, but was finished soon after
completing a mile. Due to a timer malfunction the mile and one quarter fraction was unavailable.

Footnotes
ETE INDIEN quickly cleared on top and crossed over to the inside heading toward the first turn, set the pace and saved ground down the backstretch,
widened advantage moving through the far turn then prompted at the quarter pole, responded willingly and drew off authoritatively while drifting wider under
right handed pressure through the lane. CANDY TYCOON raced on the inside around the first turn then settled off the pace to the far turn, coaxed around
the far turn then advanced to race outside of AS SEEN ON TV in the final furlong, got carried out wider by rival but stayed on gamely and captured place.
AS SEEN ON TV veered out at the start then raced in range along the inside through early stages, ridden along to maintain tempo going by the half mile
marker then put to a drive around the final turn, ran on under steady pressure into the lane, shifted out wider in late stages and got edged for the runner up
spot. SHOTSKI raced widest while rated through early stages, launched an outside bid around the final turn, moved up closer and stayed on trying to
capture a share, got carried out wider in late stages and lacked the late needed kick to gain position. COUNTRY GRAMMER lost footing at the start and
raced in the back, continued unhurried in the last flight, prompted along the outside and raced widest in the lane and had a mild improve. MASTERDAY
secured inside position on the first turn, continued to rate while saving ground through middle stages, hustled the rail around the far turn, cut the corner and
gained position but failed to sustain bid and gave way. THE FALCON was unhurried and saved ground down the backstretch, was put to a drive two to three
wide entering top stretch and lacked a needed rally. GEAR JOCKEY got bumped a bit at the start then was forwardly placed around the first turn, stalked
the pacesetter to the far turn, raced in aim for the lead near the seven sixteenths pole but could not advance on eventual winner then steadily weakened.
LIAM'S LUCKY CHARM raced in range and tracked the pace along the outside through early stages, urged to go after the leader racing three path entering
the far turn but could not move on and faded. DENNIS' MOMENT raced between foes not too far off the pace in early backstretch, was called upon to
advance near the half mile marker but had no response and dropped back.
