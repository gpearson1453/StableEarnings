Footnotes
TRUSTING FRIEND, between second flight, swung wide on the turn and into stretch, took the lead near sixteenth pole and was under pressure to hang on.
THOMAS KNIGHT, in the four path chasing, drifted a bit leaving the turn, challenged in deep stretch and fought gamely to wire. EKATI WILDCAT split rivals
on the turn, moved out wider for the stretch run and finished with good energy. WHITE BLUFF came out sharply at the start and bumped MANTLE, set the
pace just off the rail, drifted out and faded. ASK CHUCK came in leaving the gate, was between rivals early and then was left with the rail on the turn,
changed course to the outside mid stretch and was being eased up late. NINETYEIGHTOCTANE came out leaving the gate, saved ground and was too
late. NO MORE STRIPPERS had his head down and turned to the left at the break then never threatened. FRATELLO DEL NORD raced wide and failed to
menace. MANTLE, bothered leaving the gate, showed little. STORM TALES, bumped at the start, raced very wide and was no threat. SUNSHINE MARK
broke slowly, was hustled up inside to be just off the pace then tired.. THE ITALIAN was bumped leaving the gate but quickly hustled to race between
second flight then stopped suddenly.

Footnotes
BAAQEYA, between rivals early, angled in on the turn, was eased out a bit near stretch but was caught behind a wall of horses, angled back to the rail to
secure racing room, closed and won going away. GOSSIP ISLE stumbled badly leaving the gate, saved ground and was always well placed, took the lead
and was clear with a furlong to run but then was no match late. VALIANT SPIRIT raced very wide while just off the pace then faded late. ZENSATIONAL
DIXIE, extremely wide while outrun, drifted wider under left handed into and through stretch and was too late. ALEDA LUTZ set the early pace in the four
path, allowed rival to rally inside near stretch and gave way. SPECTACULAR MOVE, three wide dueling for the early lead, tired. WISE TRADE, between
foes while outrun, angled out and was no factor. POINT LOCKOUT saved ground and showed little. FORTRESSA broke slowly, saved ground to the turn,
split foes and failed to threaten. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY stalked the early pace two wide before stopping. LUCKY'S RANSOM, very wide, failed to
menace. GEMODIXIE, just off the rail and just off the pace, stopped.

RONIN WARRIOR never left the rail, took the lead nearing stretch, drifted out deep stretch while edging away. HIBACHI set the pace in the three path, lost
the lead near quarter pole, was no match for his stablemate but gamely held place. RICHIE GOES GLOBAL, racing in the five path, rallied around rivals on
the final turn, continued wide and closed. PIGGYBANK broke slowly, saved ground to stretch, angled out through stretch and despite being eased up
through deep stretch he was able to bring home fourth place monies. JOHNNY JIGGLE broke slowly, saved ground, edged closer after a half, drifted out
and tired. PERFECT DAYDREAM, raced between foes while well placed and came up empty. UNCHEYNE DJANGO, outside and just off the pace, was
finished after a half. THIN SPACES, raced lapped on winner then tired. NAUGHTY FOX was wide and showed little. GAUCHO, three wide, bid after a half
but then quickly flattened out.
