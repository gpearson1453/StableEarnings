RIGEL'S HALO stalked pace outside, steady outside advance, much the best. YOU CAN DO MAGIC middle of the pack, some inside late gain. LA
SALSERA pressed pace outside, bid, weakened. MOLACHA set pressured pace inside, couldnt follow, got tired. TROPICAL BEAUTY off the pace, no rally.
DIAMOND WORKS show some initial speed, drop back.
