Footnotes
AUDREY'S TIME settled in a good position while saving ground, was asked to pick it up on the far turn, rallied in the two path into the stretch, closed fast to
get the lead passing the three-sixteenths, shook clear under a right-handed whip into the final furlong and proved best while put to a solid hand ride for the
final sixteenth. DREAMALILDREAMOFU was taken in hand while showing early speed, went three wide on the first turn, was rated towards the front on the
outside, came under urging while three then four wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished with good courage for the
place. BROADWAY LADY angled in early then became rank under restraint, lugged out while fighting the rider into the first turn then bumped with LEA'S
PRINCESS and was taken up, dropped from five to three wide on that bend, was reserved off the pace, went two to three wide on the far turn, came four
wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. TAKE CHARGE PATTI broke in at the start, was a bit keen under restraint early, saved ground
on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, raced inside on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, hugged the rail in the stretch and improved
position to get the last spot in the superfecta. JOHNNIE MERLE (IRE) broke a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, raced
three wide on the far turn, came seven wide into the stretch while bumped by HAPPY THOUGHT and failed to threaten. SWEET N SALTY KISS went to the
front, raced inside on the first turn, set the pace off the rail on the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch and
gave way. NIKKIS KITTEN bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was taken up a bit into the first turn, went four wide on that bend, was reserved off the
pace, rounded the far turn in the two path under urging, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TELLER TO SING stumbled at
the start and was last to commence, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, went two to three wide on the far turn, was asked
outside the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. SWEET BAY went around the first turn in the three
path, tracked the pace on the outside, chased two then three wide on the far turn and tired. HAPPY THOUGHT went three wide on the first turn, settled well
back on the outside, went three to four wide on the far turn, shifted six wide into the stretch then bumped JOHNNIE MERLE, steadied briefly at that point
before regaining momentum and never reached contention. LEA'S PRINCESS broke awkwardly then was bumped hard by a rival, was bumped by
BROADWAY LADY then carried out into the first turn and taken up, went six then five wide on that bend, settled outside on the backstretch, was urged
along while four to five wide on the far turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
AIN'T NO ELMERS was quick to lead, dictated the pace in the clear up the backstretch, faced just mild pressure from an outside rival into the turn going
inside but primarily in the two path through that bend, was asked for more in upper stretch and responded by drawing away through the lane and was kept
to her task late. SALACIOUSACUSATION pursued the winner from outside, was given some encouragement three wide into the turn while just off that rivals
flank, proved no match for that one but turned back an outside foe to capture the place. READYFORMYCLOSEUP settled into stride staying outside foes,
edged closer up the backstretch going four wide on the turn, drew even with the aforementioned putting a short head in front but was ultimately denied
second place. NASTY was keen behind and between runners near the half-mile marker, moved out a bit entering the turn going three deep and between
runners on that bend and settling a bit, moved out a further path nearing the furlong marker, ran on late. CHICK BE QUICK was outpaced early despite
breaking well, went four wide and outside foes on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, evened out and had no late bid. ANIMA GEMELLA was
outpaced racing inside a rival early and dropping back into the turn, went in the two to three path on that bend and was never near enough to threaten.
LEGAL LIMIT settled early toward the rear, advanced outside foes five wide on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and tired. LIAM'S TEMPEST chased
briefly inside, tired.

AUBURN HILLS crossed over while going to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, shook off a foe under his own power into upper
stretch, responded well when asked coming to the furlong marker, was put to a right-handed whip under threat from the runner-up late and just held. FREE
SPENDER went four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased three to four wide on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive
into the final furlong, drifted out some shortly thereafter, gained determinedly late and just missed while clear for the place. EAST LEX went four wide on the
first turn, settled towards the front, was urged along while two to three wide on the far turn, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker and finished
willingly for the show. LOKOYA ROAD was taken in hand early, went around the first turn in the two path, tracked the leader down the backstretch, made a
bid in the two path on the far turn, drifted in just after turning into the stretch then was straightened by the rider, chased the winner into the final furlong and
was out-kicked while just able to hold the last spot in the superfecta. DECISION MAKER bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two
path, settled in the back half of the field, was urged along in mostly the two path on the far turn, moved out under a drive at the furlong marker and finished
with good energy. SMALL TALK was keen under restraint early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while
three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SPANISH KINGDOM was eager under restraint into the first turn, went five
wide on that bend, was reserved on the outside, came under urging around the seven-sixteenths, went four wide on the far turn, was driven into upper
stretch and lacked the needed response. TEMPLET went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused while three wide on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch, drifted in late and also lacked the needed response. DIVULGENCE bumped with a foe at the start, was taken in hand early,
went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along while inside on the far turn and came up empty. AUTUMN JETT traveled
around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
DEANOS CAPE saved ground towards the rear, was ridden along on the far turn, moved to the two path near the five-sixteenths, was driven three wide into
the stretch, moved out outside the furlong marker and also failed to threaten. MISCHIEVOUS MO went three wide on the first turn, settled well back in the
field, was urged along while inside on the far turn and never reached contention. DECLARED went five wide on the first turn, settled well back on the
outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn and was no factor. ENCHANTED EMPIRE went four wide on the first turn, lagged at the rear, was
put to the whip late on the backstretch, rounded the far turn in the two path and showed little.

SHAKE SOME ACTION settled between foes under a light hold two wide into the first turn moving out a path on that bend, continued to track in behind up
the backstretch entering the far turn three wide, began to move out at the three-eighths coming five wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit while taking
command outside the furlong marker, was clear under urging at the sixteenth pole and held safe. CHESTERTOWN broke a length slowly, was last into the
first turn and appeared to not corner well while keen to go on racing on or just off the rail, moved out a bit and advanced two wide between foes into the far
turn going two to three wide on that bend, lacked room in behind runners in upper stretch briefly before moving out past the three-sixteenths, once clear ran
on well but was too late and missed. WINNING IMPRESSION pressed the leader three wide into the first turn, applied further pressure up the backstretch
and into the far turn taking a narrow lead at the three-eights, was overtaken by upper stretch and kept on well but was simply outkicked. SHARECROPPER
saved ground tracking the leaders along the rail through the first turn and up the backstretch, continued in range inside on the far turn, lacked room in upper
stretch and tapped on the brakes briefly before angling out past the three-sixteenths but had too much to do at that juncture. UNTHROTTLED raced outside
foes four wide just off the leaders early, continued four wide on the far turn within range, moved out a path past the three-sixteenths and offered no late bid.
DISCLOSURE broke a half step slowly, went four wide into the first turn moving out another path on that bend, raced at the back still off the inside up the
backstretch into the far turn, advanced inside one foe two to three wide into the far turn continuing three to four deep on that bend, shifted six wide past the
quarter pole and ran on to pass a tired rival. RANAAN was very lightly brushed at the break then mildly coaxed forward, set the pace a path removed from
the rail with outside pressure through the first turn and up the backstretch, was overtaken three furlongs out and gave way in the stretch. DREWPOWER
bobbled just slightly and brushed the outside foe at the start, raced outside five to six wide on both turns and failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
JUST MIGHT brushed with a rival at the start, showed good speed from the outside then moved clear, controlled the action while inside through the turn,
turned into upper stretch under his own power, responded well when asked under threat from the runner-up coming to the furlong marker, was put to a
left-handed whip near the sixteenth-pole and just held under good handling. CHAOS THEORY showed speed towards the inside then was eased back just
off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the winner under a strong hand ride, was put to a
right-handed whip at the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, made a bid into the final sixteenth and just missed while
clear for the place. FAST BOAT broke in at the start, settled under some restraint, was shuffled back some behind CHAOS THEORY near the
seven-sixteenths, went around the turn in the two path while guided with extra left rein pressure, moved out while asked for his best in upper stretch and
finished with good courage for the show. BLIND AMBITION bobbled at the start, was ridden along towards the rear on the outside, went three wide on the
turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and improved position to get the last spot in the superfecta. STAR OF KODIAK settled off the pace, was asked while
four wide on the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, drifted out some around the furlong marker and failed to rally. POWELL was well placed just off
the pace, dropped back while lugging out into the turn, went three wide on that bend, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed
response. MADE YOU LOOK settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and
failed to threaten. MCFEELY was last to commence, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail in the stretch and was no
factor. MALPAIS broke out a bit then brushed with a rival, raced on the outside under some urging, chased three wide on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CHRYSTAL SPHERE came in at and just after the break, pressed the pace three wide into the turn, lost some ground on that leader late on that bend,
re-engaged in upper stretch and dueled with a narrow lead past the furlong marker and held under urging. VERB set the pace in the two path with moderate
pressure, was challenged in upper stretch, just overtaken at the furlong marker but fought on gamely. MYSTIC GUIDE broke outwardly and awkwardly and
was last away, moved up inside shortly thereafter but had to tap on the brakes just slightly near the five-eighths pole, switched out to go three then four then
five wide on the turn, came seven wide past the quarter pole with aim on the leaders but much to do and finished with good energy. AMANI'S EAGLE
exchanged a bump at the start but recovered to obtain forwardly position tracking the leaders, saved ground on the inside through the turn coming out a bit
leaving that bend and in the stretch and ran on. BROTHER MARTIN broke outwardly and a bit awkwardly, raced toward the rear unhurriedly early, went
three to four wide on the turn swinging eight deep out of that bend, gained belatedly. TOTAL DESTRUCTION exchanged a bump at the start, raced in the
back half of the field early outside foes, advanced mildly outside five wide on the turn but evened out thereafter. QUANA DUDE broke a half-step slowly and
was shut off at the start, raced toward the rear outside going five to six wide on the turn and asked for run by the top of the stretch but was not a threat.
OLSON exchanged a bump with a rival then was bumped by a different one at the brake, tracked mid-pack into the turn racing just off the fence, failed to
rally. SALADO was within range four wide through the turn, drifted in a bit then out through upper- to mid-stretch and came up empty. MALAHINI saved
ground inside just off the rail, was asked for a bit more entering the turn but had no response. GOOD CLEAN FUN exchanged a bump at the start, was
forwardly-positioned three to four wide heading to the turn, began to drop back, drifted out a bit in upper stretch and tired.

SHE'SONTHEWARPATH was restless in the gate, settled on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, rallied to
the lead just inside the furlong marker, moved clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under steady urging. MITCHELL ROAD bumped with a rival at
the start, tossed her head while keen early, raced in the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, went around the far turn inside to the two path,
shifted three wide into the stretch, chased the leader in the drive and was outfinished while just able to get the place. QUICK WITTED settled well back in
the field on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was roused into upper stretch, moved off the rail under a drive around the three-sixteenths, came
between horses into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. NOTAPRADAPRICE
bumped lightly with a foe early, was taken in and while tugging at the bit on the initial straightaway, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the
pace, went four to five wide on the far turn, advanced six wide into the stretch, chased the leader in the drive and was out-kicked and just missed the show.
ZOFELLE (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, went four then five wide on the far turn,
swung seven wide into the stretch, advanced quickly on the outside, chased into the final furlong and flattened out. QUEBEC crossed over while going to
the front, set the pace on the inside, shook off a rival while asked at the quarter-pole, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead just inside the furlong
marker and weakened. FLOWER PARTY (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start, bumped lightly with NOTAPRADAPRICE early, went around the first turn in
the two path, settled off the pace, went two to three wide on the far turn, altered out near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
SILVER DUST tracked the leaders in the three path heading into the first turn while steadying off heels just slightly passing the wire the first time, came out
a bit heading up the backstretch, took closer order into the far turn moving three then two wide on that bend, was put to urging past the quarter pole and
quickly struck the lead, edged clear about mid-stretch, drifted out late under left-handed urging and held from GUN IT, who raced mid-pack in the two to
three path into the first turn, settled up the backstretch still racing near inside, went two to three wide on the far turn, drifted about throughout the length of
the stretch but was moved out about the furlong marker with aim and having made up ground on the leader, continued to drift out after that point and closed
the gap but could not get past. PIRATE'S PUNCH broke on top and moved clear heading to the first turn shifting in to the two path entering that bend and
dictating terms on a clear lead while shifting in a bit, set the tempo up the backstretch, was challenged by the winner from outside on the far turn still racing
on or just off the fence through that bend, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on to preserve show honors. CAPTIVATING MOON bobbled just slightly
at the start and settled at the rear tucking in toward but just off the rail, advanced inside foes leaving the backstretch going in about the two path early on the
far turn and coming out a further path late on that bend, continued to come out in the stretch for room and ran on one-paced to narrowly miss show honors.
CUTTING HUMOR went four wide mid-pack and outside foes through the first turn, lost ground dropping back while four then carried five wide on the far
turn before taking hold and shifting inside a foe, showed renewed effort in the stretch to gain mildly late. SLEEPY EYES TODD bobbled just slightly at the
start, entered the first turn near the inside coming out a bit on that bend and tracking the pacesetter from outside that foe two to three deep, moved wider
still up the backstretch and while still in range before moving back in two wide into the far turn, began to weaken and that juncture and slowly weakened
thereafter. HOFBURG was forced outwardly just a bit and in a hair tight at the start, raced outside foes three wide into the first turn then four to five wide the
rest of that bend, was kept wide up the backstretch, went five wide early on the far turn and was floated out a further path late on that bend, ran on evenly.
WINNING NUMBER stalked the pace from outside four wide early, continued outside into the far turn roughly four to five deep and beginning to drop back
on that bend, came up empty in the lane. MOCITO ROJO raced inside just off the rail through the first turn in the back part of the field, moved out heading
up the backstretch racing further off the fence, fanned five wide leaving the far turn, was never near enough to threaten.

FACTOR THIS went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under a
right-handed whip into the final furlong and held under strong urging. SYNCHRONY was last to commence, settled on the inside, tipped into the two path on
the far turn, swung out four wide into upper stretch, gained momentum into the final furlong and finished with good energy but was too late while clear for the
place. BOTSWANA saved ground on the first turn, was well placed towards the front, drafted inside early on the far turn, shifted to the two path after being
asked at the five-sixteenths, spun into the three path entering upper stretch, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong, drifted out shortly
thereafter and weakened but just held the show. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME went three wide early on the first turn then tucked into the two path, settled well off
the pace, was roused while inside to the two path on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive inside the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response then just missed the show. DONTBLAMEROCKET went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was asked while
three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. HONOVI saved ground on the first turn, settled well back in the field,
was urged along while moving from the inside to the two path on the far turn, came under the whip in upper stretch and failed to threaten. TONE BROKE
went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along while three wide for most of the far turn, shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole,
came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SPECTACULAR GEM went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, was
asked while two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and tired. SPACE MOUNTAIN saved ground on the first turn, moved out
entering the backstretch, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along while inside on the far turn, angled out significantly in upper stretch and was no
factor. CLASSIC COVEY rounded the first turn in the two path while near the back, went wrong inside the five-eighths and fell then was vanned off.

Footnotes
FINITE was well-positioned stalking four wide from outside runners through the first turn, edged closer up the backstretch moving in a bit to travel three to
four wide on the far turn, bid three deep coming out of that bend taking the lead in upper stretch and was put to right- then left-handed urging in the vicinity
of the furlong marker while drawing off, continued to be steadily urged to the wire extending the advantage. BRITISH IDIOM exchanged a light bump at the
start, steadied off heels heading to the first turn as a rival veered out, went four to five wide on that bend racing outside and entered the backstretch under a
light hold, was allowed more run heading to the far turn going three to four then five wide on that bend, put to strong urging by upper stretch but could not
gain on the winner while clear of the rest. SWISS SKYDIVER angled in soon after the start, saved ground along the rail mid-pack through the first turn and
the far turn, came out past the quarter pole coming four to five wide to mid-stretch, could not kick on with the top two but held show honors. TEMPERS
RISING exchanged a light bump at the start, settled at the rear racing off the fence in the two to three path, moved out further up the backstretch before
coming back in a bit to go three to four wide on the far turn, shifted five wide at the quarter pole and a bit wider in upper stretch and ran on with some late
interest. IMPECCABLE STYLE was taken hold of and altered out heading into the first turn, raced in the three to four path on that bend, shifted in up the
backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on late to gain a position. HIS GLORY was lightly bumped at the start, moved
forward under just mild coaxing, set the pace inside in the clear early, was shadowed up the backstretch into the far turn, overtaken in upper stretch and
weakened thereafter. URSULA bobbled into the aforementioned rival at the start, was forwardly-placed two to three deep into the first turn just off the fence,
continued in pursuit inside the eventual winner up the backstretch, was two to three deep between foes into the far turn then dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MR. MONOMOY moved in while going to the front, put READY TO ROLL in tight quarters early, set the pace in the two path through moderate fractions,
was challenged early on the far turn, dropped closer to the inside around the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked coming to the quarter-pole, shook
clear under a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths and proved best under strong urging. ENFORCEABLE broke a step slow, went three wide on the
first turn, moved up on the backstretch, advanced closer while in hand in the three path on the far turn, moved to the four path outside the quarter-pole, was
roused while swinging six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to get the place. SILVER STATE moved out after passing the wire for the first
time, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while moving from three to five wide on the far turn, turned into the
stretch under a drive, chased the winner under the whip and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. FARMINGTON ROAD went five wide on the
first turn, settled well back on the outside, was urged along while five then six wide on the far turn, came eight wide into the stretch and improved position.
DIGITAL saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the front, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked while moving from the inside to the two
path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, made a brief bid outside of the winner at the three-sixteenths but weakened. SCABBARD went five
wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, came under urging while five wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the seven path and failed to
rally. BLACKBERRY WINE went three wide on the first turn, stalked the winner on the outside, made a bid while three wide on the far turn, dropped back
under a drive in upper stretch and tired. MOON OVER MIAMI bumped with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, was
urged along passing the five-eighths, went three to four wide while ridden along on the far turn and failed to threaten. READY TO ROLL broke out and
bumped with a rival, was taken in hand when put in tight early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled in a good position down the backstretch,
was asked while four wide on the far turn, dropped in after turning into the stretch and came up empty. PERFECT REVENGE bobbled at the start then
bumped with foes on both sides, went two to three wide on the turns and was no factor. SHASHASHAKEMEUP went four wide on the first turn, settled on
the outside, came up empty while four wide on the far turn and retreated.
