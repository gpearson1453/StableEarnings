Footnotes
RULER OF THE NILE in the second flight between rivals, angled out a bit when advancing late in the turn, engaged the leader when straightened for home
and wore that foe down under steady handling. MIDNIGHT LAS VEGAS lacked early foot, moved closer with a four wide in the turn, continued willingly to
the finish to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. SCRUTINIZER away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a slightly
larger advantage entering the stretch, dueled with the winner past the furlong marker then gave ground grudgingly to the top two until late. DRC ALL
INCLUSIVE back off the early pace, improved slightly while three wide, not a serious threat. ALPHA TO OMEGA last away, went evenly toward the inside.
BAR STOOL BUDGET lacked early foot, failed to rally. FAREEQ alternated up front in the two path, gave way. DOM THE BOMB broke to the outside,
stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
MILLWOOD in the second group while toward the inside, angled out to be four wide when moving on the leader turning for home, challenged soon after,
edged clear under firm handling. LADDIE BOY within striking distance off the inside, advanced and challenged to briefly take over turning for home,
outkicked by the winner the final furlong, clearly second best. TITOCHIP carried out five wide early in the first turn, continued to race back and outside, five
wide rally out of the second turn, clear of the others. STORMINSIDE stalked the leaders off the inside, continued to race within striking distance while three
wide in the 2nd turn, came up empty for the drive. LOOKIE LOO lacked speed in the two path, continued just off the inside, improved slightly while not a
serious threat. FIREHORN broke alertly, dueled early off the inside, shook off the other speed after five furlongs, gave way in the drive along the inside.
HERBIE settled off the pace, lacked a response three wide. ELITCH off a step slow, remained always back. ISTILLGOTIT rank, steadied into the first turn,
was finished early. OMEN OF CHANGE in mid pack, tired in the drive. MAHALO JOHN dueled up front early, stopped.

Footnotes
PROUD VICTORIA outrun in the early going, raced between rivals in the turn when beginning to advance, steered to the far outside when straightened for
home, closed with good resolve to be up in time. TIDDLY forwardly placed outside, advanced and challenged five wide late in the turn, shook clear upper
stretch, could not contain the winner. SAVEDBYANANGEL with the first flight while between rivals, could not keep up with the runner up exiting the turn nor
contain the winner, saved the show. ALL ABOUT CLARA void of speed, swung four wide turning for home, rallied belatedly down the middle of the strip.
FLATOUTANDFOXY off a step slow, improved position without posing a serious threat. ORDAINED KISS set or forced the pace for a half closest to the
inside, gave way in the drive. OWE HER ONE raced in mid pack early toward the inside, fell back in the turn, picked off some tiring rivals while not a threat.
LUCKY EVERY DAY vied up front four wide for a half then faltered in the drive. BETTYANN unprepared at the start to spot the field several lengths, raced
back, four wide turn, failed to muster a rally in the drive. JOY IN THE JOURNEY with the pace while between horses and three wide, gave way turning for
home.

Footnotes
BELEWS GOLD forwardly placed just behind the first flight and just off the inside, behind some traffic exiting the turn, clear for the drive, roused, full of run
late. VAYA CON DIOS broke alertly, pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled through the turn, shook clear for the drive, proved no match for the winner
late, clearly second best. ADHHAR settled off the pace and the inside, set down for the drive, late burst to be up for the show. SAILOR CHOW pressured
the pace while racing in the three path, continued within striking distance into the lane, weakened the final furlong. SON OF GA GA raced back off the pace,
three wide through the turn, improved position while not a serious threat. FAIR CATCH away in good order, narrowly set the pace up the backstretch along
the inside, gave way in the drive. WENT bumped then bobbled just after the start, raced well back early as a result, passed some tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. RAHAAL broke back, settled off the pace, four wide late in the turn, lacked a closing response when called on for the drive. DAZZLING
REUNION raced well back early in the two path, failed to menace. STEELDRIVER steadily faded. BIG BAD BUD bumped just after the start, remained
always back. CHITTO pressured the pace four wide for a half, stopped badly in the stretch, jogged in far back.

place, could do much with the winner late. EXEMPLAR lacked speed, raced three out to four wide in the final turn, finished up best of the resst. SONNY
SMACK void of speed, raced in the two path second turn, improved position with some belated interest. DRIVEN TO COMPETE broke alertly, chased the
early leader, challenged three wide late in the second turn, faltered the final furlong while remaining inside. COAL TRUTH off slowly, settled off the pace,
came up empty for the drive. ALTITO void of speed, remained always back. PINSON away in good order, drew clear into the first turn,set the pace in the
two path, saved ground in the final turn and gave way for the drive. SECRET TOUCH in mid pack early, steadily faded.

Footnotes
TARAZ last to leave, moved up to take control into the first turn, got toward the inside early in that bend, rated while showing the way up the backstretch,
shrugged off the runner up turning for home to be comfortably clear, slowly increased that advantage to the wire under a steady hand ride to win ridden out.
O SERAPHINA broke on top, allowed the winner to clear and cross to the inside, moved off the rail and chased that onto the backstretch, continued to
prompt that rival into the far turn, asked along soon after, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. HIGH ON GIN settled off the pace, continued in
even fashion throughout while racing off the inside. PRINCESINHA JULIA broke out, fell well back off the issue early, remained back in a dull effort.

Footnotes
SPECIAL RELATIVITY outrun in the early going, asked along in the two path midway on the turn, eased out a bit nearing the furlong marker, split foes,
finished with good energy to win going away. IRISH MISCHIEF behind the pace off the inside, three wide in the turn when within striking distance,
challenged outside the winner a furlong out, proved no match for that one, held sway for the place. MT. BRAVE broke on top, dueled in the two path into
and through the turn, had little to offer the top two late, saved the show. AMY'S CHALLENGE moved up along the inside to alternate for the advantage,
continued to duel into the stretch, faltered in the run to the wire. TALBEYA fell back to trail after the start, swung to the outside for the drive, improved a bit
while not a serious threat. RAINTREE STARLET closest to the dueling leaders early, two path then dropped to the rail late in the bend, had little left. ASCOT
DAY failed to menace while racing three wide.

GRIT AND CURIOSITY within striking distance early, in some traffic into the turn, came three wide into the lane, advanced, bid, kicked clear. CANDY
CORNELL bumped start, took command after the start, clear early, continued to show the way through the turn along the inside, proved no match for the
winner the final furlong, lasted for place. TOUGH LOVE settled in mid pack off the inside, came three wide through the turn, roused, finished willingly to be
getting to the runner up late. SOARING BIRD pinched, off slowly, raced back early as a result, moved out, came four wide into the lane, finished well while
too late. ROYAL DAAHER broke in bump with an inner rival, raced back, saved some ground turning for home, improved position with some belated
interest. AMERICAN MANDATE went evenly while saving ground. SIGALERT failed to menace while racing three wide. MARKET KING prompted the pace
while racing in the two path, gave way in the drive. DEFLATER lacked speed, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. BIRD DOG second flight while
four wide, tired from those early efforts. STORMIN HONGKONG was never involved while racing toward the inside. MOST AMUSING prompted the pace
while racing three wide, stopped in the drive.
