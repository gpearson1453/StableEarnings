Footnotes
KITTEN'S ROYAL was unhurried to the second turn, rallied inside to the stretch, had room and pushed to the front in mid stretch then held driving. COOL
HUNTER settled mid pack to the second turn, swung four wide to the stretch then finished willingly to get the nod for second. ON THE KEY had no speed,
trailed to the second turn, circled five wide into the stretch and was gaining belatedly. TAELYNS PRINCE tracked the leaders to the second turn, bid two
wide to the stretch, was outkicked by the winner to mid stretch and finished evenly. SILENT MOVIES pressed the pace for five furlongs, pushed up to
engage for the lead two wide, dueled to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. FOR HIM set the pace to the second turn, was collared
after six furlongs and tired. LIL' CHIEFTAIN tracked the leaders to the half, came three then four wide to the stretch but gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST hesitated and broke half a step slow, chased the pace two wide then swung out for room into the stretch, was responding when OLYMPIC
SILVER lugged out into his path, checked and altered course outside then closed fast late to win going away. MISTER MCLEAN dueled for the lead outside
of COMIC STYLE, pushed away from that one to mid stretch but was tiring and could not stall the winner. OLYMPIC SILVER tracked the pace to the turn,
was roused four wide to the stretch, lugged out in mid stretch causing the winner to alter course then finished evenly. BELHAM had no speed, raced three
wide to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. GEM STATE was chasing the pace three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch
and weakened. LUCKY TWICE was outsprinted to the turn then was fanned out four deep to the stretch and did not rally. COMIC STYLE hustled to contest
the pace from the rail to the stretch then tired.

PASSING had good speed, dueled inside of SHARON'S FURY, responded to push clear to mid stretch then held driving. MONCEROS was outrun early,
chased three wide to the stretch, was no threat to the winner but finished steadily for second. MONDOLONIA stalked the leaders to the turn, raced three
wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. BUB was also chasing the leaders, bid two wide to the stretch then failed to offer a closing response.
LEGENDARY NIGHT lagged to the stretch and was never a factor. SHARON'S FURY hustled to duel outside the winner to the quarter pole then tired.

Footnotes
SMILING BANDIT was outsprinted to the turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied to get to terms in mid stretch, inched to a short lead late and held on
desperately. BROTHERCICCIO broke slow, trailed to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then closed steadily but too late. HOT'N NOTTY had no
speed, was also fanned out to the four path to the stretch, shifted out further then closed fast and just missed. ROMAN ROCKET stalked the pace to the
turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, rallied to engage for the lead in mid stretch, dug in late but also missed. STONE GROOVE hustled to duel for the
lead, raced two wide to the stretch, dug in determinedly in the final furlong but was outfinished. HOW'S MY HERO dueled outside of STONE GROOVE
three wide to the stretch, stayed gamely to deep stretch then was also outfinished. MR. DIPLOMAT chased the leaders to the turn, had to circle four then
five wide to the stretch and lacked a closing response. MARINOS LAW was also chasing the pace, bid three wide to the stretch but gave way in mid stretch.

Footnotes
KLONDIKE CREEK pressed the pace for six furlongs, responded when straightened for the drive and outkicked IRREFUTABLE for the win. IRREFUTABLE
set all the pace from the rail to the stretch, resisted the winner determinedly but was overtaken late. ELECTORAL stalked the top two to the second turn, bid
two wide to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. MAD AT MONEY had no speed and saved ground to no avail. AMERICAN CAMP chased the
leaders to the second turn, offered a bid three wide to the stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. BOYSON also had no speed, was two wide throughout
and did not rally. REY COLIMAN got outsprinted to the half, raced three wide to the stretch but also came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) pushed to the front into the first turn, set the pace from the rail to the second turn, turned back MOONLIGHT BLUE and kicked
away to mid stretch then held under steady urging. UNUSUALLY GREEN was outrun to the half, bid three then four wide to the stretch, shifted out in upper
stretch and finished willingly for the place. GET LIKE ME settled mid pack to the half, was two wide on the second turn, got outrun to mid stretch and lost the
place late. THE REF had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then did not threaten in the drive. ON THE WINGS OF was
chasing to the half, raced three wide to the stretch but weakened in the drive. MOONLIGHT BLUE pressed the winner for five furlongs, made a bid outside
that one on the second turn to loom a threat but was outkicked to mid stretch and gave way. POCKET PRINCE had no speed, settled to the second turn,
swung out four deep to the stretch but was not a factor in the drive. KATZUMOTO was rank off heels into the first turn, chased the winner to the half then
saved ground but gave out after six furlongs.
