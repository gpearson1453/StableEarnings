Footnotes
AUBERGE broke in and bumped a rival in a bit of a slow start, angled in and dueled inside, inched away leaving the turn, kicked clear and proved best
under a backhanded tap of the whip and a steady hand ride while being flagged with the stick. SPEECH stalked off the rail then bid three deep a half mile
out and into the turn, angled in just outside the winner leaving the turn and was clearly second best. ROADRUNNER'S HONOR broke in and a bit slowly,
came out early and chased outside a rival then just off the rail on the turn, came out into the stretch and picked up the show. BIDDY DUKE broke on top but
bobbled, sped to the early lead off the rail, dueled outside the winner then between foes a half mile out and into the turn, dropped back just off the fence
leaving the turn and weakened. SAVVY GAL settled off the pace inside, came out leaving the turn and into the stretch and lacked a further response.

RUSHIE had speed between foes then outside a rival, inched away on the first turn and angled in, set the pace inside, edged away again into the second
turn, kicked clear, drifted out a bit under left handed urging in the final furlong and held. DIVINE ARMOR five wide between horses early and three deep on
the first turn, bid three wide a half mile out, stalked outside a rival on the second turn and into the stretch and continued willingly late. KISS TODAY
GOODBYE saved ground stalking the pace, came out in upper stretch and gained the show. KOKO'S KANDY between horses early, dueled then stalked
inside, bid between foes a half mile out, stalked on the second turn, angled in for the stretch and weakened in the drive. KENO'D pulled between horses
early then chased outside a rival to the stretch, gave way and was eased late. VASARIANO six wide early and four wide into the first turn, stalked three

inside then stalked the winner a bit off the rail to the stretch and weakened. INSTAGRAND angled in and saved ground chasing the pace, came out in
midstretch and lacked the needed late kick. ROADSTER settled off the pace inside, split horses on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and
could not offer the necessary response. CALIFORNIA STREET unhurried outside then chased off the rail, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a

Footnotes
BODHICITTA (GB) saved ground chasing the pace, split horses leaving the second turn, came three deep into the stretch, rallied under vigorous handling
and a tap of the whip inside the eighth pole to gain the lead a sixteenth out and proved best. PETER'S KITTEN settled outside a rival, came out leaving the
second turn and five wide into the stretch and gained the place. MAGICAL GRAY angled in and slipped through inside into the first turn to gain the lead, set
the pace inside, responded when challenged five eighths out, inched away again, kicked clear on the second turn, fought back past midstretch and held
third. SHE'S OUR CHARM tugged between horses for the early lead, drifted out into the first turn, stalked three deep, came four wide into the stretch and
was edged for the show. COURTEOUS saved ground stalking the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed rally inside. OUT OF
BALANCE angled in and settled off the pace inside, came out in midstretch and could not offer the necessary response. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT stalked
between horses then a bit off the rail leaving the second turn and into the stretch and weakened. SUTRO hopped slightly at the start, settled inside then a bit
off the rail, came around a rival into the stretch and did not rally. PRIMA VALENTINA saved ground off the pace, came out leaving the second turn and four
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. SILKEN SPY had speed between horses then stalked outside a rival or just off the rail, bid alongside the
pacesetter five eighths out, stalked again leaving the backstretch and between foes on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
CHARMINGSLEW four wide early, stalked three deep, dropped back on the second turn and gave way.
