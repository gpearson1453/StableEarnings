to widen. EXCEED THE GOAL came away a step slow and raced in the three and four paths the first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole but
proved no match. SHE FIGURES settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then
lugged in through the upper stretch and weakened. DRAMATIC PEGASUS came away a bit awkwardly and raced well off the pace, then showed only mild
response from the five sixteenths pole. MISS CASUARINA was hustled along with the early lead inside then rated the pace from the five eighths pole, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths, but dropped back into the far turn and faded at the rail. KENTUCKY DANCER was through after a half mile.

Footnotes
AUTS REVOLUTION settled off the pace in the three path then bid past the five sixteenths pole, took the lead three wide midway on the far turn, surged
clear toward the head of the lane and was steadily handled to prove much the best. WATCHMENEIGHNEIGH stalked the pace off the rail, started a bid
toward the three eighths pole, dueled to a brief slim lead on the far turn then settled for second best. VILLAGE PRINCE saved ground racing well off the
pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved in the three path of the far turn and finished evenly. THEKIDSBACK rounded the opening turn in
the four path then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the four path of the far turn but showed little more. WOODBURN HALL saved early
ground and showed little response through the backstretch. CHINESE TAKEOUT angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching
the three eighths pole, gave up the lead and dropped back midway on the far turn then weakened. R U SURE raced off the pace and off the rail the opening
turn and showed little response. MASTER YOO saved ground the first turn then faded through the backstretch. OVER SALTY saved ground. Due to an
equipment malfunction, this race with all the fractions were hand timed.

DR. TUCKER raced well off the pace in the two and three paths then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, improved
steadily in the three path of the far turn, took the nod leaving the eighth pole, dueled clear mid-stretch then drew away later yards. FREET DEM tapered to
the inside to rate the pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail rounding the far turn, but gave up the nod past
the eighth pole and flattened stride through the lane. FEISTY AND SASSY raced well off the pace in the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn in the four path and held on for third. TRIPLE BAD saved ground off the pace then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving
the three eighths pole, raced five wide on the far turn and finished evenly. MELTECH settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn then stalked four wide
into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, dueled close two deep on the far turn but dropped back toward the head of the lane and
weakened. CHARITABLE VISIT showed only mild response while saving ground. OUT OF CENTS stalked the early pace off the rail, picked up the chase
from the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. ISLAND CADGER rounded the opening turn while stalking the pace from the four path then faded
readily after a half mile.

Footnotes
GOLDEN DESIRE gave early chase toward the outside, came through the turn in the four path and dug in down the lane to get up the final strides.
FLEETRESS gave early chase outside then took the lead two deep nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail through the turn, drifted into the lane and was
caught the final strides. MARY'S LISTED NEXT engaged in close early chase off the rail then checked from a hemmed in position at the five sixteenths pole,
came through the turn in the four path and raced evenly down the lane. CALCUTTA settled off the pace then bid into the turn, came through the turn in the
five path and finished evenly. TAKE PATTERNS raced well off the pace then bid leaving the five sixteenths pole, was eased to the six path through the turn
and finished well. CATHERINES WARRIOR pressured the pace inside then checked from tight quarters at the rail in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole,
came through the turn still at the rail then weakened. RED BEAN SONDE set a pressured pace through the backstretch but was caught nearing the quarter
pole and faded through the turn. THAT TRICKY LADY settled back inside and was never a factor. LIVE FREE never factored.
