Footnotes
INDOMINUS REX was rated within easy striking distance in the two path, was steadied while blocked behind the leaders around the final turn, moved
quickly between horse to vie into the final furlong then drew out just after a mile. BUSTIN THE BANK pressed two wide outside the early leader, moved to
the front midway on the final turn but couldn't contain the winner in the drive. IYWAAN was unhurried in the two path, came out four wide midway on the
final turn while moving, moved closer on the outside in early stretch then lacked a further response. HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY had early position outside, gave
his best three wide between horses on the final turn, tired in the lane and was eased up late. FINAL RITUAL moved to the front from the inside entering the
first turn, was under rating until the far turn, was put to urging, tired in the lane and was eased up. BEST CHOICE broke slowly, raced outside in the three
path, stopped in the lane and was eased up.

Footnotes
COLOR FORCE set the pace while staying a bit off of the rail, shook free from an outer pursuer passing the five furlong pole, widened advantage through
the far turn, and was kept to task through the lane under mild flagging. FREE COFFEE pressed from outside of the leader's flank while being kept in the
three path into the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with that rival passing the five furlong pole, chased that loose foe around the far turn, and held place
through the lane to prove second best. QUEEN STINKER tracked from the pocket around the first turn before shifting to the three path into the backstretch,
chased from the four path and outside of the leaders around the far turn, but failed to rally through the lane. FLASHY SIREN was caught in the four path
around the first turn, got outmoved by inner rivals down the backstretch and tucked to the rail into the far turn, saved ground around it, but to no avail.
SUGAR INCLUDED was outrun, lost touch with the field around the far turn, was eased through the lane, and showed little.

CHEESE ON moved to the front from the inside midway on the backstretch, drew out on the turn then widened under urging through the lane. SILVER
STARSHIP angled to the outside early on the backstretch, raced four wide outside horses into the turn, angled in some, swung wide into the stretch and
weakened. TO THE HILT wasn't far back between horses early, raced two wide into the turn, angled to the rail early on the bend, swung out entering the
stretch then tired. ONLY THE TRUTH broke sharply to make the early pace, raced three wide between horses into the turn and began to fade before a half.
BLUEGRASS POSSE was slow early, was forced to steady and alter course well out into the track early on the turn and continued evenly. SILVER DUKE
was slow from the gate, steadied then altered course well out into the track early on the turn then failed to menace. NINTH SYMPHONY steadied slightly
between horses early on the backstretch, steadied and altered course well out into the track early on the turn and failed to menace. MR. TALENT trailed
early, steadied, altered course out from the rail early on the turn and was outrun. GORGEOUS CHARLI wasn't far back inside into the turn, steadied sharply
when put in tight along the rail, clipped heels, stumbled and unseated the rider leaving the three-eighths pole. There was a stewards' inquiry but the results
stood.

Footnotes
NONPLUSULTRA prompted the pace inside of the dueling leaders before taking back to stalk from the pocket into the turn, commenced a bid along the
inside of the leaders at the furlong pole as the rail was left vacated, and prevailed in the late stages under through a long drive. WEST FORK dueled inside
of A TO Z while between horses in the three path early on, cleared his inner rivals and angled down to the two path into the turn, sustained the duel while
holding a slight margin turning for home, but left the rail open, dug in and repelled his outer counterpart as NONPLUSULTRA made an inside bid for the lead
passing the furlong pole, but was bested by that foe in the late stages. A TO Z dueled outside of WEST FORK early on, shifted from the four to the three
path into the turn, sustained the duel turning for home, but weakened at the furlong pole and gave way. BOLOGNESE shifted to the three path in midpack
into the turn, but lacked a kick in upper stretch to threaten the leaders, and kept on willingly for a minor reward while failing to make headway on the leaders.
SPORTING ART took the turn in the three to four path while far off the pace, but bore out when asked to angle outwards for racing room in upper stretch,
ended up in the eight path at the furlong pole, and failed to factor. BULLAGER took the turn in the two to four path while off of the pace, but awkwardly
changed leads when asked to in upper stretch, and lacked a rally thereafter. USEPPA hopped at the start, was off slow, and trailed the field around the turn
in the three path, then passed tired foes without threatening. BACKCOUNTRY stalked along the inside of the trio of leaders, but failed to keep pace with
those rivals at the half mile pole, saved ground while fading around the turn, weakened further turning for home, and was eased through the lane. TICKED
ALL DABOXES was restless for the gates to open, raced in midpack in the five path and outside of horses early on, but weakened around the turn.
RISQUE'S AFFAIR raced far off of the pace in the six path around the turn, weakened to trail the field in upper stretch, then was eased.

PENNY IN LOVE stayed out from the rail while rated on a clear lead to the stretch then widened under brisk urging. LADY A. G. was slow early, made a run
along the rail into the stretch, angled out between rivals and was up for the place in an even finish. JESSE THE GREAT was unhurried in the two path,
angled out in early stretch and continued evenly. MOON CHANT was fractious in the gate, broke slowly, moved to chase the winner in the three path, was
put to strong whip on the final turn then tired. SWEET MAGIC MOMENT stopped.

Footnotes
TWEET KITTEN rated on a clear lead while staying off of the rail through the turn, angled down the to two path turning for home, then drew off when asked
approaching the furlong pole, and finished strongly to widen his margin while hanging on his left lead. POLAR JET stalked three wide and between horses
early on, cleared inner foes and angled to the rail around the turn, attempted a bid inside of the leader turning for home, but decided to angle out in upper
stretch and engage the leader from the outside, but was no match for that foe approaching the furlong pole, and held place through the lane while hanging
on his left lead. WARLEGGAN saved ground around the turn while far off of the pace, was guided to the six path turning for home for racing room outside of
the leaders, and rallied mildly for show. KRAKOV took the turn in the five path while off of the pace, and failed to menace. SUCCESS HURRICANE was
forwardly placed in the four, then three, path around the turn, but proved no match for the leaders in upper stretch, weakened late, and got outfinished for
minor rewards. TIGER ALLEY reared in the gate, threw his rider, then was unloaded and reloaded before the start, was forwardly placed two wide between
horses early on, but failed to keep pace with those foes into the turn, came into the lane in the three path and between horses, but failed to rally. SILENT
ALARM chased the pace setters from along the inside, but weakened turning for home. INSIDER hopped at the start and was off slowly, took the turn in the
six path while outside of rivals and far off of the pace, and failed to get involved.

I GOT A ROCK, fractious in the gate, was reloaded, showed speed from the outset, stayed out from the rail around the turn then drew out under strong
urging. VENOMOUS STATE pressed in the three path outside the winner to the stretch then couldn't keep up. LOVE THAT JAZZ ducked into
WOLFINBARGER leaving the gate, steadied then ducked hard into that rival early on the backstretch, was caught in tight between horses on the
backstretch and into the turn, steadied in tight between horses nearing the quarter pole then weakened. MAGICIAN'S CALENDAR stayed outside in the
three path into the stretch then continued evenly. WOLFINBARGER was bumped leaving the gate, was bumped soundly early on the backstretch, stayed
along the rail and tired. INCENSED wasn't far back outside early then stopped.

Footnotes
BAYANNE settled in midpack in the four path and outside of rivals, commenced a rally at the quarter pole, drove past the leader passing the furlong pole,
and drew off under driving pressure. MERROW rated on a clear lead in the two to three path around the turn, dug in approaching the furlong pole as
BAYANNE rallied along side, but was no match for that rival and held place late. YOUARESTILLTHEWON shifted off the rail to the two, then three, path
approaching the five sixteenths pole, then angled to the four path in upper stretch and produced a mild rally outside of inner tiring foes for show. FAIRFIELD
saved ground around the turn while chasing from midpack, altered off of the rail to to pass a tiring rival at the furlong pole, but got outfinished for show. KAY
SYRAH SYRAH broke outwards, took the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and failed to get involved. ORBITING THE MOON stalked outside of
the leader in the three path, but was outkicked by an outer foe turning for home, drifted in in upper stretch, and stopped.
