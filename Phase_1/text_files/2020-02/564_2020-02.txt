Footnotes
MISS SWISS sped to the front, set the pace from the inside to the turn, challenged from the outside and dueled around the bend, held a narrown advantage
into the stretch, kicked clear of KATHIA in the upper stretch and drew away in the final sixteenth. KATHIA chased off the the inside, bid alongside the
pacesetter on the turn and dueled into the stretch but could not match the winner late. LALA FLEUR trailed the field in the early stages from off the rail,
angled in and saved ground on the turn, kept along the inside through the lane and bested the rest. IN IT FOR LIFE chased the speed between rivals to the
turn, traveled three wide into the lane and never produced a bid. IZZY'S INPUT stalked outside rivals and well off the rail, went four wide around the turn
and proved no menace. MOTHER SUPREME bobbled shortly after the start, chased from between rivals in the early going then off the rail, angled in on the
turn to race a bit off the inside into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
DARK AND DANDY settled off the pace and off the inside early, made progress on the pacesetter around the turn while in the two path, angled out and set
his sights on ROYAL BAR entering the stretch, assumed command nearing the sixteenth pole and won going away under a drive. ROYAL BAR had good
early speed from the outside, controlled the pace with a comfortable advantage and angled over near the inside, continued to show the way through the turn
but with a diminishing lead entering the stretch, came under a drive at the eighth pole, offered no resistance to the winner approaching the sixteenth pole but
was clearly second best. EVENING REWARD showed brief speed from the inside then chased the leader to the turn, traveled a bit off the rail to the lane
and went evenly late. DIXIE DOO RUN RUN settled in the early going, raced three wide into the turn, shifted to the inside and saved ground into the stretch
but lacked a rally. ROCK N DOC hopped at the start, trailed the field in the early going, traveled along the inside then two wide and also lacked rally. P
TOWN TITAN chased outside a rival, three wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
RON'S CAT displayed keen early foot and opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, controlled the pace along the inside into the turn, continued
well clear into the lane and held safely under right-handed encouragement and ridden out late. WE WILL RE JOYCE chased the pace outside a rival, two
wide then three wide while still alongside CIOPPINO PASADINO into the lane, finished willingly in the late stages but failed to threaten the winner in the
closing moments. CIOPPINO PASADINO chased from the inside to the turn, moved out into the two path entering the stretch and finished evenly through
the final furlong. ALLOTMENT tracked off the rail, entered the turn two wide then angled four wide and failed to rally. ROYAL ASTRONOMER reserved off
the rail in the early going, angled in on the turn then back out to race three to four wide into the stretch and never threatened. CHARMING ALEXIS settled
off the pace, raced a bit off the rail through the turn and was never a factor.
