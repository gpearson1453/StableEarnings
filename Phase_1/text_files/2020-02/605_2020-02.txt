Footnotes
ZIRCON ZLOTY set a clear pace inside and came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced near the rail on the turn then dug in under steady
handling to hold off the game stretch challenge of TREASURED INFO, who gave chase then raced at the rail on the turn and dug in under a steady stretch
drive but couldn't get past the determined winner. GINGER IN DISGUISE engaged in close early chase off the rail and raced in the three path rounding the
turn, then finished evenly at the outside flank of the winner. GOLDEN VALE chased the pace outside down the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn
then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. DAISY'S STORM chased the pace toward the inside then angled to the six path through the turn and finished
evenly. MRS POOCHIE gave close early chase, dropped back in the five path of the turn then flattened stride. NO HONEY MONEY angled to the outside to
give chase and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BEARCAT KITTEN set a pressured pace inside, widened through the turn, lasted well and was taken in hand the final yards. ON THIS DAY broke out to
make contact with Tensas Tough, was then forced in and into Jewel Heist on the chute, raced well back from the early pace but steadily progressed,
rounded the turn near the rail, came between horses leaving the eighth pole and finished evenly after taking second mid-stretch. POPLAR AVENUE
engaged in close chase to the quarter pole but dropped back midway on the turn and flattened out the final sixteenth. PAPACHO gave chase, raced in the
four path of the turn and showed little more. FRENCH'S QUEST chased the pace outside and came through the turn in the five path but showed little more
in the lane. TENSAS TOUGH broke through the gate prior the start, was bumped at the break then came in on the chute to make contact with On This Day,
picked up the chase leaving the chute but showed little leaving the turn. TWINSANITY was bumped off stride on the chute then gave chase to no avail.
JEWEL HEIST was bumped inward and into Twinsanity on the chute then raced well back while galloping the course.

Footnotes
BRUSHING stalked the early pace from the three path then took the lead past the half mile pole, raced clear leaving the seven sixteenths, came under
pressure nearing the five sixteenths, drew away on the far turn and continued to widen under mostly, an aggressive hand ride. I AM I WILL settled back from
early contention toward the inside then bid past the half mile pole, took over second approaching the top of the lane, though had to settle for second best.
SWEET TWEET steadied while attempting to bear out into the opening turn then again at the rail in the vicinity of the half mile pole, started a bid leaving the
seven sixteenths, rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little more. COURTLY KITTY settled off the pace toward the inside, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little further. TAKACHANCEONME rounded the opening turn about the four
path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed only mild response. FOXY JOXY broke awkwardly then raced in the five path the first turn, entered the
backstretch outside and faded past the five sixteenths pole. ONE TOUGH ANGEL rated a slim lead two deep and drew briefly clear past the nine sixteenths
pole, but was caught leaving the half pole, dropped back at the seven sixteenths then taken in hand.

Footnotes
SCHLOSSER rounded the opening turn in the five path then stalked from the seven eighths pole, took a slim lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, came
under pressure and widened past the five sixteenths and was steadily handled down the lane. SET'EM UP JOE raced off the pace in the three and four
paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened out late stretch. WHISKEY CREEK settled well back off the rail, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail but flattened stride down the lane. HOWYAFORMONEY settled well off the pace in the three
and four paths then raced outside into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and showed little
more. QUALITY TIME saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch. CHARITABLE MARK settled off the pace in the two and three
paths then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, however, showed little response through the backstretch. HOSWAY had the early lead off
the rail but ceded the advantage toward the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase from that point then faded through the backstretch. SPECIAL SEASON (GB)
rated close inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

and held on under steady encouragement. TURNER ASHBY raced well off the pace about the four path the first turn then entered the backstretch outside,
bid nearing the three eighths pole, circled rivals six wide on the far turn, dueled for second mid-stretch and finished evenly while gaining mildly on the
winner. MOONLIT NIGHT was hustled along for the early lead then met at even terms approaching the half mile pole, dropped back past the pole and gave
chase, came through the far turn in the four and five paths then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. HARD BEING ME raced well off the pace while
saving early ground, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, angled to the outside leaving the turn and passed some faders.
NAZCA MYSTERY bore out into the first turn then stalked three wide into the backstretch, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took the lead past
the five sixteenths, but was caught midway on the far turn and weakened. GOLDEN APPEAL settled off the pace inside, started a bid leaving the three
eighths pole, checked off the heels of Fear The Lati approaching the quarter pole then faded off the rail rounding the far turn. FEAR THE LATI settled off the
pace in the two and three paths the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled back toward the inside
approaching the quarter and showed little more. FAPPIANO ROCKET stalked the early pace two deep then moved to even terms approaching the half mile
pole, took the lead past the pole and was pressured from that point, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

SINGINDOWNTHELANE took immediate control and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled to hold on well. RIGHT NOTION stalked the pace three wide then picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, couldn't improve on the winner and just lasted for second. SO RED THE ROSE rounded the first turn in the
four path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the four path and was
closing on the runner-up. ARCHANA saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, angled out toward the stretch and left the turn in the
seven path, then passed some. RESPECTED stalked the pace inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
weakened. NORTHERN HEAT raced outside leaving the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the six path
and showed little more. CARSON CITY COIN raced in the five path the first turn and never factored.

Footnotes
CARTER'S RUN saved ground off the pace the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn in the four path and dug in through the stretch to get up the final strides. POET WARRIOR settled off the pace and off the rail then closed for the
lead past the three eighths pole, widened his advantage through the far turn but showed little further response beyond the sixteenth pole and was caught
the final strides. LITTLE BARI settled off the pace in the three path then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail but flattened
stride inside the sixteenth pole. JOEY GOTCHA saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed
little further. AWESOME BUZZ stumbled leaving the gate and raced well back while saving early ground. ALPHASTEST closed to the lead while tapering to
the inside and rated the pace, was pressured nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the lead past the pole, dropped back at the five sixteenths then faded
at the rail leaving the far turn. ODDS R AGAINST US raced well back in the three and four paths. CONQUISTODOR FUEGO was not a factor.
EXPLOITATION rounded the opening turn in the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and showed no response to steady encouragement.
