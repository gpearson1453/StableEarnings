settle early, moved up five wide at the eighth pole and finished second best. TREBULSKI stalked the pace from the outside, raced four deep into the upper
stretch and had no final winning bid. BUDDY ROCKET was slow early, saved ground throughout, improved his position through the stretch but had not
enough late. EARS A WINNER stalked the pace, raced three deep and never was a factor. MIDNIGHT BLUES MAN set all the pace and gave way. HART

MESSIAH pressed the pace, Raced just to the outside of Dauntless Prince through the stretch, an objection was filed by Dauntless Prince for claiming he
came down deep stretch to put him in tight but the claim was not allowed. DAUNTLESS PRINCE showed good early speed from the inside, raced in a bit
tight in the latter stages and finished second best. HOUR CITY stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
ROCKTIZWAY stalked the pace, raced along the inside and had no final winning bid. DECLARE WAR was allowed to settle early, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and never was a real threat. HERO OF FIRE was slow early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. ARIZONA settled in the early
stages, raced six deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. CRESCENT FLYER failed to respond. A P'S BLUEGRASS dropped back early, raced
four wide into the lane and never threatened.

early, saved ground and had no response. UNTILWEMEETAGAIN dropped back early and failed to have a response. MULA JOHN failed to menace.
