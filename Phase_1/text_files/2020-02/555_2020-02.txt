Footnotes
SNEADS established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, shook away nearing the quarter pole and went three wide into upper stretch,
drew off being lightly shown the stick to the off side briefly while in hand through to the finish to prevail comfortably at the end. SPLITTING EIGHTS four then
three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while well clear of the rest
for the place honors. INFORMED CONSENT chased three to four wide placed to coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired
while along for the show honors. SEEDISKID chased three to four wide down the backstretch, briefly tucked to the two path half a mile out before tipping
back out three to four wide through the turn put to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home and tired. TIO BLAS coaxed from
the gate, briefly gave chase just off the inside before tipping four paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coaxed along
from the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide for home and tired. WELL IN TUNE chased just off the inside forwardly placed early on, lost position into the turn,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced mildly, swung three wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
POT OF HUNNY bumped between foes at the start, came under light coaxing and raced forwardly placed in the two path, had HONEY MONEY tuck over
from the outside and was placed in tight inside that rival and in turn put IDAKA in very tight along the rail with five furlongs to go, got taken in hand and lost
about two lengths of ground at the nine-sixteenths forcing IDAKA in turn to steady in behind, tipped three wide near the half mile pole, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths now traveling three wide, angled out six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive closing well to issue a challenge through the final
furlong taking over command at the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to prevail. HONEY MONEY broke in at the start bumping POT OF
HUNNY in tandem with IDAKA, chased three wide briefly before tucking to the two path placing a pair of rivals in tight along the inside five furlongs from
home, continued just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to preserve the place honors clear of the rest. LEYTE established the front
and showed the way in hand three then two wide, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under challenge and was headed a
furlong out, weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. CHOOSE HAPPINESS grew detached at the tail of the field early on while striding
a bit green, came under light coaxing and chased four wide down the backstretch and through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on
belatedly with interest. SMOKIN HOT KISS six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn placed to coaxing at
the three-eighths, cornered five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. NEW YORK SUPREME forwardly placed five wide down the backstretch, tucked
three wide through the turn coming under a ride five-sixteenths from home, went four wide at the head of the stretch and faltered in the drive. IDAKA chased
along the inside and got placed in tight along the rail to the inside of POT OF HUNNY five furlongs out due to pressure outside that rival from HONEY
MONEY, got forced to steady at the nine-sixteenths conceding three to four lengths of ground to the front, tipped three wide following the move by POT OF
HUNNY into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

BERTRANDA bobbled at the break and recovered breaking on top despite it, showed the way in hand four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a
drive to prevail. LETMETAKETHISCALL five to six paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while well clear of the rest and along second best.
TAYLER'S THE BOSS four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. FIRST FOREVER
seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the turn, got ridden along at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS broke in at the start brushing TAKEOFF, established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path under some
pressure from a pair to the outside through swift splits, remained patiently handled until set down angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
under threat a furlong out before edging clear under a drive to the finish. NO MORE MIRACLES prompted the pace from the four path between foes, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, dug in under a drive threatening a furlong from home, ultimately got repelled through the
final furlong while running on safe for the place honors. BEACH FRONT five wide in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MAC'S REVOLUTION a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and kept on through to the finish. TALENT SCOUT eight paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, went five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the
drive. UNION WISE chased along the inside coaxed along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. PRETERNATURAL
coaxed from the gate, chased six then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. RUNNING VIOLENCE
crossed directly to the two path after the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide for home and tired. I'M
ELMER J FUDD bobbled at the start recovering outwards and leaning on LETZGOMETZ for a stride or two, chased seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn pushed along from three furlongs out, went five wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.
LETZGOMETZ got leaned on for the initial strides out of the gate by the aforementioned foe, chased seven then six wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, continued six wide into upper stretch and tired. TAKEOFF got brushed at the break by SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS who broke inwards,
chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, was unable to make an impact, then got
vanned off after finishing and being usaddled in the paddock.

PLAYWRIGHT four wide in pursuit down the backstretch, briefly tipped out to the five or six path nearing the half mile pole bumping with FROSTED ICE
before tucking three wide at that station, advanced on the once clear top pair and darted to the open rail near the three-eighths put to coaxing to take over
command inside that station, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, drifted in slightly straightened away before drifting out under a near sided stick a
furlong from home, dug in under threat and held safe to the finish to prevail. CARTHON five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away to the four path, dug in
and had the aforementioned foe drift out safely in front, drifted out nearing the finish while offering up a mild kick to be along well clear of the rest and
second best. FROSTED ICE eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the four path bumping with PLAYWRIGHT near the half mile pole,
advanced on the duelers up front placed to coaxing four wide at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, then weakened through to the
finish while along for the show honors. REAL DAN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and tired. HOROSCOPE hustled from the gate, dueled from the six path down the backstretch with
BIG MOUNTAIN to his outside shaking away from the rest of the field as a pair while coaxed along, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, had a pair
of rivals advance and take up flanking positions near the three-eighths, yielded readily inside that station, went five wide into upper stretch and tired. BIG
MOUNTAIN coaxed from the gate, dueled from the seven path with the aforementioned rival to his inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the
turn, came under a ride at the three-eighths joined by a flanking pair, retreated steadily through the latter portion of the turn and went four wide for home,
folded and was eased through the stretch. JOE'S SMOKIN GUN chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch, made no impact and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
MR. BUFF coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits accompanied by a pair to the outside, shook off those
rivals from the midway point on the turn to the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, came under brief coaxing near the eighth pole, got shown the
stick once to the off side inside that station, the rider peering back to assess any oncoming threat while well clear of the field, got taken in hand through to
the finish just outside the sixteenth marker to prevail comfortably on the wire. HONOR UP four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, got shaken off in tandem with SYNDERGAARD through the latter portion of the turn, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired, proved no
match for the top one while prevailing in the battle for the place honors. SYNDERGAARD coaxed from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside three
then two wide, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off through the latter portion of the turn and went five wide into upper stretch, tired.
TWISTED TOM chased just off the inside growing detached from the top trio in concert with FLEET IRISH, came under urging at the seven-sixteenths,
continued just off the inside for home and was unable to make an impact. FLEET IRISH three wide in pursuit from afar in tandem with the aforementioned
foe, came under a ride at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

DESBORDES bobbled at the break, recovered to establish the front shortly after the start and show the way in hand from the three path, tucked inside half a
mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and slipped away before spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive
and was geared down inside the final sixteenth, the outcome in no doubt. MIZZEN THE MARK bumped at the start by WICKED KHEISHA who broke
awkwardly inwards, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
angled out six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while kicking on belatedly to go by a host stacked across the track a furlong out and
secure the place honors safely on the wire. WICKED KHEISHA broke awkwardly inwards and bumped the aforementioned foe, chased four to five wide
down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and improved position for
the show honors. EMPRESS LUCIANA eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid, then weakened in the late stages. JUST STAY HOME forwardly placed
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got shaken off swinging five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. STUY TOWN BABY four wide in aim of the leader, tucked to the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. SHES EUPHORIC inside early on, tipped three wide six and a half furlongs from home, closed in
on the back of rivals into the turn and tipped out four to five wide near the three-eighths placed to coaxing while mildly advancing, went seven wide into
upper stretch, was unable to make an impact while passing some tired rivals in the stretch. LIL MORNING STAR broke in a step at the start brushing ON
TO CINCINNATI, chased four wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and tired. BROADWAY ANGEL coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch and tired. ON TO CINCINNATI brushed at the start by LIL MORNING STAR who broke in a step, came under hustling ans raced forwardly placed
just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, faded coaxed along through the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and faltered. PLAYBOYS
