Footnotes
HAILEY'S DAY showed good speed, set the pace while getting some pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear outside the
quarter-pole, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew off under a brisk hand ride. ORB'S SOUL broke out and was off a bit slow, angled in
while ridden along off the pace, raced in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the rail, saved ground from that point into upper stretch, angled out
while put to a right-handed whip just inside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner while far clear for the place. ALLEY MUSIC was urged
along on the outside, went around the turn in the five path, turned into the stretch in the six path and failed to respond while best of the rest. ROZAFA broke
a step slow, was ridden along at the back, raced inside early on the turn, moved to the two then three path later on that bend, turned into the stretch under
the whip and also failed to respond. MISS JAMIE pressed the pace set by the winner while on the outside, vied in the four path on the turn, dropped back
outside the quarter-pole, drifted out in upper stretch and stopped.

Footnotes
KING OF CANDY saved ground on the first turn, came off the rail entering the backstretch, tracked the pace on the outside, raced in the two path on the far
turn, was asked while making a three wide bid into the stretch, took over outside the three-sixteenths, responded well under pressure in the final furlong,
shook off SURGE PRICING near the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging. JAILHOUSE KITTEN dropped well behind early, saved ground on the
first turn, lagged at the rear, was urged along while inside for most of the far turn, moved closer in the process, shifted three wide late on that bend then
swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished fast but was too late and just missed while able to get the place. GOOD
INTENT went four wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside, moved closer while going inside of a stopping foe with a half-mile to run, was roused
while three wide on the far turn then driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and earned the
show. SURGE PRICING went to the front, raced in the two path for most of the far turn then dropped to the rail, set the pace through solid fractions, vied
inside on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive into upper stretch, fought on until near the sixteenth-pole then
was outfinished. GO FOR MOONSHINE went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, came under urging while three then four wide on
the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. TRIVISTA went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace,
moved closer with a half-mile to run, dropped back in the two path on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then dropped in and came up empty.
MULTIPLE broke a bit slow, moved up quickly on the outside, went five wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside for a half-mile then
retreated. (Rail at 25 Feet)

Footnotes
RELEASE THE BEAST was in a bit tight and just slightly taken hold of at the start, settled while shifting in early, saved ground on the turn, began to move
out under urging in mid-stretch then continued to drift out under a left-handed whip, struck the lead about forty yards out and edged away late under his own
momentum. LETITHAPPENCARLOS broke outwardly, forced the pace from outside a rival early, edged away and extended the margin through lively
fractions on the turn while in the two path, asked for more in upper stretch but began to noticeably weaken and was overtaken late. BET AGAIN was well off
the top pair racing between rivals early then soon moved clear of foes still far back of the top two, went in the three path into the turn just briefly coming in a
bit entering that bend before coming back out, came to the head of the stretch four wide and having edged a bit closer by upper stretch, drifted in thereafter
and ran willingly late but could not kick on with the winner. BROTHER RICHIE was between rivals toward the rear early, steadied just slightly past the
half-mile marker entering the turn, continued inside foes on or just off the fence through the turn, came out in late stretch and gained mildly. LUCK OF THE
DRAW raced outside foes four to five wide through the turn toward the back and was never near enough to threaten. TWO STEPPIN' STAR was at the back
between rivals going mostly three wide through the turn, failed to threaten. C'MON VE pressed briefly inside then dropped back and chased while switching
out past the half-mile marker, continued to chase well back of the leader but clear of others from the two to three path through the turn, drifted about a bit in
the stretch after giving way and faded.

PAPA'S BOY went four wide early on the first turn then tucked into the three path, settled off the pace, was asked while four wide on the far turn, rallied six
wide into the stretch, took the lead near the three-sixteenths, fought outside of two foes in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. CHANGI went
three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue while three wide on the far turn, made a bid in upper stretch, fought on
gamely in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the place. IM A COWBOY TOO went to the front, set the pace through glacial fractions while
inside to the two path, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, kept on in the final
furlong and held the show. PAYDAY TOO went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the inside of a rival, was roused in the two path on the far
turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive around the three-sixteenths, shifted further out outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly
for the show. CABO'S RUMOR rounded the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked for his best
in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. IMPRESSIVE STUDENT went four wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, came under urging while
three to four wide on the far turn, angled out in upper stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive and failed to rally. MY BOOK was eager under
restraint while inside on the first turn, settled more kindly on the backstretch, was taken up while dropping back into the far turn, saved ground on that bend,
moved out in upper stretch and came up empty. CAJUN PINATA was taken back early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear,
moved out near the half-mile pole, was roused while five then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. (Rail at 25
Feet)

Footnotes
SCARLETTSBLACKJACK exchanged a bump at the break but recovered with just mild urging to move clear and dictate terms up the backstretch, saved
ground on the rail through the turn while in the clear and in hand, was asked about the three-sixteenths when challenged by an outside foe, headed by that
rival outside the furlong marker but responded to urging to retake command past that point and edge away late. ZENUCCI exchanged a bump with the
aforementioned and was consequently last away, switched off the rail and given mild encouragement early moving up inside foes but racing just off the
fence, entered the turn in about the two path but soon shifted out four wide by the three-eighths and came to the head of the stretch five wide, was put to a
strong drive at that juncture, bid past the three-sixteenths putting a head in front nearing the furlong marker but could not kick on with the winner.
ONEHOLYLION was in a bit tight and lightly taken up at the start, moved forward from off the rail into the turn, shifted from the three path early on that bend
to the rail just past the seven-sixteenths, came out in mid- to late-stretch and ran on to get show honors over JOHN'S LUCK, who was strongly urged at the
break, chased the winner from outside going in the three path through the turn and drifted out a further path leaving that bend, lacked the needed late bid
and lost third late. WHERE Y'AT JOE JOE was bumped at the break and urged along early racing mid-pack and well off the inside, went five to six wide on
the turn and failed to rally. BOOTH ROAD SHINE was bumped into a rival at the start, settled at the rear, shifted in early on the turn saving ground before
coming out a path leaving that bend, moved out further in upper stretch and ran on but needed more. MY DAD LOUIE bumped the inside rival at the start,
was allowed to settle early, went in the four path into the turn before shifting in a path on that bend as a rival moved out, failed to produce a bid. CHASE
FOR THE GOLD broke outwardly, briefly chased the leaders from outside dropping back in the four path entering the turn and faded thereafter.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN LIAISON broke awkwardly and about a length slowly into stride, raced in behind foes and faced mild traffic leaving the backstretch easing back
under a brief hold entering the turn, went in the two to three path on that bend advancing inside foes, moved out under stout encouragement inside the final
furlong to be about five wide outside of the sixteenth pole, struck the lead late and edged past of her own power. G'S MINE was in just a bit tight after the
start as a rival shifted in and switched outside that foe, raced mid-pack in behind rivals into the turn going in the two then three path on that bend, came out
four wide in upper stretch between rivals, took a narrow lead past the furlong marker but was outkicked. STAR PRADO moved forward and clear soon after
the start, shifted in and set the pace saving ground on the turn but facing outside pressure leaving the turn, fought on gamely through the lane but needed
more. POPS SHANGHAI shifted in after the start as STAR PRADO moved in, tracked that rival along the inside on or just off the rail moving outside that foe
early on the turn while edging closer, bid between rivals near the eighth pole but lacked the needed late kick. DECADENT DIAMOND chased from outside,
went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide past the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. ABLE CATCH was outside foes four to five wide on
the turn and never near enough to threaten. MI LIA chased briefly, steadily dropped back four wide shifting in a path late on the turn and continued to
retreat. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY raced a bit greenly in the early going, shifted in to go on or just off the rail through the turn and failed to threaten.

furlong marker then moved clear under strong urging. ENDURINGLY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, went three wide early on the
far turn then angled five wide, gained into upper stretch, chased the pacesetter under a drive while outside into the final furlong and was outfinished by the

the five-sixteenths, drifted out after turning into the stretch then was straightened by the rider, chased under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked
while able to get the show. ALBA'S STAR went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through solid fractions, vied inside on the far
turn, responded well when put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead inside the furlong marker and weakened. GALILEOS BALLERINA was taken in hand
early, went four wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the rear, started the far turn in the three path then shifted four wide, moved to five wide later on
that bend, came six wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but flattened out. MISS COMMISH saved ground on the
first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, raced inside on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted further
out near the furlong marker and failed to threaten. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL went three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, came under urging while
