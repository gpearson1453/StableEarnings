command nearing the quarter pole, ran out into the stretch and held under brisk urging. DEAR JOHN LETTER settled inside, made a run into the stretch
then gained slowly to the end. POLICY MISTAKE broke in the air, raced three wide with the pace to the stretch then weakened. VANESSA'S SECRET
ducked out sharply leaving the gate, raced three wide and weakened. PINK bobbled, hit the outside door of the gate at the break, raced two wide between
rivals and tired. DETERMINED LOVE showed speed between rivals, moved two wide to a short lead outside the winner midway on the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
ROMAN BELLA stalked along the inside, came under coaxing and shifted off of the rail passing the five sixteenths pole, angled out to the four path from
behind the leaders in upper stretch, quickened and bid for the lead outside of the dueling leaders passing the furlong pole, reached the front under light
handling at the sixteenth pole, and was geared down while drawing off. DECOLLETE dueled inside of RAIN RUNNER through the turn, dug in as that foe
grabbed the lead turning for home, repelled her dueling counterpart approaching the sixteenth pole, but was worn down by an outer oncharging rival through
the late stages. RAIN RUNNER vied, then dueled, outside of DECOLLETE into the turn, drifted to the three path turning for home while gaining a slight
advantage over her inner rival, but tired late and gave way between horses approaching the sixteenth pole. GLYNDON MISS saved ground while far off of
the pace, advanced inside of tiring rivals turning for home, and offered a mild rally without truly threatening the leaders. SUNNY HILL BOBBIE tracked from
midpack four wide and outside of rivals, but drifted out turning for home, and weakened while continuing to drift through the lane. MY LION EYES trailed two
wide early on, took the turn in the four to five path while still far off of the pace, and proved no factor. MAKEMEASAMMICH was forwardly placed three wide
and between horses early on, but weakened passing the seven sixteenths pole, trailed the field turning for home, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ANITA LUCKY BREAK didn't break sharply, ducked out into NATALIE leaving the gate, was sent between rivals to duel for command soon after, stayed out
from the rail once clear on the turn and was best under intermittent urging. TIZ TAS TIME ducked out into IL MIO AMORE leaving the gate, chased two wide
and gained mildly. IL MIO AMORE was fractious in the gate, was bumped leaving there, stayed out from the rail around the turn, angled to the outside in
early stretch and gained mildly. UNCANNY dueled inside the winner into the turn then tired. REINING IN broke awkwardly, was unhurried early, raced two
wide between rivals around the turn and outfinished the others while no threat. REYANA REYA DREAMS improved position along the rail around the turn
but failed to sustain her bid through the lane. NATALIE was bumped leaving the gate, was shuffled back early on the backstretch, raced the three path
around the turn and tired. JOYOFTHIRTYSEVEN briefly showed speed following an alert break, raced wide around the turn and stopped. SHE'S SURE
CLASSY was outrun. POOCHIE LOU was reluctant to load, trailed and was eased up late.

Footnotes
ALLISON K was between horses two wide in midpack early on, forged show from those foes around the turn, sustained her grinding rally through the lane to
split the leaders late, and get up approaching the wire. RORAIMA DOS prompted, then dueled, outside of TIKA into and around the turn, grabbed a lead
turning for home while drifting to the four path, held a slight advantage from her game inner foe through the lane, but drifted out under right handed
encouragement passing the furlong pole, and was bested by an oncharging rival in the late stages, then won the headbob for place. TIKA dueled inside of
RORAIMA DOS through the turn, dug in as her counterpart forged a narrow advantage turning for home, prolonged the duel gamely through the lane, but
was bested by an oncharging rival late, then lost the headbob for place with her dueling counterpart. SOBEIT SYLVIA settled far off of the pace inside of
rivals, vacated the rail at the five sixteenths pole, swung to the five path turning for home, and offered a mild grinding rally through the lane. HURRICANE
PATRICIA stalked three wide from the four path, but weakened turning for home. TRINKET broke outwards and bumped a rival at the start, took the turn
four wide from the five path in midpack, swung to the seven path turning for home, but lacked a rally. BERBERSLILBRIEBRIE was off a step slow and
trailed the field, came under an all out drive into the turn, but failed to response while shifting from the five to the eight path turning for home. ZANDORA
took a bump from an inner rival at the start, took the turn in the six path while far off of the pace, and never got involved. DULCIBELLE (GER) saved ground
from midpack, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole and subsequently stopped.

Footnotes
BRANDYWINES SECRET settled early, raced the two path around the turn, angled between rivals into the stretch, angled to the outside leaving the furlong
grounds and quickly ran clear late. YING YUE was urged to duel outside in the three path, moved to a short lived clear lead into the final sixteenth then
faltered. SHACKLEFORDS LADY stayed inside, moved closer in early stretch but lacked a strong closing. SO GUCCI showed speed from the outset,
dueled under urging in the two path for over five furlongs then weakened. FORMAL CLASS reared in the gate at the break, left several lengths behind the
field, lagged badly early then passed tired ones. FLATTERING RUBY chased early, was put to whip in the four path on the turn then stopped. VANIDOSA
was outrun inside.

Footnotes
CANDY ASSET advanced position with a rail skimming surge through the far turn, shifted to the two to three path while looking for racing room behind the
trio of leaders, bumped his outer foe, CAPTAIN THUNDER, multiple times in upper stretch while trying to create a clear path, found clear sailing as
DIGGERS DIAMOND shifted inwards approaching the furlong pole, powered through to split those rivals, and drew off while hanging on his left lead.
DIGGERS DIAMOND prompted the pace setter from the two path, forged a lead away from his inner rival at the five sixteenths pole, shifted ground from the
three to two path while holding an advantage in upper stretch, but by doing so allowed clear running room for CANDY ASSET, who suprassed him in the
final sixteenth. CAPTAIN THUNDER stalked along the inside, tipped to the three path at the five sixteenths pole, then to the four path at the quarter pole to
bid for the lead outside of the pair of leaders, but was bumped multiple times by his inner foe, CANDY ASSET, in upper stretch as that rival looked for racing
room, and was outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole. KNOWN QUANTITY made up ground by saving it around the far turn, was quickly maneuvered to
the five path the furlong pole, and stayed on mildly for a minor share. UNBRIDLED MESA trailed, took the far turn in the four to six path, and failed to
threaten whilst passing tired rivals. CAN HE SHINE set the pace along the inside to the far turn, but was headed by DIGGERS DIAMOND at the five
sixteenths pole, and weakened under light encouragement in upper stretch. JONATHANTOQUICK was floated to the five path into the first turn, advanced
slightly in the four to five path around the far turn, but failed to threaten. HEART OF A WARRIOR pulled to a stalking position in the four path around the first
turn, but weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
RYDELL ducked out into SACRED WALK leaving the gate, was caught in tight two wide between horses entering the far turn, rallied the rail into the stretch
once clear and quickly drew out through the final sixteenth. COOKIE CRISP ran out into SCURLIN around the first turn whilst prominent two wide between
horses, moved clear in the two path on the final turn then couldn't contain the winner late. RIDE THIS TRAIN was unhurried outside, made a strong four
wide rally around the final turn to loom a threat into the stretch then flattened out. TINTO MESA began a run along the rail after a half, steadied behind the
easing horse nearing and for much of the final turn, swung wide into the stretch for room and finished willingly. BLACK JACKET was caught four wide
around the first turn whilst not far back, remained prominent three wide between horses into the far turn then tired. SCURLIN was carried out around the first
turn whilst three wide between horses, retained position into the far turn then stopped. SACRED WALK was bumped leaving the gate, made the early pace
along the rail, began to ease into the far turn, pulled up in early stretch then walked off.

Footnotes
NO HONOR NO DEAL was off slowly and settled far off of the collapsing pace in the two path, swung to the five path in upper stretch, rallied widest past
tiring foes, and got up approaching the wire. JOHNNY JUNIOR was pinched back between horses at the start, trailed the field early behind a hot pace,
made a rail rally through the turn, shifted off of the fence in upper stretch to split rivals in the two to three path at the furlong pole, made a bid and led briefly
passing the sixteenth pole, but was worn down by NO HONOR NO DEAL approaching the wire. QUEEN'S BIRD established a clear margin early on, stayed
in the two path around the turn while setting a fast pace, but tired turning for home, drifted outwards in upper stretch before drifting inwards as the rider
switched to right handed encouragment at the furlong pole, and was bested by multiple foes passing the sixteenth pole. RING THE BELLA chased from
midpack in the three to four path, but lacked a rally between horses in upper stretch. REY ASTRAY was a bit fractious waiting for the gates to opened,
saved ground from midpack, produced a bid for place inside of rivals at the quarter pole, but weakened passing the furlong marker. ELIAV chased two wide
from the three path, but weakened between horses at the furlong pole. AUDUBON WOOD was far off of the pace in the three path around the turn and
failed to get involved. FOXY B settled four wide in midpack, but came under coaxing into the turn, failed to respond, and weakened.
