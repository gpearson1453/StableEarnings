DIVA'S DIVA dueled throughout and prevailed in a long drive. EASTER DREAM bumped at the start, was never far off the pace, angled out on the turn, bid
seven wide, was gaining fast late and just missed at the wire. SOMARA pressed the pace three across, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled through
the stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. RYDERROO raced mid pack in a steady effort and lacked the needed late rally. FANCY COOKIE was
never far back and improved position under steady urging. S S TAYLOR raced inside and lacked a bid. ANGELS N DEVILDOGS broke awkwardly to be
away slowly, moved up to vie inside, fell back leaving the turn and leveled off. HEAVENLY HOLIDAY stumbled at the start and failed to threaten in an even
effort. HAPPY MARGARITA bumped at the start and was not urged late in an outside trip.

SUCCESS RATE raced close to the pace outside, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and drew clear to prove best. HARD TO
COME HOME raced in close between horses, challenged on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded to finish second best. TIZ MEOW pressed the
pace while racing along the rail, fell back on the turn, shifted out and earned show under steady urging. BLUE LAW lagged while racing outside, went ten
wide at the top of the stretch and closed well. CHAMPSACHAMP was never far back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only.
MIDNIGHT BOLT raced in the second flight between horses, fell back on the turn and went evenly thereafter. DEMERARA set the pace to the turn,
weakened and faded through the stretch. DUST ROLLER stumbled at the start and trailed the field.

CHANCE TO SHINE was never far back, saved ground, advanced along the rail on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly, got up near
the sixteenth pole and drew off. DEPUTY DORA was allowed to settle and raced in the back, bid off the rail, closed steadily, was gaining ground and got up
at the wire for place. UNIQUE FACTOR moved up along the backstretch to press the pace two wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to the
sixteenth pole, was outclosed, was caught for second. TRUE TO HERSELF (IRE) was sent to the front, held a clear lead around the first turn, responded
when challenged on the turn to duel to the sixteenth pole, yielded and lost position. KOOL KATE stalked the pace, fell back, bid six wide and didn't have
enough late. FREE MY SOUL raced in the back in an even effort and failed to menace. TEE EM EYE raced close to the pace, had nothing left for the drive
and faded.

POTANTICO was steadied entering the first turn, raced in the back, rallied around the second turn, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up at the
wire. CAMINO DE ESTRELLA was unhurried early, advanced to the turn, angled in, closed steadily, got up past the sixteenth pole and was caught.
BUCKYS PICK pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled past the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in a game effort. YO Y ME set the
pace, responded to duel past the eighth pole and faltered. ABRIDLEANDAPRAYER broke awkwardly, showed speed to the second turn and flattened out.
COURAGEOUS was checked on the first turn, through after a half and not urged late.

CLEAR THE MINE trailed the field, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up in the final strides. PRIMO
TOUCH raced in hand and was steadied entering the first turn, pressed the pace, challenged on the turn, dueled through the stretch and was outfinished in
a game effort. GATO GUAPO set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch, didn't have enough late and settled for show. MORSE CODE pressed the
pace to the second turn, fell back and finished evenly. SALTINI raced mid pack, was steadied on the second turn, blocked in the upper stretch and leveled
off. STRATTON stalked the pace while racing inside, bid on the turn to loom a threat and came up empty. ARIZONA MOON failed to menace in an even
effort. MESA SKYLINE was not a threat.
