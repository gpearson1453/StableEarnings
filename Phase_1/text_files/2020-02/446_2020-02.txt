Footnotes
SIENA'S TICKET ducked out at the start, angled inwards racing through the backstretch to press the pace outside a rival, then between foes into the turn
and went clear under steady pressure. ORNERY ANGEL tracked off the first flight in the opening stages, shifted three wide racing into the turn to lodge a
bid midway through the turn but proved no match. HIFALUTIN, urged between foes in the opening stages disputing the pace, couldn't match the winner
after three and a half furlongs and gave way nearing the lane. LADY JORDAN broke readily, was urged inside foes to briefly prompt the pace but gave way
early.

Footnotes
DAS DA ONE broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin just off the inside racing to the backstretch, forged clear nearing upper stretch and was
kept to firm encouragement to maintain the advantage. TALK TO THE MEDIA tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance between foes into the
backstretch, shifted inwards on the far turn and prevailed for the place honors between foes in the closing stages. UNSPOILED MOMENTS, reserved last
racing in the three path to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position.
WILSHIRE STAR, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane. NOMINAL DOLLARS tracked the pacesetter
three deep to the backstretch and faded after a half. OLLIVANDER broke in the air losing position to the leaders, angled immediately to the inside racing to
the first turn to track just off the leaders inside foes but gave way early.

BRONX RUMBLE pulled his way to terms prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, took over racing into the the far turn, forged clear to a
commanding advantage racing into upper stretch and was kept to steady pressure. SUPER DUPER HAPPY settled outside foes, advanced five wide on the
far turn to upper stretch and edged rivals for the place honors. BIJEMINI SLEW tracked off the second flight inside foes early, shifted out on the far turn
improved position three deep between foes while prevailing for a share. HEY SACH shied inwards at the start, was caught four wide racing into the first turn,
angled inwards nearing the far turn and continued with interest to finish on even terms with a rival for fourth. AUTOGRAPH, urged to dispute the pace inside
the eventual winner to the far turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. PINAR tracked off the second flight, was urged to make a brief advance three deep
between foes racing into the far turn but proved empty late. STRUM AND PLUCK was a brief factor inside foes in second flight but faded early. SECRET
MAGICIAN, pulling hard between foes tracking just off the first flight to the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner through that bend and gave way late.
UNO DOS TRES, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, never seriously menaced, then was vanned off the course. MR. HAND FULL was a brief
factor tracking just off the first flight three wide into the backstretch but was through after half. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF HEY SACH
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF AUTOGRAPH WHICH WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
SNICKER KICKER, caught four wide, then three wide while urged to dispute the outside rivals racing into the first turn, moved away to a clear advantage
racing into the backstretch remaining well off the rail, met a rival's challenge after a half to maintain the advantage racing into the far turn and steadily
widened the advantage in the closing stages under firm encouragement. SEGISMUNDO, bumped at the start, then caught five wide racing into the first turn,
advanced to contention in that path racing into the backstretch, was prompted to challenge the pacesetter nearing the far turn, but couldn't gain even terms
with that foe while proving best of the others. BOX CANDY, caught four wide between foes tracking just off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued in that path through the far turn to upper stretch but steadily improved position. HOMERS MAGIC broke outwards bumping SEGISMUNDO, was
collected, then reserved along the inside, saved ground through and gained some position insides foes racing into the stretch. BROWN ESSENCE made
brief pursuit of the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way into the far turn. K C TWOSTEP was a brief factor inside
the eventual winner prompting that foe's pace into the backstretch but was through after a half. I'LL MAKE U FAMOUS, held up just off the second flight
along the inside racing to the backstretch, made brief progress inside foes to gain position after a half but steadily faded racing into the lane. YOU'LL LIKE
IT, caught three deep between foes into the first turn, dropped out early.

Footnotes
DOMESTIC SPENDING (GB) was rated off the second flight inside a rival while pulling against restraint racing to the first turn, shifted out while continuing
between foes under firm restraint, shifted four wide midway through the far turn while being given his cue to advance and produced a sharp response to rally
to the front shifting inwards racing into the stretch to prove best under firm handling. MAROON MANIAC broke readily, was rated off a rival's pace to track
just off that foe inside rivals into the backstretch, was urged through inside foes to challenge when presented an opening racing into upper stretch but
couldn't match the winner late. ALONZO MOSELY veered out sharply at the start losing position to the field, was settled outside rivals in the last flight racing
to the first turn, shifted inwards to track off the second flight between foes into the far turn, then split rivals just off the inside in the closing stages to gain
some position late. MY ECLAIR sped to the fore while angling over to dictate the pace on a narrow margin in the two path racing to the backstretch,
maintained that advantage into the far turn, briefly resisted when challenged from both sides by the top pair midstretch but weakened late. CURLIN'S
THRILL settled between foes in the last flight early, angled out five wide nearing upper stretch to gain some position but made no real impact. SUNSATION
tracked just off the pacesetter three deep in second flight to the backstretch, was urged in brief pursuit of the leader between foes into the far turn but proved
empty in the drive. QUID tracked off the second flight inside rivals in the opening half, was prompted to gain some position nearing the far turn, then cam,e
up empty while racing in close quarters entering upper stretch. KENTUCKY GHOST tracked just off the pacesetter between foes to the backstretch and
faded after a half. ACCESSIBLE settled outside foes early and failed to menace. JOEY PADRINO tracked off the second flight just outside the eventual
winner in the opening stages, shifted out three wide nearing the far turn while being urged to advance but gave way abruptly nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
FUN AND GAMES broke readily to gain a position just off the leaders while under light rating racing to the turn, shifted three deep nearing upper stretch
readily advancing on those foes, took over, then went clear under steady pressure. RICHIE'S SISTER broke sharply, angled inwards setting the pace on a
narrow margin racing into the turn, was headed racing into upper stretch, proved no match when confronted by the winner but continued with a willing effort
to prevail for the place honors late. ODACHI, pinched back at the start, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out racing into
the lane and improved between foes to the end. THIRTY NINE SEVEN broke inwards making light contact with ODACHI, was held up last in the opening
stages, shifted out three deep gaining position nearing the lane, then shifted to the rail in late stages while missing for a share. LUNA AZTECA ducked out
at the start, was quickly righted, then urged to a position prompting a rival's pace racing well off the inside to the turn, pressed the issue to gain a brief lead
racing into upper stretch but emptied out late. THREE ILLUSIONS tracked off the second flight in early stages, shifted four wide racing into the lane but had
no closing bid. STERLING QUEEN tracked off the second flight inside foes racing to the turn but faded early.

Footnotes
LONG BLADE broke sharply, angled inwards prompting a rival's pace racing to the turn, edged forward leaving the midway point of the bend and came
under firm encouragement racing through the stretch to safe the late bit of MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE to prove best. The latter tracked off the second flight
outside a rival in the opening stages, shifted inwards entering the turn, split foes while being roused to advance on the winner entering upper stretch and
continued with a steady bid to close the gap while always only second best. I'M CARDINAL, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the leaders,
shifted out three deep leaving the midway point of the turn to bid for command in that path racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick while
prevailing for a share. COROT settled between foes in the opening stages, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued with late interest to
gain some position. TOTAL DISTRACTION tracked just off the leaders outside a rival racing to the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and
lacked the needed late bid. CLOUDED JUDGEMENT angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight racing to the turn and faded from contention
early. DAD'S YANKEES broke through the gate before the start, was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn and gave way into
the stretch. PHILOSOPHY dropped off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out three deep entering the stretch but had no closing bid. HALFBACK
proved no factor. TACO threw his head while breaking slowly losing position to the field, trailed throughout, then was vanned off the course following the
race.

DEMANDING, restless before loading in the gate temporarily dislodging his rider, broke readily, angled in sharply to prompt a rival's pace racing to the turn,
took over nearing upper stretch and responded to firm right handed encouragement to go clear in the closing stages. SAMMY'S TOWN, urged to dispute the
pace inside the eventual winner from the outset on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, dueled into upper stretch and proved only second best. CANDY
FOR ALL was settled last while angling inwards in the opening stages, came under some prompting to split foes racing into the turn, angled out four wide
nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to gain a share late. LANGUE LIEE broke inwards bumping, was righted to track just off the first flight three
deep between foes racing to the turn, shifted inwards continuing in pursuit to upper stretch but had no late kick. EARTHA, fractious in the gate, tracked the
leaders four wide in second flight racing to the turn, then faded between rivals in the final quarter. V K LEGACY, bumped at the start, was collected, then
prompted in brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes racing to the turn but soon emptied out. UNDERCOVER OUTLAW settled in the last flight three deep
between foes and offered no rally. DISCRIMANATION tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening quarter but faded early. GRANDMARY
tracked off the first flight along the inside, then between foes for three furlongs and emptied out racing through the turn. THIRSTYFORAMIRACLE dropped
out early.

POWER WALKER switched outside a rival attending the pace racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch and edged clear
late under firm encouragement. BUNSTER broke sharply, angled to the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin, dueled for command on the far turn into
the stretch but proved no match. GLOBAL ENTRY tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, was urged to advance three deep nearing the stretch
but finished evenly late. WICKED BOY tracked off the second flight outside foes in the opening half, shifted four wide racing into the lane and displayed
some late interest. ROUGH NIGHT, in touch three deep early, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch and weakened into the
stretch. DOUBLE DEEP tracked off the second flight along the inside but offered no rally. SHIDOSHI dropped out early. CROWN TO THE GOLD trailed
throughout. TOTAL TAP was scratched before the start after becoming fractious in the gate. ALMOREB was also scratched before the start after being
caught in the adjoining stall.
