Footnotes
GOING TO VEGAS pulled her way along inside then came out into the first turn, dueled outside the runner-up, took a short lead in upper stretch, inched
away under left handed urging in midstretch and won clear. TOO MUCH HEAVEN bobbled at the start, tugged her way to the early lead, angled in and set a
pressured pace inside, fought back leaving the second turn and into the stretch and held the place. DESTINY'S JOURNEY also tugged some early, stalked
three deep then off the rail, continued outside leaving the backstretch and off the inside on the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and edged a
rival for third. SABINOS PRIDE pulled between horses and steadied passing the wire the first time and again into the first turn, stalked between foes, fell
back some on the second turn, cut the corner into the stretch, remained inside and was outfinished for the show. ESTABLISH JUSTICE also pulled inside
and steadied into the first turn, saved ground stalking the pace, came out on the second turn then angled back in, came out again in upper stretch and was
in close off heels briefly, went between foes in the final furlong and lacked the needed rally. SUGAR PICKEL tugged her way outside then four wide into the
first turn, stalked three deep to the stretch and could not offer the necessary response.

PRINCIPE CARLO had speed off the rail then dueled outside a rival, took a short lead past midstretch and gamely prevailed under urging. DESSMAN broke
a bit slowly, went up between foes then stalked off the rail, came three deep into the stretch, drifted in from the whip past midstretch then came out and got
up for the place three wide on the line. GALILEAN also broke a bit slowly, went up inside to duel for the lead, fought back along the rail through the stretch
and was edged late for second. HEARTFULLOFSTARS stalked the pace between horses on the backstretch and turn, drifted to the inside in midstretch,
came out in deep stretch and was edged for the show between foes late. IT'S TIZ TIME was in a good position stalking the pace three deep to the stretch,
came out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ROGALLO angled in and saved ground stalking the pace, came out in upper stretch and could not
offer the necessary late response.

Footnotes
ORIGINAIRE (IRE) a bit slow to begin, angled in and settled inside then a bit off the rail, steadied and came out around the injured runner on the second
turn, entered the stretch three wide, bid outside the runner-up under a left handed crack of the whip to take the lead in midsretch and drew clear. NORTH
COUNTY GUY stalked a bit off the rail, tugged between horses in tight into the second turn, continued three deep leaving that turn and into the stretch,
gained the advantage into the stretch, battled inside the winner in midstretch and bested the others. WOUND TIGHT dueled between horses then outside a
rival, regained the lead leaving the second turn, drifted in some in the stretch and held clear for third. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) chased outside a rival,
went up five wide into the second turn, continued outside then four wide into the stretch and lacked a rally in the stretch. NEVER EASY chased inside then
outside a rival, split horses four wide into the second turn, continued between foes then three wide into the stretch and weakened. FORAY had good early
speed and dueled inside, fought back leaving the second turn and weakened. OISEAU DE GUERRE prompted the pace three deep then stalked off the rail,
was between foes into the second turn, was forced out by the injured runner while falling back on that turn and gave way. CHOSEN VESSEL saved ground
stalking the pace, took a bad step and was injured in the left front past the three eighths pole and was vanned off. The stewards conducted an inquiry into
the run on the far turn before ruling no other runner was responsible for the trouble to CHOSEN VESSEL.
