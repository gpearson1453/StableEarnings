MISS BOISTEROUS set the pace and held well under mild urging. MISS WINE TOPPER chased the pace, failed to rally despite steady left handed urging
and held for place. FICETY LADY held a good position inside, dropped back and shifted out on the turn, bid five wide, closed steadily and earned show.
BLUEGRASS BETTY got away alertly, raced mid pack, bid inside leaving the turn and didn't have enough late. TOCCALOT was never far back, went six
wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. EZ GIRL trailed the field and showed little.

Footnotes
BABY ROSE assumed command on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held well while ridden out. SUPAH SISTA advanced to the turn, swung seven
wide, closed once straightened and was gaining fast late. SPIRITA broke out, raced close to the pace, went six wide entering the stretch and lacked the
needed rally. TELL IT AGAIN broke slowly, advanced inside to the turn, angled out, bid five wide and hung. CALM DOWN LADY led to the turn, fell back,
weakened and faded from contention. MCFUN was not a factor. KOLOCHA broke slowly, trailed the field, went widest in the drive and showed little.
SPIRITA raced as AIM HAPPY.

TODO ES TORO came in at the gap, vied three wide, dueled through the stretch and prevailed in a game effort. ALL IN STEW OUI pressed the pace while
racing along the rail, dueled through the stretch and was outnodded to just miss. ROCKET SHIP raced close to the pace, went four wide entering the
stretch, closed steadily to threaten and didn't have enough late. MARICOPA COUNTY was pushed in at the gap, boxed in along the backstretch, angled out
on the turn, bid five wide and lacked the needed rally. COSA NOSTRA (IRE) broke awkwardly, raced in the back, put in a steady effort and did not threaten.
TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO led around the first turn, vied to the upper stretch, was steadied and dropped back. NO HARBOR IN SIGHT broke awkwardly,
was checked early, raced in the back and lacked a bid. Hand timed.

earned place under mild urging and was no match for the winner. WHO'S HOT was never far back and earned show under steady urging. VENDING
MACHINE raced inside and failed to respond. PRAYINTHEPRAIRIE went ten wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. MAC MCLOVIN showed some
early speed, swung nine wide entering the stretch and faded. KOE FACTS broke slowly, raced outside, went eleven wide at the top of the stretch and was
outrun. RAIDER RED raced inside and trailed the field. The fractional split of 45.13 was removed by Equibase.

Footnotes
THRASHER was never far off the pace, rallied around the turn, went five wide entering the stretch, assumed command and drew off under mild urging.
COOL HAND LUCAS raced in close, assumed command entering the turn, was outclosed and no match late. LINEMANS CHECK raced close to the pace,
bid inside on the turn, hung late and held for show. PARKING PERMIT advanced to the far turn to loom a threat, fell back and leveled off. MIGHTY MICK
stalked the pace while racing inside, was blocked entering the turn, dropped back and gave way. ITS A BOY was never far back, lacked a stretch response
and dropped back. PUBLIC ENEMY set the pace, stopped into the turn, was eased and walked off. EMPIRE WICKET was fractious at the start and lost his
rider. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made. Fractional splits unavailable. Hand timed.
