DANCING WILLARD advanced to pressure on the backside wresting a clear lead on the far turn, hooked on the inside in upper stretch found more drawing
out late. GIFT OF OAK tracked evenly giving a quick move on the far turn, drawing even abreast rival in upper stretch only to be turned away late. MISTER
MOBIL prompted the pace through the backside then weakened on the far turn traveling evenly down the lane which was enough to hold the others. KID
TEJANO slow early gained modestly five wide to upper stretch angling in a bit while finishing evenly. BELTON AVE played no factor. STREAKY worked the
early pace wearing out on the far turn. FAMILY JET raced mid pack fading on the far turn. GENERAL REMI raced wide to upper stretch tiring there.

Footnotes
PERFECTLY PLAIN pressed the pace extending abreast foe down the lane getting up gamely on the wire. IM NO SAINT pressed the pace shaking clear in
upper stretch being hooked from the outside late just missing. DIDDY DEW slow early rallied four wide down the lane finishing well. ASTRO ORBITER
pressed the pace to upper stretch weakening under a drive. POUR IT OUT pressed all out through the turn wilting in upper stretch. EMPTY TALK played no
factor. DUNNY BUG dropped back early. LAFLEUR was never involved. D K'S CANDY faded on the turn. ENGINE NUMBER NINE raced second flight
tiring in upper stretch.
