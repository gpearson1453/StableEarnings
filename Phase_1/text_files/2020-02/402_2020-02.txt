Footnotes
THESWEETESTTABOO took over past the seven eighths pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths,
contested the rail rounding the far turn and held off FLOATING BY, who settled off the pace toward the inside, started a three wide bid leaving the three
eighths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn but couldn't improve through the lane. VONDA settled off the early pace toward the inside, started a bid
nearing the three eighths pole but was hemmed in past the five sixteenths, recovered stride in the three path of the far turn and came along for third.
MAMMA DEE came away a bit slow then raced in the five path the opening turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride in the four path of
the far turn. RUN ON ENERGY saved ground off the pace then picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, though, faded into the far turn. SECRET
O'LIFE settled off the pace, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole then weakened leaving the far turn. HOPEFUL ANGEL trailed.

Footnotes
FIREBIRD gave chase through the backstretch and kept aim in the three path of the turn, dueled for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and raced clear
through later yards. KULANI gave chase from the three path and raced close through the turn, came in a path and had his heels clipped approaching the
sixteenth pole, but dug in from there to take second the final yards. LUCKY NED PEPPER accelerated to the lead nearing the three eighths pole and set a
pressured pace, raced at the rail through the turn but was caught inside the sixteenth pole. PAGAN SMART chased the pace off the rail then checked to
avoid a fallen rider nearing the sixteenth pole and was not encouraged further. INDUS VALLEY MAN led most of the opening three sixteenths of a mile then
gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened stride. A LITTLE BANGED UP gave chase from the outside, rounded the
turn in the six path and raced widest through the lane. WILLIE THE WHALE gave chase from the two and three paths then tripped and fell over a fallen rider
nearing the sixteenth pole. BOPPIN BOB chased the pace inside but was shut off and clipped the heels of Kulani and host his rider nearing the sixteenth
pole. A stewards inquiry resulted in the disqualification of Kulani to sixth place for coming across the path of Boppin Bob which also affected the path of
Willie The Whale, both of which walked off the course

Footnotes
FRANKIE DOTS raced well back from early contention then steadily progressed leaving the nine sixteenths pole, dueled close off the rail rounding the far
turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch then drew clear and held on well. CANTAKEITANYMORE raced well back saving early ground then eased out into the
backstretch, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, improved in the three path of the far turn then dug in through the lane to take second later yards.
GIANT DREAMS stalked the early pace two deep and moved to even terms post the three quarter pole, took the nod into the backstretch, came under
pressure leaving the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the tail then gave up the lead and weakened the final sixteenth. EDDY DIRT settled off the pace
and off the rail, bid leaving the half mile pole, raced in the four path of the far turn and showed little more. CRAZED settled off the pace and off the rail, bid
leaving the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn. CHARITABLE MARK saved ground off the pace and showed little response through the
backstretch. GOTHAM BOY raced well back while mostly saving ground. WATSON rated a slim early lead and was met at even terms past the three quarter
pole, gave up the lead into the backstretch then faded past the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
ONTHESTRAITANARROW settled back off the rail then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide, dug in for the lead mid-stretch
and raced clear later yards. SIENTE EL VIENTO raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail then dug in at the rail through the stretch to take second inside the sixteenth pole. MORGAN COUNTY stalked the pace toward the inside, bid
leaving the three eighths pole, was blocked mid-stretch though finished evenly. SILVER CASTLE angled to the inside to rate the pace, dug in at even terms
to the challenge of Cast The Lot leaving the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms to the top of the stretch then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
SCOTTISH MAN settled close in the three path then bid from the seven sixteenths pole and raced four wide on the far turn before flattening stride.
COMPROMISO was never a factor. CAST THE LOT angled in to stalk the early pace and challenged at even terms from the three eighths pole, took the
nod past the quarter pole and raced with the edge through the far turn then continued close through the upper stretch but was eased inside the sixteenth
pole. CAPITAL ASSET was not a factor.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN MACHEN stalked the pace then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear
approaching the top of the lane and held on well under steady handling. TRANQUIL BLUE settled off the pace and off the rail then eased out into the
backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn three wide then dueled for second mid-stretch. HARD BEING ME settled back saving
early ground then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and was just up for third.
MOONLIT NIGHT rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, gave up the nod at the rail midway on the far turn then
dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. GOLDEN APPEAL settled just off the pace in the two and three paths then bid nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. CHAMPAGNE JAM rounded the first turn in the three and four paths and raced outside into the
backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the four path of the far turn. CANDY MAN ONE rated off the pace inside, faded through the
backstretch and was eased the final quarter mile.

RUSH TO THE CASTLE stalked the pace then dueled for the lead two deep nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled through the stretch to hold on. CAYENNE CREEK settled off the pace in the four path the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. WINDSORS FOR IT raced off the pace then bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened stride down the lane. SILVER TAURUS raced well off the pace and entered the
backstretch outside, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the four path toward the head of the lane and passed some
faders. CLASSY CROSSING raced well back saving early ground then angled to the six path on the far turn and passed some rivals widest. SIR
LONGWOOD saved ground the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch and showed little response. SUNBRIDLED was never a factor. ROCK ON
rated the pace inside and was pressured leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up control approaching the five sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the

Footnotes
LION LORD stalked the pace off the rail the first turn then took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced clear past the pole, came under
pressure from the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and held well under steady encouragement. HOBE SOUND rounded the opening turn in the
four path then raced outside into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path, finished evenly and was
gaining mildly. JEFFERY SCOTT saved ground well off the pace then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and was along
to take third later yards. PHILLY COMPLETELY raced well back off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and angled to the seven path on
the far turn then passed some rivals through the lane. POTENTIAL GRIZZLY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the
three path of the far turn and showed little more. BACOLI settled off the early pace in the three and four paths then bid nearing the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn off the rail then weakened. I IDOLIZE YOU stalked the pace in the three path then gave chase from the three eighths pole, though,
faded at the rail rounding the far turn. THE RED SHIELD was not a factor. POPLAR AVENUE hustled to the lead while angling to the inside, was caught
nearing the seven sixteenths pole and faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
PAXOS stalked the pace off the rail then challenged into the backstretch, dueled close two deep on the far turn, took the lead mid-stretch and just lasted
under all out encouragement. BLIMEY LIMEY raced well off the pace saving early ground then eased out into the backstretch, started a bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced five wide on the far turn, dug in through the lane to gain steadily on the winner then just missed. OFFSHORE TRIP angled to
the inside to rate the pace, was met at even terms into the backstretch, dug in with the edge from that point but was caught nearing the sixteenth pole and
flattened stride later yards. ODDS R AGAINST US settled well back about the three path the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, angled to the
outside leaving the far turn and passed rivals through the lane. MY PEOPLE SING saved ground into the opening turn then bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened stride down the lane. STRAPHANGER saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. AJWIBAH raced well back in the four path and never factored. HARASAN was not a factor. RUN
BANNER loaded reluctantly and rounded the opening turn in the four path, then gave way after a half mile. HOORAY HENRY was through early.
