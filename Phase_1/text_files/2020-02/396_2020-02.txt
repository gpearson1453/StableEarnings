Footnotes
SOLITARY GEM remained forwardly placed after a good start, stalked the pace primarily from the three path on the turn and while between opponents,
challenged in earnest coming into the stretch, fought its way to the front end during the ensuing furlong, kept going well and edged away. OK HONEY raced
as a pace factor four to three wide on the turn, got let loose spinning into the lane, was staved off yet mustered up a touch of willingness nevertheless
securing second. LOOKBOTHWAYS cut over to the inside route in short order, chased the pace within striking distance, scurried along the rail issuing a
challenge for the top at the midway point of the turn, was forced to fend off a twosome to the outside after gaining a narrow advantage, was still feeling their
pressure entering the stretch, relinquished soon afterwards then weakened into the show slot. SISTER ALEXA dove over to the rail at the top of the
backstretch, stayed put until the end of the bend, was maneuvered into the five path during the first half of the stretch run, finished a non-threatening fourth.
MOVIE SCORE established the top shortly after the field had been sent off and running, showed the way towards the two path, had no answer when
challenged by LOOKBOTHWAYS in the vicinity of the three-eighths pole, surrendered then backed away steadily. OUR TICKET pursued the pacesetter two
to three wide on the turn, came under stronger handling after halfway around the bend, shifted into path four from upper to midstretch, had no response.
TEQUILA SUNDAY stumbled badly at the start, was moved to the outside after recovering, departed the backstretch from the four path, never made its
presence felt.

Footnotes
MASTER OF HOPE brushed the near side stall at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge and take command just inside
the eighth pole, dug in and held on from a late challenge nearing the finish. HALO CITY five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked two to
three wide through the turn, remained patiently handled and spun just off the inside for home, dug in between rivals in behind PURE WOW to the eighth
pole, angled out inside that station passing on a gap between the top pair to head out to the five or six path, then surged late outside of MASTER OF HOPE
to miss at the end. PURE WOW showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, got let out spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, kept on to secure the show honors. TONAL VISION brushed at the start
by ARIMA who broke outwards, chased three wide until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into
upper stretch and offered no response. COMMON COURTESY four wide in closest aim of the leader down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through
the turn, got set down spinning three wide for home, weakened in the final eighth. ARIMA broke out at the start brushing TONAL VISION, chased just off the
inside down the backstretch and through the turn under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. CHEROKEE SONG
chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail into the turn, got ridden along three furlongs out, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
GETOFFMYBACK put to feverish urging upon springing from the gate, beat an equally feverishly- ridden LEAP TO GLORY for control, cut over towards the
inside, showed the way spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, edged away from the competition during the latter stages of the run around the bend,
came up to the three-sixteenths pole and got asked for more, offered up the desired response and kicked further clear. O SHEA CAN U SEE went on to
save ground for nearly a half after breaking approximately a half beat the tardiest, was tipped into the two path at the head of the stretch, rallied for the
place, although accomplished without posing a danger to the top one. LIAM LETS GO alternated between the inside route and path two during the event,
was more the former coming into the lane, lacked the necessary response. ROYAL ASSET three wide onto the turn, was fanned out into the five path
exiting it, made no headway. DEEP SEA pursued the pace two wide on the turn, shifted to the outside after entering the turn until about six wide, failed to
make any impact. MAJESTIC AFFAIR pulled early tracking the winner from the pocket, angled three wide for the drive home, gave way. LEAP TO GLORY
gunned out of the gate, was out-hustled by the eventual winner, chased that rival two to three wide on the turn, got re-roused in the general area of the
five-sixteenths pole, went four wide into the stretch, folded.

SOBERSICK N SORRY four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting
out under a near sided stick a furlong from home, rallied to take command seventy yards from the finish and inched away to the wire. BASSMAN DAVE
prompted the pace of RUNNING VIOLENCE from the outside three then two wide, took over narrow command inside the five-sixteenths, got let out spinning
just off the inside for home, dug in inching away under a drive to the eighth pole, got caught seventy yards from the finish while along safe for the place
honors. NO MORE MIRACLES chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the
show honors. CAUSE FOR APPLAUSE chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered
up a mild kick. PRETERNATURAL five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. TALENT SCOUT coaxed from the gate, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn placed to
coaxing three furlongs from home, went four wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. OUR AMERICAN STAR coaxed from the start, chased two to three
wide until tucked inside at the half mile pole, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. RUNNING VIOLENCE hustled from the gate,
showed the way coaxed along in the two path through swift splits under pressure from BASSMAN DAVE to the outside, got headed for command inside the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. ALRAHAAL bobbled at the break, chased three wide coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled six
wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
INFORMATIVE displayed no lasting ill effects after bobbling at the start, settled into midpack, travelled two to three wide on the turn, was forced to bide
time, stuck in traffic beginning from midpoint on the turn, stepped into the lane, still stuck in the same predicament, patiently drafted behind opponents,
tipped into the four path and into clearance right around the eighth pole, responded when given his cue and closed in on the ones to catch, got engaged in a
late duel with CONTINUATION, bested that foe after a spirited tussle to prove best. CONTINUATION took up the chase towards path four on the turn, was
slightly nearer the rail once the stretch action began, forged past STRIKING SPEED with just under a furlong to go, was still involved with that rival when the
top one arrived on the scene about a sixteenth later, vied with vigour against the fresh challenger, came up the one to be denied. STRIKING SPEED
disputed the pace from the two path, was called upon for the drive home, got headed by the second place finisher in midstretch, fought for another sixteenth
before weakening into the show slot. BREITHORN was coaxed along on the chute to cement itself to a prominent position, disputed the pace three wide for
nearly three-quarters, stepped into the lane, kept up its pursuit to the eighth pole and gave way. JUDICIAL RESTRAINT devoid of any early foot, brought up
the pack, was sighted on the inside route and under the whip by the half mile pole, was being roused heading home, gradually moved out into the path three
rallyong mildly for a minor piece of the pot. BETTS strung out three wide on the turn, lacked a solid closing punch. WARFRONT FIGHTER nestled in and
amongst rivals early, checked as the first fraction was being finalized, slipped back a bit in time to begin the run around the bend from the four path, angled
one wider into the lane, had no rally. SIXTEEN TONS forwardly placed along the rail for nearly three-quarters, faltered. FIAT LUX sent over to the rail at the
half mile pole, failed to menace.

SUMMER BOURBON broke out at the start bumping and squeezing back STONE BREAKER in tandem with THESIS who broke inwards, raced four then
three wide in aim of the leader applying some pressure, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command outside the eighth pole,
then edged away to the finish kept to task. THESIS broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back STONE BREAKER in concert with the aforementioned
foe, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the place honors in the late stages.
SUDDEN SURPRISE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under growing pressure from a pair to the outside, got put to
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in and was collared just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late
going while preserving the show honors. MO DIDDLEY coaxed from the start, raced five then four wide in aim of the leader, came under coaxing three
furlongs out, cornered five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BLUE BELT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and paused when getting in tight in behind and to the inside of SUDDEN
SURPRISE with a sixteenth to go, altered out late unable to recover from the shuffle. H MAN chased along the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. STONE BREAKER got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was
squeezed at the start getting away last and conceding about three lengths to the front, chased three to four wide, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SICILIA MIKE got going after an abbreviated hand ride out of the starting gate, was in the two path in pursuit of the front runners on the turn, swung to the
outside for the drive home, completed the maneuver approximately five wide, kicked into his best as the run through the furlong grounds was ending,
hitched up to the ones to catch a sixteenth later, forged to the front in the final seventy yards after out-fighting a pair to his inside and edged away. CLENCH
lost its footing springing from the starting gate, took up position from just off the rail, stayed within striking distance for the opening half, got cued up angling
four wide into the lane narrowed in, find himself as the middle member of a three-way tussle for the top beginning in the general area of the sixteenth pole,
showed willingness to the end but couldn't match strides with the winner late. MORNING BREEZ away without apparent mishap, saw the pilot take hold
coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, got tipped into the three path at the half mile pole, went into the stretch about as wide, vied for the
advantage versus two others, emerged at the furlong narrowly ahead, held out until about a sixteenth to go, all the while still having to fend off two rivals,
before weakening into the show slot. DARK MONEY sparred for the top from path two, was forced to go about its task from between rivals as the half was
being completed, kept at it until the vicinity of the sixteenth pole then gave out. BLINDWILLIE MCTELL saved ground to the quarter pole, got spotted in the
two path at the top of the lane, lacked an offering. READY TO ESCAPE gained the advantage shortly after the field had been released, cleared over to the
rail at the top of the turn, showed the way, pressed by DARK MONEY to the outside, came under heavier pressure as the half was being completed,
succumbed soon afterwards then steadily backed away.

just off the inside for home, rallied tipping out at the three-sixteenths to the three path, issued a challenge through the final furlong collaring the top pair
inside the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish to prevail. SECRET RULES dueled inside of JOHNNY RITT from the get go widening away as a
pair early on before the field took closer order through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in clinging
to the front knocking heads through to the sixteenth pole, got collared by the top one inside that station and ran on to safely secure the place honors.
JOHNNY RITT broke in at the start bumping OLD CHESTNUT and pinching that rival out against MONTAUK TRAFFIC, came under coaxing and dueled

drive continuing the duel through the stretch fighting on until shaken off inside the final sixteenth and was along safe for the show honors. OLD CHESTNUT

Footnotes
VALID QUEST attained a forward position along the backstretch, was well rated in the two path within range of the front runners during the run around the
bend, tipped one path farther off the inside and got turned loose spinning into the stretch, out-fought a pair of opponents to his inside to emerge at the eighth
pole as the new leader, kept going well and drew clear. BRONZE LION was moved over to the inside route after the start, showed the way feeling some
pressure from the outside, was put to a drive a short distance from the end of of the bend, stepped into the lane as the innermost of three arguing for the
top, saw the winner take over, stayed on well enough to salvage second. OUR TROUBADOUR at a considerable distance from off the inside throughout, sat
parked out five wide on the turn, was about as wide getting driven into the lane, went on to secure the show. CHIRICAHUA stalked the pace mostly from
path three, was slightly closer to rail challenging for the top as the half was being completed, battled from between foes over the course of the next furlong,
wasn't up to the task and backed away. BETA four wide on the turn, lacked the needed response. LASTLOOKATTHECAT three wide entering the turn, was
more in the four path exiting it, mildly improved. FIVE EIGHTEEN took up the chase from the two path, got steered into path three for the drive home, had
no rally. CARNEGIE SONG four wide at the top of the turn, was never in it. CONCRETE JUNGLE vied two to three wide early and folded. MO LIGHTNING
came in sharply at the start, settled along the inside route, responded to some light encouragement to take up residence in midpack, got called upon
crossing the midway point on the turn, appeared to have little left a furlong down the road, strolled to the outside at the head of the stretch, then venturing
onward under a protective hold, was allowed to fade away.
