Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL COMMAND chased the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to the stretch, pushed past JAMASON nearing mid stretch and held under steady
urging. JAMASON set the pace from the rail, turned back LUCKY TWICE into the stretch but was collared by the winner then just saved second.
DARTMOOR stalked the pace to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then finished steadily inside and was nipped for the place. BLUES RAPPER broke
slow and lost about three lengths to begin, pushed up to close that gap to the turn, raced two then three wide to the stretch and finished willingly to the line.
LUCKY TWICE pressed the pace outside of JAMASON, tried to engage that one mid turn but was outkicked to the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
MIGHTY CHAMP had no speed and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MOON ROCKET set the pace to the second turn, saved ground and dueled to mid stretch then dug in gamely to hold on. MY IDOL pressed the winner to
the second turn, bid two wide while between rivals, dueled through the length of the stretch and just missed. WAVERLY WAY had no speed, settled to the
second turn, raced two wide to the stretch then was finishing in a rally. PRIVATE KITTY prompted the winner to the half, bid three wide and dueled to mid
stretch then tired. SURE MAGIC was fanned four wide to the backstretch, tracked to the second turn, came three wide to the stretch but lacked the needed
late response. WHY ARE U SO SWEET was five wide on the first turn, trailed to the half then gave out after five furlongs.

Footnotes
LACEY'S RAINBOW broke a step slow and was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out, rallied when set down and caught HAMMY
TIME for a dead heat. HAMMY TIME chased the pace to the turn, was three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front and edged away to mid stretch then dug
in but was tagged for a dead heat. IT GIRL also was away and bit slow, had no speed and lagged two wide to the stretch then found her best stride and
closed fast but was too late. SARAZONA TWO hustled to the contest the pace from the rail to the stretch, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened.
NINNAVEE dueled outside of SARAZONA TWO and two wide to the stretch but tired after being collared in upper stretch.

UNUSUALLY GREEN was unhurried to the half, bid three then four wide to the stretch then rallied to the front and held driving. GET LIKE ME pressed the
pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, got to terms then was outfinished for the win. TAELYNS PRINCE settled for a half, raced off the rail on
the second turn then finished willingly to tag AZTEC WARRIOR for the show. AZTEC WARRIOR chased the pace to the second turn, saved ground and
rallied to the stretch, loomed boldly inside to mid stretch but was bested in the late stages. SMOKED TOO MANY hustled to the front, set the pace two wide
for six furlongs then was overtaken and tired. POCKET PRINCE trailed to the second turn then saved ground to no avail. OOPPER WALLAH had no speed,
was three wide on both turns then weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
UNLAWFUL ACT never far back to the second turn, bid two wide to the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive and closed steadily to wear down GRAY
GEM late. GRAY GEM pressed the leader to the second turn, moved up to engage for the lead two wide to the stretch, edged clear to mid stretch then could
not stall the winner. TORO DE TORO was also well placed to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and finished
evenly. MAGIC RATE had no speed, saved ground to the stretch but could not offer the needed late response. RED CLEM had no speed and was never a
threat. JOURNEY TO RUN was allowed to settle to the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn but weakened in the drive. GIANT MARK hustled to the
front, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs then was overtaken and tired.
