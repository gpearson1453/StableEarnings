NO NO NO lunged at the start, went to the front, drove clear and was kept to the task. BUY ME THE RING void of early speed, made a late bid, proved no
match for the winner, but was a clear second. GIVEN KISSES pressed the pace, raced close throughout and proved third best. SELENE'S ARGUMENT
raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no factor. SHE'S SEVENTEEN was an early factor, saved
ground around the turn and weakened. EMILY'S PEGASUS raced within contention and faded. FINDING VALUE raced evenly near the back and was never
a threat. BLONDIE LOX BABE always raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
SHES OUR FASTEST stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up around the final turn, took the lead entering the stretch, drove clear and held on well
for the win. SEEDS OF TIME unhurried in the beginning, racing evenly in the middle of the pack, made a late bid and was gaining on SHES OUR
FASTEST. OPERATIC lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide and gained ground. SMOK'N RITA void of early speed, came around the
second turn on the outside, moved up and finished evenly. PERFECT REINS broke in, raced near the back in the early part, moved up, but was no factor.
BLUE SUADE GUITAR bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. SUMMER'S INDY dueled for the early lead, drove
clear and faded. REACHREACHREACH challenged for the early lead and was finished early. FOOL'S PARADISE void of early speed and was never close.
BEST KEPT SECRET showed early speed and retreated to the rear.
