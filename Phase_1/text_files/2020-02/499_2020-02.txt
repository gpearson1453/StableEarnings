GALERIO tracked the early pace two wide, sped to the front in hand nearing the five-sixteenths pole then drew off under a drive in the lane. VERO SUN
settled off the pace while racing two wide, came three wide into the lane, continued on his left lead in the lane, drifted in and rallied for the place. SEA
GHOST led early, dropped back inside nearing the turn, stayed at the rail and lacked a rally. KUKULKAN disputed the early pace two wide, cleared nearing
the turn, set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out and gave way readily.

Footnotes
PRANK CALL stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, seized command near the quarter pole and drove clear. FENDER BABY was reluctant to load,
broke in a tangle, rushed up between rivals to set the pace in the two path, was collared near the quarter pole, drifted out and lasted for the place.
SLEWZER raced off the pace three wide between foes, edged closer around the turn and lacked the needed rally. JOYFUL NOISE broke a bit awkwardly,
steadied near the half-mile pole, was ridden along to advance two wide between foes around the turn then flattened out in the lane. MY T TALK lacked early
speed, raced four wide around the turn and came up empty in the lane. LADY KIM chased the pace from the rail and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
REFLECT vied inside of OLIVE KAT down the backstretch, rated back nearing the three-eighths pole, re-bid two wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole and
quickly drew off under a drive. OLIVE KAT set a pressured pace outside of the winner down the backstretch, angled in when that rival took back nearing the
three-eighths pole, could not match strides inside of that rivals from the five-sixteenths marker but held well to be clearly second best. OUR STAR saved
ground off the pace, tipped out in uppers stretch, angled back in leaving the three-sixteenths pole and was along for the show. HENDAYA chased the pace
three wide, angled in in upper stretch and faded. TRULY HOT raced two wide in midpack, steadied off heels leaving the three-sixteenths pole, shifted further
out and lacked a bid. HEATHERLY was outrun inside. DOCUMENTED trailed two wide.

Footnotes
D C FIREMAN led early, was content to settle back and stalk two and three wide, seized command in upper stretch and drove clear. FUGIWHARA was
devoid of speed, raced two wide and rallied through the lane. JUSTIN FRONT tracked the pace outside of the winner in the three and four paths, had a mild
bid in upper stretch but flattened out. DISTILLED SPIRIT was hustled to the front, set the pace off the rail and weakened through the lane. FIVE CARD
DRAW saved ground in midpack, was hard ridden around the turn and lacked a serious response. TOTAL ACCESS trailed inside.
