lacked early speed, advanced between rivals two wide around the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued on her left lead in the lane, rallied
outside and gained second in the final strides. R TRUE SENSATION set a clear pace in the two path and led to deep stretch. CROSSINGTHEVALLEY
trailed the field four wide, angled in to the two path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. TRAFFICPLAN chased the pace from the rail and came up empty
in the lane. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM had only brief speed three wide.

Footnotes
SINCERE MAN took over soon after the break, set a rated pace two wide, turned away a threat from FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY leaving the five sixteenths,
responded to pressure into the lane, kept on under left handed encouragement in mid stretch and held firm. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY saved ground, gained
and angled out past the five sixteenths, had aim three wide into the stretch, went evenly through the final furlong but was well clear of the rest. BOURBON
AGOGO chased the winner three wide, shifted in for the drive and gave way grudgingly. INSPIRED OPTIONS broke slowly then ducked in towards the gap,
recovered to be well back early, swung five wide nearing the stretch but lacked a serious kick. GOTTAWAY chased two wide, shifted in and faded. LATE
NIGHT FANTASY steadied after the break, was hustled along three to four wide mid turn and gave way. DETERMINED PURSUIT broke awkwardly and to
the inside, steadied soon after, corrected and moved up wide nearing the half mile marker, chased briefly then retreated past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
WAR TWEET saved ground advancing under rating leaving the five eighths, tracked patiently mid turn, angled four wide into the lane, closed in under left
handed rousing, took command a furlong out, kicked clear and held firm while kept to task. BEARING SECRETS broke a step slow, angled out early, moved
up wide and under some rating past the half mile marker, circled into the stretch, closed steadily and gained the place in the final yards. ORTINOLA
disputed the pace two to three wide outside NEVISIAN SUNSET, took over from that one in upper stretch, drifted in battling past mid stretch and faded.
NEVISIAN SUNSET took over inside rivals early on, set a pressured pace while towards the inside, dueled into the lane and weakened late.
KEENEASABEAN , in close when brushed at the break, lagged off the pace and failed to recover. WORDS OF A FEATHER settled inside, moved up mid
turn, had aim entering the lane, failed to kick on and weakened in the final three sixteenths. ACIANO rated back from between foes leaving the chute,
stalked the pace off the rail, came under pressure around the turn, failed to kick on and faltered before going six furlongs.

CHASING THE CANDY set the pace along the rail and drew off under a drive in the lane. LECTRIC CHOKE lagged well back two wide, advanced between
rivals around the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside, had the rider lose the whip near the eighth pole and continued on willingly to gain
the place. FIVE STAR PERFECT was fractious in the starting gate, raced well back while saving ground, tipped two wide in upper stretch and rallied for the
show. THUNDER GRUNDER prompted the winner two wide and weakened through the final furlong. VICTORY GIVEN stalked the pace three wide and
came up empty in the lane. TIGER ROAD saved ground and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
PARADISE PRIDE settled off the early duel while removed from the rail, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled four to five wide into the lane,
rallied to command heading towards the eighth pole, responded to right handed rousing and eagerly drew out through the final seventy yards. ROBBER
BOB chased the leaders two to three wide, shifted out a bit wider and moved up behind rivals in upper stretch, briefly steadied off heels, angled in some and
kept on willingly while saving the place. SUPERCROSS had speed then eased back off the leading pair, dropped back under some pressure while saving
ground mid turn, angled out for the drive, found more through the final furlong and rallied between foes. CREATED SPECIAL dueled outside
ANTAGONIZER, held a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, wandered outward soon into the lane, straightened to remain a presence past mid stretch, drifted
out some late and faded. JOHNNY JIGGLE , off slowly after breaking outward and bumping with a rival, lagged well back while off the inside and attempting
to get out, was under pressure mid turn, circled well wide into the lane and had belated interest. HARP OF GOLD , bumped at the break, raced off the pace
while two wide, angled out some in the stretch and had a mild response. DAY OF HONOR broke a step slow, was hustled up soon after, pursued and faded.
ANTAGONIZER was sent up early and joined the pace fray to the inside of CREATED SPECIAL, sparred with that one to upper stretch then tired with a
furlong remaining.

proved a resurgent winner inside of her stablemate. JUMPING MICHELLE was bumped at the start, bid four wide into the turn, took the lead three deep
nearing the quarter pole, battled outside past the eighth pole but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. SEXYAMA dueled between foes to upper stretch and

Footnotes
HAND RAIL dueled inside rivals, held a short advantage around the turn, spurted clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under right handed rousing past
mid stretch and held sway. LADY ROZINA drafted back off the contested pace while saving some ground, moved closer mid turn, swung five wide for the
drive and finished well to gain. CHICKEN DINNER had speed between foes then was eased back off the leaders nearing the turn, was put to a ride past the
three eighths, eased out and had clear sailing into the stretch, moved up a bit between runners then flattened out late. EIGHT OAKS bobbled at the break,
recovered and pulled her way between foes to contest the pace, battled outside the winner around the turn and into the lane then gave way through the final
furlong. AMERICAN STAR was hung out five wide while forcing the pace, dropped back around the turn and came up empty. LADY LOOSE had speed
between foes, pressed the pace three deep mid turn, drifted to the four path entering the stretch and gave way.
