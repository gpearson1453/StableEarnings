between and faded. MISS ELLIE'S GIRL took up sharply at the break, raced five wide in the lane never threatened.

Footnotes
RETROFIT set all the pace and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. XAVIER DAVEY stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide
through the lane and finished second best. FANTASTIC WARRIOR pressed the pace and weakened a bit late. E LEE dropped back early, raced along the
inside through the stretch and never was a serious threat. COMO SE LLAMA stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no response.
DRAMA COACH stalked the pace and weakened along the inside. REAL FAST MUSIC saved ground and never was a factor. SAMMY WONDER STONE
was off slowly and never threatened. LIL' QUARTER CHUTE showed little.
