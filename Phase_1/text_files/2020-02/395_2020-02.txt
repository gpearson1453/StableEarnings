led to quarter pole but proved no match for the winner. RONAN raced evenly with no late response when needed. SPECIAL CONQUEST bumped start with
no speed, rallied up late in the stretch. GREEN GARNET bothered start, no speed and failed to threaten in the stretch run. LA DAMA pressed leader to the
half, dueled past quarter pole while used up and weakened in the drive. YOU PEOPLE bothered start, made an outside move at the quarter pole but used
up and flattened out through the stretch. TIZ STELLA bothered start and never menaced. JR'S JOY through after half, faded back.

ELI'S COMING speed inside to the front, shook free turn, drew off in the drive. HOLY BOLY outside speed, chased winner throughout, no match while best
of the rest. SOUTHERN HUMOR unhurried to turn outside with a five run run for show. JACK SPARROW went to nose start, lost best chance, moved up
widest. PADDY JANE no speed to the stretch, improved position only late. WHY STOP NOW battled up front briefly, weakened in the stretch run. SEA
NOBLE saved ground throughout, gave way at quarter pole. IRON AGE close up to the turn, gave way readily from there. DIAL MR PROSPECTOR never
menaced.

enough for place in the final stages. IRON MIKE set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch and faltered in the late
stages. POPCORN FOR EDDIE raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane, was put in tight and checked hard nearing the sixteenth pole but
moved up late. CORBIN was unhurried early on, raced in the five path into the lane with a belated gain in the stretch run. HARLAN'S VADOR (ARG) raced

Footnotes
OXUM POWER was taken out by LAS RAMBLAS at the start and raced far back early on, was in the three path into the lane, altered to the inside down the
lane with a late bid while full of run, drove past the leader and cleared the field in the final stages. LAS RAMBLAS was out of control at the start and
bothered multiple foes, chased the early pace, was in the four path into the lane, made a late bid three wide in the stretch and was up for place at the wire.
SWANAGE dueled early on, was off the rail into the lane, inched clear in the stretch but yielded late and lost place at the wire. MY GOOD GIRL was
bumped and bothered at the start, raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run.
MAGGIE'S MONARCH chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE was bothered
at the start and was done early. SHELLEY'S GEM dueled early on, was off the rail into the lane and folded up in the stretch run.
