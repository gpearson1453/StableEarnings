Footnotes
U S LAWMAN bumped both sides at the start, chased thee deep up the backstretch, two to three wide leaving the bend, chased the winner through the
drive and closed late to get up in the final strides. OUR MANEKI CAT stumbled at the start but quickly jumped to the lead, set the pace clear and took
control of the rail, held a comfortable advantage into the stretch and continued to clear to the sixteenth pole but was overtaken by the winner in the closing
moments. RADIO TIM settled off the pace, saved ground along the inside, shifted out in the stretch and rallied to earn the show. HEAT THINGS UP chased
from the inside, saved ground and cut the corner into the lane but finished evenly through the final sixteenth. VERMEER broke out and bumped rival then
bumped from the inside as well, unhurried after and raced off the rail, raced to wide then angled out into the four path and lacked a rally. NAHOY bumped at
the start, chased four deep up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and weakened. BRAGGART shifted out and bumped rival at the start, between
foes in the early going, exited the turn three wide and tired.

MALIBU BAY broke out and bumped rival, sent for the lead and cleared the field, showed the way in the two path to the stretch, challenged by SEATTLE
ENCOUNTER in the final sixteenth and held gamely. SEATTLE ENCOUNTER stalked from the inside early, angled out and came three wide into the
stretch, rallied outside the leader in deep stretch but could not get by. SPEEDY RIDE knocked into rival at the start, settled off the rail, traveled four wide into
the stretch and flattened in the late stages. RAW DIAMOND off the rail in the early going, five wide nearing the turn, angled to the inside and saved ground
into the lane and lacked a response when called upon. ULTIMATE SHILO bumped at the start, tracked from off the rail, exited the turn three wide and never
rallied.
