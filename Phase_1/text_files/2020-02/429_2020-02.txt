Footnotes
TACTICAL QUALITY angled to the rail in the opening stages tracking the leaders from well out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, steadily
gathered momentum advancing in tandem with a rival racing into the far turn, split foes nearing the quarter mile marker, then angled inside the pacesetter to
challenge for command along the rail, contested the issue to late stages and narrowly prevailed in time under firm encouragement. OSVALDO tracked the
pace outside the eventual winner under light rating in the opening half, advanced in tandem with that foe shifting out three deep nearing upper stretch,
pressed the issue to late stages but was just outkicked. MULLED WINE, forwardly placed outside the pacesetter racing to the first turn, was taken in hand
momentarily while shifting out conceding position to a rank foe nearing the backstretch, tracked just off the leaders along the inside through the backstretch,
was prompted to split foes to gain command racing into the far turn, dueled between the top pair into upper stretch, couldn't match those rivals but continued
with interest to hold a rival for a share on the wire. CIRCLE AWAY settled last to the far turn, was prompted to advance on the second bend, shifted out four
wide racing into the stretch and continued evenly while just missing for a share. WELD broke through the gate before the start, was collected by the outrider
and re-saddled prior to loading, broke sharply, sped to the lead along the inside to the backstretch, dueled inside foes into the far turn but quickly came up
empty. FLASHTOUR, off a bit slowly, was urged along the inside to gain contention in the opening sixteenth, pulled his way to terms with the pacesetter
splitting foes racing through the first turn while rank under restraint, prompted the pacesetter to the far turn, drifted out and quickly gave way.

Footnotes
NORTHERN angled to the inside while rated off the first flight tracking the pace into the turn, shifted out three deep nearing midstretch to split foes and
continued with a steady late bid to wrest the advantage in time under firm left handed encouragement. DEFICIT HAWK broke readily, vied for command
between foes prompting the pace, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch and continued grudgingly to maintain the advantage to late stages
while just failing to contain the winner. JOHNNY U was urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, dueled into upper stretch and yielded late.
JUNCTION tracked just off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, then continued willingly into the stretch to narrow the gap in the closing stages.
TARTAN THE BULL joined the pace three deep racing through the backstretch prompting the leaders, continued in that path to upper stretch and gave way.
WING AND WHEEL, restless in the gate just before the break, dwelt at the start losing position to the field and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

QUEENS EMBRACE was rated out of contention while angling to the inside in the opening three furlongs, switched outside foes readily gaining position
three deep nearing the far turn, continued under patient handling on the second bend, angled inside the leaders to challenge for command when presented
an opening racing into upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm left handed encouragement. SUGAR FIX was rated just off the
leaders while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out racing into the far turn readily advancing on the pacesetter, gained the advantage
from that foe entering upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. JACKIES DREAM angled to the inside to track off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out racing into the lane and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. WICKED WITCH, reserved last to the backstretch,
advanced inside rivals racing into the stretch while just missing for a share. MATINEE GIRL broke sharply, set the pace on a clear margin along the rail to
the far turn, shifted out while being roused to resist a rival's bid but gave way midstretch. LITTLE MARIA tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight,
shifted out four wide racing into the lane and steadily faded. WOWEE ducked out at the start, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing stalking just off
the pacesetter, made brief pursuit of that foe racing to the far turn but quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
COCKTAILS OR CANDY tracked just off the leaders while angling to the rail nearing the turn, came through inside foes to challenge for command nearing
upper stretch and went clear under pressure. BONSAI BENNY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing off the rail to the turn, dueled
between foes into upper stretch but proved second best. C. A. C. CHAQUIRA, forwardly placed outside rivals, advanced to challenge four wide racing into
the turn but flattened out nearing midstretch. R D HAVE FAITH, held up between foes avoiding close quarters racing to the turn, angled six wide nearing
midstretch and displayed some belated interest. RETURN THE FAVOR ducked out at the start, was righted to make brief pursuit of the leaders racing five
wide to the turn but quickly came up empty. A TOAST TO KAY, bumped at the start, settled last into the turn and never gained contention. WINE BOTTLE
ducked out bumping a rival at the start, was righted to make a brief bid three deep between foes racing into the turn but quickly came up empty.
INTRICATELY was a brief factor inside foes tracking just off the leaders but emptied out early.

Footnotes
HANIEL, reserved out of close quarters while angling to the inside in the opening stages, continued under light rating to the far turn, swung out five wide
racing into upper stretch and produced a solid response to wrest command, then go clear under hand urging. JOST SAYIN angled to the inside in early
stages to track just off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch, advanced inside rivals to challenge for command nearest the rail but proved no
match for the winner. KITTEN'S SHADOW tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight in the opening half, advanced four wide through the far turn to
challenge for command in upper stretch striking the front but failed to sustain that momentum. BEACHTREASUREGIRL was settled outside foes racing to
the backstretch, continued four wide into the far turn, was fanned six wide in upper stretch but made an effort to improve position. RAGTIME SUZY broke
outwards exchanging solid contact with BIG ANGEL at the start, was quickly righted to track just off the leaders inside foes racing to the far turn, shifted out
three deep nearing the lane to lodge a brief bid between foes but proved empty late. FIELD LETTERS moved to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on
a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled between foes into the lane and gave out midstretch. FEELING GOOD ducked hitting the gate at the start, shifted in to
settle off the second flight between foes, was steadied racing into the first turn, continued between foes to the far turn but had no rally. BIG ANGEL broke
inwards exchanging bumps at the start, was reserved last to the far turn shifting off the inside, was fanned seven wide into the stretch but had no rally.
TROPICAL FROSTY, urged to gain a forward placing three deep early, tracked the leaders between foes in the second flight racing into the far turn but
came up empty in the drive. MALLIE CRAMP, in touch prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn, gave way into the stretch.

Footnotes
TOWN CLASSIC took up a position under rating tracking off the first flight while angling inwards a bit racing through the backstretch, continued under
patient handling into the turn briefly awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide in upper stretch advancing in close quarters to
challenge the leader leaving the furlong marker, then took over from that foe and went clear under firm encouragement. MUNGOJERRIE, in touch with the
leaders four wide attending the pace on the backstretch, was prompted racing into the turn to press the issue three deep between foes, edged forward
racing into upper stretch to gain a brief advantage but couldn't contain the winner. LAST PROMISE, disputed the pace inside foes on a narrow advantage
racing into the bend, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way late. MIGHTY GHOST, in touch with the first flight from the outset three deep
prompting the pace, dueled between rivals just off the inside to upper stretch and gave way. TONY switched outside foes to race just off the first flight five
wide in early stages, was urged to prompt the pace racing four wide into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. TABIA ducked out at the start, angled to
the inside on the backstretch but never gained contention. LEM ME TEL YA flashed brief pace between foes and emptied out early.

Footnotes
ASHLIE NICOLE shifted out four wide in the opening stages tracking off the second flight, steadily advanced to contention in that path racing through the
turn and continued with a solid closing response to wrest the advantage in time under left handed pressure. MARDI GRAS GIRL angled inwards prompting
a rival's pace through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn, took over racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but came up
second best. SUSIES WHO shifted out five wide early while rated out of striking distance, then continued in that path to upper stretch while making an effort
to improve position to the stretch. LADY VALENTINA tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing into the trun and continued evenly between foes
in that path to late stages. SOLD ON SALSA sprinted to the lead while angling to the inside, dueled for command through the turn and gave way into upper
stretch. NOT REGRET tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, then faded into the stretch. SHARPERTHANME broke a bit slowly, settled well off
the leaders and never gained contention. HIGH CURRENCY broke slowly dropping out last and failed to menace. SUNSHINE SMILES tracked the leaders
inside foes in the second flight racing into the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
JOURNEYMAN, bumped at the start, was righted to track just off the second flight inside foes under light rating, advanced to a position just off the
pacesetter along the rail when presented an opening racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide advancing on the leaders in tandem with a rival and
continued with a steady late response to prevail between foes under firm encouragement. DAZZLING TRUTHS tracked the pacesetter inside a rival as part
of the second flight, switched out after a half to track outside foes, was fanned four wide racing into the stretch while advancing on the pacesetter in tandem
with the eventual winner, couldn't match that foe late but prevailed for the place honors on the wire. ACTION EVERYDAY moved readily to the lead while
under light rating racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace in hand while opening a commanding margin after a half, turned back a rival's challenge racing
through the far turn to briefly regain a clear advantage, then resisted the winner's bid grudgingly to late stages. SPEED GRACER tracked off the second
flight outside foes in early stages, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, came through close quarters and continued willingly
inside foes to the end. SMALL HOPE tracked off the second flight between foes under rating, was prompted to advance between foes just off the inside
nearing upper stretch, was shuffled out of tight quarters entering the lane, shifted out three deep and continued willingly between foes to late stages. AND
WON was settled outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide racing into the stretch but made some mild progress between foes to gain some
position late. REDOUTE'S LIGHT settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, swung out widee racing through the stretch and lacked the needed final
response. THE CURT FOX (GB), bumped by CAMMACK, then forced into the eventual winner at the start, was settled near the inside but proved no threat.
CAMMACK ducked inwards bumping a rival at the start, was reserved near the inside, shifted out on the far turn, was fanned wide into the stretch and
proved no threat. SHENDAM (FR) broke readily, stalked the pacesetter outside a rival for a half, advanced to lodge a brief bid on the far turn but came up
empty racing into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BROWNS GAP, bumped at the start, recovered quickly while switching just outside the pacesetter to gain a forward placing racing to the backstretch,
prompted that foe racing into the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, edged forward in a long drive and just held the late challenge
of MEILLEUR on the wire in an all out drive. The latter tracked off the first flight three deep between foes racing to the backstretch, made a steady advance
in that path to challenge leaving midstretch and just missed. GAME DAY DRAMA broke inwards bumping the eventual winner, went quickly to the lead
racing off the inside to the backstretch, dueled inside the winner through the far turn to upper stretch but weakened late. CANDY COVE broke readily to
stalk just off the leaders along the inside, was prompted inside foes to lodge a brief bid racing into the far turn but came up empty nearing the lane.
ENTERTAINER tracked the leaders between foes out of striking distance to the backstretch and never gained contention. DONE ACTING, caught five wide
racing through the first turn to the backstretch, retreated nearing the far turn. PERFECT JOE threw his head while breaking a step slowly, switched out
racing to the backstretch but failed to seriously menace. SACRED LEGACY was a brief factor tracking the leaders four wide between foes through the first
turn but gave way early. LAPULGA raced unhurried along the rail to the backstretch and proved no factor. .

Footnotes
CLASSY OF COURSE stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside that foe readily advancing to terms on her
own courage entering the far turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and came under firm encouragement to maintain a clear margin to the end.
MORE THAN GRACIOUS, reserved inside foes in the last flight along the rail, gradually drew into contention saving ground into the far turn, shifted out to
split rivals just off the inside racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. BIG LIZ broke inwards brushing ALEXACRAT, was rated between foes
tracking well off the second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four, then five wide racing through the far turn while being prompted to advance, came under
some correction when lugging inwards racing into upper stretch but continued well enough to prevail for a share. IRISH ORB was rated off the second flight
along the inside in the opening half, shifted out racing into the far turn to bid three deep between entering upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick.
FLORIDA RUST settled between foes in the last flight to the backstretch, swung out six wide racing into the stretch but had no rally. ENGLISH TOFFE
ROSE was settled outside foes in early stages and never gained contention. ALEXACRAT came through close quarters at the break, was prompted to gain
a contending position, drifted wide into the first turn, continued outside foes off the second flight to the backstretch but dropped out early. CALYPSO KEY
sped to the lead while angling to the rail, dictated the pace to the far turn and gave way abruptly once headed by the winner. TROPICAL DRIVE, pulling a bit
in the opening stages while gaining a position tracking just off the pacesetter, continued outside the eventual winner through the backstretch, drifted out
racing into the far turn and gave way early.
