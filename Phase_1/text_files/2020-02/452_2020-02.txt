Footnotes
SASSY BUT SMART broke on top but deferred to HERO UP, kept tabs in closest attendance to the latter for a half-mile, began moving between horses into
the far turn, reeled in the leader approaching the quarter-pole and drew away under pressure. ASTROTURF was unhurried early, swung four wide into the
stretch and finished well without menacing the winner. ROMAN EMPIRE was slow into stride while moving inside, moved out widest for the drive and rallied
mildly for a share. CARIBBEAN GOLD raced in striking range three wide for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late bid. COSMIC TREASURE edged a bit
closer to the leaders in the two-path after six furlongs, but flattened out. EMOJI GUY was outrun throughout. HERO UP set a brisk pace inside, offered little
resistance when collared by the winner on the far turn, and faded steadily. TEXAS GIANT was put to pressure up the backstretch and into the far turn, and
offered nothing. CRUMB CAKE was always far back.

Footnotes
MYSTIC COMIN HOME broke near the lead and angled to the rail shortly after which caused VICKYTHEBEST to be taken up sharply, continued on top and
saved ground around the turn then kept clear under steady pressure. VICKYTHEBEST was moving up the inside then was forced to be taken up sharply
when MYSTIC COMIN HOME dropped to the rail in opening stages, lost momentum but recovered quickly and continued in game pursuit, chased two wide
into stretch run and continued a steady bid with solid response. STAMINA PRINCESS raced in the back along the inside then switched out midway through
the turn, swung wide entering top stretch and rallied up for a share. ITSMYLUCKYGIRL raced five wide through early stages, continued a outside bid racing
in range around the turn then flattened out in the lane. AZTEC MOON raced along the outside positioned off the top two leaders in the opening quarter,
continued a four wide bid past the quarter pole then failed to sustain kick in the lane. LOVE OF GLORY steadied near the five eighths pole after rival was
taken up, raced off the pace then hustled up for response entering the turn, kept under a drive five wide into the lane but lacked the needed response for
impact. KINGSTON TIME steadied near the five eighths pole and continued to chase after the early speed, kept under steady pressure through the stretch
but failed to gain a threatening position. WATER WIZARD chased near mid-range through early stages then flattened along inside upper stretch.
ZANGARVA raced near the rear and saved ground through early stages then shifted out to position widest upper stretch and failed to move on. NENITA
raced four wide through early stages then moved wide into stretch and failed to factor. AWESOME FOXY LADY was forwardly placed racing just off the
early leader, remained in close range and chased through the turn then tired in the drive. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY #9 MYSTIC COMIN HOME WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR CAUSING #1 VICKYTHEBEST TO BE TAKEN UP SHORTLY AFTER THE START

Footnotes
ASSAIL advanced inside around the turn, moved out to the three-path rallying through upper stretch, rallied in tandem with MIDNIGHT MIRACLE as they
overhauled the pacesetter a sixteenth out, and proved best to the wire. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE gained around the turn in the two-path, moved to the rail
rallying through the lane, overtook the pacesetter in deep stretch but was edged by ASSAIL through the final yards. ROYALLY COOL hustled through to
grab the early lead, showed the way clear in the two-path to the stretch, but weakened into the final furlong and yielded to challengers from both flanks.
GILDA F. chased under pressure three wide into the turn, and made no headway on the far outside in the stretch. SUZ pursued the pacesetter two wide for
a half-mile, and faded through the drive. MEMORIZE lacked room after the start between horses, stayed close four wide heading to the turn, moved in a
path and faded steadily before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
JIMMYSSMOKEDCARROT raced three wide near mid-range down the backstretch, prompted three to four wide around the far turn, produced a sharp kick
near the furlong marker, surged to the lead then drifted wider and kept clear. TYNAN stalked the pacesetter to the far turn, prompted and advanced to hold
a slim lead at the quarter pole, turned for home two wide with the advantage, kept on with response but was no match for the winner in late stages. LOVE
RANGER steadied along the inside around the first turn then steadied slightly early backstretch, sat off the pace in early going then moved up bit closer near
the half mile marker, hustled up between foes on the far turn then kept under a drive three wide in stretch run and got up late for show. COUPLE OF NIKKIS
was forwardly positioned and tracked the pacesetter to the far turn, raced in aim for the lead at the quarter pole then given cue leaving the far turn, lacked
the needed kick to move on with top pair then edged late for show. BY HIS GRACE tracked the pace and saved ground down the backstretch, had to wait
for racing room near the quarter pole then steadied late far turn, switched out a path top stretch then ran on evenly. TAPPED TWICE raced under slight
restraint to sit off the early pace, hustled up for response around the far turn, moved into top stretch six wide under a drive and lacked the needed response
for late impact. INDEPENDENT MISS raced in the back and saved ground, shifted out top stretch and lacked a needed rally. GRAVEL GERTIE raced near
the rear and failed to kick on under pressure. SURMOUNT SUN took the lead and crossed inside entering the first turn, set the pace down the backstretch
then got collared in the far turn and had nothing left in the lane.

SHELLPHONE was sent through inside to get the early lead, shook off pursuers and settled into the stretch well in command, and widened under pressure.
PASATIME saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, stayed on the rail and rallied into second late. IRISH THUNDER raced three then four wide around the
turn, and could not threaten with an even finish outside. AWESOMENEWYEAR pressed the pace between horses for a half-mile, and faded through the
lane. LUCY'S INTEREST got bumped by SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL at the start, then had her hind end bumped by UNCAPTURED HARMONY, lagged well
back four then five wide around the turn, and posed no threat. TUMBADORA broke out bumping UNCAPTURED HARMONY at the start, pressed the pace
three wide to late on the turn, and tired. UNCAPTURED HARMONY got bumped by TUMBADORA coming out, then bumped with LUCY'S INTEREST to get
away slowest, and never reached contention. SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL broke in bumping LUCY'S INTEREST at the start, raced between horses in the
two-path going to the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
SISTER GEMA took the lead shortly after the start and saved ground around the first turn, raced a path off the rail and set the uncontested pace down the
backstretch, held firm over challenger's around the far turn, put to a drive near the inside in stretch run, stayed sharp in response and finished clear.
KARENINA stalked the pacesetter to the far turn then launched a two wide bid for command, continued with effort under steady urging through the lane but
could not reach the winner. ZODIAC PRINCESS rated near mid-pack through early stages, launched a bid along the inside around the far turn then
remained in steady pursuit up the inside in stretch run and cleared show. SWEEPENO settled out of the gate then tugged a bit around the first turn, raced
under a snug hold to rate off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn then put to a drive two wide and lacked the needed response to threaten.
MAGIC RIVER settled nicely sitting off the early pace through the backstretch, prompted around the far turn then moved into stretch run six paths wide and
lacked a needed rally. QUIET ALL AROUND was forwardly placed out of the gate and steadied nearing the first turn, tugged a bit then settled more and
tracked the pace along the rail, continued as a sharp factor late backstretch then lacked response when called upon around the far turn. MI KARLITA raced
in the back along the outside, moved into top stretch seven paths wide and failed to make and impact. LITTLE NICOLE sat back off the early pace, saved
ground then prompted two wide around the far turn but failed to respond.

Footnotes
THE VIRGINIAN eyed the leaders in the clear three wide early on the turn, got closest to R MAN JOE approaching the quarter-pole, had the latter get away
from him turning for home, but rallied determinedly and was along in the last 70 yards. R MAN JOE came away alertly despite brushing the right side of the
gate and veering out sharply at the start, took over from MR NAPPY around the turn, remained clear to deep stretch but could not withstand the top one.
SOUPER WATSON broke out at the start, was outrun to the stretch in the two-path, and finished gamely inside the top two. MR NAPPY vied early inside R
MAN JOE before getting outsprinted around the turn, then stayed on stubbornly through the lane. EXTRA DOUGH raced two wide around the turn, and did
not seriously menace. PUTIN ONLINE broke slowly, saved ground outrun to the stretch, and gained mildly without threatening. OPTIMISTIC got shut off at
the start between SOUPER WATSON and EXTRA DOUGH, and was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
GRIT AND GLORY was allowed to settle in early stages and raced near inside with the second flight, headed in pursuit of the clear leader at the half mile
marker, moved into striking distance of MORE THAN STRIKING upper stretch then kept on determinedly under steady pressure and forged ahead. MORE
THAN STRIKING quickly cleared on top and angled closer to the inside, held a clear advantage and set a sharp pace down the backstretch and remained
sharp around the turn, fought back when challenged by GRIT N GLORY upper stretch then had no kick left in late reserve while clearly second best.
MALIBU MUSIC was hustled up out of the gate and continued the closest pursuer off the quickly clear leader, continued in the second position while ridden
along to maintain tempo down the backstretch then began to tire off the top pair around the turn and churned on for show. MAC JAGGER raced off the clear
leader positioned in the second flight down the backstretch then came up tired around the turn and gave way. SPINNING KITTEN showed response three
wide in early stages then retreated and allowed to gallop home under no exertion from the rider.

Footnotes
LENA HORNE was four wide around the turn within striking range, rallied steadily outside, caught CHARLIEANNA in deep stretch and edged clear. CAT'S
ASTRAY was bottled up behind the leaders in the two-path approaching the stretch, got through an opening inside HIRE THE LADY in upper stretch, and
finished gamely on the rail. CHARLIEANNA was bumped between horses at the start, dashed to the lead in the two-path, remained well clear through the
furlong grounds, but weakened late and was passed from both sides. TRIXIE'S TIME was well back three then four wide for three-eighths of a mile, and
rallied belatedly on the far outside. GOLCONDA (FR) was outsprinted two wide to the top of the stretch, moved out a bit and closed with good courage
between horses. NILESTAR became edgy in the gate and was backed out and reloaded, got bumped between horses at the start, settled in midpack early,
came off the rail to the two-path for the drive, rallied through traffic and had to be put on hold through the final yards behind the leaders. HIRE THE LADY
broke out bumping CHARLIEANNA into PAULA ANDREA, chased after the leader inside for three furlongs, moved to the two-path in the stretch, and faded
late. PAULA ANDREA got bumped by CHARLIEANNA at the start, steadied slightly between horses at the back going to the turn, steadied behind a wall of
horses entering the final furlong, moved steadily outward in search of a lane and could never be set down in earnest. PLAY THAT TONE had aim three wide
to the top of the lane, and lacked the needed response. ANJALI bumped with NILESTAR at the start, lacked room in tight brushing the rail into the turn, and
could not reach contention. CURIOUS ZELDA showed little at the back throughout.

Footnotes
R BOY BODE sped to the lead shortly after the start and angled inside, held clear along the rail still unleashed around the turn, put to a drive upper stretch,
had more in reserve and kept clear. KEEP IT UP gained a contending position out of the gate then chased after the top two around the turn, came under
strong handling in stretch run, produced a solid bid but could not reach the winner. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA hustled along two wide at the quarter pole
then angled out wider upper stretch, continued four to five wide in final stages and finished with response to take show. CAN'TTAKEITWITHYOU raced
along the rail off the top two leaders around the turn, continued a bid up inside then evened out in the final furlong and finished on equal terms with DARK
AGES. DARK AGES was not too far off the early pace then hustled along four wide late turn, kept under a ride in stretch run, produced a mild bid and
finished on equal terms with CAN'TTAKEITWITHYOU. SCRIBE was off to a good start and remained forwardly placed off the leader around the turn then
flattened out in the final furlong, was pulled up after the race then vanned off. VISIONS OF YOU lacked early foot and angled inside to save ground, put to a
drive two to three wide in stretch run and lacked the needed response for late impact. TIDE OF THE DESERT raced three wide leaving the backstretch,
moved into stretch run five wide under a drive and failed to kick on. WAHOOWAH was off very slow at the start, raced in the back and saved ground to no
avail. CHUCKLES CANDY raced five wide off the early pace and failed to rally in the lane. DUBLIN TINKER raced off the early speed, moved into stretch
four wide and lacked a needed rally. STRATEGIC OUTLOOK raced wide and failed to move into contention.
