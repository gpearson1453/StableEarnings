Footnotes
ROSES FOR RUBY didn't break sharply, was rated inside early, steadied after advancing into tight quarters nearing the end of the backstretch, remained in
tight behind the first flight until approaching the quarter pole, moved quickly to vie into the stretch, took over leaving the furlong grounds and held under
steady urging. EVIL WOMAN dueled along the rail, regained command entering the far turn, ran out entering the stretch and continued with good courage
between rivals once displaced. JANELLE DREAMS lagged early, made a run in the five path around the final turn then gained mildly through the lane.
BAMBOO GARDEN was slow leaving the gate, settled early, made a strong four wide run on the final turn to vie into the stretch but failed to sustain her bid.
IF YOU ONLY KNEW showed speed two wide, moved to a short lead outside the early leader early on the backstretch, remained prominent to the stretch
then tired. IVANYA was close up three wide for over three-quarters then stopped in the lane. ALL ABOUT BLEU steadied then bore out sharply entering the
first turn, remained well out into the track while steadily falling back and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
QUEEN COURAGE stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail to split horses at the five sixteenths pole, tipped to the four path turning for home for
racing room outside of the dueling leaders, rallied in upper stretch, and drove past at the furlong pole. CHAPEL OF CHIMES was driven to gain from
midpack while two wide and between horses passing the seven sixteenths pole, made a bid for the lead turning for home, dueled between horses passing
the furlong pole, but was outfinished by her outer rival. HIJINKS stalked in the three path, moved between the leaders to bid for the lead at the nine
sixteenths pole, cleared her inner rival into the far turn, but was challenged turning for home, and gave way passing the furlong pole. JUDGEMENT FREE
was void of early speed in the five path around the first turn, angled to the inside into the backstretch, tracked closer while in the bit behind the leading
group, shifted off the fence to pass a tiring rival around the far turn, then made a mild rally inside of foes through the lane, but failed to threaten. BOWTIE
DIVA raced in the four path in midpack, but lacked a rally. MARNESIA BIG GIRL vied for the lead inside of ONLY ESSA while a bit keep and under a tight
hold through the first turn, held a narrow margin to the far turn, but weakened around that bend. ONLY ESSA dueled outside of MARNESIA BIG GIRL
through the first turn while in the three to for path, retreated to stalk passing the half mile pole, but weakened while being floated to the five path passing the
five sixteenths pole. SARATIAGO came under coaxing at the five furlong pole while trailing the field, but failed to respond and was no factor.

Footnotes
LOLA'S KISSES wasn't far back inside early, came out on the turn, moved two wide to command midway on the bend, was clear before a half and widened
under mild urging. DOUBLE CROSSED settled early, made a run in the two path around the turn but failed to sustain through the lane.
DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY was slow early, stayed along the rail and gained mildly in the lane. SNOW BLOSSOM wasn't far back in the four path around
the turn then weakened. DISCREET TATTOO was hustled to a clear lead after going a furlong, stayed along the rail and had nothing left for the drive.
CHEERMENOW held the early lead after a sharp break, raced the three path between rivals around the turn then stopped. LUNAR STAR was fractious in
the gate, broke slowly, trailed and was eased up through the lane. CHARLIE DREAMS RVF wasn't far back outside to the turn, raced the five path into the
stretch and was eased up. GRACEYGAB stumbled badly leaving the gate and unseated her rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but the results
stood.

Footnotes
LOVELY LYDIA was forwardly placed in the two path, shifted to the four path into the turn, inched forward and made a bid for the lead turning for home
outside of FAST INTENTIONS, then prevailed over that foe at the sixteenth pole through a long drive. FAST INTENTIONS lied close to the pace three wide,
took over from her inner foes passing the five sixteenths pole, but met a challenge from LOVELY LYDIA turning for home, dug in inside of that rival in upper
stretch, dueled, but gave way passing the sixteenth pole. SPECTACULLARI was bumped at the start, swung from the three to the six path around the turn
while far off of the pace, then rallied willingly, but belatedly, through the lane, and missed place. FOXY HIYA shifted off of the rail to the four path turning for
home, and offered a mild rally, but was no threat to the leaders. SUNDAY IN L B C bumped an outer rival at the start, went on to prompt the pace inside of
multiple rivals, but failed to keep pace with FAST INTENTION passing the five sixteenths pole, held position turning for home, but weakened late and got
outfinished for minor rewards. KATY THE CAT took the turn in the five path while in midpack, and was no factor. TOWN SPIRIT set the early pace in the
two path, but gave way between horses at the five sixteenths pole and faded through the lane. LUXURY ITEM was pinched between horses at the start,
was void of early speed inside of a rival, took the turn in the two to three path, and failed to get involved. R CHERRY shifted from the four to the two path
while getting outpaced around the turn, and failed to factor. SPECTACULAR NOW stalked four wide, but failed to keep pace with the leaders while drifting to
the six path around the turn, then weakened passing the quarter pole and subsequently stopped.

Footnotes
FU MAN SUE dueled two wide from the outset, moved clear into the stretch and was under intermittent urging to the end. LUNAR PRIZE was bumped
leaving the gate, moved early to duel along the rail, ran out entering the stretch and weakened. YES SIR COLONEL wasn't far back outside in the three
path to the stretch then tired. TOP HAT TREASON failed to menace two wide. LORD JACQUE was reluctant to load, ducked into LUNAR PRIZE leaving the
gate then was outrun inside. SIR JAMES ducked out into FUTURE STAR leaving the gate, stayed out from the rail while chasing the first flight to the stretch,
stopped in the lane and was eased up late. FUTURE STAR broke in the air, was bumped leaving the gate and quickly fell far back.

BROAD STREET BULLY tracked between horses in the three path around the turn, cut the corner and angled from the three path to the rail turning for
home while just clear of BERN CIGARS to his inside, then produced a rail bid inside of the leaders through the lane, and drove past in the late stages.
START CASHIN dueled outside of BERN CIGARS early on, took command passing the five sixteenths pole, dug in as TYLER made an outside bid and
BROAD STREET BULLY made an inside bid turning for home, but was bested by the latter in the late stages while hanging on his left lead, and just held
place at the wire. TYLER stalked three wide while being kept in the five path, inched forward and angled to the four path to bid for the lead at the five
sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick in upper stretch to surpass the leader, kept on willingly late, but missed place. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA broke inwards,
raced in midpack in the three to five path around the turn, then finished evenly while hanging on her left lead. WELL BORN trailed in the three path early on,
swung to the eight path to be widest of all turning for home, and passed tired rivals without threatening. COLONEL MOORHEAD shifted off of the rail while
far off of the pace into the turn, then angled from the three to the four path turning for home, but lacked a rally. PAGE DOWN stalked along the inside, but
steadied hard behind the weakening BERN CIGARS at the quarter pole, and was eased through the lane. BERN CIGARS dueled inside of START CASHIN
early on, but relinquished the lead to that rival at the five sixteenths pole, steadied slightly while weakening as BROAD STREET BULLY crossed across his
path at the quarter pole, causing PAGE DOWN to steady hard along his inside, then was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
KEWANNE broke awkwardly, bumped with ALPHARDINI early on the backstretch, moved to vie two wide outside the early leader on the turn, took over in
early stretch and held after a stiff drive. SIX PACK GAL took command at once, stayed along the rail while making the pace for less than five furlongs then
continued gamely once displaced. TIZ PROMISING RVF bumped with ON MAGIC WINGS leaving the gate and again early on the backstretch, steadied in
tight behind rivals from early on the backstretch until nearing the half mile pole, raced the three path around the turn and finished willingly. ALPHARDINI
bumped with the winner soon after the break, settled early between rivals, raced two wide around the turn then found best stride too late. FORMAL
DUTCHESS stayed outside, raced the five path into the turn and failed to matter. HOOF HOOF AWAY wasn't far back in the three path into the turn and
tired in the lane. ON MAGIC WINGS bumped with TIZ PROMISING RVF leaving the gate then again early on the backstretch, raced three wide and failed to
menace. PRAYFORACURE broke slowly, angled to the rail early on the backstretch and stopped in the lane.

Footnotes
BIG DAVE saved ground while rating in the two path off of the pace through the turn, positioned between horses turning for home as the leader drifted
outwards, split foes in the two path approaching the furlong marker, surged through, and drew off through the final sixteenth. MARTINKELLY broke
outwards, dueled inside of TYGER BRIGHT while staying in the two path around the turn, drifted to the four path while holding an advantage turning for
home, but by doing so allowed racing room for BIG DAVE, who surpassed him at the sixteenth pole. MY TRAIN split foes to gain to stalking position in the
two path, waited behind the leaders through the turn, angled inwards turning for home as the leader drifted out, made a rail bid for the lead in upper stretch,
but flattened out late and was outfinished for place. CAMGO stalked in the three to four path between horses while close to the pace, failed to split horses
while caught in traffic approaching the furlong pole, then came up empty with clear racing room in the late stages. PHARAOH'S CITY shifted from the five to
the seven path turning for home, and passed tired rivals. CREATE A WINDSTORM prompted the pace inside a pair of rivals early on, but weakened
approaching the quarter pole and faded through the lane. TYGER BRIGHT dueled outside of MARTINKELLY while being kept in the three path around the
turn, but was floated to the five path by that rival turning for home, and subsequently weakened. JOVIS was off a step slow and crowded between horses at
the start, settled in midpack three wide and between horses, four to five wide around the turn while slightly advancing outside of horses, but floated to the six
path turning for home, and flattened out in upper stretch. SPIN LIGHTNING bobbled a bit then took up at the start, then trailed the field throughout, and
never got involved.
