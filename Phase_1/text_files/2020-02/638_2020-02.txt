Footnotes
HOT LITTLE HONEY broke out at the start bumping ALL ABOUT REYANA, got carried out to the six or seven path by LA NEGRITA who floated outwards
down the backstretch to her inside to the five or six path, cleared that rival and tucked four wide into the turn, advanced under light coaxing through the bend
coming under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, swung five then four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to latch on the leader a
furlong out, had that rival drift out under a near sided stick getting herded mildly while dueling to the finish and got up in the final jumps in game fashion to
prevail. STUNNING MUNNINGS hustled from the gate, crossed to knock heads from the four path briefly with SUMMER BELIEF before conceding the front
to that rival five furlongs from home, prompted that foe from the outside three wide through the turn came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun
three wide into upper stretch seizing the front straightened away for home, inched away under a drive briefly before being confronted by the aforementioned
foe, dug in under a near sided stick shying outwards and herding her main danger slightly while fighting on stubborn but was ultimately headed and bested
at the end. LA NEGRITA bobbled at the break slightly, tipped out after the start and drifted out five to six wide carrying out HOT LITTLE HONEY to the six or
seven path, went five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued five wide for home and offered up a mild bid for the show
honors. ALL ABOUT REYANA stumbled at the start and was bumped by HOT LITTLE HONEY conceding four to five lengths to the front before settling into
stride, chased two to three wide from near the rear placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. SUMMER BELIEF coaxed from the gate, dueled briefly from the three path with STUNNING MUNNINGS to her outside before being
conceded the front five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path half a mile from home coming under pressure from her main pace rival through the turn
and got put to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under threat, succumbed the front straightened away and weakened.
SPEED TALKS stumbled at the start and was taken in hand conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four wide down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside for home and tired.

kick to close in and secure the place honors. BUSTIN HOFFMAN broke a step outwards and was bumped in the hind end by the aforementioned foe and
bobbled placing the rider very briefly off balance, vied three wide down the backstretch among a trio before tucking to the two path into the turn emerging

three-sixteenths, leaned on that rival gaining clearance to loosely split foes a furlong out, rallied to take command just inside the sixteenth pole and prevailed
gamely on the wire. PAVE IT shied out at the start filling the space left vacated by NOT PHAR NOW who stumbled, got hustled to establish the front and
showed the way lightly coaxed along three then two wide before tucking along the inside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive coming under threat through the final furlong, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker and fought on to the finish well clear for the place

dug in under a drive and came inwards at the three-sixteenths putting the squeeze on DOUBLE SHOT loosely between foes, traded brief leans with that
rival before weakening in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. BOOM BOOM KABOOM bumped at the start by THEITALIANAMERICAN due
to pressure from NOT PHAR NOW, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and mildly advancing through the latter portion
of the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. THEITALIANAMERICAN got bumped solidly at the start by NOT PHAR NOW and in turn bumped

THE LAST ACE broke in at the start bumping SCUTTLEBUZZ and pinching that foe back against MONTAUK MEMORIES, established the front and
showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained patiently handled and spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
got roused straightened away and drew off under a drive to prevail. MR. BUCKLEY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. FOREST SPIRIT chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SCUTTLEBUZZ got bumped at
the start by THE LAST ACE breaking inwards and was pinched back at the start, chased six then five wide down the backstretch before going four wide
through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch improving position and weakened in the drive. I PROWL
ALONE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. BEING ME hustled from the gate,
showed brief speed along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in retreat, swung three to four wide for home and folded. BLACK IRISH two to
three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. MONTAUK MEMORIES chased along the
inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and
appeared to injure himself straightened away, got placed to a light hold, the rider looking down to the off side and was eased through to the finish to collect
the last check taking bad steps before the wire and favoring the right hind leg, got pulled up four to five awkward strides after the finish and was
subsequently vanned off.

pole, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to score.
BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE forwardly placed three wide past the stands and through the opening bend, advanced on the leader in tandem with LEITONE down
the backstretch while four wide, tucked three wide through the far turn, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
heads apart for command, took over a narrow advantage at the three-sixteenths, briefly inched away under a drive under growing threat to the outside, dug
in and was caught in the final strides while clear for the place honors. EKHTIBAAR coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, took to
the two path down the backstretch and had a pair of rivals advance outside, got headed for the front near the nine-sixteenths, came under light coaxing half
a mile from home and tucked inside through the far turn, got shaken off nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to
secure the show honors. DYNAMAX PRIME along the inside through to the backstretch, chased three wide from there until tucked to the two path half a
mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. LEITONE

the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, came under challenge near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home heads apart for command, yielded
the front with three-sixteenths remaining and weakened in the late stages. HEAVY ROLLER three wide early on, got carried four wide through the first turn
as ARMAMENT went three wide to his inside, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the half mile pole placed to coaxing,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ARMAMENT bobbled at the start, raced just off the inside early on before tipping three wide
through the first turn taking HEAVY ROLLER four wide, chased four then three wide, tucked two to three wide into the far turn and came under a ride at the
seven-sixteenths, continued two to three wide for home and was eased in the final furlong. Due to a timer malfunction the mile and one quarter fraction was

inside the half mile pole, tipped four wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command near the eighth pole and was directed inwards to look his main danger in the eye, dug in headed nearing the sixteenth marker, fought on to
the finish but was ultimately bested by a pair while clear of the rest. PSYCHIC ENERGY coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and improved position for the last major share. BLUE BELT two to three wide in pursuit early on,
