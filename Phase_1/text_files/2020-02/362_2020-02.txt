Footnotes
STRONG BEAUTY ducked out sharply at the start then bumped soundly with ORETTA before being corrected by the rider, moved up while angling out,
tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch under the whip, made a bid at the three-sixteenths
while drifting out a bit under a left-handed whip, switched to a right-handed whip just after taking the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear under the
whip outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride before being eased up in the final few strides while much the best. LADY BE GONE
moved to the lead while showing good speed then set the clear pace, controlled the action while inside to the two path on the turn, was asked at the top of
the stretch, lost the advantage under a drive outside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner while well clear for the place. LUCKY ARTIE
was away well, showed speed then chased the pace near the inside, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive while near the two path,
took a brief awkward stride outside the three-sixteenths and weakened while well clear for the show. ORETTA bobbled at the start then was bumped hard
by STRONG BEAUTY and forced hard into STELLAR VOID, lugged out some early while ridden along, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. SINCERITY was bumped hard at the start then forced out and off a step slow, moved out while ridden along on the outside,
was caught five wide into the turn then angled to the rail, came three wide into the stretch under an all out drive, drifted out under a left-handed whip near
the three-sixteenths then switched to a right-handed whip, drifted out again after being swapped back to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker and was
no factor. STELLAR VOID was bumped hard at the start then forced soundly into another foe and checked, dropped well behind the rest of the field,
rounded the turn in the two path and trailed.

Footnotes
TAP DANCE STAR was bumped by MARYWOOD at the start then shut-off and checked, spotted the front around five lengths, went around the first turn in
the two path, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while four then five wide on the far turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, drifted in some under
a left-handed whip while gaining fast outside the furlong marker, had the rider put the whip away then took the advantage inside that marker and drew off
under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. YALISHA was sent hard from the start then taken in hand after getting the lead, set the pace on the inside
while in hand, was asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the whip in upper stretch, drifted about coming to the furlong marker, lost the lead just inside
that marker and proved no match for the winner while well clear for the place. CRIMSON FELINE went around the first turn in the three path, followed the
leader from second, chased in the three path on the far turn and tired while just able to get the show. B'S TEN was bumped at the start then steadied some
when MARYWOOD came out, went three wide on the first turn, settled last but one, was urged along while three then four wide on the far turn, steadied
inside the quarter-pole and came up empty then just missed the show. MARYWOOD came out at the start and bumped TAP DANCE STAR and shut-off
that foe, was taken up early, saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the front, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and retreated.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA got away well and raced between rivals into the first turn continuing in the three to four path through that bend in behind the pacesetter, moved
outside a rival to edge closer three to four wide on the far turn, took a narrow lead at the top of the stretch then edged away late under a drive.
TOMMYTOSHORT broke on top and moved clear shifting in to the two path into the first turn to dictate terms, faced mild outside pressure up the
backstretch then continuing just off the rail was challenged by the aforementioned leaving the far turn, fought on gamely before yielding grudgingly late.
EASTSIDE BOY switched off the fence entering the first turn under light rating tactics tracking in behind the leaders from the two to three path, continued
from off the rail into the far turn, began to shift out past the five-sixteenths while given some encouragement, came five wide into upper stretch and ran on to
capture show honors. HITTHEGROUNDRUNNIN raced off the inside in the three path toward the back early, advanced on the far turn still in about the three
path to reach striking distance but could not sustain the effort. DJINN OF DJIBOUTI was taken back early shifting in to about the two path, continued inside
of foes but just off the fence on the far turn, came out in upper stretch and ran on. MEANINGFUL was urged at the break but caught four to five wide
between rivals on the first turn, stalked from outside before making a brief bid three wide entering the far turn but came up empty thereafter. B RASEN was
caught five to six wide outside foes into the first turn, steadily dropped back racing still off the fence and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
GRAND MARAIS was allowed to settle into stride between runners into the first turn then dropped back racing in the two path through that bend, continued
well back racing off the inside going outside foes three to four wide on the far turn, came in a bit in upper stretch then rallied late to just get up. REIGNING
WARRIOR raced last but one outside four wide on the first turn, inched closer still outside foes into the far turn going four to five wide on that bend, came
out a path for the drive reaching striking distance, was bumped late and just missed. CEE R BEE was well off the rail into the first turn tracking the leader
from outside in the three then quickly the four path on the first turn, continued to stalk from outside up the backstretch before moving to take a narrow lead
by the three-eighths pole while four wide, shifted in a path on the second turn once clear, lugged out under left-handed urging at the top of the stretch,
switched to right-handed corrections but continued to drift out bumping rivals in the process while nearing the wire. ORANGE received a late shoe repair in
the paddock, raced mid-pack in the three path early, continued to chase three to four wide on the far turn, began to edge closer in mid-stretch but was then
bumped into the outside rival. SINGING ACES was reserved under a hold trailing early while just off the inside, continued to trail into the stretch swinging
from the two path to the five path by the quarter pole, came out a further path or two in upper stretch then had to alter in to avoid drifting rivals late. ROUND
HILL moved to the rail soon after the start racing inside on or just off the rail through the first turn, continued two wide on the far turn coming three deep out
of that bend, was in a bit tight in upper stretch then drifted in through mid-stretch while failing to threaten. IKE WALKER was floated to the five path entering
the turn while appearing to not corner well but was taken back and shifted in four then three deep on that bend coming in the two path into the run up the
backstretch, continued to track in behind foes two wide into the far turn then shifted in on that bend, dropped back and switched out in the stretch while
weakening. LITTLE TOE set the pace from the two path, was challenged early on the far turn then gave way. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS
WELL AS OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ORANGE AGAINST BOTH CEE R BEE AND GRAND MARAIS, CEE R BEE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM
THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH BEHIND ORANGE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
PALVERA brushed the inside rival lightly shortly after the break, attended the pace three to four wide between runners going outside two foes through the
turn, asked for run at the quarter pole and grabbed with the reins nearing the three-sixteenths, responded by kicking clear then held sway while kept to task
late. THE MINIT I SEE U settled off the early pace, raced outside a rival but in the three to four path on the turn edging closer, moved out five wide in upper
stretch, captured the place but was not a late threat to the winner. FAST VERDICT was off a length slowly then unhurried early bringing up the rear, saved
ground on or just off the rail through the turn, swung six deep coming out of that bend and making up ground but evened out inside the final furlong. REACH
THE CIRCLE broke sharply but soon dropped back, tucked in behind the leading quartet heading to the turn, raced inside early on that turn and in the two
path late, came out three to four wide for the drive and failed to rally. BIBLEMAN was lightly brushed in the early going, contended two to three wide
between rivals to the top of the stretch then dropped back and faded. FRIDAY'S BEST was reluctant to load, encouraged forward after the break to vie
inside runners, went on or just off the rail through the turn still contesting the lead then gave way in upper stretch. SOUL SONG chased briefly from outside
runners four to five wide into the turn, steadily dropped back at that juncture and faded. PER RULING FROM THE LOUISIANA RACING COMMISSION,
PALVERA WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
COACH BAHE was taken back some nearing the first turn, went four then three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, moved closer while two then three
wide on the far turn, steadied behind horses inside the three-sixteenths then altered course to the outside, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed well
to get up under strong urging. LOOKIN HIGH went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn, made a bid
into the stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken while just able to get the place. A. K. SAFARI angled in nearing the first turn,
went three wide on that bend, raced just off the pace, dropped in leaving the backstretch, drafted inside on the far turn, lacked room behind the leaders from
the three-sixteenths to the eighth-pole, altered course to the rail at that point, had the rider lose his whip nearing the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to
just miss the place while clear for the show. MAN OF HONOR was hustled to the front, set the pace in the two path while getting some pressure to his
outside, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, battled under the whip in upper stretch, lost the lead before the furlong marker and was
outfinished. KINZEA STONE broke a step slow, angled out early, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was ridden along in
the three path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch, had the rider lose his whip near the furlong marker, moved out while dropping back around
the sixteenth-pole and tired. BALLYHACK moved in early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while three wide on the far
turn, passed the quarter-pole under the whip and failed to rally. ROCK RIDGE was off slow and spotted the front a couple of lengths, rounded the first turn in
the two path, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, dropped back late on the backstretch and retreated.

Footnotes
TIZ NEYNEY AND RAD chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, made a bid at the quarter-pole then kicked clear in upper stretch,
responded well in the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. SWINGING GALAXY moved out midway down the backstretch, was urged along in
third position, gained four wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. SOVOL was ridden along on the outside,
went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. STORMIE COURT was off slow and
spotted the front a few lengths, raced at the rear under urging, started the turn in the two path, shifted four wide near the five-sixteenths, was guided out
behind a foe that was drifting inward in upper stretch and failed to threaten. NOCOMET was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn,
spun four wide into the stretch, drifted in outside the three-sixteenths and came up empty. BIGBOYSHOWSHART was ridden along off the pace, went three
wide on the turn and failed to respond. POWER SERVE broke a step slow, saved ground through the turn, moved off the rail into upper stretch, shifted
further out late and was no factor. KING'S PRAYER quickly sped clear, saw the lead diminish while in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage inside the
quarter-pole and gave way. DREAM ON MISTER was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also failed to
respond.
