Footnotes
RIVER JUMPER was quick to begin from the outside set all the pace and drew off in the final stages to be well clear under steady pressure. CUSHMAN
ROAD stalked the pace, moved up along the inside through the drive but was no match for the winner. SWEET POISON dropped back early, moved up
three wide between rivals in the stretch and had no final winning bid. SMOKED PAPRIKA was hustled throughout and weakened while racing off the inside.
PARIS AT NIGHT stalked the pace, raced five wide at the eighth pole and had no response. CLONGIFFEN dropped back early, raced four wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. SPARKLING BID was slow early and never threatened. BESS EVER failed to have a response. PER RULING
#19-20-138A FROM THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF GAMING, RIVER JUMPER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

Footnotes
MAMBOCELLO was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up four wide at the eighth pole, finished well and got up late under strong handling. PEACH
TIME dueled for the early lead, led into the upper stretch but couldn't match strides with the winner late to finish second best. BAY AREA was unhurried
early, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and showed good late interest. MUSIC GIANT stalked the pace, raced four wide through the stretch while
racing between rivals and finished willingly to the wire. TEDDY TIME was slow early, raced towards the inside, was in a bit tight just past the sixteenth pole
and had no final winning bid. REMEMBERTOBREATHE dueled for the early lead from the inside and gave way. HOLY FRAZIER was unhurried early, raced
six deep through the drive and not enough. HARRY THE HITMAN dropped back early and failed to have a response.

Footnotes
GAMBLERS GOLD RUSH showed good early speed, dug in deep stretch and was clear late under strong handling. VALID PRINCE stalked the pace,
moved up three wide and finished second best. HOT RODIN stalked the pace, raced four wide at the eighth pole and finished willingly to the wire.
RUNFORMEFREDDIELEE pressed the pace from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. BATTI MAN (ARG) was unhurried early, raced three
deep through the stretch and never was a factor. C C N' WATER stalked the pace and weakened while racing four wide. MERLOT BRANDO settled off the
early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never menaced. VIDAKS BACK was fanned seven wide into the lane never was a factor.
PISTOLPAKNPREACHER was off a step slow, raced three deep and never threatened. LIL BIT OF THUNDER failed to have a response. ALL ABOUT
TRUMP trailed throughout and had to be vanned off.

Footnotes
GIO'S CALLING stalked the pace, moved up along the inside into the lane to take command and held gamely under strong encouragement. WE'RE JUST
SAYIN settled off the early pace, moved up four wide splitting rivals just past the eighth pole and finished well late to be second best. BUYMEABOND was
unhurried early, moved up five wide through the stretch and had no final winning bid. FREDDIES DREAM stalked the pace while saving ground and had no
response. DAD'S A GAMBLER dropped back early, saved ground and never threatened. EMPIRE KNIGHT pressed the pace and gave way. UTANDREAM
was slow early and never threatened. DRAYMAGIC showed good early speed and tired readily through the drive.
