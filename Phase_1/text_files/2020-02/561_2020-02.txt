Footnotes
IKEISGREAT was never far back, moved off the rail past the five-sixteenths, took over outside BYCHANCE after straightening away for the drive, and drew
away under mild urging well out in the track. UNION COLONEL broke outward at the start, chased outside BYCHANCE early, was never a threat to the
winner but continued on well enough to best the others. DREAM D'ORO got pushed out into LEGENDARY PRINCE at the start, raced near the three-path
around the turn, and ran on evenly after moving further out. KING OF ROCK was pushed out at the start, raced four wide around the turn, and remained
outrun while moving further out. BYCHANCE sped clear early a bit off the rail, had no answer for IKEISGREAT turning for home and faltered inside.
LEGENDARY PRINCE got bumped by DREAM D'ORO and pushed out a bit at the start, saved ground outsprinted to the stretch, moved off the rail and had
no response.

Footnotes
HARTLING stalked the top two leaders down the backstretch, moved up three wide mid-turn and swept to command with ease, prompted five wide top
stretch, responded willingly, quickly widened to a clear advantage then stayed sharp in response and continued to pull away. JUST A BIT SASSY was
unhurried out of the gate and raced in the back, began to pick up the pace along the rail but lacked clear room and steadied losing ground at the half mile
marker, angled out and made a rebid around the turn, continued a steady outside bid in the lane and gained place. NAPA RULES held a slim lead out of the
chute and set a pressured pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead racing inside of YOLANDA'S PRIDE into the turn then failed to be a match when the
eventual winner swept by past five-sixteenths pole, stayed on near the inside under steady pressure and prevailed for a share. YOLANDA'S PRIDE was
forwardly placed in opening stages and applied pace pressure to NAPA RULES, vied for the lead racing outside of foe entering the turn, could not contend
for the top spot when HARTLING came on the scene mid-way around the turn, kept under steady pressure in the lane but had no late kick. BEAST OF
WILDWOOD raced in range off the top trio in early going while ridden along to maintain tempo then failed to keep pace entering the turn, dropped back then
galloped home under no exertion from the rider.

Footnotes
LIAM'S POINT brushed the left side of the gate and bumped with SIR KAHN at the start, was steered outside to track the early leaders in the clear, collared
ATONE with five-sixteenths remaining and pulled away under pressure well out in the track, greenly wandered around well clear in mid stretch, swapped
back to his left lead at the 70-yard marker and had enough to hold sway. MUD PIE was slow to get going, advanced with a four-wide run after a half-mile,
rallied on the far outside and was closing in steadily on the winner. ELLIS ISLAND was outsprinted early despite some urging, remained well out of it three
wide around the turn, moved in through the stretch and finished with good energy on the rail. SIR KAHN bumped with LIAM'S POINT at the start, gave
chase between horses heading to the turn in the three-path, and lacked a solid response with an even finish while much best of the remainder. APACHE hit
the left side of the gate and bumped with MALIBU EDGE at the start, saved ground in range early, and was through after a half-mile. ATONE whirled around
fractiously entering the track, unseating the rider and briefly getting loose, had the rider remount after some anxious moments and went to post without
further incident, was sent up to vie for command inside WEEKEND DREAMER leaving the chute, got the best of that dispute but was no match for LIAM'S
POINT outside the quarter-pole, and had nothing left. MALIBU EDGE became fractious in the gate dislodging the rider, backed out and reloaded, bumped
with APACHE coming out, and showed little. WEEKEND DREAMER vied outside ATONE up the backstretch, and was finished early on the turn.
CENTERED dropped back two wide into the turn, and was eased up through the stretch.

Footnotes
VINTAGE PRINT raced two wide in the second flight down the backstretch then launched a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, advanced two wide into
striking range of VOODOO ZIP near the furlong grounds, dug in under steady urging and edged away. VOODOO ZIP was forwardly placed around the first
turn and applied pace pressure to SENZAZIONE down the backstretch, cleared on top entering the far turn and continued with the advantage turning for
home, fought back along the rail when VINTAGE POINT loomed a danger near the furlong grounds, dug in under a strong left handed drive but could not
hold off the winner in late stages. BEACHWALKER stalked the top flight while racing inside of the eventual winner down the backstretch, launched a two
wide bid moving through the far turn then flattened off the top pair in final furlong but stayed on for a share. MECHA CORTA secured inside position in the
first turn then rated off the top two flights to the far turn, prompted to pick up the pace and kept under steady urging in the lane but needed more for late
impact. RELIABILITY raced off the pace along the inside, waited briefly then launched a bid near three eighths pole and had a mild improve, raced two wide
upper stretch then shifted out wider and lacked a needed rally. MY BOY BLUE settled four wide in early stages while not too far back near the half then had
no response when called upon entering the far turn and gave way. TIME FOR TROUBLE was unhurried, raced two wide down the backstretch and had no
response. SENZAZIONE led the way on the inside around the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch then retreated in the final turn. UNCLE
FESTER raced two wide between foes in early stages then dropped back after the half.

BLUE BUFF was unhurried early, advanced rapidly four wide on the turn, blew past VINCERO at the top of the stretch and drew off under pressure.
ALLURSTRA veered out in front of SAINT LARNED and bumped CANDY CRUSHEM at the start, stayed close two then three wide around the turn, rallied
into second through the furlong grounds but could not menace the winner. YES I SEE saved ground outrun to the stretch, and offered a willing finish in the
two-path to earn a share. CHARLIE THE GREEK bumped with VINCERO at the start, moved off the inside shifting out four wide late on the turn, and could
not gain. VINCERO bumped with CHARLIE THE GREEK at the start, vied inside CANDY CRUSHEM through the opening half-mile, edged clear briefly with
five-sixteenths remaining, yielded readily to BLUE BUFF after six furlongs and steadily gave way. CANDY CRUSHEM got bumped by ALLURSTRA at the
start, vied for command outside VINCERO to the turn, and weakened approaching the three-eighths. TOUPHA raced three wide and was through before
reaching the stretch. SAINT LARNED got shut off behind ALLURSTRA at the start, tracked outside the leaders to the turn, and faltered soon after going six
furlongs.

SOLAR WARMING sped to the lead at the start and set a pressured pace with BELGRANO racing in striking distance, cleared over rival around the turn
then put to a drive upper stretch, responded sharply, quickly opened up on the field and continued to pull away along the rail while clearly best. DOCTOR D
J raced four to five wide and settled in early stages, picked up the pace leaving the backstretch and edged up closer around the turn, raced wide entering
top stretch, drifted out wider, continued a steady bid under pressure and gained second best. BELGRANO was forwardly placed around the first turn then
applied pace pressure to SOLAR WARMING down the backstretch, launched a bid for SOLAR WARMING around the far turn, could not gain on pulling
away winner then came out wider for the drive and stayed on for a share. COLIN A WINNER raced five wide entering the first turn, tracked the pace through
early stages then launched a bid entering the turn, kept under pressure three wide in stretch run and needed more for impact. BLAKEY was positioned as a
sharp factor while tracking the early pace, was ridden along to pick up the tempo past the half mile marker and urged around the turn but failed to make
headway and gave way. KRACHENWAGEN raced two wide and steadied in the first turn, settled along inside and saved ground down the backstretch the
had no response when called upon in the final turn. BLUESKY KITTEN broke outward at the start, continued in the back and saved ground, was under a
ride three to four wide upper stretch and failed to move into contention. THE MIGHTY JUDGE settled along the outside not too far off the early pace then
had no response when prompted around the final turn.

Footnotes
UNCONQUERED LEA quickly gained command, rated along inside with several foes in pursuit, shrugged them off without need of encouragement at the
top of the stretch and drew away in hand. EXPRESS PHAROAH broke out bumping PRICING EXERCISE at the start, entered the first turn four wide before
moving in a bit, swung back outside approaching the stretch, and finished well to be clearly second best. LEADING WEST hugged the rail throughout, and
offered a mild response to gain a share. ALPHA DOG prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile.
BATTALION was bumped between horses at the start, saved ground in the second flight early, lacked room behind LEADING WEST at the top of the
stretch, and could not gain when clear. THIS ILL DEFEND broke out bumping BATTALLION at the start, trailed inside to the far turn, moved out widest for
the drive and made no headway. PRICING EXERCISE was bumped between horses at the start, tugged his way forward outside rivals up the backstretch,
and gave way four wide after six furlongs. MAURO'S TEAM bumped with PRICING EXERCISE at the start, moved out four wide nearing the stretch and
posed no threat. LASTING IMAGE bumped with BATTALION at the start, prompted the pace three wide for six furlongs, and tired.

Footnotes
AMERICANUS quickly angled to the rail and settled in early stages, edged up a bit closer moving around the turn, cut the corner and advanced to lead
upper stretch, held a slim advantage over VIOLENT CITY at the furlong marker, dug in gamely along the rail, turned back bid and held firm. VIOLENT CITY
was forwardly placed in opening stages and continued up close while patiently handled, picked up the pace near the quarter pole, moved up to race in aim
for the lead in stretch run but could not reach the game winner. SILVER RATIO raced in range and tracked four wide through early going, let out entering
the turn, kept under a ride four wide a furlong out and secured share. COST BASIS raced in contention under a snug hold in early stages, advanced along
the inside and took over the lead nearing mid-turn, got collared when the winner moved up the inside top of the lane then gave way. RALSTON held a slim
lead in opening stages, continued to dig in on top and held a narrow advantage leaving the backstretch then got headed by COST BASIS nearing the
mid-way point on the turn and steadily weakened. WICKED TEMPTATIONS raced in range between foes then came up empty near three eighths pole and
dropped back. BAD LITTLE BEAST raced a slim margin off of the leader and vied into the turn then came up empty and retreated.

Footnotes
JACKSON broke in bumping ADMIRAL LYNCH at the start, stalked intently outside the latter for a half-mile, challenged under a full drive at the top of the
stretch, reached the front a sixteenth out and edged away. ADMIRAL LYNCH got bumped and pushed into SWEETONTHELADIES by JACKSON at the
start, showed a good turn of foot hustling up to get clear approaching the five-eighths pole, dug in when confronted by JACKSON turning for home, and
yielded grudgingly in deep stretch. EPIC DREAMER settled into a good spot eyeing the leaders in the clear for a half-mile, had aim outside through the lane
but did not have enough. LASTING LEGACY got bumped by SWEETONTHELADIES and took up behind that rival at the break, lagged far back to the
stretch, shifted inward past the eighth-pole and gained belatedly on the wrong lead. FAST PASS was outrun four wide for a half, and gained mildly farthest
out while not a factor. YORKTON lost his footing breaking awkwardly to the outside, raced widest unhurried up the backstretch, and never reached
contention. SWEETONTHELADIES got bumped between horses at the start, saved ground and failed to menace. GOLDENLION led through the first few
strides, dropped back steadily up the backstretch, and was eased up in the stretch.

PENALTY leaned in and bumped the gate at the start then raced two to three wide entering the first turn, was unhurried and settled two wide down the
backstretch, responded willingly when prompted and circled into contention around the final turn, dug in five to four wide in stretch run, advanced to duel for
the late lead with LARGENT, dug in gamely and edged by. LARGENT was forwardly placed around the first turn, applied pace pressure to the leader down
the backstretch, roused for more around the final turn, vied for the lead with AWARD WINNER upper stretch then got by rival while under attack from
PENALTY, kept on gamely but edged out for the win. PROLIFERATE settled along inside and saved ground through early stages, roused along the outside
late far turn, raced wide into the lane, finished with good energy and rallied up for a share. RY'S THE GUY secured inside position on the first turn, stalked
down the backstretch then remained forwardly placed along inside around the far turn, raced in some traffic in stretch run with even response. AWARD
WINNER led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch and around the final turn, vied for the lead entering top stretch, fought
back at the furlong marker then was all out and gave way in final sixteenth. DRAGON BAY rated through early stages not too far off the pace, launched a
three to four wide bid around the final turn, stayed on with interest racing six wide upper stretch but needed more for late impact. EMPIRE OF WAR had a
solid bump with rival at the start, rated near midpack through middle stages, raced two wide around the far turn, briefly in a bit tight then came out a couple
paths and failed to kick on. BIG AGENDA settled in early stages and raced off the pace to the far turn, urged along the outside into stretch run but lacked
the needed response for impact. TIMMY M. raced near midpack through middle stages, saved ground on the final turn then gave way in the lane.
BOURBON WAR got bumped back at the start, remained in the back, moved into stretch three wide then swung wide and failed to move on.
MUSTAAQEEM (AUS) tracked the pace along inside to the far turn, given cue and continued in range upper stretch then gave way. UNCLE MOJO raced
near the rear then three wide into lane to no avail.

FRANK'S ROCKETTE sped to the front and moved inside after the start, edged away around the turn, turned back a brief challenge from SOUND
MACHINE into the stretch and drew away hand urged. SOUND MACHINE advanced to contention four wide midway on the turn, loomed outside the winner
after a half-mile, but could not kick on with that one while clearly best of the others. FUJAIRAH prompted the pace three wide into the turn, weakened past
the quarter-pole and ran on to salvage the show. TALE OF SUCCESS stayed close inside for a half, and came up empty when roused. STILL ALIVE
pressed FRANK'S ROCKETTE into the turn, and retreated after three-eighths of a mile. YESTERDAYONCEMORE (IRE) trailed to the stretch, and had
nothing on the far outside.
