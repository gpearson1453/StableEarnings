THE JOKE'S ON YOU showed the way in hand from the two path, remained patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, went clear
under a mild drive and was ridden out to the finish. DA BERG six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest and second best.
WISECRACK five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to
three wide for home and tired. GO WITH HONOR three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and tired. FREUDIAN ANALYST showed brief speed from the four path down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under a
ride at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
COLD HEARTED PEARL hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand three to four wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
under some pressure at times from LINDA'S BALLET to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive and held well and safe to prevail. RADIANTRITHYM got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was taken in hand when
squeezed back at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased four then three wide down the backstretch from near the rear before tucking
to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well to secure the place honors
latching on the aforementioned foe as that rival hit the finish. KEEP YOUR DISTANCE broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back RADIANTRITHYM
in concert with ZECHA, chased four then three wide from just off the pace, tucked to the two path near the quarter pole before cutting the corner into upper
stretch, tipped out from in behind the eventual winner just inside the eighth pole two then three wide and kept on clear for the show honors. LINDA'S
BALLET prompted the leader from the four path briefly before being shaken off a bit to chase in closest aim, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and
advanced once more to apply pressure through the latter portion of the turn, went three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
NOWITNA RIVER three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths while under a stout near side rein appearing to be floating out a bit,
angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ZECHA broke out at the start bumping RADIANTRITHYM and in turn got bumped from
pressure outside by KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, squeezed back RADIANTRITHYM in tandem with that rival conceding about two lengths to the front, chased
two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. COVER PHOTO five then six wide in
pursuit, got placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, went six wide at the head of the stretch and offered no rally. MAZMANIA six then five wide in
pursuit, came under a ride midway on the turn, continued five to six wide at the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BAD GUY broke a beat slow and lost his lane to the breaking inwards RIDOLFO, briefly took to be well off the inside in the early stages lightly coaxed along
before tucking to the two path six furlongs out, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths and tucked to the inside at the five-sixteenths in front of the
fading BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command straightened away and edged clear under a drive kept to
task. DR. DEVERA'S WAY hustled from the gate, raced six paths off the inside in aim of the front early on before advancing in tandem with MINE THE
COIN to vie outside a trio with nine-sixteenths remaining, tucked three wide into the turn and emerged from the pace dispute with RIDOLFO at the
three-eighths to knock heads through the latter portion of the bend taking narrow advantage before cornering three wide into upper stretch, got displaced
straightened away and ran on to preserve the place honors on the wire. LEGION STORM chased four then five wide under a ride from the three-eighths,
continued four to five wide into upper stretch, kept on to be along clear for the show honors. SOUL FIGHT chased three then four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, offered up a mild bid swinging three to four wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move and weakened in the stretch.
MINE THE COIN five wide in range of the front early on, ranged up in concert with DR/ DEVERA'S WAY to vie between foes among a quartet with
nine-sixteenths to go, tucked three wide into the turn and got shaken off near the three-eighths when placed to coaxing, faded through the latter portion of
the turn, swung three to four wide for home and tired. RIDOLFO dueled early on from the four path with BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE to his inside, got joined by
an additional pair at the nine-sixteenths and vied between foes into the turn tucking to the two path, emerged from the pace dispute knocking heads three
furlongs from home with DR. DEVERA'S WAY, got headed for the front inside the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide for home and tired.
BRIDGETOTHEFUTURE bobbled at the start, dueled early on with the aforementioned foe before vying inside a trio at the nine-sixteenths into the turn,
tucked inside through the bend and was shaken off three furlongs out, faded and was taken hold of briefly as BAD GUY took to the rail directly in front near
the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
QUASAR three wide in closest aim of the leader, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the final eighth and
was up in the last jumps to prevail. GOTTAHAVEAHOLIDAY showed the way in hand three to four wide, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the final furlong and was nailed in the last jumps. JASMINESQUE six paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure
the show honors. CAPRAIA'S DESTINY hustled from the gate, strode greenly three then two wide, tucked briefly inside before getting out three wide at the
seven-sixteenths under a stiff near side grip, faded while striding green in the turn, went four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the last major
share. HICKORY MADE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. LOVELY LUCKY
chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
made no impact. EMPIRITA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired.

straightened away to the two path at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive dueling through the final furlong, got nudged late and got the nod on the wire.

command spinning just off the inside for home, got roused at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat to the outside, came out a path late nudging the
aforementioned foe in the shadow of the wire when getting nailed at the finish. GIANT SHOES showed the way under some pressure while three wide down
the backstretch, had the aforementioned foe advance and dueled through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home,
weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. WILD BANKER chased four then five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
swung five wide for home, weakened in the stretch. FOREVER WICKED chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home and tired. BELLARMINE HALL five wide in pursuit, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued five wide into upper stretch and

Footnotes
ILCHESTER CHEETAH hustled from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish. KANSAS KIS chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out a path at the three-sixteenths and offered up a mild kick to close in belatedly
while clear for the place honors. FIERCE LADY bobbled at the break, chased two to three wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. LOVE OF MY HEART broke in at the start and was corrected, chased along the inside under a ride from
the seven-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. LEAVEUWITHASMILE three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at
the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. WICKED AMBER five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing with seven-sixteenths remaining, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. AUTONOMOUS forwardly
placed four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, swung four wide for home, faltered
and was eased through the final furlong.
