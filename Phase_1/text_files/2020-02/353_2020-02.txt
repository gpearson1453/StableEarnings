Footnotes
CLASSY NEKIA prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, drew on even terms for the lead past the quarter pole, battled the length of the stretch and
proved best in a game effort. COLETTA stalked the pace from the three path for six furlongs, circled three wide to gain a narrow advantage near the furlong
marker, dug in determinedly but couldn't handle the winner. ODDS GET EVEN away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened.
PAY NO RENT failed to menace. EDDIE AT BAT had speed for a half then faded. OVERLAY was through early.

FRANKIE'S GIFT prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch and just lasted under a strong hand ride. CHAOS
never far back, dug in determinedly in the four path through deep stretch and just missed getting up in time. UNTAPPED ENERGY offered a mild bid into
the stretch then leveled off. CARLEXA passed tiring rivals. ULTERED PERCEPTION failed to menace. MISS BOMBON chased the pace four then three
wide into the turn, loomed boldly near the quarter pole then came up empty. GUN THING had brief speed. VERA'S SMART TRIP bobbled at the start,
rushed to the lead before a quarter, had speed into the turn then was used up.

AWESOME HALO prompted the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, assumed command, set the balance of the pace and widened through the
stretch under right handed urging to win going away. DINESEN vied for the lead in the four path and finished clearly second best. GIANT'S FORREST set
the pace along the inside through the clubhouse turn, remained a sharp threat pressing the pace into the stretch then was outfinished. BORA BORA moved
up along the inside entering the second turn then leveled off. BATTLE CROSSING well placed, weakened in the stretch. CEE'S AWESOME checked along
the rail behind the leader on the first turn, dropped back then trailed.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT SUPER away alertly, set the pace under confident handling and shook clear in the stretch under mild urging to win going away. DIVINE SPARK
pressed the pace two wide and gamely held on for second. SHESMYHEARTANDSOUL stalked the pace two wide and finished determinedly. LORETTAS
SONG allowed to settle, finished with courage courage along the inside. DANCER'S KISS failed to menace. SPRINGDETTI with the second flight two wide,
lacked the needed response. SHARP HENNY had sped into the turn then wilted. AZIFORCAST was no factor. TENACIOUS TRUDY broke in a tangle and
trailed.
