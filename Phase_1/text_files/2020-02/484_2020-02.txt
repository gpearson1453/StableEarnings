Footnotes
STERLING MISS off a step slow, trailed for a half, steered out four wide late in the turn, widest drive, long drive, in time. JOSIE THE E F FIVE settled off the
pace and the inside, three wide advance to take over turning for home, clear late, nipped in the final strides, remained clear for the place. C P QUALITY
lacked early foot, began to move in the two path late in the turn, angled toward the inside past the furlong marker, up for the show. HAWT MESS chased the
early leader off the inside, advanced and challenged between rivals turning for home, weakened, caught late for the show. SOPHIE'S ANGEL lacked speed,
was four wide out of the turn, made little impact. TIZANILLUSION within striking distance along the inside, came up empty. FAIRWAYNGREEN used a bit
early, clear before a quarter, showed the way through the turn, gave way when headed into the stretch.

Footnotes
SYCAMORE RUN away in good order, dueled up front in the two path, shook off the other speed turning for home, steadily increased advantage under
token encouragement to win ridden out. PLANE TALK broke sharp, dueled up front inside the winner, could not match that one in the drive, clear for the
place. SHANGHAI'S DREAM lacked speed, saved ground in the second flight through the turn, finished up best of the rest, no threat to the top two. RIP IT
RYAN within striking distance while racing three wide, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing punch. CONNECTION raced off the pace in the two path,
also lacked a closing response. STOCK DEAL stumbled badly at the start, raced well back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. BIG BIZ
four wide through the turn when with the second group, tired in the drive. SOUTHSIDE SWIG behind the leaders, steady fade in the two path.

under steady handling. HALEYS HEIST settled off the early pace off the inside, advanced into contention three wide exiting the turn, brushed repeatedly

saved ground through the turn, mild late interest to improve position slightly. PUNISH off a step slow, saved ground into and through the turn, improved
position while continuing inside. MICHELLE'S GRACE went evenly while racing three wide. FRONTIER WOMAN bobbled to be off slowly, remained back.
WACCA WACCA WACCA dueled early inside through a quick opening quarter, continued to vie through the turn, gave way in the drive. FLAT PRECIOUS

Footnotes
ITS MY BAG BABY in the second flight while racing off the inside for a half, two path through the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, outside bid late, proved
narrow;ly best in determined fashion. TIME HEIST broke in mid pack, moved a bit closer behind the leaders along the inside into the turn, saved ground
through the turn, also shifted out slightly for room in the drive, bid between rivals late, missed. WENYEN chased the early leader, moved to challenge
through the turn, dueled into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the top two til late. GUMWRAPPER broke alertly, clear early inside, dueled through the
turn, weakened a bit late while remaining along the inside. PROFUSION lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, roused, showed some belated
interest to improve position. RAHAAL went one paced in the two path. TOUGH COMPANY settled off the pace while racing in the three path, failed to
muster a rally. THAT DUDE off a step slow, trailed early, between rivals into the lane, improved slightly by passing tiring rivals. SIETE LEGUAS forwardly
placed for a half in the three path, gave way in the drive. RISKY SITUATION was never a threat while racing just off the inside. SILVER HIT failed to
menace while racing three out to four wide.

Footnotes
PNEUMATIC outrun early outside after bobbling just after the start, raced three out to four wide exiting the turn, roused, long drive, outside bid, proved best
under firm handling. SKOL FACTOR ducked out at the start, raced forwardly and three wide, challenged into the lane, held a narrow advantage past the
furlong marker, outkicked in the late going, clear for the place. LIAM'S PRIDE broke out, raced forwardly inside, continued to race forwardly through the turn
and into the stretch, drifted out then in stretch, could not get to the top two late. ONAWAY last to leave, raced back and off the inside, came four wide into
the lane, displayed some mild interest well out in the strip. NORTH SIDE squeezed at the start, moved up to duel inside, continued to vie into the stretch,
gradually weakened in the drive. DIVINE MIRACLE went evenly in the two path. STURGILL alternated up front in the two path for a half and faltered. BABA
LOU brushed at the start, remained back. WITHERSPOON trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SOMETHING NATURAL settled in the second flight inside, patiently handled behind the leaders into and through most of the final turn, eased out into the
two path entering the stretch, bid soon after, drove clear, kept to task. DAVIDIC LINE lacked speed toward the inside,moved closer in traffic midway on the
final turn, three wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, held sway for the place. LIFE ON THE ROAD took back to trail after being last away,
continued unhurried while saving ground, continued along the inside final turn, moved out a bit, rallied, outkicked late for the place. ALPHA SIXTY SIX broke
back, raced back off the pace, steadied to avoid a stricken rival onto the backstretch, advanced in the four path to a forward position in the final turn,
flattened out in the drive. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY settled off the pace and the inside, three wide and evenly paced through the final turn, in some traffic
turning for home, went evenly. NEW EAGLE broke on top, set the pace inside, gave way in the drive. PLAY THE WILDCARD forwardly placed while three
wide, had little left for the drive. TICK TACK MO pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled the middle half mile, faltered in the drive. DEVIL'S DRAMA
back off the pace and the inside, pulled up in apparent distress onto the backstretch, vanned off.

Footnotes
LEXI ON THE MOVE forwardly placed while toward the inside early, steered out to be three wide late in the turn, pushed along with a vigorous hand ride
past the furlong marker to win going away. CATECHISM vied early off the inside, dueled through the turn in the two path, proved no match for the winner
the final furlong, clearly second best. WICKED SMART away in good order, set or forced the pace along the inside, weakened in the drive, saved the show.
AUSTIN'S GAL went evenly in the three path. COLLUDE stumbled at the start, quickly recovered to race back off the pace inside, continued to save ground
through the turn, continued in even fashion through the lane. CAGED BEAR made little impact while racing three wide. MAGICALLY HONORED bothered,
off slowly, remained back to be always outrun. COCO CABALLO remained always back.

Footnotes
MOJO MAN outrun for a half, raced four out to five wide exiting the turn, set down while widest for the drive, up in time while remaining outside of the first
flight. MANNY WAH settled in mid pack early, three wide and in some traffic turn, asked along into the lane, late bid while inside the winner and between
rivals, missed in a good effort. OPERATION STEVIE last away, void of any early foot, made a good gain to reach contention while angling out three wide
late in the turn, inside the winner entering the stretch, late bid between horses, not enough late, missed the place. NERO pressed the issue early while out
in the strip, dueled late in the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, folded up in the late going to lose several position. GORDY FLORIDA raced
back off the early pace out in the strip, moved closer four wide through the turn then flattened out in the drive. FLAT LUCKY saved ground to no avail.
OURBESTFRIEND D L broke alertly, narrowly set the early pace along the inside, dueled through the turn and weakened. MISTER BANJOMAN flashed
early foot off the inside, backed up after a half. WESTFEST in some early traffic behind the pace, faded.

Footnotes
RING LEADER bobbled slightly at the start, moved out three wide when rating just off the early leaders, challenged on the outside turning for home, shook
clear nearing the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. SPECIALLY last away, light encouragement early, closer inside, asked along
late turn, moved out, roused for the drive, finished up willingly to be slowly getting to the winner, too late. WASABI GIRL unhurried while off the inside, three
wide turn, staged a mild rally to annex the third spot, no threat to the top two. SASSY SENECA pressed the pace in the two path, gradually weakened
through the lane. MISS FIRECRACKER broke sharp, set the early pace inside, vied turn while continuing to save ground, gave way in the drive.

BONNY SOUTH raced back off the pace outside, began to advance three wide in the second turn, hooked up with the runner up for the stretch run,
outkicked that one to the wire. SHEDARESTHEDEVIL forwardly placed past the wire the first time, settled off the inside, moved closest to the leader after a
half, easily collared that rival when straightened for home, briefly dueled inside the winner late, second best. JILTED BRIDE void of early foot, continued
back into the far turn in the two path, staged a mild rally to be well clear of the others, no threat to the top pair. SHE'S ALL WOLFE lacked speed, raced in
the two path much of the way, came three wide into the stretch, mild interest to improve position. SEAHAWK LISA turned in an even effort toward the inside.
