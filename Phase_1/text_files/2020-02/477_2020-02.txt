IT'S BIG AINE was outrun to the half, bid two then three wide to the stretch, shifted out, split rivals in mid stretch, rallied determinedly and prevailed driving.
AUTISM'S QUEST tracked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to the stretch, dueled to mid stretch then could not stall the winner while not
threatened for second. ANGELIN THE HARBOR had the best speed, set the pace from the rail for six furlongs, was overtaken in mid stretch then
weakened. SATIN MUSIC had no speed, settled to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. MUSKETIER
WALTZ also settled for a half mile while four wide, remained four wide to the stretch then did not rally. I C FIRE raced mid pack to the second turn, was
outside a rival to the stretch and also lacked a closing response. FANTASY GOLF GAL stalked the pace to the second turn, offered her best try two wide to
the stretch but was outkicked to mid stretch and tired. SILVER SCRIPT was also settled to the half then saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
CASH MONEY was outrun to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then rallied inside to take over and edge clear driving. CARTERS BLUE tracked the
leaders to the turn, was fanned four wide while rallying to the stretch, got to terms with the winner in mid stretch but was outfinished while not threatened for
second. BABY YOU GOT IT stalked the pace inside to the turn, shifted out three wide, rallied and also was on terms briefly nearing mid stretch then was
outkicked to the line. CHANGING IMAGE chased the pace two wide to the stretch, eased out in upper stretch but lacked a late response. TANNER'S MY
NAME had no speed, saved ground to the stretch then angled out but also did not rally. FORT YORK attended the pace two wide to the stretch, got
outkicked to mid stretch and tired. KLAY NATION was a paced factor inside to the stretch then gave way.

JAIMI JAMES was well placed to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and closed steadily to prevail. LORETTA set
the pace under pressure to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch, dug in determinedly, could not stall the winner but held off MISS INDEFATIGABLE
for second. MISS INDEFATIGABLE The latter bumped AMERICAN ROYALTY at the start then pressed LORETTA to the second turn, responded to get to
terms with that one in mid stretch, could not get by and hung late. AMERICAN ROYALTY was bumped by MISS INDEFATIGABLE at the start, had no
speed, was fanned four wide on the second turn and lacked a closing response. ROUGE BOUQUET had no speed, saved ground on both turns but was
never a threat. LIVE IT WELL stalked the pace for five furlongs while four wide then gave way. SHELBYDOODLE (IRE) was rank and hard to settle into the
first turn, had no speed and gave out in the stretch.

terms to mid stretch but weakened in the late stages. AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM tracked the pace to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then came
up empty in the drive. CZECHMIGHT broke a bit slow then hustled to the front and angled in, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid
stretch then tired. FINAL FINAL was outrun to the second turn, swung five wide to the stretch but did not threaten in the drive. MYSTERIOUS STONES was
stalking the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but weakened in the lane. PRAISE LOUDLY checked in traffic on the first turn, settled on

JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT hesitated at the start then broke out and lost about six lengths to begin, trailed to the turn, was two wide to mid turn, angled out
sharply to the five path into the stretch, responded when set down and closed with a rush to win going away. ILLAPAWNIE was outsprinted to the turn,
raced two wide to the stretch then finished willingly to tag MAY SONG for second. MAY SONG had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch,
pushed clear to mid stretch then was tiring, got collared by the winner late and nipped for the place. ST. ANNIE'S INDY tracked the pace to the turn, was
fanned four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch and finished evenly. EXSQUEEZE ME stalked the pace to the turn, shifted off the rail and was
two wide to the stretch then was also outrun to mid stretch and weakened. ENVY had no speed and saved ground to the stretch but could not make an
impact in the drive. DARLING DEMON pressed the pace to the turn, came three wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and tired. HEART
STREET got outsprinted to the turn, was fanned out to the five path to the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LA SHIRIMP was rank and hard to
place on the backstretch, raced three wide into the turn then swung out six deep but gave out through the stretch.
