tracked the early pace, went five wide into the second turn, angled out, was no match and finished second best. TRUST N PRAYER was void of any early
speed, raced between rivals into the home turn and was along for the show position. WAYLAY set a pressured pace, raced off the rail and faded in the
drive. TOX was unhurried early, circled seven wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. GERDA'S GONE pressed pace, raced between rivals into
the turn and tired. MOVE IT MISTER was reserved off the pace, went four wide into the turn and never fired. FIREWATER BUZZ forced the early pace, from
between rivals and retreated.

Footnotes
INVODKAWETRUST raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down EVIL ITCH in the
final sixteenth to but going away late. EVIL ITCH broke sharply to press the pace of GETTIN WESTERN while racing three-wide, moved up to take
command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not match strides
with the winner late. REVENOOR WOMAN was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane but lacked the
needed closing response. INDIAS LUTE pressed the pace from between foes, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. ALL TOO SUPER
lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and failed to menace. GETTIN WESTERN set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after
going a half. BIG BELLA showed brief speed and weakened. INDIA WILKES reared at the start and unseated her rider.
