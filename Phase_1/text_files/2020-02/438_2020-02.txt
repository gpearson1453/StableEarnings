Footnotes
MISS KITTY MAE broke sharply to duel or the early advantage with GLACIER POINT while racing three-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and held her stable-mate at bay to the wire. SWEET CAROLINA chased the winner while racing three-wide throughout and failed to
gain on that foe in the drive. FIGURE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and did not threaten.
HARD SPUN GAL was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GLACIER POINT was away alertly to dispute
the pace with the winner from the inside and weakened after going three furlongs.

seven wide into the turn, ranged up in mid stretch and just missed. TYGER TENNESSEE was taken back early, circled eight wide through the turn and
flattened out in drive. AMOR N PASION raced in mid pack early, advanced three wide into the turn and evenly. REBOUNDER pressed the early pace from
between rivals and tired. FLYING FALCON set a pressured early pace, from the inside and faded. A ZENON NITE was unhurried early, went six wide into
the turn, angled out and offered no late rally. ALMOST A STORM was allowed to settle early, raced between rivals and was empty late. ATTILA'S LEGEND
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DISCLOSED was allowed to settle early, circled four-wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole, gained command with a quarter to run and steadily drew clear.
BASHFUL BOB was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up to offer a bid in tandem with NAVARONE SANTASONG nearing the seven-sixteenths
marker, vied with that rival but could not match strides with the winner in the drive. NAVARONE SANTASONG settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide nearing the seven-sixteenths pole to offer a bid, vied with BASHFUL BOB into the stretch and gave way grudgingly. JACKS ZEN raced six-wide
through the first turn, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way gradually. J C STREET was forwardly placed from the inside, checked
nearing the half, dropped back and did not menace thereafter. AZTEC EMPEROR bobbled at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. SPECIAL EXCESS raced five-wide through the first turn, set a pressured pace from off the rail and weakened after going a
half. CITY LIGHTS WHO drifted out through the first turn, showed brief speed and weakened.
