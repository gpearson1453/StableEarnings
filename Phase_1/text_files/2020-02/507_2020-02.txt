Footnotes
NEVADAN set the pace, responded to pressure and drew clear past the eighth pole and held under steady urging. ASSETS INCLUDED raced close to the
pace, challenged along the inside on the turn, contended along the rail past the eighth pole, altered course, continued in a game effort and gained late.
WILLIAM CROTTY was reluctant to load, never far off the pace, went five wide at the top of the stretch, lacked a rally and held safely for show. CEDAR
RAPIDS trailed far back, closed inside and passed a tiring rival. JONNY'S CHOICE showed speed to the second turn, swung out, dropped back and faded
through the stretch.

BEST TWO MINUTES stalked the pace, bid willingly and wore down his rival to get up late. GENERAL IKE set the pace to deep stretch and was outclosed
despite steady urging in a game effort. DUKATI was never far back, raced outside, rallied into the turn to loom a threat, swung eight wide, fell back and
settled for show. VIDAKS BACK stalked the pace while racing inside, was steadied entering the turn, fell back and finished evenly. CHELOKEE'S LEGACY
was outrun in an even effort. RONTON broke out, raced six wide along the backstretch, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. DREAM
ON FOR SPEED showed speed to the turn, dropped back, angled in and had no further response.

Footnotes
FIERY CAUSE was unhurried early, saved ground, rallied around the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly, got up past the eighth pole and drew clear. HER
NAME IS UM broke out, was void of early speed, bid six wide leaving the turn, closed well and got up late for place. WARNING BELLE sprinted clear to set
the pace past the eighth pole, was unable to sustain her bid and settled for show. THE MALLARD QUEEN broke in the air to be off slowly, raced far back
and finished well inside. PRINCESS NICOLE raced in the back, found her best stride late and was gaining ground. DESTINY'S STORM raced mid pack, bid
five wide to get within range and came up empty late. DAT CAT MIRACLE chased the pace, bid, came up empty and dropped back.

Footnotes
BLUE JEANS N BEER set the pace, drew off in the drive and was kept to task. CASUALITY stalked the pace while racing inside, lacked a rally and finished
second best. CHEAP O CHARLIE raced mid pack, bid between horses on the turn, fell back and held for show. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL raced far back, went
ten wide at the top of the stretch and improved position. CAUSEWAY RUNNER advanced to the turn, swung nine wide and dropped back. AWESOME E K
pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. ALLEN'S CROWN was fractious in the gate, showed brief speed and stopped.

EL BELL CAMP assumed command outside, drew clear on the turn and held well under mild urging. FICETY LADY got away well, pressed the pace while
racing between horses, fell back, angled out, closed willingly, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best. BLUEGRASS BETTY led early, fell
back, bid inside leaving the turn, hung late and held safely for show. MISS WINE TOPPER pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back, angled
in, bid and hung. NOUMEA was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a mild bid only. WAIT FOR LOVE raced mid pack in an even effort and
did not threaten. HONOURAPRILSRULES was rank at the start and outrun. KOLOCHA broke slowly and was not a factor. SHAREMYWAY had brief speed
only.

Footnotes
MONUMENTAL SEVEN was never far off the pace, rallied into the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily, got up near the sixteenth pole and inched away. TOO
AWESOME sprinted clear to set the pace to the sixteenth pole and yielded grudgingly in a good effort. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM saved ground while never
far back, bid three wide leaving the turn, closed steadily, didn't have enough late and earned show. GOOCH EXPRESS was unhurried early, advanced to
the turn, bid and hung. OUR MONEY CAT saved ground, bid inside and came up empty. YEREVAN SONG raced outside, went seven wide leaving the turn
and lacked a stretch response. PAPA JOE broke slowly and failed to threaten in an even effort. ME broke awkwardly and was not a factor. MIDNIGHT IN
MAUI failed to contend and was not urged late. PRICELESS ALLSTAR raced in close outside, was through after a half, stopped and not urged late.
