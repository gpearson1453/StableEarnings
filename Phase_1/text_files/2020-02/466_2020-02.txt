Footnotes
DAPPER JACK broke on top, cleared toward the inside into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way through the second
turn, remained clear through the stretch under steady handling. DANGERFIELD last to leave, continued to lack speed, crept closer three wide through the
final turn, brief, mild bid from the outside nearing midstretch, no further inroads on the winner, clear of the others. CHICORY BLUE within striking distance
while racing three wide, lacked a closing response in the drive. CANDY MY BOY saved ground to no avail. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN chased the winner from
the two path in the early going, had little left for the drive. PLENTIFUL trailed throughout, showed little.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) away in good order, helped set a lively pace toward the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, drew out steadily under
firm handling. HIDDEN PROMISE forwardly placed under some encouragement, stalked the leaders up the backstretch, dropped inside second turn, proved
no match for the winner in the drive, lasted for the place. AGITATOR last to leave, raced unhurried along the inside, continued to save ground through the
final bend, slowly getting to the runner up late. HOT IRON void of speed, dropped inside and saved ground through the second turn, improved position
without posing a serious threat. KINETIC SWAGGER broke alertly, dueled up front outside the winner, gave way exiting the final turn. BRACKETOLOGIST
raced back, was continuing to be outrun, got out late in the final turn, not a threat in the drive. MOONLIGHT BEACH settled off the leaders in the three path,
had nothing left for the drive. GLOBUS settled in mid pack while out in the strip, carried wide turning into the stretch, remained well back.

Footnotes
PLATINUM NIGHTS in the second flight just off the inside, continued in the second group through the turn, traffic nearing midstretch, brushed, split foes,
proved narrowly best in game fashion. FIRERY TALE last to leave, raced back and just off the inside, angled out four wide late in the bend, widest for the
drive, outkicked in the late going. ATTAIN SUCCESS in the second flight outside the winner, came four wide into the stretch, brushed with the winner then
challenged with a furlong remaining between foes, not enough for the top two in the final strides. JIMMY AT LAST away in good order, dueled up front
closest to the rail, continued to vie upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly the final furlong. SPENDAHOLIC forwardly placed, four wide into the turn, three
wide bid midway on the bend, weakened slightly in the drive while drifting in a bit. HIS GIANT set or forced the pace in the two path, faltered in the final
furlong from between rivals. MICHAEL T was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
ENJAY'S BRASS in the second flight just off the inside, angled out three wide late in the turn, outside bid, set down for the drive, edged clear under
continued firm handling. MIA PROMESSA settled off the pace, saved all the ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied for the place.
FABULOUS GIRL broke outward, prompted the pace while three wide, floated out four wide turning for home to lose some position, came back for the
show, outkicked for the place. SAUCY AT MIDNIGHT last to leave, raced well back and inside, picked off some tiring rivals late while not a serious threat.
CIPHERIN' SUE lacked speed, was never a threat off the inside. DESTINY'S LOVE broke out but sharply, narrowly set the pace off the inside for four
furlongs, weakened in the drive. SASSY SETA pressed the pace from along the inside, gave way.

Footnotes
HERITAGE PARK away well, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed turning into the stretch, drew well clear in the drive under
steady handling. MY GOLDEN DIABLO back off the early pace, four wide when beginning to advance into the turn, three wide into the stretch, drew clear for
the place, no match for the winner. TEMPT FATE in the second group just off the inside, continued in the two path through the turn, along for the show late,
no real threat to the top two. PRIVATE LAKE lacked early foot, improved along the inside into the stretch, flattened a bit in the late going. MACHO ROCCO
dueled up front while off the inside, faltered in the drive. HESLUCK pinched back to be off slowly, raced back and three wide, improved slightly, not a
serious threat. EXPLOSIVE SHOES veered into the gap at the start, raced back, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. TEN BUDS mid pack,
tired while racing thee wide. KURTS RAIDER remained always back in the two path. HAMAZING SONG tired while racing three wide. DINNER AT
CRUMPIES forced into the gap just after the start, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LIEUTENANT POWELL close up from the start, pressed, vied three wide turn, long drive, wore down rival late. RIDE TO THE WIRE broke sharp, narrowly
set the pace along the inside, continued to narrowly show the way past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. ADMIRAL BROWN lacked early
foot, saved some ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, dropped back in, rallied late while up the inside to finish up willingly. GOOSE
DRANK WINE forwardly placed early toward the inside, moved up to vie for the lead between horses in the turn, gradually weakened in the drive. SUPER
TERRIFIC in mid pack early well out in the strip, four wide through the turn, continued evenly through the stretch. BELMONT HILLS within striking distance
off the inside, had little left for the drive. BLOWINTHEBLUESAWAY made little impact. SCOOTER'S BOY remained always back. MARSHALL HILL last
away, trailed early, was never close.

Footnotes
BIG BELLA BROWN closest to the leader, took over in the two path turning for home, dueled to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. JUNIOR
GILLIAM forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer three wide turning for home, dueled to the wire, outkicked. NO FUNNY BIZ settled off the pace,
moved out to the three path turn, staged a mild rally to annex the show. KOWBOY KARMA last away, trailed for a half, moved out to be widest for the drive,
mild interest to improve position. YOU'RE KILLIN ME lacked speed, moved out to be three wide late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch. ST. LOUIE
GUY settled behind the pace inside, came up empty for the drive. R FAST LIFE remained always back. EUROBOND broke sharp, sprinted clear along the
inside, stopped when headed entering the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
FIRECROW broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace, shrugged off a rival turning for home, clear a furlong out, enough left to hold the runner up safe
late. AUGIE forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer in the three path turn, fell back off the winner nearing midstretch, coming again late to close the
gap. SABRENA'S BLING void of early foot, four wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally while widest in the drive, gained the nod for the show. DUNPH
settled off the pace toward the inside, traffic midway on the turn, moved out slightly, some late interest to be closing the gap late, missed the show.
LULLABY BLING within striking distance while between rivals, 2nd flight turn, eased out, empty late. TUT'S REVENGE in the second group while racing
toward the inside, in some traffic turn, went evenly through the stretch while continuing along the inside. NICE WORK away well, pressed the winner from off
the inside, faltered in the drive. IMPRESSED off slowly, raced back, moved out, lodged a mild middle move four wide in the turn, faded through the lane.
CHARLIE'S SCHILLER off a step slow, remained always back.

Footnotes
JOAN'S DELIGHT forwardly placed off the inside, challenged into the lane, put a head in front just inside the furlong marker, dug in late to gain the nod.
ROCK CITY ROADHOG lacked speed, advanced five wide into contention exiting the turn, late bid outside the winner, finished willingly to narrowly miss.
FIVE O ONE within striking distance early outside, vied into and through upper stretch, not enough in the late going. MARVELOUS THUNDER bit slow to
settle early, moved closer late backstretch inside, behind horses in the turn, brief wait in the two path late in the bend, steered inside a furlong out, finished
up willingly. WEAST HILL narrowly set the early pace in the two path, continued to vie into and through the turn, still with the leaders past the furlong
marker, gave ground grudgingly. MEANBONE off a step slow, remained back. BUD RO lacked early foot, three wide into the lane, lacked a late punch.
BURTNJOE vied up front along the inside, gave way when straightened for home.
