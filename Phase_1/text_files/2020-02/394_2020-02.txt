Footnotes
DOC KANE was urged inside rivals prompting the pace racing into the turn, gained the advantage racing into upper stretch, edged clear under firm
encouragement and was taken in hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. AMERICANO vied with the first flight three wide between foes racing
to the turn, was eased outside foes nearing the lane, shifted out four wide and continued with a steady effort to edge a rival for the place honors. KITCHEN
POLICE joined the pace five deep in the opening furlong, shifted inwards racing into the turn prompting the leaders but weakened in late stages. KING
DUDE OF OCALA, off a step slowly, then brushed at the start, settled last to the turn, saved ground gaining some position racing into the lane but made no
real impact. SENT FROM HEAVEN, in touch with the first flight four wide between foes in the opening quarter, faded racing into the turn. WILD WIGGLIN
JACK, urged to dispute the pace from the outset on a narrow advantage between foes racing to the turn, couldn't match the winner after a half and gave
way midstretch.

Footnotes
QUARTERMASTER broke awkwardly, then was a bit rank under restraint while being switched outside rivals racing through the backstretch, continued in
the four path nearing the turn, advanced on the pacesetter three deep nearing upper stretch to challenge for command, pressed the issue past midstretch
and edged forward late under firm left handed encouragement to prevail. FUNNEL CLOUD, urged to the fore from the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow
margin racing a bit off the inside, maintained the advantage to upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second best. ARES
WARRIOR, reserved last in the opening quarter, angled outside foes racing into the turn while being urged to advance in the four path to upper stretch but
finished evenly in the closing stages. CITY CAT, forwardly placed three deep between tracking just off the pacesetter racing into the turn, faded into upper
stretch. ROCKY JOHN angled to the inside early while being prompted in brief pursuit of the pacesetter racing into the turn but gave way nearing the lane.
MIGHTY PETE dropped out early.

FAST FAIRY came through close quarters at the start to track off the first flight along the inside, shifted out three deep nearing the midway point of the far
turn while being prompted to advance, gained terms with the pacesetter pressing the issue in a prolonged drive past midstretch and prevailed in time under
firm left handed encouragement. ONE MORE DRINK, urged to terms prompting a rival's pace racing into the first turn, took over entering the far turn,
resisted the winner's challenge in a grudging effort but failed to contain that rival late. READY TO MINGLE came through close quarters at the start, then
was reserved along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out to split foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a
share. MY COMPUTER tracked off the first flight three deep racing to the backstretch and faded after a half. IFEELGOOD broke sharply, dictated the pace
on a narrow margin along the inside to the second bend and gave way into the lane. ROCKY DIPLOMAT came through close quarters at the start, then was
caught four wide racing to the first turn, angled inside while being roused to advance after a half but soon retreated. CAPABLE MAN proved no factor.

challengers on a clear margin under firm encouragement. FLASHING RED tracked off the first flight along the inside, split foes advancing to challenge
racing into the far turn, was urged to advance nearest the rail to challenge the winner but couldn't gain terms with that foe while edging a rival for the place
honors. DIVINE MARTHA broke inwards brushing FASHION RULES, tracked just off the leaders outside foes racing three deep to the backstretch, was
prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn but lacked the needed final kick. ELUSIVE AMELIA sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the
pace on a narrow margin through the backstretch, then gave way racing through the far turn. SINISTER SIREN was settled last to the backstretch and never
gained contention. PACT, off last, was caught four wide racing into the first turn while prompted to contention but dropped out early.

Footnotes
BIG DOLLAR BILL was settled last racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide entering the far turn gaining momentum, continued with a steady
advanced in that path to challenge for command near midstretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm handling. NAVY ARMED GUARD, caught
four wide racing into the first turn, angled inwards to track off the leaders between foes, was promoted to challenge three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch and contested the issue to late stages while being just outkicked by the winner. NO DOZING, forwardly placed along the rail prompting a rival's pace
into the backstretch, gained a brief advantage while shifting just off the rail on the far turn, dueled between foes into the stretch but weakened in the closing
stages. FIREMAN OSCAR was rated along the inside tracking the leaders in the opening half, saved ground through the far turn, was prompted to lodge a
brief bid inside foes when presented an opening in upper stretch but soon flattened out. LOOKIN TO STRIKE, urged to gain a forward placing racing three
deep into the backstretch, gave way racing through the far turn. WELL DEFINED, restless in the gate, was urged to dispute the pace on a narrow advantage
outside a rival racing into the backstretch but gave way early.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE RYDER tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the backstretch, took over entering the far turn, gained a commanding advantage
racing into upper stretch and was kept to stout left handed encouragement to widen to the end. OUR PETUNIA angled inwards a bit racing into the first turn
to track off the second flight under light rating, was prompted to advance between foes racing into the far turn in pursuit of the eventual winner but couldn't
gain terms with that foe while proving best of the others. RED KITTEN tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside in the opening half, switched out
racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance three deep into the stretch but had no rally. GIFTED PATH sped to the lead while angling to the rail,
set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn and gave way. LADY AND ME dwelt at the start, was prompted to gain a position off the second flight outside
foes racing into the backstretch, continued four wide into the far turn and proved no threat. BOURBON TRACE, reserved along the inside while dropping
into last, failed to menace. CARAMEL MOON tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch and emptied out after a
half.

OUTBURST (GB), caught five deep nearing the first turn, was rated off the second flight while angling inwards racing to the backstretch, steadily drew on
terms with the second flight while shifting out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, came under some hand urging in that path to challenge the
pacesetter near midstretch, then was taken in hand after his rider confirmed the issue was decided to maintain a narrow advantage to the wire under
confident handling in a ridden out effort. BREDENBURY (IRE), urged to the lead along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin through the
backstretch, widened that margin racing into upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. CHICK'S SHADOW, caught four wide
racing into the first turn while gaining a position in the second flight, angled inwards sharply midway through the backstretch, was prompted to advance
along the inside, then between foes nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but couldn't match the top pair while just lasting for a share. SUMMER
CLOTHES tracked off the second flight along the inside under light reserve for a half, was prompted to gain position saving ground on the far turn, switched
out four wide racing through the stretch but finished evenly late. WHISPER SLOW settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled
inwards nearing the lane and made an effort to gain some position while no real threat. SAYYIDA AL HURRA, reserved between foes in the last flight to the
backstretch, was fanned six wide into the stretch and had no rally. TEACHER DRAMA, urged to a forward placing between rivals pursuing the pacesetter to
the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. DIAMOND SPARKLES, reserved inside foes in the last flight in the opening half, shifted out nearing upper stretch
but offered no rally. SILVER TUNES stumbled at the start, pulled her way to terms prompting the pacesetter into the backstretch and gave way abruptly
after a half.

Footnotes
DO WHAT IT TAKES, four wide in the opening stages, tracked the pacesetter outside foes in second flight, angled inwards steadily advancing on the
pacesetter racing into the turn, shifted out three wide in upper stretch, readily wrested command and went clear under firm right handed encouragement.
MANCORA, reserved last while shifting off the inside, angled out nearing the turn gaining some position, angled five wide racing into upper stretch and
found her best stride in the closing stages to close the gap while earning the place honors. CULTURAL MANDATE was hustled clear through the
backstretch to open a commanding advantage, held sway to upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker to lose second late. GUCCIGUCCIGIRL
settled off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance in tandem with a rival while being fanned four wide into the stretch and
continued evenly between foes. ONLY IN AUGUST tracked off the second flight inside foes, shifted three wide entering the lane but faded in the closing
stages. THE GREAT KATH angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter inside the eventual winner racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch but
had no late response. WILLS BOOST retreated early.

Footnotes
CANDY MONEY, in touch with a rival attending the pace under light reserve, pressed the issue on the far turn and drove clear. LIDO KEY, reserved in early
stages while angling to the inside, angled out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late bid to prove best of the others.
COURAGEOUS CAJUN, urged to dictate the pace along the inside in the opening half, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and gave way.
TWISTED TREASURE switched outside foes tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced to brief contention three wide on the far turn
but had no closing bid. FACTOR AROUND tracked off the second flight outside foes and passed only tiring rivals. BACI tracked off the first flight between
foes in the opening half, shifted in on the far turn and faded nearing the lane. KATIE FALOONA proved no factor. COSMIC LINK was rated tracking just off
the leaders along the inside for a half, then emptied out racing into the far turn.
