Footnotes
HELGA SHMELGA had a sharp break to the front, maintained advantage throughout and held to the wire. LYONAISSE showed no speed to the turn,
roused sharply through the stretch run to just get up the place spot while all out. NO VA MAS broke a bit slow, ran on outside to just get nosed for place spot
late. BOOMTOWN never far back, rushed past the quarter pole off rail but outfinished in the final sixteenth. AMERICAN VALUES chased winner from inside
all the way to no avail. FIDES RATIO (FR) bore out a bit at the start, rushed to the leader with brief foot but came up empty and dropped back from the turn.
MS MAGIC broke a bit slow, had a steady fade thereafter. TERRY'S CANDY never reached contention.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S DREAM bothered start, inside position to far turn, rallied in time. ECHO ALPHA SIX good position, throughout, rallied to lead stretch, run
down. TIDAL EFFECT unhurried far turn, advanced steadily inside, angled out, rallied. POPPY JOE ROCKS with the leaders, raced on in the stretch run but
faded late. MR. MUTADDA no speed to far turn, rallied along to improve late. AGAINST THE LINE slammed sideways first turn, lost best chance, improved
late. ENHANCED EDITION never a factor. BIG ISLAND raced evenly with no rally when needed. FLUELLEN with pace between horses to quarter pole,
gave way readily. SUPER VALENTINE bolted first turn, ramming foe off stride, always outrun. WILL RUNAWAY battled on the lead to the half, gave way
thereafter. EDZO brief foot to the half, went wrong and dropped far back.
