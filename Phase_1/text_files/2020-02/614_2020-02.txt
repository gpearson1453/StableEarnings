Footnotes
EVIL LYN went to the front from the outside post, dropped from the four path to the two path early on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace on
an easy lead, controlled the tempo while inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked turning into the stretch then drew off under a hand ride, came
under a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, widened under the whip until just before the sixteenth-pole then was placed back under a hand ride while
much the best. LITTLE RED FROG was keen under restraint entering the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled in third position, was roused while
three wide on the far turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. TIZ SUSAN ANN saved ground
on the first turn, tracked the winner down the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper
stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. SUMMER EXPRESS went two to three wide on the first turn, settled in the back half of the field, saved
ground while urged along on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to threaten. BLUEBIRD SING lunged inward at the start then
hit the gate and was off a step slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, turned
into the stretch under a drive and was no factor. BAR TAP broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, went four wide into the first turn, dropped to the
three then two path later on that bend, settled in the middle of the field, swerved out four wide leaving the backstretch, dropped to the three then two path
under urging later on that bend, was put to the whip just after turning into the stretch and failed to respond. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY broke out at the start
then was hustled before being taken in hand early, saved ground on the first turn, settled well back in the field, dropped back while moving from three to five
wide on the far turn and also failed to respond. (Rail at 16 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
ALLIACEOUS went five wide on the first turn, settled under some urging, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased three wide on the far turn, took the
lead under the whip into the stretch and powered away under a strong drive to prove much the best in an impressive debut. G'S DEADLINE was taken up to
avoid the rider who was falling off the foe to the outside at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled outside under some urging, angled in leaving the
backstretch, advanced in the two path on the far turn, steadied just inside the five-sixteenths, regained momentum before the quarter-pole and safely
secured the place. HEATHER DIVINE went two then three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead just inside the
three-eighths, moved clear while drifting from the three to the four path inside the five-sixteenths, approached the loose horse a bit hesitantly with a clear
lead coming to the quarter-pole, was headed by the winner into the stretch and weakened while well clear for the show. OVERLY SWEET went two to three
wide on the turns and failed to respond. LITTLE GIRLS RULE saved ground on the first turn, tugged hard at the bit under restraint late on that bend, moved
out early on the backstretch, went three to four wide on the far turn and was no factor. I AM THE FIRE saved ground on the first turn, dropped back under
urging with five furlongs to run and retreated. THE LAST GIG went three then four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back
under urging late on the backstretch, floated from the three path to the five path on the far turn and retreated. FOREIGN CONNECTION was sent hard to
the front, dropped from three wide to the rail early on the first turn, set the pace on the inside with company to her outside, lost the lead just inside the
three-eighths and stopped. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA stumbled at the start and unseated the rider. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE

Footnotes
TRIVIAL slightly lost her footing at the start, settled last but one racing just off the rail through the first turn, came out moving up the backstretch, went four to
five wide on the far turn coming six wide to the top of the stretch, drifted about in the stretch but took over a sixteenth from home under steady urging.
STROLLIN THE BAYOU tracked inside a rival in behind the leading pair early, moved out a bit to enter the far turn in the two path then moving out a further
path on that bend and coming into the stretch four deep, drifted about in upper stretch, struck the lead briefly from about the eighth pole till being overtaken
a sixteenth out but was clear of the rest. HAVINFUNYET settled in hand racing inside on or just off the rail at the rear, was still last swinging to the four path
coming into the stretch, shifted out eight deep to the middle of the course and gained too late. LITTLE SNIP stalked the pacesetter from outside in the three
path entering the first turn continuing in about the two path through that bend, edged closer two to three deep on the far turn taking the lead a stride past the
quarter pole but was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and came up empty. NORTH OF EDEN tucked in early racing off the early leaders racing along
the rail, continued to save ground on the far turn edging a bit closer into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. EMBARRASSING raced outside a foe
two to three wide in the early going just off the leading pair, continued outside that same rival three then four wide on the far turn coming five deep into
upper stretch after having been asked for more by the five-sixteenths but failed to produce a rally. GABBY'S HALF was mildly coaxed forward and shifted in
heading to the first turn dictating terms on a clear advantage racing just off or on the rail, continued to set the tempo up the backstretch before being joined
by an outside rival on the far turn, appeared to be getting out a bit on that bend near the five-sixteenths, was overtaken at the quarter pole, gave way and

near the three-eighths, advanced inside on the far turn, came out just after turning into the stretch, rallied outside of the pacesetter, closed well to get the
lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady urging. SAY YES AGAIN showed speed while contesting the early pace outside of THIS IS
MY PRAYER, vied three wide on the first turn, moved clear late on that bend, remained clear in the two path through the far turn, was asked while still on
her inside lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place. ONETWOMANYROCKETS
went around the first turn in the three path, lagged at the rear of the field, was coaxed three wide on the far turn, stepped out four wide inside the
quarter-pole then swung six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy but missed the place while clear for the show. XAIRO broke out at the start,
went two then three wide on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved closer with a half-mile to run, chased two then three wide on the far turn,
pursued the leader under a drive into the final furlong, drifted in then bothered BELLA CAJUN near the sixteenth-pole and weakened. BELLA CAJUN went
three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn, drifted in under a drive near the
furlong marker, was taken up when shut-off by XAIRO near the sixteenth-pole and tired. SNOWBALL went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
came under urging late on the backstretch, went five wide on the far turn and failed to respond. THIS IS MY PRAYER showed good speed while fighting for
the early lead on the inside of SAY YES AGAIN, was taken back late on the first turn, settled in second on the backstretch, came up empty under urging
while three wide on the far turn and retreated. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
HOMEBRED was bumped by the inside rival then the outside foe at the start, settled into stride tracking in behind the leaders going on or just off the rail
through the turn, cut the corner inside rivals to emerge with the lead past the quarter pole, drew off while racing on the wrong lead and extended the
advantage while being eased up through the final sixteenth. CITRUS BURST brushed the outside rival lightly at the start and spotted the leader about a
length, moved forward under mild encouragement racing outside, moved in a bit into the turn going in the three path behind rivals through that bend, shifted
in a path in upper stretch and fought on to get the place over. SIGESMUND , who bumped the inside rival at the start, moved forward to set the pace inside,
drifted out a path leaving the turn and then a further path near the three-sixteenths, was no match for the winner and outfinished for place. HERO OF THE
FUTURE contended between rivals up the backstretch going two to three wide on the turn, weakened in the stretch. SILVER GALAXY bumped the outside
rival at the start, was taken back and switched out heading up the backstretch drifting out a bit in the process and on the turn going mostly in the six path
and outside rivals on that bend, came into upper stretch seven deep and ran on evenly late. SILVER SEABEE was forwardly positioned racing outside foes
going three to four wide on the turn, gave way in the stretch. SOAR LIKE AN EAGLE was lightly brushed at the break, shifted in racing on or just off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor. (Rail at 16 Feet)

OH TOODLES was well placed in third position, dropped further behind the top two late on the backstretch, started the turn in the two path, moved to three
then four wide while gaining passing the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead into upper stretch then drew off under a strong hand ride, began to drift out when
given one crack of a left-handed whip outside the sixteenth-pole, continued to drift out into the final sixteenth then took a straighter course late under a hand
ride while much the best. JOE G'S PAYBACK dropped back while urged along, went three wide on the turn, gained five wide into the stretch, chased the
winner past the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for the place. TENSAS WEEZY was off slow and spotted the front around three to four
lengths, settled at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was along for the show.
LEBKUCHEN broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to respond.
SIENNA BREEZE broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. LADY
BE GONE showed good speed and set the pace outside of a rival, vied in the three path on the turn, lost the lead just inside the quarter-pole and faded.
LUCKY ARTIE pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and stopped
then was vanned off while bleeding from the nostrils and reported to have bled. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
VACATION LOVER stalked from outside going in the three path and several lengths back of the leaders through the first turn, continued to race off the
inside still in the three path through the far turn coming out four deep into upper stretch and put to urging, struck the lead a sixteenth out and edged away.
COPPER FIDDLE set the pace from inside in the clear, was still clear into upper stretch and under urging but was outfinished while clearly second best.
MORETHANFISHIN brushed the outside rival lightly and was taken up at the start, saved ground inside a rival through the first turn, came out a bit to race in
the two path into the far turn still toward the back and inside a rival, was asked for more by the five-sixteenths having moved out a further path, swung five
wide coming into the stretch with some momentum but could not sustain the effort and evened out. BAYOU JAM was urged at the break then taken under a
hold and guided in heading to the first turn, saved ground along the inside through that bend, steadied just slightly about the three-eighths entering the far
turn still saving ground on that bend, came out in upper stretch and ran on. AFLEET ROGER was brushed at the break, raced outside a foe two to three
wide at the rear early, continued outside that same rival three to four wide on the far turn, moved out a path in the stretch but had no rally. MASPERO was
within range of the pacesetter a path removed from the rail, continued in this fashion into the far turn then gave way and was not persevered with through
the final sixteenth. (Rail at 16 Feet)

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SWAGG broke in then angled in while going to the front, set the clear pace, raced in the two path early on the turn then dropped closer to the
rail, responded well when set down in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. BET AGAIN was bumped at the start and forced soundly into another
foe, recovered to track the pace down the backstretch, chased three then two wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in upper stretch and
proved no match while clear for the place. FAST VERDICT dropped back while urged along, swerved out four wide while behind ALMA DERBY leaving the
backstretch, dropped to three then two wide later on that bend, was driven into upper stretch and got up for the show. THE MINIT I SEE U broke out and
bumped solidly with an opponent, was urged along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch under
the whip and lacked the needed response. BROTHER RICHIE bumped soundly twice with a rival at the start while off a half-step slow then dropped back,
raced at the rear, went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then five wide later on that bend, came six wide into the stretch, drifted out under a
left-handed whip from the three-sixteenths to the furlong marker, was switched to a right-handed whip at that point and failed to threaten. TWO STEPPIN'
STAR was bumped soundly on both sides at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and
came up empty. ROSE'S GALAXY broke a bit slow, moved up on the outside under urging, went five wide on the turn and had nothing left. ALMA DERBY
dropped towards the rear, was taken up while lugging out some leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the
stretch and was no factor. BIBLEMAN was bumped soundly on both sides at the start, moved up to race up close on the outside, dropped back under urging
while four wide on the turn and retreated.
