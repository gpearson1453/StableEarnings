the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch and was also gaining ground late. AILISH'S BUTTERCUP set the pace to the second turn, met the winner's
bid to mid stretch but was tiring late. DREAMING ABOUT YOU had no speed, trailed to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch and made up ground
belatedly. NONNA GIANNA (IRE) was allowed to settle mid pack to the second turn then saved ground but tired in the drive. POINT OF THE ROSE pressed
the pace for five furlongs, stopped on the second turn, was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
ARCH PRINCE was always within striking distance, bid two wide into the second turn then shifted to the rail when MITHQAAL left room, rallied under strong
urging, took a short lead from BAM BAM BRYAN then held off LORD GUINNESS late. LORD GUINNESS tracked the pace to the second turn, bid three
wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but kept to task, surged in the final fifty yards and just missed. BAM BAM BRYAN set all the pace from the
rail to the stretch, responded to deep stretch then was caught by the winner and lost second late. CUPID'S CLAWS was settled to the half, got fanned four
wide on the second turn, rallied to mid stretch then could not sustain the needed bid. MITHQAAL stalked the pace from the rail to the second turn, came off
the rail into the stretch but could not offer the needed response. HARMON had no speed, trailed to the second turn and was never a threat. ANGELO'S
PRIDE also had no speed, was four wide throughout and did not rally. MIDNIGHT SWAP pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs then tired.

Footnotes
POTENTE ALBA went right to the front and angled in, set the pace from the rail to the stretch, dug in when confronted by COLORMEMONEY in mid stretch
and held off that one by a nostril. COLORMEMONEY pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, rallied to get on terms in mid stretch, battled gamely and
just missed. BULLET DRILL broke a bit slow, had no speed, swung out four wide on the turn and was closing ground steadily. MIRROR IMAGE chased the
leaders to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch and finished in a rally. UNCLE HAL had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch then lacked the
needed late response. SUNDAY NAP pressed the winner early, shifted off the rail on the turn, was outkicked to mid stretch and weakened.
