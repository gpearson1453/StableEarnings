Footnotes
ELEVENTENTEETIME in the second flight while in the two path, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, advanced when asked late in the final turn,
bid between rivals, long drive, proved narrowly best in a game effort. CLAY'S MOON STONE void of speed for five furlongs, advanced into contention four
out to five wide in the final turn, challenged and put a head in front nearing the furlong marker, outkicked in the final strides while between horses.
KIMBERLY FRANCES off a step slow, lacked speed inside, continued to save some ground into the far turn, angled out late in that bend when advancing,
steered widest when straightened for home, late bid, hung in the final strides while widest of the first flight. SPECTACULAR TEMPER five wide into the first
turn, raced four wide into the far bend, challenged three wide and between rivals turning home, in a bit tight, weakened the final furlong. QUIET DAWN
jostled past the wire the first time, pulled hard onto the backstretch, raced three wide in the second bend when moving to challenge, faltered the final
furlong. VIVA LA SECRETA prompted the two leaders early, took over in the second turn, briefly clear midway in the final turn, gave way when the real
running began turning for home. LITTLE SLEW was never dangerous while racing off the inside. SUITS ME vied up front along the inside, fell back into the
far turn. HERMANA RED remained always back. SILENT NIGHT SKY set or forced the pace for six furlongs, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
VIOLENT STORM closest to the first flight early toward the inside, began to advance in the two path late in the final turn, tilted out to be three wide into the
lane, challenged outside, edged clear under firm handling. ANOTHRDAYATTHELAKE outrun for five furlongs while saving ground, advanced along rail into
the stretch, challenged up the rail inside the furlong ground, could not match the winner late, held sway for the place. BOOKIE'S BLUES broke alertly, set
the pace along the inside, allowed the runner up the inside nearing midstretch while still showing the way, gave ground grudgingly until late. WAR
VETERAN chased the leader off the inside, moved a bit closer nearing midstretch, lacked a late punch. NEW YEAR'S LUCK void of speed, continued back
second turn, picked off some tiring rivals while never a threat. HARD TO IMPRESS last to leave, raced back, lacked a serious response. SERGEANT
MCNERNEY pressed the issue four wide into the first turn, tired while racing three wide. PICTURE PAINTED lacked speed, four wide late in the final turn,
failed to muster a rally. WRATH within striking distance while saving ground, gave way in the drive.

CONQUEROR outrun in the early going toward the inside, two path when moving closer late in the turn, split foes in midstretch, vied to the wire and proved
best in determined fashion. FASCILITATOR also raced back off the pace, swung four wide when poised to rally turning for home, challenged outside,
outfinished in the late going while remaining widest of the first flight. RECOUNT closest to the leader, took over in the two path from that one when
straightened for home, was challenged soon after and was found lacking in the late going while between horses. ROCKSHAW pressed the issue while
racing three wide, set down for the drive, challenged three wide and between rivals inside the runner up, also outkicked in the late going. ROCKYS
WARRIOR slight bother start, sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace by a diminishing margin through the turn, gave
way when headed upper stretch. QUALIFLY failed to menace while racing toward the inside. TRES EQUIS void of speed, three wide into the lane, failed to
muster a late kick. SHARP ART bobbled at the start to be off slowly, moved up to the second flight early along the rail, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CALL ME DERBY away well, dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other speed to be clear into the lane, maintained daylight to the wire under steady
handling. ROCKTHEPULPIT reluctant to load, raced in the second flight while racing in the three path, continued to stalk the leaders in the turn, could do
little with the winner in the drive, edged clear for the second spot. THORNISH broke in a bit, quicky straightened, dueled up front closest to the inside, could
not match the winner in the drive nor contain the runner up, comfortably saved the show. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF THE DARK JEWEL
AGAINST THORNISH FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED. THE DARK JEWEL off slowly, raced back, in some traffic
late in the turn, improved position when clear for the drive. EXPLOSIVE SHOES within striking distance for a half, came up empty for the drive. BLACKS
FERRY ROAD lacked speed, raced in some traffic while three wide in the turn, improved slightly in the drive. BRAVURA CREEK restless in the gate, failed
to respond in the drive. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY raced back and four wide through the turn, also failed to respond in the drive. GONE DANCING tired in the two
path. GOTTA LOVE IKE off slowly, remained sluggish and well back, passed a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. DADDY JACK broke
back and was never a factor. ROCK SOLID TRUTH within striking distance early while outside, stopped.

Footnotes
MUCHO MACHO DAN a bit rank just after the start, dueled off the inside into and through the first turn inside, continued to set the pace in the run up the
backstretch and into the far turn, turned back a bid turning for home to be clear again, held sway to the wire under steady handling. ROAR OF THE LION
broke in, lacked speed in racing back in the two path, continued just off the inside, got through turning for home, finished willingly late to be getting to the
winner. RIKER in the second flight inside, steered out slightly when advancing on the winner late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive
and lost the place late. GOSPEL ABE raced back and four wide into the first turn, four wide again turning for home, displayed a mild amount of late interest
to be gaining for the show. THE ROUGE DIESEL settled off the pace and the inside, second flight while four wide late in the final turn, lacked a closing
response. MONDAY CONFESSION broke alertly, dueled early inside the winner, chased that one up the backstretch and into the far turn and began to
weaken. SUMNER settled off the early pace, saved ground through the second turn, had nothing for the drive. TOUCH 'EM UP lacked early foot outside,
remained back in failing to threaten. SATELLITE was always outrun. TONBO steadily faded while saving ground.

Footnotes
MATROOH broke on top, got clear into the first turn, set all the pace while racing, drew out through the lane under brisk handling. ARRIVAL pinched back
just after the start, raced back, angled out four wide when advancing late in the final turn, proved no match for the winner, edged clear. LOOKIN FOR
EIGHT settled off the pace, saved ground through both turn, continued up the rail to annex the show. HINTON settled early while three wide in the first turn,
dropped inside, saved ground through the final turn when moving closest to the winner, flattened out. ALBIREO void of speed, came four wide into the
stretch, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. ALWAYS A CATCH chased the winner just off the inside for six furlongs, gave way in the
drive. HARDLY A SECRET settled off the pace, faded while racing the three pat. CONQUEST BIG E rank,pulled in the first turn, within striking distance after
a half, had little left for the drive. ON PATROL remained always back. KRISTI'S COPILOT stopped after a half, jogged in.

Footnotes
WHENTHEDOVESCRY broke alertly, alternated up front off the inside, long, spirited drive, proved narrowly best in a game effort. SOUIXPER CHARGER
away well, dueled up inside the winner throughout, proved stubborn to the end. BEBOP SHOES in the second flight while toward the inside, moved out a bit
for the drive, proved no match for the top two, best of the rest. HEISFANCY lacked speed just off the inside, moved a bit closer in the two path late in the
turn, lacked a further response to finish up evenly. WASABI MOON off a step slow then was bumped, trailed for a half, improved position in finding best
stride too late. DESTINEDTOBEASTAR void of speed, three wide most of the way, improved position without posing a serious threat. REEF'S DESTINY
raced in mid pack out in the strip, three wide through the turn, failed to respond in the drive. IRISH OAK failed to menace inside. IT'S BELLAMY TIME was
outrun while racing toward the insdie. PIECE OF WORK tired while racing off the inside. SILVER CITY BLUES in the second group while racing in the three
path, tired. CALLE PATRON retreated while four wide through the turn.

Footnotes
CALIENTE CANDY off a step slow, raced back early as a result, began to pick way through traffic turn, came four wide into the stretch, finished with good
resolve down the middle of the strip to be up in time. WHOLEHEARTED settled early in the two path, advanced late in the bend, tilted out a bit for the drive,
took over from the outside past the furlong marker, clear late, could not contain the winner in the final stride while inside that rival. READY TO RUNAWAY in
the second flight while between rivals early, continued to stalk through the turn, lodged a mild bid nearing midstretch then flattened out. DRIP BREW broke
alertly, soon shook clear, continued to show the way through the turn, weakened in the drive when headed with just over a furlong remaining. PRETTY
GREELEY went evenly along the inside. URBAN KAT also went one paced while racing four wide move of the way. PORTAL CREEK chased the early
leader off the inside, began a steady fade midway on the turn. WAR BALLAD four wide through the /turn, was never a serious threat. TIGER BAIT raced in
mid pack early, had little left while racing just off the inside. SOPHIE'S ANGEL was always outrun along the inside. SUNSET PAULA JO was finished early.
WESTLODGE INTRIGUE faded while racing in the two path.

Footnotes
HIDDEN TALENT broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way when confronted in the second turn, held a narrow advantage
past the furlong marker, dug in late when dueling, gained the nod at the wire to narrowly prevail. SANTOS DUMONT away in good order, stalked the pace in
the three path, asked for run turning for home, long duel, missed the nod at the wire. ON D'ORO broke out, bumped foe start, recovered to stalk the pace
inside the runner up, behind horses into the lane, could not reach the top two late, edged clear of the others. BOBBY AXELROD pressed the winner to that
one's outside, continued forward the middle half, challenged late in the final turn, had little left late. BARINGER SPRING within striking distance outside,
crept a bit closer three out to four wide turning for home, displayed a modest amount of late interest while widest of the second group at the wire. COPPER
KING lacked speed, moved inside for the drive, improved slightly up the rail. STRETFORD END off a step slow, trailed much of the way, picked off some
tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. LIAM'S PRIDE jammed at the start, mid pack briefly, was finished after a half. PINE KNOLL steadily faded.
EDGEMONT ROAD had nothing for the drive.
