Footnotes
SHAQ JACK went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, rallied three to four wide on the far turn,
closed fast to make an outside bid passing the quarter-pole then took the lead shortly thereafter, moved clear coming to the three-sixteenths, responded
well in the stretch and held under steady urging. BROKEJAW bobbled at the start while bumping with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, settled well
back in the field, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch under the whip, drifted
in some outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage for the place. OUR PRINCE saved ground while contesting the early lead on the first
turn, dropped back early on the backstretch then tracked the clear leader, gained on that foe under urging in the two path on the far turn, made a bid
between horses outside the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner approaching the three-sixteenths then dropped back into upper stretch and tired while
able to get the show. MAN ALIVE went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, advanced under urging while four then five wide on the far turn but
came up empty. MYTHIC'S PATRIOT broke out and bumped with a rival, went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the three path, moved clear early
on the backstretch, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost the lead just inside the quarter-pole and faded. FIRE GIANT went four wide on the first
turn, lagged at the rear, was ridden along passing the seven-sixteenths, went three to four wide on the far turn and was no factor. NOCOMET was last to
commence, went around the first turn in the four path while under restraint, settled outside on the backstretch, moved in near the half-mile pole, dropped
well behind while inside on the far turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED

Footnotes
SPIDER LEGS was carried in at the start, established a good position just off the pace under some restraint, drafted inside on the turn, raced just off the
heels of the leader while under a tight hold from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole, was asked when given a very large opening at the top of the stretch,
cruised through under mild urging to take the lead just inside the three-sixteenths, kicked clear outside the furlong marker then was pt to a right-handed
whip, drew away under the whip until just inside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. BALOOK settled
towards the rear, went around the turn in the three path, was put to a left-handed whip after turning into the stretch and improved position to get the place.
UNDENIABLY DEVINE showed good speed and set the pace, was asked in the two path on the turn, lost the lead under a drive just inside the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened while just able to hold the show. SHE'S GONE D'WILD broke a step slow, rushed up on
the outside under urging, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch then was used up and tired. MISS UNDERRATED was fractious
behind the gate, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, made a brief bid on the outside at the
three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and also tired. LONE STAR DIVA was rated off the pace, moved in leaving the backstretch, was asked
in the two path early on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. COMMERCIAL FLASH broke in at the start, was rated off the pace, came
under urging in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. MADAM QUEEN settled under some urging, checked very severely leaving the backstretch
and swerved out into the middle of the course then was eased but walked off. Following a stewards' inquiry into the run into the turn, no change was made
to the order of finish. (Rail at 8 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
KOOL AID GIRL was bumped by inside and outside foes and pinched back at the start, settled into stride shifting in to race along or just off the rail through
the first turn, edged up inside foes up the backstretch, entered the far turn on the fence but gradually moved out to the four path past the five-sixteenths in
behind rivals lacking anywhere to go, found room at the top of the stretch and was set down for the drive, took a narrow lead a furlong out and maintained
under steady handling. COMPROMISING was a bit keen in behind rivals racing just off the rail into the first turn, continued to track in behind along the fence
up the backstretch, came off the rail a bit early on the second turn and bulled her way between foes past the five-sixteenths, bid in upper stretch, dueled with
the winner but could not get past while a game second. NANA'S JOY was caught outside foes six wide into the first turn moving in a path on that bend,
continued wide up the backstretch and in range, was forced five wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick but passed a rival for show honors.
FRONT MONEY MORGAN broke outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, was forwardly-positioned outside four wide on the first turn, continued four wide
on the far turn and between rivals for a bit on that bend, made a bid and briefly dueled for the lead in upper stretch but began to weaken nearing the furlong
marker. JUST CRUISING bumped the inside rival then exchanged contact with the outside one at the start, raced three wide mid-pack into the first turn,
continued three then four then five wide entering the far turn while dropping back to last, shifted in at that juncture coming out of that bend in the two path
and then nearer the rail in upper stretch, passed tired rivals in the lane. D'OR FILLE exchanged a bump at the start, the rider fell back in the saddle coming
near the end of the home straight the first time and tucked in behind foes but still quite wide going in the five to four path through the first turn, continued four
then five then six wide on the far turn outside rivals and failed to rally in the stretch. STAR PERFORMER set the pace inside, gave way in upper stretch and
drifted out a bit. CARSON'S PROSPECT was urged forward at the break pursuing the leader but off the fence in the three path into the first turn, continued
to be within range through the far turn still racing three wide then gave way and drifted out a bit in upper stretch. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO

Footnotes
ZOLA was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, took the lead
at the seven-sixteenths, moved clear in the two path on the far turn then was asked near the five-sixteenths, shook off GIFTED TALENT in upper stretch,
was put to a left-handed whip at the furlong marker, drew away under the whip into the final sixteenth then was put to a hand ride while much the best.
GRAND ISLE GIRL settled on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, was driven
into the stretch in the two path, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly while second best. PARTY WITH KASSIDY went
around the first turn in the two path, lagged at the rear, was hard ridden while inside on the far turn then driven into the two path entering the stretch and
improved position to get the show. GIFTED TALENT was taken in hand early, raced in the four path on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the
outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, stalked four wide on the far turn, was asked while making a brief bid at the quarter-pole, dropped back
under a drive in upper stretch and tired. ALY'S CHARM broke a step slow, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer with a
half-mile to run, was roused while three then four wide on the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths and came up
empty. FUHRCRY went four wide on the first turn, settled well back on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the far turn, swung seven wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. RUN BY broke in and a step slow, went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along
while three to four wide on the far turn, came five wide into upper stretch then moved out some more around the three-sixteenths and was no factor. GO MY
JULIET had her head turned at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, rushed up to take the lead then dropped in into the first turn, went
around that bend in the two path, set the clear pace while well out in the course, lost the lead to the winner at the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide on
the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. (Rail at 8 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED

Footnotes
CALL THE COLONEL settled in the back half of the field racing on or just off the rail, advanced inside rivals on the far turn, came out in the vicinity of the
eighth pole with momentum and aim while under a drive, got up late over LEMON BLITZ, who set the pace inside into the first turn, was pressured by HALF
TRICK and overtaken by that one midway up the backstretch, continued to chase inside till nearing the three-eighths pole at which point he was guided out
to the three path, regained command in upper stretch and edged clear by the furlong marker but was collared late. SQUARE THE CIRCLE stalked the
leading pair from the three path through both turns, came four wide into upper stretch and needed more late. HALF TRICK was bumped at the start then
caught five wide into the first turn gaining forward position, gradually shifted in to the three path on that bend, prompted the pace up the backstretch edging
clear early on the far turn going in the two to three path on that bend, floated out entering upper stretch then drifted in a bit and waekened. EASTSIDE BOY
raced just off the rail toward the rear through the first turn, moved out a bit heading up the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn and was floated six
deep out of that bend then needed more in the lane. AL TAWEEL was slightly taken up a few strides after the start and relegated to last, went into the first
turn in the two path moving out four deep on that bend, edged away from rivals taking closer order of the top ones entering the far turn two wide, angled five
wide at the head of the lane and failed to threaten late while drifting about a bit in upper stretch. OUTRUN bumped the outside rivals at the start then was in
a bit tight and eased back while shifting in a bit entering the first turn, went in the three to four path on that bend racing well back of the leaders, passed by
inside and outside foes up the backstretch dropping back to last still racing a few paths removed from the rail on the far turn and was empty in the stretch.
UPTOWN RULER was bumped into the outside rival at the start, pursued the leaders racing in the four path, asked to keep pace still in the four path on the
far turn but dropped back and faded. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY

Footnotes
RUSTON VOW switched off the rail into the first turn in behind rivals going in the two path tracking the leaders through that bend, maintained close order up
the backstretch into the far turn moving out a path midway on that bend, shifted five wide coming to the top of the stretch, shied from a rival just inside the
final sixteenth and dug in under steady handling to prevail. CAPTAIN TYREE gained forward position into the first turn racing outside the pacesetter about
three wide, edged closer into the far turn making a bid at the head of the stretch, drifted out a bit in upper stretch then badly a sixteenth from home and just
failed to last. RAHFEES MAN hit the gate and bumped a rival at the start then quickly moved clear under mild encouragement to dictate terms inside but
moving just off the rail into the first turn, continued to lead the way up the backstretch along the rail and again moved just off the fence into the second turn,
was overtaken leaving that bend then gave way in the stretch. B RASEN stalked from outside racing in the four path through both turns and up the
backstretch, was asked for more two furlongs from home but failed to rally. SHANIKO'S SECRET angled in heading to the first turn, saved ground on the rail
racing mid-pack, continued along the inside through the far turn and was never near enough to threaten. ROLLWITHIT was bumped from both sides at the
start, shifted in to the two path heading to the first turn then shifted out throughout that bend emerging five deep, continued outside foes up the backstretch
in the back half of the field going four to five wide on the far turn and failing to rally in the drive. IDE B A CLASSIC was caught five wide through the first turn
in pursuit of the leaders, dropped back having shifted in a bit up the backstretch going three to four wide between foes leaving the run up the backstretch
and continuing a few paths removed from the rail on the far turn, offered no late bid. CAMERON RULES bumped the inside rival at the start, raced off the
fence at the rear outside a rival three to four deep early, entered the far turn still last but one in the three path shifting in a path midway on that bend and
failed to produce a bid. STAR BANJO broke a step slowly, was ridden along early and midway through the race, went off the fence in the two to three path
on both turns shifting gradually to be six wide in upper stretch and was not a threat. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED

Footnotes
STRIKE MY FANCY was reserved on the inside, saved ground through the far turn, was asked in the two path into the stretch, moved out a path inside the
three-sixteenths, rallied between horses into the final furlong, closed fast to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. MORNING
MOLLY went four wide on the first turn, moved in inside the five-eighths, was well placed towards the front, drafted inside on the far turn, shifted to the two
path into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong, made a bid shortly thereafter, battled between foes into the final sixteenth and missed while
clear for the place. ROSEBUD'S HOPE set the pace while inside to the two path, was guided around the far turn with extra left rein pressure, came under a
drive in upper stretch, was collared nearing the sixteenth-pole then outfinished while able to get the show. MISS MERCKEN went around the first turn in the
two path, settled off the pace, rounded the far turn in the two path, dropped to the rail after turning into the stretch, was asked around the three-sixteenths,
chased into the final furlong, checked while lacking room coming to the sixteenth-pole, altered course to the outside several paths shortly thereafter and lost
any chance at the victory while able to get the last spot in the superfecta. RUSSIAN MAFIA was last to commence, lagged at the rear while inside to the two
path, was roused while three wide into the stretch and improved position.. WINGS OF DAWN brushed with a foe after the start, raced in the three path on
the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, pursued the winner under a drive in upper stretch, came out into the
final furlong and weakened. RED ROUNDER broke in and bumped with a rival, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was asked
while three wide on the far turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. ROUSSALKA was caught six wide on the first turn, raced outside under
restraint on the backstretch, was roused while four wide on the far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. AMAZIMA
went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, raced three wide on the far turn, was asked nearing the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. MAKEME DREAM bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, went four wide on the
far turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. (Rail at 8 Feet) TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED

MAY HOUR was urged along towards the front, raced inside to the two path on the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the final sixteenth and got up
determinedly in the final strides. MALASONG bumped hard with a rival at the start, recovered well to take the lead, extended the advantage in the two path
on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. CHAMBLISS
was a bit slow into stride, raced at the rear of the field, went three wide on the turn, came four to five wide into upper stretch and finished with good energy
to garner the show. HIGHLY CENTSABLE settled in the front half of the field, was asked while four wide on the turn, chased outside under a drive into the
final furlong and weakened. CLEVER RACER bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled well back under some urging, rounded the turn in the two path
and improved position. ROSES N' RUBIES broke out at the start, was urged along on the far outside, went five wide on the turn and lacked the needed
response. KISS OF THE WOLF was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive
around the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. CHEAP SHOT was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to respond. DOUG'S
BUG was urged along off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went five then six wide on the turn and also failed to respond. YES MY SON
showed speed then chased the pace on the outside, raced in the three path on the turn, dropped back between horses outside the quarter-pole and
retreated. TIMES DID NOT APPEAR ON THE VIDEO BUT WERE COLLECTED ELECTRONICALLY
