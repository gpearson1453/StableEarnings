MR. CHESAPEAKECITY chased the dueling leaders leaving the three eighths pole, took closer measure and angled four wide into the lane, forged to
command leaving the three sixteenths, kicked clear then held firm under a steady drive. LUNAR IMAGE , off the pace while removed from the inside, angled
five wide into the lane and closed willingly. EL ROJO , outrun early while saving ground, swung out entering the stretch and closed steadily. PAID HOLIDAY
broke sharp then chased three wide, bid outside the leader leaving the far turn, dueled past the five sixteenths, stayed willingly to about mid stretch then
gave way. CHUCK'S DREAM sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined around the far turn, battled into the lane then faltered through the
final furlong. MEDITERRANEAN saved ground and faded around the turn.

drew off under urging. SMOKING BABY stalked the pace near the rail around the turn, swung outside in upper stretch and passed tired foes.

the pace along the rail and gave way through the stretch. HOME BY SEVEN , four deep on the turn, was outrun. SWEEP THE BOARD , in the two path on
the turn, weakened. HOSS KITTEN , unhurried down the backstretch, circled the turn three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
WHITE RUSSIAN sped clear early, dictated the pace towards the inside, widened a bit in mid stretch then held sway under a drive. YES MAN saved ground
chasing the winner, moved through inside rivals in mid stretch and continued willingly to be clear for the place. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , three wide
pursuing the winner, moved up some in mid stretch but failed to seriously follow through. LET ME ASK BOB lacked speed, circled into the lane and had a
belated response. DEVOTION IN MOTION stalked the winner two wide, failed to kick on in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CONFUSION
was outrun.

Footnotes
FIFTY stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, gained command in upper stretch then drew out. PARADE OF NATIONS chased the pace two wide
around the turn, swung to the five path near the eighth pole and gained the place. DRIVE AT NITE lacked speed, floated to the five path turning for home,
was in the six path in mid stretch and rallied mildly outside horses. FINBAR , two wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and passed tired rivals.
UNNAMED SOLDIER broke alertly and quickly sprinted clear, hugged the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. JONATHAN MCD , two wide on the turn,
eased out to the four path in upper stretch, altered course to the inside when PARADE OF NATIONS angled out in front of him then failed to be a factor.
SUPER BUDDY hugged the inner rail throughout and gave way.

Footnotes
TOP CZAR , reluctant to load, stalked the pace two wide, moved out a bit wider under pressure into the lane, closed in under a drive, took command past
the furlong grounds, kicked clear then was fully extended to prevail. IN HIM WITH HIM , hustled along about two wide, shifted out four wide for the drive,
leveled off through the final furlong and steadily gained. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST lacked speed two wide, angled five wide into the lane and closed willingly.
BUCKED TOOTH sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, came under pressure into the lane, was confronted in mid stretch, lost the lead soon
after and weakened late. DA WINNER IS , outside rivals nearing the half mile pole, moved up four wide in upper stretch, kept on past mid stretch then
flattened out between runners. IWISHIWASPECIAL saved ground, eased out in the drive and had a mild response between foes. I IDOLIZE YOU was away
last after having his head turned when the gates sprung, spotted the field a few lengths, was under pressure around the turn, saved ground into the lane
and came up empty.

Footnotes
FORT PECK prompted the pace two wide, gained a short lead inside the three sixteenths pole, was challenged on his outside by TATTOOED near the
eighth pole then dug in tenaciously to narrow prevail. TATTOOED , along the inner rail on both turns while stalking the pace, swung to the three path in
upper stretch, bid for the lead in mid stretch and hung. PRETTY GOOD YEAR lacked speed, circled the far turn three wide, angled to the five path in upper
stretch, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. HAMMERIN AAMER broke slowly, swung to the five path in upper stretch and showed a mild
gain outside rivals. TOTALITARIO , three wide the first turn, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally. MOONLIGHT SHADOW , four deep the
first turn, hugged the inner rail the far turn, angled out in mid stretch, raced between horses and showed some late interest. FOREST FIRE stumbled a
stride out of the gate, set a slow pace along the inner rail and gave way approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
GROOVE eased out leaving the five eighths marker tracked the leader, bid in hand mid turn, moved to command with a quarter remaining, was roused clear
soon into the lane, widened a bit past the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling and held sway. BOW MAKER bobbled at the break, recovered and
settled off the pace, moved up to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, eased out and then advanced between runners into the stretch, worked through a
tight spot in mid stretch, altered out and churned on to get the bob for the place. QUEEN OF TOMORROW settled four wide, commenced a run mid turn,
ranged up outside rivals in mid stretch, failed to seriously sustain and lost the bob for second. TRULY RED , three wide, edged up under coaxing mid turn,
had aim past the three sixteenths while between runners then faded in the final furlong. DUPLICATED broke a step slow, was sent up between runners
nearing the far turn, steadied briefly off a tiring rival, regrouped and had belated action. MARY'S SONG was sent clear early, set the pace towards the rail,
was collared mid turn, battled to upper stretch then gave way. ANY MINUTE NOW saved ground and faded. BYZANTINE EMPRESS gave early chase
three wide and faltered.
