Footnotes
CHARITABLE JAN rated just off the pace in the three path, started a bid past the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the
far turn, then dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. BECOMING MACHEN was urged clear and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was caught flattening
stride the final yards. QUINCYS WAY saved ground off the pace the first turn then bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four
path, drifted leaving the turn and settled for third. BREAK DANCIN settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came
through the far turn in the three path then weakened. LIL TROUBLE rounded the opening turn in the five path and raced outside into the backstretch, but
showed little response. LADYS CROSS FIRST raced off the early pace in the three and four paths, showed little response through the backstretch then
faded at the rail on the far turn. SAMMIE GIRL entered the first turn in the five path, faded toward the five sixteenths pole and was not asked the final
quarter mile.

in through the lane to get up later yards. GIMME KIMMY rounded the opening turn in the three path then stalked into the backstretch, started a bid leaving
the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead three wide on the far turn but was outfinished through the final sixteenth. FOXY GATOR saved ground off
the early pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, angled to the outside in the upper stretch and finished well to take
third the final strides. GREASEDLIGHTNING angled to the inside to set the pace, was met at even terms at the three eighths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail rounding the far turn, dug in to steady stretch encouragement but was caught inside the sixteenth pole and flattened later yards. NORTH

LIL MISS FIBER settled close to the early pace in the two and three paths then challenged three wide nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead
approaching the five sixteenths, raced clear past the pole and angled to the inside, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady encouragement
to hold on well. GATTOLOTTACHARM saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, improved position in the three path of the far
turn and took second entering the stretch, but couldn't improved further. DIAMOND TRAIN raced well off the pace saving ground, bid leaving the five
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then angled to the outside leaving the turn and passed rival in an even finish. U S FUNDS stalked the pace
two deep then challenged at the three eighths pole, steadied off the heels of Lil Miss Fiber passing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail
and weakened leaving the turn. SIENTE LA MAGIA set the early pace inside and was pressured nearing the three eighths pole, steadied at the inside flank
of U S Funds passing the five sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. The stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of Lil Miss Fiber,
lodged by the riders of Siente La Magia and U S Funds for interference in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, however the stewards determined the
incident was not a significant factor in the outcome of the race.

Footnotes
FATHER'S LUCK raced close in the front stretch then stalked through the opening turn, moved to even terms into the backstretch and took the nod past the
seven sixteenths pole, pulled clear toward the five sixteenths, drew away at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled down the lane.
WATCHMENEIGHNEIGH raced well off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn and was kept in hand through most of the backstretch, started a
bid nearing the quarter pole, came through the far turn in the three path then settled for second best. BRILLIANT BOLT broke through the gate prior the start
then settled off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and finished evenly. BATTLE ROYALE
saved ground off the pace the first turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path rounding the far turn but flattened stride inside
the eighth pole. FIRST DRAFT rated a slim lead inside but was met at even terms into the backstretch, ceded the advantage leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, gave chase from that point then dropped back nearing the five sixteenths and weakened at the rail on the far turn. PROSPECT TOY drifted into the
first turn then settled off the pace about the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole then flattened stride two deep on the far turn. MASTER YOO
raced well back. THE MESSAGE R V F showed little response through the backstretch after racing in the six path of the first turn. TRUMP CHANGE raced
in the seven path the first turn and entered the backstretch outside then bid only mildly from the three eighths pole.
