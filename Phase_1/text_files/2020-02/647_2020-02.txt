Footnotes
PETRONILLA set the pace between runners, held command in the two path around the turn and into the lane, cleared rivals mid-stretch and held on after a
last second challenge from the runner-up. MADERA JUBILEE angled in, settled off the pace, raced along the inside through the turn, angled out entering
the stretch, surged late and just missed. SONGBIRD EYDIE forwardly placed three deep up the backstretch, challenged from the outside into the lane and
stretch but was outfinished in the late stages. GRACIE'S GIRL pressed the pace inside, challenged the winner around the turn and into the stretch but
weakened in the final sixteenth. MUCHOMONEYBABY off the rail in the early stages, took the turn three wide and was never a factor. SUNNY SLIPPERS
tracked the field from off the pace, saved ground into the lane and never threatened.

BALLYCASTLE broke in and bumped BRAVE COURT, stalked outside of MR BINGLEY up the backstretch, raced three wide into the turn, angled four wide
and bid outside BRAVE COURT entering the stretch, battled through the final furlong and edged LAKE SHOW nearing the wire. LAKE SHOW tracked off
the rail, angled over to the inside, moved out into the two path on the turn then a bit further out in the stretch, rallied between foes late and earned the place.
BLITZING MARIO dueled for the lead from the inside, led through the lane, fought back in the late stages but was outkicked by the top pair. MR BINGLEY
stumbled and bumped at the start, traveled a bit off the rail and looked to advance but lacked room on the turn and then from the inside into the stretch,
found room along the rail in the lane and finished willingly. BRAVE COURT bumped both sides leaving the gate, dueled for the lead from the outside into
and around the turn, fought to mid-stretch and gave way.
