Footnotes
OCTORARO ORPHIE was bumped leaving the five furlong pole while unhurried, raced two wide around the turn, angled out while rallying into the stretch,
bid outside foes inside the final sixteenth and was narrowly best after a stiff drive. YES SIR COLONEL chased the early leader from the outside, raced the
three path around the turn, opened a short lead in midstretch but couldn't last in a game effort. LUNAR PRIZE angled sharply to the rail leaving the five
furlong pole, raced in good position into the stretch, was on near even terms in front into midstretch but wasn't enough. FU MAN SUE came out leaving the
gate, bumped with ALL TACKED UP, steadied sharply along the rail leaving the five furlong pole, came out, bumped the winner soon after, angled into the
three path on the turn then gained slowly outside. An objection by Inirio against the third finisher was not allowed. ALL TACKED UP came in, bumped with
FU MAN SUE leaving the gate then appeared to clip heels and stumble soon after, was slow to settle and failed to menace. WIDGET FACTORY moved to a
clear lead from the outside after going a furlong, stayed out from the rail into the stretch then tired from between horses. SPIDER BITE fell far back and was
eased up.

Footnotes
COURTING JENNY set a pressured pace inside of a rival while staying in the three path, drew clear from that foe approaching the five sixteenths, bore out
a bit to the four path at the quarter pole, but straightened and drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure before being geared down at the sixteenth
pole. SNIPER SIS pressed the leader from off of her flank while being kept in the four path by that foe, but failed to keep pace with that rival approaching the
five sixteenths pole, proved no match for her in upper stretch, then held place to the wire. DANCE LIGHTLY had a slow start and trailed the field down the
backstretch, swung to the five path to be outside of rivals turning for home, but lugged in and split rivals instead in upper stretch, then offered a mild belated
rally for show. PAJAMA TOPS tracked three wide, forged show away from inner rivals into the far turn, but failed to threaten the leaders through the lane
and lost show in the late stages. GIULIANA VEE was jostled between horses at the start, raced in midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to
threaten. SPEAK YOUR TRUTH took a bump to her hind quarters leaving the gate by an outer rival, settled far off the pace in the four path and outside of
rivals around the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch, and had no rally. HUNTER REVOLUTION saved ground from midpack, but weakened in
upper stretch.

Footnotes
BEST CHOICE was unhurried following a slow break, steadied early on the far turn after rallying into tight quarters behind the first flight, angled sharply to
the outside for room entering the final furlong, closed outside and was along in time. DRUMMER DON was unhurried early, made a strong four wide run to
the front nearing the quarter pole, drew out in early stretch, remained clear into late stretch but was caught on the line. ALGORIX forced or set the pace
along the rail into the final furlong then weakened. PAT'S SHOES was rated in good position in the three path, gave his best three wide between horses on
the final turn then weakened in the drive. GILGIMESH took command at once, raced two wide between horses with the pace into the stretch then tired.
MARK TWAIN was caught in the four path around the first turn, stayed outside and was finished after three-quarters. SUNSHINE MARK was steadied in
tight along the rail on the first turn, wasn't far back to the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
YELLOW CHICK stalked the loose leader from along the rail, moved off of the fence around the turn and made a bid for the lead outside of the leader in the
three path at the quarter pole, drew away from her rivals under driving pressure at the furlong pole, then was ridden with hands and heels through the final
sixteenth. ATTENTIVELY was urged along from midpack three deep, inched closer around the turn and made a three wide bid for the lead in the four path
at the quarter pole, but got outkicked by the eventual winner in upper stretch, kept on to forge place at the sixteenth pole, and held off JESSE THE GREAT
for place through the final stages while hanging on her left lead. JESSE THE GREAT saved ground while far off of the pace, shifted to the two path in upper
stretch, and made a mild rally through the lane while inside of ATTENTIVELY, but failed to have enough to catch that foe for place. BANK ROLLIN
established a clear lead early on and stayed in the two path, met a challenge from YELLOW CHICK and ATTENTIVELY approaching the quarter pole,
lugged in in upper stretch due to hanging on her left lead, then was headed by YELLOW CHICK approaching the furlong pole and wilted through the late
stages. POSSEINEFFECTTOO saved ground while trailing, passed an eased for in upper stretch, and failed to get involved. GENEVIEVE'S Z VA stalked
outside of YELLOW CHICK early on, but weakened passing the five sixteenths pole, then drifted to the five path turning for home while being eased.

VENUS RAMEY advanced between rivals early, vied in the three path around the turn, took over entering the final sixteenth, drew out late then held.
GUILTYWITHANEXCUSE wasn't far back early, steadied two wide between rivals entering the turn, angled to the outside for room entering the final furlong
and gained mildly to the end. FOLK MAGIC reared in the gate prior to the break, broke slowly, trailed in the two path into the stretch, angled to the outside in
midstretch and finished with good energy. LITTLEBITALILY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, moved clear on the backstretch, held on to a short lead along
the inside to midstretch then faltered. TAKE ME HOME raced the three path and lacked a rally. MS TEEK had early position along the rail, steadied into the
turn then faded.

Footnotes
GINGER AND JINGLE raced in midpack and four wide into the turn, cleared an inner foe and angled to the three path at the quarter pole, then commenced
a rally through the lane to reach the lead passing the sixteenth pole, and drew off under a vigorous hand ride. BEACH TREASURE stalked close to the
leader, inside of a foe, and in the two path, ranged up to bid for the lead two wide and between horses into the far turn, dueled with his inner rival around the
turn and through the lane, but was passed by an outer charging foe at the sixteenth pole while getting the better of his dueling counterpart for place.
VICTORIOUS BEAR set the pace from the onset, dug in into the turn as BEACH TREASURE moved alongside, dueled inside of that foe through the turn
and stretch while holding a slight lead, but was passed by an outer oncharging rival at the sixteenth pole while losing the duel for place. OFFENDER raced
in midpack in the four path, angled down to the two path into the turn before shifting back to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, but lacked a rally
through the lane. PAINTED CLOWN prompted the pace from the three path, but failed to keep pace with his inner rivals passing the five sixteenths pole,
then cut the corner turning for home and weakened in upper stretch. ITSHOULDBEFINE trailed, shifted off of the rail to the five path at the five sixteenths
pole, but failed to make an impact. COOL YOUR BOOTS weakened to trail the field into the turn, and never played a factor.

Footnotes
GOLIGHTLY dueled outside of a pair of rivals early on, but was coaxed and drew off readily into the turn, widened her advantage under driving pressure
through the turn, the held sway while hanging on her left lead. QUEEN STINKER advanced in the five path around the turn, shifted to the four path turning
for home, but was second best. FLASHY SIREN trailed, swungto the six path turning for home, and offered a mild grinding rally without threatening. PAZ
THE WINE stalked along the inside early on, shifted to the three to five path around the far turn, but got out finished for minor rewards st the furlong pole.
KAY SYRAH SYRAH Stallked in the four path early on, forged place away from inner rivals into the far turn and angled to the two path, but weakened in
upper stretch. GLAMOROUS THUNDER dueled two wide and between horses, but weakened into the far turn. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE dueled inside a
pair of rivals, but was put to a drive passing the half mile pole, and weakened into the far turn.
