out despite right handed pressure in midstretch, could not match the winner but held second. POINT HOPE (IRE) bobbled at the start, chased inside then a
bit off the rail, went around a rival into the stretch, came out in upper stretch and gained the show. WISHFUL broke a bit slowly, settled just off the rail then
angled in leaving the backstretch, saved ground thereafter and did not rally. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE angled in and dueled outside the runner-up, fought
