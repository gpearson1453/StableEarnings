O K GAME ON was rated early, moved to command two wide between horse entering the far turn, quickly ran clear, was roused sharply in early stretch then
continued to widen under a hand ride. MINE TO HOLD wasn't far back early in the two path, improved position around the final turn then flattened out in the
lane while second best. SMART PROSPECT ducked into SCOOTER BUSKIE leaving the gate, was slow to settle, raced wide around the final turn and
outlasted tired ones. SCOOTER BUSKIE was bumped leaving the gate, lagged into the far turn then passed tired ones. A T M AWESOME reared in the
gate, was hustled to a clear lead soon after the break, stayed along the rail while making the pace to the far turn then stopped. FOLES advanced outside
horses before a half and was finished before six furlongs. GRANDE GATO broke slowly, stopped after five furlongs and was eased up through the lane.

Footnotes
MONEYBAGS trailed outside of a foe in the three to four path early on, swung five wide at the quarter pole, came into the seven path and widest of all,
rallied past his inner rivals through the lane, and reached the lead in the late stages. MAKE THE RULES vied inside of a duo of rivals through the first turn,
bid for the lead inside of WARLEGGAN into the far turn, dueled inside of that rival while staying a bit off of the rail, held an advantage into the lane, but bore
outwards inside the final furlong, herded WARLEGGAN into LOOKIN AT BELSSING's path approaching the sixteenth pole, then prevailed over
WARLEGGAN for place, but got outfinished by the late charging MONEYBAGS. WARLEGGAN set the pace from the two path, met a challenge from MAKE
THE RULES towards his inside into the far turn, dueled around the second bend while being kept in the three to four path by that foe, drifted to the five path
turning for home while getting outpaced by his inner counterpart, but was herded outwards by that foe inside the final furlong, causing him to drift into
LOOKIN AT BLESSING's path approaching the sixteenth pole. TUFF DUFF saved ground from midpack, made a mild bid along the rail through the lane,
but weakened late. LOOKIN AT BLESSING stalked in the three to four path, shifted to the five path turning for home and commenced a grinding rally
between horses, but was shut off and took up when WARLEGGAN was herded into his path approaching the sixteenth pole while getting outfinished by his
outer rival. JOINT STRIKE raced midpack in the two to three path, but failed to make an impact. PRAISE THE MOON prompted the pace three wide, but
weakened into the far turn and stopped. FLASHY BARON was outrun and never got involved. Following the race, the claims of foul lodged by the rider of #2
LOOKIN AT BLESSIN against the riders of #5 WARLEGGAN and #8 MONEYBAGS were disallowed, while the claim of foul lodged by the rider of #5
WARLEGGAN against the rider of #4 MAKE THE RULES was allowed. The stewards deemed #4 MAKE THE RULES impeded #5 WARLEGGAN, causing
WARLEGGAN to impede #2 LOOKIN AT BLESSING inside the final furlong, therefore disqualified #4 MAKE THE RULES and placed him fifth.

MOON SHOCK was sent clear soon after the break, stayed out from the rail under rating to the stretch then was put to urging. ROMAN REIGN began a run
outside rivals after a half, raced five wide into the far turn but failed to sustain her bid in the lane. LIGHT MY PATH was slow early, made a run well out into
the track around the final turn but couldn't gain through the lane. HEAVY TIPPER trailed early, came out into the three path nearing the lane while moving,
angled out in early stretch and outfinished tired ones. OUR HONEY BELLE advanced the rail on the backstretch, fell back early on the far turn, steadied and
altered course in early stretch to avoid the fallen horse and faded. PLATINUM AFFAIR was hustled to gain early position, remained prominent three wide
between rivals into the far turn then stopped. SWISS ROSALEE came out from the rail while not far back on the first turn, raced three wide between rivals
into the far turn then stopped in the lane. MISS FORESTER was no factor, fell over the fallen horse in early stretch then ran off. YOURCREDITISGOOD
made a run two wide between around the final turn, suddenly fell in early stretch then got up and ran off.

DAREDEVIL CARL established a clear margin in hand early on, stayed in the three to four path around the turn, then widened his margin easily through the
lane. SPOT OF GOLD edged place away from, and inside of, PENNY'S LEGACY passing the quarter pole, shifted to the five path turning for home to be
outside of the leader, but was no match for that foe and proved second best. PENNY'S LEGACY was reluctant to load, prompted then chased the loose
leader while in the four path around the turn, but weakened while drifting outwards passing the five sixteenths pole. JOHNY LIGHTNIN was off a step slow,
saved ground while far off the pace through the turn, and showed mild interest along the rail through the lane. VISHNU raced outside of SPOT OF GOLD
early on in midpack, but weakened while taking the five path around the bend. HONORABLE WAY had a slow start, was always outrun, and showed little.

BUSTIN THE BANK dueled early while two wide between horses, regained command for good entering the far turn, drew out entering the stretch then bore
out sharply under left hand whip through late stretch. HOLLYWOOD HANDSOME was taken well in hand early, stayed along the rail while behind the first
flight around the final turn, came out between horses in early stretch, was caught in tight behind the winner entering the final furlong, angled to the outside
for room and flattened out. PAL CAL took turns on the front end while along the rail inside the winner then weakened in the lane. SNOOP raced three wide
within striking distance for over three-quarters then tired. HASHTAG WINNING stayed outside while not far back to the far turn then stopped.

Footnotes
LATE BREAKING NEWS set the pace in the two path, cleared off down the backstretch, widen his advantage around the far turn, then drew further off
under driving pressure through upper stretch. BRONX SANDMAN settled off the pace in the two path, shifted from the four to five path around the far turn
while commencing a rally outside of horses, then sustained his grinding advance through the late stages to outfinish BOLT BROTHERHOOD for place.
BOLT BROTHERHOOD stalked in two path between horses, shifted to the rail and rated while waiting for racing room behind horses from the seven
sixteenths pole to the five-sixteenths pole, swung to the four path at the quarter pole to split foes, rallied and forged place at the furlong pole while no match
for the leader, but got outfinished by BRONX SANDMAN for place in the late stages. IYWAAN stalked from the three path and outside of rivals, but was put
to a drive to keep pace passing the half mile pole, then weakened between horses approaching the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead. NICK
PAPAGIORGIO prompted the pace setter from along the rail, but failed to keep pace with that foe at the seven sixteenths pole, saved ground around the far
turn, but weakened in upper stretch. SWINGING STAR raced far off the pace in the three path around the first turn, then failed to make up ground in the five
to six path and outside of horses through the far turn, and proved no factor. FEDERAL DOMINANCE trailed in the four path around the first turn, then failed
to make an impact. INDOMINUS REX saved ground from midpack, but weakened to trail the field into the backstretch, and never got involved thereafter.

GAME BREAK was hustled to a clear lead before going a furlong, was rated in the two path to the stretch then was put to urging. TICKED ALL DABOXES
stayed inside in an even effort. A TO Z wasn't far back outside early, raced the four path around the turn and tired. NONPLUSULTRA chased early, was
urged closer in the three path early on the turn then was finished after a half. MAKIN TROUBLE raced well into the track around the turn and failed to
menace. RAVAGE was outrun. USEPPA broke slowly and couldn't catch up.

Footnotes
BALHARBOUR MISS established a clear advantage early on, angled from the three to the two path into the turn, met a challenge from PACHAMAMA
passing the five sixteenth pole, repelled that foe in upper stretch, then held sway under driving pressure before being geared down through the final
sixteenth. PACHAMAMA stalked in the three path, inched closer to bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled by the leader in upper stretch
due to hanging on her left lead through the lane, and was second best. MRS. CREWS saved ground from midpack, shifted off of the rail to the four path
turning for home, then edged show from an inner rival at the furlong pole without threatening the leaders. SHACKLE ME GOOD saved ground while stalking
the pace, but failed to keep pace with the leaders into the far turn, then tired through the lane and was edged out for show passing the furlong pole.
PERINA'S PRIDE shifted from the four to five path while in midpack at the quarter pole, but lacked a rally outside of foes in upper stretch. BRONZE CHARM
saved ground while far off the pace, and failed to threaten. DANCING COOL trailed in the five path around the turn, and was never involved. ME GUSTA
PAPI prompted the pace from the four path and outside of rivals, but weakened into the turn and subsequently stopped.
