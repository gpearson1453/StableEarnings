WATCH CAIRO set a clear early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn, opened up and drew off as an easy winner. INGLENOOK was outrun early,
advanced five wide into the second turn, was no match late and finished second best. MACHO ON DAX raced in mid pack early, made a middle move along
the backstretch, raced along the inside and flattened out late. DONT TELL NOOBODY was void of any early speed, saved ground throughout and offered
no late rally. BEHOLD'S HOTTIE tracked the early pace, raced seven wide through the turn and was empty late. INDY MOON followed the early pace and
was finished early. MAGIC CARPET RUN was taken back and was no factor.

Footnotes
SOLID GOLD BAR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore nearing the quarter and drew off through the
lane with complete authority. RUNAWAY REGENT broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive but
could not match strides with the winner. RADICAL ERUPTION stumbled at the start, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in
with a furlong to run and finished with good late energy. SWEET BEAU ROLL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished
evenly late. JAZZ TOWN broke awkwardly and was bumped, raced off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and failed to rally. INSOMNIA
disputed the pace from the inside for a half and weakened. STORMIN CORE vied for the lead from between foes, checked nearing the three-eighths marker
and weakened. HAPPY RESOURCES lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LESTER'S MEMORY was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the quarter and did not reach contention. JEDI FEVER hopped at the start was bumped and
lagged throughout.
