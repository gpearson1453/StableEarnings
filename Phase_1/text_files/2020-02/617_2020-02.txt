STORM chased the winner and threatened nearing the quarter pole, dueled close through the turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. FELLOW gave
chase inside then faded through the turn. LOVIE'S BITER was not a factor. TAX HUNTER came away slowly and never factored.

Footnotes
THOMAS EDWARD rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady
stretch encouragement to hold on well. GIO LEMON saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn,
angled out into the lane but couldn't improve. EDDY DIRT raced in the four and five path the opening turn then stalked the pace four wide, picked up the
chase approaching the three eighths pole but flattened through later yards. CASHTON PEAK settled back in the two and three paths and raced outside into
the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened stride about the three path of the far turn. LANA rounded the opening turn in the three
path then stalked the pace, though, showed little response through the backstretch. PLAYFUL SUNRISE stalked the earlier pace off the rail, picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. BLIMEY LIMEY was not a factor.

Footnotes
MR OPPORTUNITY broke in to make contact with Double Derby Perks then angled to the inside to set a pressured pace, contested the edge two deep on
the turn then dug in through the stretch to inch clear of CARTHAGE, who pressured the pace toward the inside and dueled close at even terms to
mid-stretch before flattening stride inside the sixteenth pole. JUST GO WITH IT exchanged contact with Musta Never Met U leaving the gate then picked up
the chase, raced in the three path through the turn and showed little further. DUSKY gave chase inside, raced at the rail through the turn and showed little
more. PROSPECT TOY was not a factor while giving chase inside. MUSTA NEVER MET U exchanged contact with Just Go With It leaving the gate then
gave chase through the backstretch, but, weakened while losing ground on the turn. DOUBLE DERBY PERKS was bumped leaving the gate then saved
some ground on the turn.

LASER LOOP settled off the early pace in the three and four paths and raced outside into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole, took the lead
approaching the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn then drew off under steady encouragement. GREELY IS BACK rated a short lead inside, gave
up a slim advantage to Katman Quick nearing the three eighths pole, contested even terms from that point but dropped back at the rail toward the quarter,
was no match through the lane and just lasted for second. CAUSE FOR SURPRISE rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled close, started a
bid leaving the three eighths pole then dueled for third inside the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the runner-up. KATMAN QUICK stalked the pace off the
rail then took a slim lead nearing the three eighths pole and raced at even terms from that point, but was caught nearing the quarter, dropped back midway
on the turn and weakened leaving the turn. KINGDOM MINDED was detained in the gate when the gate opened then broke in the air then settled back
saving early ground, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and showed little more. TRANSFIGURED raced

CUBIC SOUND was bumped and shuffled back leaving the gate then saved ground, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and dug in at the rail to get
up the final yards. ALL ABOUT TAP became fractious behind the gate and loaded reluctantly, but, came away sharply and rated a short lead inside, came
under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in under steady stretch encouragement, though was outfinished the
final yards. EISELE stalked the pace off the rail then picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, dropped back through the far turn but came again
down the lane and was gaining on the runner-up. LASHER came away a step slow and raced well off the early pace then eased out entering the
backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then eased to the outside through the lane and was gaining steadily. RUM
RUNNER RED raced well back then bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path but showed little more. GHOST MINE stalked
the early pace about the three path and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, then faded approaching the far turn. GLOBAL FIRST CLASS
broke awkwardly and in to make contact with Cubic Sound, rounded the opening turn in the five path, raced outside into the backstretch but showed little
response. FAST RIDE settled off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn and raced outside into the backstretch, showed no response and galloped
from the five sixteenths pole.

MISS CASUARINA stalked the pace from the three path then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth

on the far turn then dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn before relenting later yards. SILENT NOTION settled back while saving ground, bid
nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then finished evenly at the outside flank of Tel Aviv. MADEITOUTTAHARLAN saved ground
well off the pace then picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, drifted on the far turn and passed a couple of rivals down the lane. DANCING

FIBER AND EMILY gave chase outside then came in a path midway on the turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch, raced clear inside the sixteenth pole and
drew away later yards. SAGEBRUSH gave chase off the rail then came out a path midway on the turn, was checked from tight quarters between horses
leaving the turn, recovered stride past the eighth and dug in to take second later yards. SHUDDAWUDDACUDDA was hustled along after angling to the
inside and set a pressured pace at mostly even terms with Farewell Time, contested the edge nearest the rail through the turn and maintained the
advantage to mid-stretch before flattening stride. FAREWELL TIME gave chase and dueled at mostly even terms from the five sixteenths pole, but, bore out
on the turn and showed little more. WINDSOR LEGEND gave chase about the three path but was shut off at the heels of Sagebrush and Fiber And Emily
midway on the turn, bore out nearing the head of the lane and showed little further. The stewards reviewed claims of foul against the rider of Fiber And
Emily, lodged by the riders of Sagebrush and Windsor Legend, for interference mid turn and at the eighth pole, however, determined no change was
warranted.

Footnotes
ONCE MORE EH angled in to stalk the runner-up two deep and challenged that one nearing the five sixteenths pole, then dug in leaving the far turn to take
over the final yards. OFFSHORE TRIP rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole, dug in under steady encouragement
leaving the far turn but was caught the final yards. BURNIN RING O FIRE settled off the pace in the three and four paths the opening turn then bid leaving
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and dueled through the stretch for third. QUALITY MATTERS saved ground off the pace, bid
nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MARCH TO MY TUNE rounded the opening
turn in the five path and raced well off the pace leaving the turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the five path
and showed little further later yards. STRAPHANGER raced in the five path the first turn, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
off the rail and showed little further. A. P. D'ORO raced well back. MORE ILLUSIONS raced in the six path the first turn and was never a factor.
