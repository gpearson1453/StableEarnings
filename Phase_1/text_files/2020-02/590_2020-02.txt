TOP ROCKET raced close to the pace, bid seven wide, closed willingly, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew clear. RUNNING FOR GUS raced in close,
went eight wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and got up for place. HEAT SCORE dueled to the sixteenth pole, yielded and was all out for show.
STONE CREEK dueled past the eighth pole and was unable to sustain his bid. MUY BUENO was never far back, put in a steady effort, gained late and
failed to menace. PAITASKA saved ground, bid along the rail and hung late. ADAPTATION was unhurried early, bid eight wide, drifted a bit and gained
some late.

Footnotes
FABLES LOVE AFFAIR set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. SWEET POISON was never far back,
went seven wide entering the stretch, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. FRAN'S EMPIRE raced close to the pace, bid three wide
entering the stretch, hung late and held safely for show. LUCKY MAC raced five wide along the backstretch, went six wide entering the stretch, had nothing
left and faded. GRAND ENGAGEMENT pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and gave way. FEATHER BOA broke slowly, was void of early speed
and passed tiring rivals. CHIEFTESS pressed the pace to the turn and gave way. FRIED ONIONS broke slowly, raced wide and passed a tiring rival.
TEQUILA Y MIEL pressed the pace while racing along the rail, was steadied entering the turn, dropped back and stopped.
