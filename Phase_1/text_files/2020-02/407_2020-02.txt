Footnotes
J P'S GLADYS bothered and was off slowly, trailed early, two path through most of the turn, moved to the outside for the drive.finished willingly to be up in
time. COUNCIL RULES away well, dueled up front closest to the inside in the run up the backstretch, put that rival away early in the bend, second duel into
the lane, shook clear a furlong out, failed to contain the winner. CAN'T TOUCH ME back off the pace toward the inside, two path into the lane, lacked a
winning punch. ARROWSPHERE forwardly placed, dueled briefly outside the runner up into the stretch, weakened the final furlong. ANITA MARIE forwardly
placed four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, weakened in the run to the wire. SHE'S A LUCKY ONE off a step slow, saved ground to no avail. SHOWIT
dueled up front off the in side, faded. WISE EYES broke out, bothered rival, was straightened, raced three wide, had little left. NORTHERN CONNECT
remained back while racing outside.

Footnotes
PORTION with the pace from the start along the inside, shook off the runner up inside the furlong marker, kept to task the final sixteenth. PRIMARY PAULA
forwardly placed while off the inside, four wide into the turn, moved closer in the three path late in the bend, brief bid upper stretch, could not match the
winner the final furlong, narrowly lasted for the place. DAT GIRL in mid pack early outside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, finished up
willingly to be getting to the runner up late from the outside. LUCINDANSHADY pressed the winner from the outside for a half, gave way in the drive.
THURSDAY MORNING pinched back at the start, continued back as a result, dropped toward the inside early in the turn, moved back out to four wide
turning for home, improved position without posing a threat to the top three. LIL' FANCY void of speed, raced three wide through the turn, angled out a bit
four wide turning for home, displayed a modest amount of late interest down the middle of the strip. ESTHER chased the winner early in the two path, gave
way turning for home. LUCKY ROAD broke out, brushed, remained always back. WISH FOR CANDY settled in mid pack early, came up empty for the drive.
CYBER AFFAIR off slowly, steadied, far back, never a threat. SING A SONG TOO tired while racing inside. DADDY'S STORM broke back and was never
close.

Footnotes
TOUCHING RAINBOWS forwardly placed inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, moved out, set down, finished with good late energy to win
going away. AWESOME ANYWHERE set or forced the pace toward the inside, clear when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner late,
clearly second best. SEVEN NATION ARMY forwardly placed while racing three wide, weakened a bit in the drive, saved show. BATTLE STATION in the
second flight while racing three wide, asked along turn, went evenly in the drive. THE RED DUDE in the two path in the second group, lacked a closing
response. HUNKA BURNING LOVE void of speed, three out to four wide late in the turn, also lacked a rally. TOP BRASS broke back and was never
involved. NUCLEAR OPTION bobbled at the start, recovered to contest the early pace between rivals, began a steady fade before a half.
TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER squeezed back at the start, was never close.

Footnotes
FOREIGN EXCHANGE behind the first flight inside, steered out in the two path turning for home to hit a seam between rivals, put a head in front soon after
and drove clear. HOUSE DRUNK off slowly, well back early as a result, angled out four wide when advancing turning for home, finished willingly to be well
clear for the place. MINJI broke on top, narrowly set the pace along the inside, offered little resistance to the winner in upper stretch, proved no match for
the runner up late, saved the show. DEHYDRATION behind the first flight, four wide in the turn when moving closer, flattened out in the drive. CONGRATS
GIRL went one paced while racing off the inside. LILFEATHEREDINDIAN with the pace while racing three wide, weakened in the drive. WHERES MOM
bumped at the start, raced toward the inside, failed to menace. LIL H void of speed, passed tiring rivals. UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY remained always back.
GODSGIFT jostled at the start to be away slowly, never a threat. MIMI'S AWESOME vied up front between rivals for a half, stopped in the drive.

D' RAPPER settled off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn and into the lane, challenged inside the runner up while
continuing inside late, narrowly best in a determined effort. POWERFUL ALLY stalked the pace in the three path, advanced and challenged turning for
home, put a head in front past the furlong marker, outkicked late while outside the winner. SEVIER within striking distance outside, raced four wide through
the turn, lacked a winning kick. CONTROL STAKE broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, continued to vie through the turn and into upper stretch,
faltered in the final furlong. DEVILS HALO lacked speed along the inside, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. YOUVESAIDITALL was
always outrun. REASON TO SOAR last to leave, remained always back. BETTER CHARGE IT settled in mid pack, had nothing for the drive. HE WILL
settled in mid pack early off the inside, backed up in the drive. I'M CORFU moved inside to duel for the early advantage, began to weaken in turn, continued
to weaken in the drive.

LA RENOLETA (ARG) forwardly placed from the start while off the inside, continued to stalk on the outside in the run up the backstretch, advanced and
challenged the leader turning for home, gained the advantage and drew steadily clear while being kept to task. CLEVER SERVE void of early foot, trailed for
a half, rallied three wide into the lane, proved determined for the place while not a threat to the winner. GLAMORIZED chased the early leader, fell back
after a half, roused fro the drive from along the inside, came back to improve position a bit, outkicked for the place. CARISSA CRISMAS sprinted clear early
to set the pace, remained clear in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. BLESSED
AGAIN settled in mid pack, went evenly, roused for the drive, not enough for the show late while between horses. FIERY LADY lacked speed, moved out,
loomed a threat four wide in the final turn, hung in the drive. GOODBYE EARL broke back, never menaced. CALF MOON BAY fractious in the gate, gave
way into the far turn, eased up in the drive, walked in.

Footnotes
STREET TO INDY forwardly placed from the start outside, advanced and challenged four wide in the far turn, showed the way into the stretch and kicked
clear. FRANKNJYMME settled off the pace and the inside, rallied three wide out of the final turn, finished willingly to be clearly second best. DETERMINANT
moved outside in the first turn to be four wide onto the backstretch, continued outside and remained four wide through the second turn, staged a mild rally to
prove best of the rest. NEW MEXICO narrowly set the pace along the inside, continued to vie the middle half, fell back off the first flight in the second turn,
moved out a bit, continued to weaken gradually through the stretch. CARTE BLANCHE raced in the main pack toward the inside, continued to save ground
second turn, lacked a closing response in the drive. BANDIT POINT void of speed, continued well back in the run up the backstretch, displayed a modest
amount of late response to improve position. TRACKING GOLD off a bit slow, raced back, improved position after saving ground, no real threat. JACK VAN
BERG with the pace for six furlongs, gave way in the drive. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER settled in mid pack, failed to respond in the drive.
COMMUNICATOR rank in the first turn while forwardly placed and steering out in the first turn, raced three wide and prompted the pace, gave in through the
stretch and steadily backed up. KNOWYOUROPTIONS was finished after a half.

SHARE THE UPSIDE broke alertly, asked a bit to soon got clear along the inside, bit of a breather through the turn, well clear when straightened for home,
held the runner up comfortably safe late under steady handling. WHITMORE broke a bit back, moved closer toward the inside into the turn, moved out in the
two path late in the bend, roused for the drive, finished willingly to be slowly getting to the winner while drifting out a bit late. SILVER RIDE shuffled back
slightly into the turn to fall back and trail, saved ground through the turn, mild rally up the rail to annex the show late while not a threat to the top pair. NUN
THE LESS last to leave, moved outside and advanced into the second flight, five wide into the bend, four wide exiting when within striking distance, little left
late, nipped final strides for the show. WILBO lacked early foot out in the strip, four wide and in some traffic turn, flattened out a bit in the drive. TRINGALE
forwardly placed early, in traffic turn, was beginning to weaken when shuffled back between rivals late in the bend, continued to fade stretch. HOME RUN
MAKER chased the winner early, began a steady fade before a half.

SUNNY DALE back off the early pace, moved out and moved strongly to the fore three wide in the turn, quickly clear into the lane, drew out, kept to task the
final furlong. EXCHANGE WEST back off the pace while racing outside after breaking a step slow, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, proved no match
for the winner in the drive, edged clear for the place. ISLAND SKY off a step slow, backed back early toward the inside, angled out four wide exiting the turn,
angled inside midstretch, finished up best of the rest. MISS MARSHA LYNN lacked speed, raced in the two path through the turn, improved position through
