Footnotes
CUSTOM FOR CARLITA followed the clear leader from second, was urged along while two then three wide on the turn, rallied while still on her inside lead
into upper stretch, closed strongly to take the advantage while switching to the proper lead outside the furlong marker, drew away under the whip until inside
the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand ride in the final forty yards while much the best. LADY DATE was bumped lightly in the hindquarters at the
start, raced on the outside while coaxed along, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn, pursued the winner while still on her inside
lead in the stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. PAPER DOLL broke awkwardly then bumped lightly with the hindquarters of a foe and
was off bit slow, spotted the front about three lengths, moved up into the middle of the field while urged along, went around the turn in the two path and
lacked the needed response while just up for the show. HOT MELISSA broke alertly from the outside post, angled in while going to the front, opened up a
sizable advantage, rounded the turn in the two path, was put to a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead outside the furlong marker and weakened then lost the
show. KEHRON'S CREED dropped back while in tight between horses early, raced well back on the outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to
threaten. SUPERSPORT SALLY was urged along while well back in the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. EASTER GIRL tossed her head
after the start, was urged along while well back on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FIST OF RAGE broke out at the start, was hard held at the rear while three to four wide early on the first turn, dropped to the two path under restraint later
on that bend, was reserved at the back, went three wide early on the far turn then shifted five wide, advanced on the outside, took the lead while floating
seven wide into upper stretch then drew away under a drive, switched back to his inside lead while well clear at the furlong marker, drifted out nearing the
sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. LEMON BLITZ went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, raced just off the heels
of the leader while under tight restraint leaving the backstretch, waited behind horses while drafting in the two then three path on the far turn, was asked
inside the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. AL TAWEEL raced inside for most of
the first turn then moved to the two path, settled off the pace, lost position and dropped to the rear near the seven-sixteenths, was roused while two then
three wide on the far turn, paused along the rail around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SQUARE THE CIRCLE
went around the first turn in the four path, disputed the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three on the far turn, lost the advantage inside the
five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. HALF TRICK went five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved up under
urging to make a bid in the four path on the far turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage while five wide into upper stretch and
capitulated. DICKINSON'S IMAGE was hustled from the start, contested the pace on the inside, dropped back near the half-mile pole, came up empty along
the rail on the far turn and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
WINGS OF FURY hit the gate and bumped the outer rival at the start but quickly recovered to move forward and set the pace racing in the two path, faced
pressure from an outside rival up the backstretch and into the far turn still just removed from the rail on that bend, was put to urging coming past the quarter
pole and responded by edging clear in upper- to mid-stretch then was kept to the task late. SWEET BLINDNESS broke just a half step slowly, settled
tracking the leading pair along the inside, saved ground on the far turn as well coming out leaving that bend, was asked for more at the top of the stretch
while shifting in, came back out late for room and gained the place inside BELLA BELLE, who pressed the winner three wide leaving the first turn and up the
backstretch, was still three wide and in contention leaving the far turn, lost ground on that one in upper stretch, drifted out a bit late and lost second. SCARY
ANIMAL was bumped at the start, settled just off the leaders from outside racing in about the three path, edged closer three then four wide on the far turn
into the stretch but lacked the needed late kick while being forced out by a drifting rival nearing the wire. MISS SOONER GIRL was unhurried early racing
outside three to four wide, continued in the same paths on the far turn dropping back to last, came out six deep nearing mid-stretch and was not a threat.
SUMMER EXPRESS was away just a half step slowly then settled toward the rear racing inside a rival but in the two to three path through the first turn,
continued near but just off the inside to the far turn, angled from the three to the five path leaving that bend and was not a threat.

DATA LOAD was taken under a tight hold early, saved ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, rallied when roused in the two path on the far
turn, swung four wide while gaining inside the quarter-pole, closed strongly to get the lead at the furlong marker then moved clear under steady handling.
LAFITTE'S FLEET went around the first turn in the three path, contested the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, led into the
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner around the furlong marker and was outfinished while well clear for the place. DEMI PATRICK was hustled from the
start, went four wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the far turn and tired while able to get the show. CREALOCK
came out and bumped with a foe at the start, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, moved
out into the far turn, was ridden along while three to four wide on that bend, turned into the stretch under the whip and lacked the needed response. FRAY
was bumped at the start, went to the front, contested the pace while inside to the two path, came under urging on the far turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and capitulated. RANCHO BARGO went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch,
dropped back while inside on the far turn and retreated. AWE PATRIOT broke out at the start, went three to four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside,
dropped well behind while three to four wide on the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
HIERONYMUS was quickly clear to set the pace along the rail under light rating tactics early, given a bit more slack to go on with it leaving the far turn, put
to steady right-handed urging in upper stretch and responded by drawing off then was taken in hand in the final stages. JACK THE UMPIRE shifted in
heading to the first turn, saved ground just off the leaders along the rail through that bend, steadied just slightly early up the backstretch, continued inside
through the far turn, was taken up slightly near the three-sixteenths as a rival lugged in, ran on thereafter to gain the place while no threat to the winner.
PERFECT STAR was keenly fighting the rider into the first turn along the fence then switched outside a rival entering that bend going in the two to three
path inside a rival, trailed up the backstretch then went outside rivals into the far turn going three then four wide on that bend. DUKE OF CARTHANIA was
fractious in the paddock backing up through the hedge in the interior of the walking ring then back out through that same hedge, went well down the home
straight the first time but appeared to be getting out early on the first turn going five deep into that bend before shifting in a path nearing the midpoint, moved
forward to reach striking distance three wide on the far turn, dropped back while lugging in near the three-sixteenths and had no extra thereafter, returned to
the unsaddling area with the appearance of light blood droplets in his nostrils. RICHARD RONALD was forwardly-positioned racing in the four path into and
on the first turn stalking the winner, came in a bit for the run up the backstretch going about three wide into the far turn, had no response and dropped back
between rivals on that bend then faded.

EASY SHOT broke out at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside towards the rear, was roused while three then four wide on the far
turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead at the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and held under strong urging.
CORNSTARCH went around the first turn in the two path, was rated off the pace, drafted behind horses in the two path on the far turn, waited behind those
foes from the five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole, had the winner make his move in the process, dropped to the rail outside the three-sixteenths then was put
to a drive, rallied along the rail and finished with good energy for the place. MARTIAL EAGLE broke a bit awkwardly then bumped with a foe, was taken
back early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then
quickly moved to six wide, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished well to just miss the place while narrowly able to get the show. I WILL STAND
went four to five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole, lost the advantage
under the whip in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the trifecta. DR. HIPP bumped with a foe at the
start, set the pace on the inside, came under urging on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and gave way. TENSAS TALK traveled around the first
turn in the three path, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader leaving the backstretch, vied two to three wide on the far turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive and came up empty. THREE-QUARTER FRACTION WAS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION

KICK N KISS tucked in from the four to the three path early on the first turn tracking the leaders mid-division early, advanced outside foes four wide into the
far turn to challenge from outside, struck the lead by upper stretch, drifted in and out just a bit in mid-stretch under right- then left-handed urging but
nevertheless edged away late while kept to task. GIFTED TALENT settled into stride in the back half shift in three then two wide on the first turn, continued
unhurriedly up the backstretch, altered outside a tiring rival in the vicinity of the seven-sixteenths going four wide into the far turn and emerging five deep
from that bend, made a mild bid upper stretch ranging up along the flank of the winner but could not kick on with that one. PLAYIN N TRAFFIC was bumped
at the start, shifted in heading to the first turn, saved ground inside through that bend, came out a bit going in the two path on the far turn then three wide on
that bend, came four wide to the top of the stretch, was within striking distance but could only run on mildly while saving show honors. ALY'S CHARM
tucked in racing last but one and saving ground just off the rail then along the rail through the first turn, took closer order still on or just off the rail on the far
turn, came out in upper- to mid-stretch for room, kept on well but missed show honors. STEAL THE STARS exchanged a bump at the start but recovered
and moved to the fore readily, shifted in heading into the first turn with the lead, was quickly overtaken early on that bend content to track, switched out up
the backstretch, made a mild bid two to three wide between runners near the five-sixteenths but could not kick on with the winner and weakened in the
stretch. THE MISSING PIECE was rank and getting out into the first turn going four wide into that bend and carrying a rival out, came back in a path and
steadied early on that turn, was still keen to go on and moved clear up the backstretch then shifted in to dictate terms, was overtaken on the far turn and
came up empty. RUN BY was kept wide in the four to five path through the first turn, continued outside while wide up the backstretch, went five to six wide
on the far turn and was never near enough to threaten. OVERLY SWEET bumped with the outside foe then the inside rival at the start then steadied at that
juncture, trailed early, saved ground on the turns and was not a threat. FOREIGN CONNECTION was urged forward at the start, carried five wide into the
first turn by a drifting rival then shifted in a path early on that bend and a further path entering the backstretch, tracked the leaders and was within range
heading to the far turn, steadied slightly when in tight between foes nearing the three-eighths and continued to drop back and fade thereafter. DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION FRACTIONS WERE UNAVAILABLE AND FINAL TIME WAS HAND-TIMED..

Footnotes
SPIN RATE was reluctant to load then off slow, spotted the front around three lengths, was urged along at the rear, went two then three wide early on the
turn, shifted four wide in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead coming to the furlong marker then
quickly kicked clear and proved much the best under a brisk hand ride. FAIRWAY MAGIC broke a half-step slow, settled well off the pace, was roused in the
two path on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and finished willingly for the place. VERB showed speed on the outside then chased the
pace, made a bid in the four path on the turn, shook clear at the quarter-pole, drifted in while put to a left-handed whip at the three-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner approaching the furlong marker and weakened while clear for the show. STEELY DANZA was ridden along on the outside, angled
in midway down the backstretch, was taken in hand near the seven-sixteenths, came back under urging in the two path early on the turn, shifted three then
four then five wide later on that bend, drifted inward in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and tired.
MISCHIEF'S MACHINE settled well back on the outside, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out near the
three-sixteenths and failed to rally. ON YOUR MARK showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn and came up
empty. KEEN SAMURAI was reluctant to load, moved up early to take the lead, set the pace under pressure from his outside, vied inside to the two path on
the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
THE GRAY BLUR broke alertly while hustled and set the pace, vied inside of rival while in the two path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under his own
power, responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths, dropped in about a half-path at that point which put the runner-up in trouble, continued to
respond in the final furlong under a brisk hand ride and a couple taps of a down-turned whip and prevailed driving. SOUPER DORMY bumped with a rival at
the start, was rated off the pace, departed the backstretch under a very tight hold, drafted inside on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, steadied when
the leader came in a bit at the three-sixteenths, regained momentum into the final furlong then switched out and finished willingly for the place. CARPE
VICTORIAM jostled with a rival near the nine-sixteenths, was coaxed along off the pace, chased four wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper
stretch and lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. NOMO D'ORO steadied very slightly and briefly while crowded amongst horses outside
the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, was roused at the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive around the furlong marker and also lacked
the needed kick. MONEY BIZ tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path on the turn, came under the whip
turning into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. DECORATED bumped with a rival at the start then dropped back early, moved
out outside the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. CARPE NOCTEM jostled with a rival near
the nine-sixteenths, dropped back into the turn, went three wide on that bend, floated six wide into the stretch and faltered. Following the race, the rider of
SOUPER DORMY claimed foul against THE GRAY BLUR for alleged interference in upper stretch. After the stewards' review, no change was made to the
order of finish.

HARBOR KNIGHT settled at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong and closed
strongly to win going away. HALFOURRETIREMENT was carried in early then chased the pace, went three to four wide on the turn, made a bid while
moving a touch further out into the stretch, shook clear outside the furlong marker, drifted in while still clear outside the sixteenth-pole and was overtaken
while clear for the place. KISS OF THE WOLF chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch then drifted out some,
pursued the runner-up into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and weakened while able to get the show. MAY HOUR was urged along off
the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. YES MY SON chased the pace on the outside, made a bid near
