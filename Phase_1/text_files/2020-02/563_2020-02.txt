Footnotes
SAVE ME PAULA settled four deep and off of a hotly contested early pace, came under pressure leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the lane, closed
steadily under left handed rousing, moved past the embattled leaders late and edged clear. LITTLE HARBOUR sped to the early lead along the inside, got
into a duel with GONE HOME from the five eighths, continued the scrum to the sixteenth marker while holding a slim lead, drifted out late and gave way
grudgingly. GONE HOME engaged LITTLE HARBOUR from the outside with five furlongs remaining, dueled on a short lead into the lane, lost command
inside the furlong grounds, was floated out some late but kept trying to the line. AWESOME AT RIEDES , three wide between rivals nearing the turn, was
under a ride mid turn, angled four wide into the lane and had a slight response. MUCHO MACHO DANNY stumbled outward at the break and bumped with
WILD WOOD NORTH, saved ground off the pace and failed to make a recovery. CONFUSION BABY BOY , bumped at the break, was well placed tracking
the duel, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faltered through the final furlong. WILD WOOD
NORTH came in at the break, bumped with MUCHO MACHO DANNY, steadied soon after, raced off the issue while between runners into the turn and
failed to drum up a response.

Footnotes
JOHN JONES stalked the pace outside SMOOTH B, overtook that one in upper stretch and dug in tenaciously the final furlong to prevail. JEFAZO lacked
speed, was four deep around the turn and rallied outside the winner. HARPERS FIRST RIDE saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail in mid stretch
and had a mild rally between horses. TOUGHEST 'OMBRE chased the pace three wide around the turn, dropped back a bit in upper stretch, altered course
to the five path near the eighth pole and rallied late. SMOOTH B set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and gave way the final
furlong. CHARGIN STORM raced in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way in upper stretch.

CAUSE HE'S WESTERN , four wide into the first turn, stalked off the rail, commenced a run leaving the five sixteenths, came three to four wide for the
drive, leveled off under pressure past the three sixteenths, moved to command a sixteenth out and drove clear. FEDERAL WALK took over early, set a
rated pace toward the rail, held a clear advantage into the lane, kept on under a drive in mid stretch, drifted out some when collared nearing the sixteenth
pole then gave way grudgingly. FINAL PROSPECT prompted the pace two wide, was under a drive leaving the five sixteenths, gave hard chase past the
furlong grounds and continued with effort. AIN'T MISBEHAVIN flashed speed inside rivals then eased back off the leaders leaving the seven eighths,
dropped back under urging while two wide leaving the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, straightened and came back with interest. BOB'S MY UNCLE
lagged off the pace, saved ground into the lane and had a slight response. RELENTLESS LION chased off the rail and came up empty. LUCID DREAM
saved ground, angled out past the half mile marker, came five wide for the drive and faded.

BEYOND THE VICTORY , in hand and in range of a three pronged pace battle, took closer order under rating past the three eighths, shifted out and
responded when set down four wide in upper stretch, forged clear leaving the three sixteenths and steadily widened under solid handling. MOTI , unhurried
early, commenced a run mid turn while three wide, angled out wider into the lane, moved up in mid stretch, flattened out late but remained clear for the
pace. THE MAGICAL ONE dueled inside a pair of rivals while under some rating, spurted clear when shaken up entering the lane, could not resist the
winner, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth marker then faded. MYSTIC TIMES bobbled at the break, vied three deep, failed to kick on under a ride past
the quarter pole and gave way. UP AGAINST IT lost ground four to five wide, made a mild run past the three eighths then tired with a quarter mile
remaining. RISING PERRY dueled between foes for five and a half furlongs then faltered.

Footnotes
MISS TAP DANCE gained an easy early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail and held sway under energetic urging. ONE LAST TRIAL hugged the inner
rail, was put to the whip mid way on the far turn, angled out turning for home and rallied. DANCER'S MELODY hugged the inner rail in the stretch and
finished evenly. OMNI DIVA raced between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. WONDER CITY , three wide the first turn, had a mild three deep
advance on the far turn then weakened. LOOKIN DYNAMIC , inside horses on the backstretch, was checked in tight quarters approaching the far turn.
STEADY LOVE , four deep entering the first turn, chased the pace to the far turn and faltered. BABY KARATS showed brief speed in the three path on the
first turn and gave way on the far turn.
