Footnotes
BIG SPORT forwardly placed early along the inside under stout restraint, continued to track the pace in the two path split foes past the furlong marker,
dropped to the rail, finished with good resolve up the inside to be in time. FIREHORN pressed the issue in the two path for a half, took over into the lane,
briefly clear a furlong out, proved stubborn in the late going, gained the nod for the place. ACADEMY BAY pressured the issue in the three path, fell back in
upper stretch, late rebid on the outside the first flight at the wire, lost the nod for the place. VIRGA narrowly set the pace along the inside, lost the advantage
in upper stretch, gave way the final furlong. COLLECTION settled off the pace, in the two path exiting the turn, went evenly through the stretch. MAHALO
JOHN in mid pack and three wide, also came up empty for the drive. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN off a step slow, remained back. UNSTABLED off step slow,
four out to five wide turn, lacked a closing kick. D'URBAN PARK fell back after the start, trailed.

Footnotes
KURILOV (CHI) off a step slow, raced back, moved out, four wide into the far turn, challenged three wide turning into the stretch, long drive, proved best
while fully extended. CANDY CARLOS prompted the leader off the inside, drew alongside that rival in the far turn, vied between foes into and through the
stretch, proved game to the end. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT broke alertly, showed the way along the inside under restraint, continued to rate into the far turn,
responded when the runner up challenged soon after, continued to hold a slight advantage with a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly. MALIBU PRO
raced off the pace and the inside, steered out to be four wide turning for home, remained widest in the run to the wire, could muster only modest late
interest. CROATIAN forwardly placed along the inside, faded. MINEYEROWNMALONE in the second flight off the inside, faded off the inside.

SEEK N JUSTICE pressed the pace while racing three wide, vied on the outside into the lane, kicked well clear under steady handling. PEWTER narrowly
set the pace while racing along the inside, could not keep pace with the winner in the stretch, remained clear of the others. PAROLEE in the second flight
outside, came four wide out of the turn, set down, finished up best of the rest. DELTA SURPRISE vied up front while between the top two, weakened in the
drive. NIALL broke back, improved slightly while racing in the two path, no real threat. SUPERADO behind the first flight, came three wide out of the turn,
lacked a closing kick. GRASSETTO made little impact while racing inside. WORLD mid pack while off the inside, had nothing for drive. GASPERGOU raced
in mid pack early along the inside, faded. CHITTO broke in and slowly, raced well back early as a result, was three out to four wide turn, not a factor.

Footnotes
ROCKO'S WHEEL settled off the early pace toward the inside, moved out a bit onto the backstretch, three out to four wide far turn when advancing,
challenged into the lane, came in, brushed with the runner up a sixteenth out, edged away in the late going under firm handling. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF RIKER AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. RIKER forwardly placed toward the inside, in
some traffic behind the leaders in the second turn, got through along the rail turning for home, brushed with the winnerl with a furlong remaining, outkicked
to the wire, clearly 2nd best. ITALIAN CHARM raced in the second flight off the inside, in the second flight between horses into the far turn, waited behind a
wall of horses midway on that bend, came three wide into the lane, finished up best of the rest. MILLWOOD settled off the pace inside, swung out four wide
late in the second turn, improved a bit into the lane then flattened out in the late going. BARATTI lacked speed off the inside, went one paced the middle
half, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. GOT MOJO off a step slow, trailed well back, found best stride too late. KENTUCKY ALLSTAR broke
back, lacked speed in the two path, made little impact. IOWA NATIVE broke on top, got clear early, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, gave way
when headed turning for home. DEVILS HALO forwardly placed while racing three wide, gave way. YOU SPLIT TENS chased the leader in the two path,
moved slightly closer in the turn then stopped in the drive.

ADHHAR off bit slow, raced back and three wide through the turn, angled 4w into lane, finished willingly to win going away. SAILOR CHOW away in good
order, came out a bit early, vied up front between rivals, dueled into the lane, put the other speed away past the furlong marker, proved no match for the
winner late, held sway for the place. MY NAME IS PHRED off slow, raced back, in the two path through the turn, steered out a bit, finished willingly to be
closing the gap on the runner up. VAYA CON DIOS vied up front three wide, dueled outside the runner up into the stretch, gradually weakened the final
furlong. ACE GILFORD with the pace along the inside, faltered in the turn while continuing to save ground. GAMBLER came in soon after the start, bumped
with rival, continued one paced while four wide turn, lacked late bid. ASTROLOGER failed to menace in remaining always back. WYOMING CONQUEST
bumped early, angled in through the turn, faded. MR. SHAPOOR fell back to trail after the start, showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
LAURIEANN close from the start off the inside, roused late turn in the three path, engaged the leader from the outside inside the furlong marker, drifted in
slightly, drew clear. PRAIRIE DRESS broke alertly, set the pace off the inside, remained in the two path turn, briefly responded when confronted by the
winner inside the furlong marker then could not keep up. FOOLISH PRINCESS within striking distance toward the inside, two path entering the stretch,
slowly gaining for the place late. WHOVILLE closest to the pace inside, weakened gradually in the drive. CONGRATS GIRL off a bit slow, raced back while
a bit rank early, traffic turn, two path in the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. SOUTHERN CENTS void of speed, showed some
belated interest after racing four wide out of the turn. UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY back off the pace, four wide through the turn, lacked a significant closing
response. LIL H settled off the pace, also lacked a closing kick. TAPALONG saved ground to no avail. HER GOLD MINE off a step slow, moved up to mid
pack the opening quarter, three wide turn, tired in the drive. EMILY BUG void of speed, remained back. VIVA LA SECRETA finished early, trailed home.

REMEMBERING RITA broke in good order from the inside, set a soft set of fractions while firmly in hand, continued to show the way into the lane, shook
clear and maintained a daylight advantage to the wire while being kept to task. M G WARRIOR within striking distance, moved a bit closer from between
horses in the second turn, could do little with the winner while fully extended to hold the place. HAWAAKOM settled off the pace while saving ground,
continued inside second turn, hooked up inside the runner up for a long drive for the second spot, outkicked. CHANGI fell back to trail, never threatened.
THETRASHMANSCOMING within striking distance, raced forward and three wide, roused, had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
GRIT AND CURIOSITY in the second flight under stout restraint just off the inside, checked up in some traffic into the turn, recovered and came three wide
into the lane, outside bid, edged clear, driving. SEVEN NATION ARMY closest to the leader off the inside, challenged between foes and inside the winner
into the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms with that rival past midstretch then could not keep up, held sway for the place. PRINCIPE GUILHERME last to
leave, raced back, two path into the lane, rallied through traffic and was going well at the end. RULER OF THE NILE settled in mid pack, raced three wide
through the turn, improved position somewhat with some mild late interest. ABSOLUTELY AIDEN broke on top, set the pace along the inside, faltered when
confronted for the drive. K CHOICE within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, moved out slightly for the drive,
came up empty. FAST BREAKIN CASH fell back to trail, saved ground turn, improved position through some traffic. BEST OF GREELEY back off the pace,
raced four wide into and through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. JERSEY AGENDA was never involved along the inside. PETE'S PLAY CALL
back off the pace outside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked closing kick. ONCEWEWEREBROTHERS forwardly placed early outside, four wide late in the
turn, gave way in the drive.
