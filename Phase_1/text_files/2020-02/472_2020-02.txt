FLIRTY lost position at half, commenced a late run from mid track to be along in time. ABSOLUTE LOVE pressured pace to half, took over quarter pole, led
deep stretch but run down late. TEMPESTUOUS AMY well place early, lost position quarter pole and rallied wide late coming on. NO INTEREST perfect
position throughout and failed to fire in the drive. MOMENTA KAT never far back throughout, outside bid stretch, faltered late. MADAME BARBARIAN never
a real factor. SHEESA PONTIAC good speed to the front, dueled to the half, gave way readily.

ARCHIE'S GIRL no speed to the quarter, steady inside run to turn, perfect trip. DANEIRA close up to the turn, four wide move, led mid stretch, outfinished.
SHAPE OF YOU speed to the front, collard past quarter pole, faltered in drive. HEY HEY raced evenly outside with no late run in the stretch. DRAMA RUN
no speed to the turn, improved position inside in the drive. OLD CENTRE wide trip with no late bid in the stretch. ANGELFROMTHESTARS rushed inside to
contend to the half, gave way readily. COUNTRY DREAMIN raced extremely widest throughout, losing ground all the way. I'M SO MUNNY dueled between
horses to half, dropped back suddenly. FOGGY KITTEN through early, dropped back. LADY FURBEIN trailed entire way, seemed to lose action down the
backstretch, no factor.

Footnotes
INVADER stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, took over command in the upper stretch then drew away in the final stages while much
the best. HIGH HOLY was bumped at the start, set the pace early, was off the rail into the lane while no match for the winner in the stretch run but was
second best. TOMA TODO came in and was bumped at the start, raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run.
MY MAN FLINTSTONE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and lacked any gain in the stretch drive. RYAN'S CAT tracked the pace
early, was in the four path into the lane and faded in the stretch. ARTEMUS EAGLE never involved while on a inside trip. HAIL TO THE CHIEF showed little.
BAHAMA CHANNEL was through after a half.
