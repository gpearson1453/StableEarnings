Footnotes
LEGACY'S PRINCE, squeezed back at the start, raced between rivals early and then went to the rail, took the lead near stretch and drew off under steady
pressure. BILL'S MAFIA set the pace in four path then was unable to keep pace late. CLOUDY SATURDAY, unruly in the gate, was under the grasp of the
assistant starter at the break and left the gate in a tangle, was outrun early, raced between foes advancing but was too late. DUBROVSKY, between foes
while just off the pace, tired. MANIPULATE, three wide in second flight, faded through the final furlong. INCIDENTALLY raced wide and failed to be a
serious threat. SOUNDS GOOD, squeezed leaving the gate, was never a factor. DADDY'S PLACER came in leaving the gate causing crowding, raced wide
and was no factor. BANNON came out leaving the gate contributing to the crowding then saved ground. BRAZEN PRINCE had speed for a half mile.

Footnotes
THE CARLBROOK KID set the pace in the three path, extended his lead leaving the turn and was under pressure to deep stretch. LITTLE SIETE saved
ground, challenged on the turn but then was unable to keep pace. OFF THE MARK broke slowly then was steered wide, continued outside and was no
threat. EASTPORT broke slowly and was outrun early, split foes in stretch and passed tiring ones. LAWYER ROY, wide and just off the pace, tired. LITTLE
VINNIE, three wide prompting the early pace, tired. RISING STORM raced outside and showed little. YES IT'S BONIFIDE, lapped on winner early, tired.

Footnotes
FINISHING SCHOOL raced close up outside of WAY OVER BUDGET, pressed the pace, bid two wide on the far turn, led into the lane, responded when
roused, drew off, ran away and was ridden out. WAY OVER BUDGET set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, could not stay with
that rival in the stretch and was well clear for the place spot. HAILEY'S WAY stalked between rivals in the early stages, chased on the far turn, lacked a
winning bid and finished evenly. GEORGIA BONNET steadied at the start, raced off the pace, advanced at the quarter pole and passed tired foes.
BELLAMY CAT tracked inside and gave way. TIZ A DATE raced three wide on the first turn, chased outside and gave way. SAVANNAH'S DREAM raced off
the pace, failed to respond and gave way.

IRISH COLONEL, wide early, moved in on the far turn, took the lead early stretch, drifted out through deep stretch and drew clear. SHANE'S JEWEL
stalked the pace two wide, drifted out leaving the turn, steadied briefly early stretch and regained place. KLINGON WARRIOR raced outside winner, moved
wider into stretch, took up chase, was no match and was being eased through final sixteenth. DROSSELMAGIC saved ground and failed to menace.
ASPHALT PAVING broke slowly and never threatened. GUNS OF STEEL raced wide and drifted wider into stretch. FIX ME A SANDWICH set the pace just
off rail, drifted out leaving the turn and stopped

LUCKY HERO dueled inside for the early lead, shook free on the turn, responded when roused and drew clear under urging. KELLI'S SMILE chased three
wide, rallied three wide into the lane, dug in and was all out to get the place photo. SCREEN SAVER was fractious behind the gate, chased three wide,
came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, dug in and just missed for second. ASPEN XTREME raced two wide off the pace, came three wide into the
lane and rallied mildly inside. REFUSEING raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside.
STRAWBERRY RED steadied at the start, raced off the pace inside, rode the rail in the stretch and lacked a rally. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE dueled two wide
for the lead, chased on the turn and faded. ARRECIFE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the turn and did not factor. TOO MUCH JOHNNIE
chased between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE CHUCK took the lead soon after start, ran freely in front in the four path, opened a long lead on the final turn and maintained under strong
handling. UNDENIABLE TEMPER very wide early, took up chase after a half and had no late gain. MARQ ONE raced wide and wasn't a serious threat.
BACKSTRETCH GEORGE, just off the rail and just off pace, tired. ZIPPED CODE saved ground early, swung wide and didn't threaten. J R JELLYBEAN
was in the four path and tired. FLEET FIRST was never a factor. CINCO Y CINCO showed little. GOOD SAVE failed to threaten. REFUNDED saved ground
early, moved out and tired. THE MONEY TRAIN had only brief speed.
