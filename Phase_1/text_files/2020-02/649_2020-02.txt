BIRDIE prompted the pace clinging to a narrow lead into upper stretch wearing from use late. GLORIOUS FREEDOM prompted the early pace dueling to
upper stretch coming up short near mid track. ROSES FOR MARTINA raced second flight losing ground to upper stretch lacking surge in the six path.
PEBBLE SLINGER played no factor. GRANDMA DOTTIE was never involved. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION SWEET BAYTOWN WAS DISQUALIFIED

Footnotes
ODDS GET EVEN sent clear set the pace widening along the rail in upper stretch being hand ridden from the eighth pole. POUR IT OUT a step slow on the
outside rallied to upper stretch bidding three deep to salvage place. FRIENDLY WAGER went evenly giving a mild rally in upper stretch mustering enough
late to best the others. DIDDY DEW slow early gave a modest response to move up a bit late. SCHILLER NAV raced evenly through the turn vying
somewhat in upper stretch hanging late. E Z'S WIDE OPEN slow early raced six wide to upper stretch. ASTRO ORBITER chased the pace through the turn
wearing out the final eighth. LAFLEUR was never involved. A B G GUERRERO hustled along pursued to upper stretch wilting the final eighth. SANTO
BRUNO faded on the turn. PABLO'S QUEST was always outrun.
