Footnotes
THE ADRIE FACTOR was allowed to settled, saved ground, rallied into the turn, angled out, got a head in front near the eighth pole and drew off under
urging. OUR MAGIC MOMENT sprinted clear to set the pace to mid stretch, was no match late and finished second best. TRAFFICISKILLINGME settled off
the pace, went six wide at the top of the stretch, had little left for the drive, held safely for show, clearly best of the rest. B C BEAUTIFUL saved ground in an
even effort and did not threaten. TIRUNESH raced in the back in an outside trip, lacked a bid and was outrun. CHICLE SPARKS failed to contend and was
not urged through the stretch. CATCHACOUGAR broke awkwardly, was taken outside, was through early, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
ANGELS ON HIGH saved ground mid pack, angled out on the turn, bid five wide, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides.
PERKY BRUNETTE broke slowly, raced close to the pace, angled in, closed inside, led late and was caught. TIZ YOUR WAY raced close to the pace
outside, bid six wide, finished well and gained late to earn show. GLIMPSEDINTHEMIST set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, led to deep
stretch and faltered to lose position. KOOL QUEEN pressed the pace inside, dropped back on the turn and finished evenly. RUHAY raced in the back, went
seven wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. SHADOW CATCHER was not a factor. VIVIR MI VIDA was outrun.

DIMERA pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, was carried eight wide, fell back, came again once straightened and wore down
FORTHWITH to get up at the wire. FORTHWITH set a pressured pace, swung wide leaving the turn and was caught at the wire to just miss. SINK THE
BISMARCK pressed the pace, angled in leaving the turn, faltered past the eighth pole and held for show. BEVOLUTION pressed the pace while racing
outside, was carried nine wide leaving the turn, fell back, continued willingly and didn't have enough late. WILT lagged while racing outside, went ten wide at
the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. WED O'S CHAMP was never far back, raced inside, bid off the rail and came up empty late. I'LL TAKE
YOU OUT failed to threaten in an even effort. DELUX PREMIER was void of early speed and improved position in an even effort. BABY GROOT was not a
factor. BIG FRENCHY was outrun. JAY LOST CONTROL raced mid pack, had nothing left for the drive and gave way.

WICKED WINNINGS was never far back, rallied on the turn to challenge, dueled for the lead and was caught near the wire. RACE HOME was never far off
the pace, bid inside on the turn to challenge, dueled to deep stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. COASTLINE SERMON raced close to the pace,
closed steadily and gained late to narrow the gap. JACKS OUTLAW raced in the back, closed under urging and improved position. HERZEN was void of
early speed, saved ground, bid inside on the turn and hung late. ARIZONA JEREMY set a pressured pace, bore out on the second turn, dropped back and
gave way. HONDO LANE raced between horses early, vied to the second turn, was carried out , dropped back and had no further response. JAMMERS
