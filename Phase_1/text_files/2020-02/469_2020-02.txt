advantage approaching the sixteenth pole and inched away late. RED VALOR went up inside a rival to duel a bit off the rail, inched away on the turn, fought
back in midstretch, drifted in through the final furlong and could not match the winner late. CONCORD JET sped to the early lead off the rail, dueled outside
the winner, stalked on the turn, was between horses into the stretch and held third. POLITY stalked off the rail then outside, came three deep into the stretch
and weakened. RINESHAFT was in a good position stalking the pace off the rail, dropped back outside a rival on the turn and did not rally. DERBY

under urging in the stretch, kicked clear and held. ALMOST A FACTOR chased outside a rival, came out leaving the second turn and three deep into the
stretch and finished willingly. SASSYSERB three deep early, stalked off the rail, bid alongside the winner into the backstretch then stalked again, re-bid
alongside that rival on the second turn and into the stretch and held third. WARRIOR'S MOON saved ground stalking the pace, came out a bit into the
stretch, continued toward the inside, came out again late and was edged for the show. NAVY QUEEN saved ground chasing the pace, cut the corner into
the stretch and weakened. BABY BOO stalked outside a rival, dropped back leaving the second turn, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch and had little
left for the drive.

pulled clear in the final sixteenth under some urging. SILK FROM HEAVEN had good early speed and dueled inside, inched away briefly early on the turn,
fought back along the rail leaving the turn and into the stretch and until past midstretch and held second. TIME FOR EBBY stalked off the rail then outside a
rival, went three deep leaving the turn and into and through the stretch and edged rivals for the show. STORMIN RANGER dueled between horses then
stalked just off the rail on the turn, continued between rivals through the lane and was edged for the show. TIME FOR SUZZIE saved ground stalking the
pace throughout and was edged for a minor award. LUCKY MS JONES broke a bit slowly, was sent along to chase the pace inside, came out on the turn

off the pace, came out into the stretch and picked up the show. EROTIC between horses early, chased a bit off the rail then inside, came out on the second

DER LU sped to the early lead, set the pace a bit off the rail then inside, came a bit off the fence into the lane, kicked away in the stretch, drifted in a bit and
won clear under a crack of the whip inside the eighth pole and steady handling. FIRST STAR close up stalking the winner outside a rival then just off the rail
to the stretch and was clearly second best. KAYDETRE three wide into the first turn, stalked outside then off the rail leaving the second turn and into the
stretch and held third. STARR OF QUALITY saved ground chasing the pace, came off the rail on the second turn and into the stretch and did not rally.
CHICKATINI four wide into the first turn, chased outside a rival, dropped back off the inside on the second turn and gave way.

Footnotes
OH PRETTY WOMAN angled in and stalked a bit off the rail, bid alongside the pacesetter leaving the second turn to take the lead into the stretch, kicked
clear under urging and held on gamely. Y NOT SIZZLE steadied when forced in between horses early, stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the
stretch and finished willingly. OUR ROMANCE also steadied when forced in between rivals early, angled in and stalked inside, came out in upper stretch,
split horses in midstretch and bested the others. DURGA in tight early, angled in and chased inside, split horses into the stretch and lacked the needed late
kick. TOO HOT FOR CURLIN steadied early, saved ground chasing the pace, came out in upper stretch and bested the others. STARSHIP SKY pulled
along the inside early, chased outside a rival then just off the rail, went outside a foe on the second turn and three wide into the stretch and lacked the
necessary rally. HOT MAGISTRATE crossed to the inside on a short early lead, set the pace along the rail, fought back leaving the second turn and into the
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. WINDS ALOFT was in very tight between horses and clipped heels early, chased outside a rival then three deep
into the second turn, continued off the rail into the stretch and did not rally. DANCE COSTUME also clipped heels in very tight between horses after the
start, settled alongside a foe then a bit off the rail, angled in leaving the second turn and weakened. Following a stewards' inquiry HOT MAGISTRATE was
disqualified and placed ninth for interference after the start.
