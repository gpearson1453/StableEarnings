Footnotes
KHOLSTOMER shifted inwards while attending the pace under firm rating in the opening quarter, continued to prompt the issue inside a rival racing into the
turn, edged forward on his own courage nearing upper stretch, came under some mild hand urging to extend the advantage, then was gathered up in the
closing stages in a ridden out effort. TORTOLA PRIDE broke slowly, switched outside foes while being urged to terms with the first flight, advanced three
deep through the backstretch, shifted inwards on the turn pressing the issue but proved no match after a half. PALIMPSEST tracked off the first flight while
angling out five wide on the backstretch, continued in that path into the turn and improved position outside foes while proving no real threat. DRAFTABLE
tracked off the first flight four wide on the backstretch but soon retreated. DANVILLE ROAD broke slowly and proved no threat. SAUCY DEREK angled
inwards to force the pace between foes in the opening quarter but emptied out abruptly entering the turn.

Footnotes
FREDDY SOTO, in touch with the pacesetter in the opening stages, conceded some position tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, continued
with a steady bid to challenge for command approaching the sixteenth marker, wrested the advantage and went clear in time under firm left handed
pressure. WHITE DRILL sped to the fore while angling inwards, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail into the turn, continued past
midstretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner late. INITFORTHELOVE tracked the pacesetter along the inside, saved ground on the turn,
shifted out in the closing stages and finished evenly late. NO LOOK BACK tracked off the leaders four wide in the opening stages and steadily faded into the
turn. ONE CRAZY RIDE, restless in the gate prior to the start, broke slowly and soon dropped out.

Footnotes
CASCABELL QUEEN pulled her way clear along the rail racing into the backstretch, was prompted to turn back a rival's challenge racing into the far turn,
held sway on a comfortable advantage racing into upper stretch and widened the margin in the closing stages under steady left handed encouragement.
SHARON'S LAW, unhurried between foes racing to the backstretch, advanced to contention three wide racing on the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. CAT CAY tracked the leaders from out of striking near the inside while under some prompting to gain position, swung out five wide
entering the lane and edged rivals for a share late. OHIO STORM tracked the pacesetter along the inside to the backstretch, switched out while being urged
to prompt the leader nearing the far turn, continued in pursuit of that foe into the lane but steadily faded. GLOBALPRINCESSCOCO tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival in the opening half, made some brief progress between foes racing through the far turn but proved empty in the drive. SPITFIRE SUZIE
ducked out a bit at the start, was caught four wide racing to the backstretch and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
GILDED DRAMA angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter from just out of striking distance in the opening stages, saved ground through the turn, was
roused to bid for command inside the pacesetter when presented an opening racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under right
handed pressure. CHESS MASTER, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, advanced on that foe racing into upper stretch
to bid for command three deep nearing midstretch but proved only second best. SIR HIGGINS was hustled to the lead from the break while angling to the
inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch, shifted out entering the lane and yielded to the top pair leaving midstretch. RATTLESNAKE
RIDGE, caught five wide in the opening stages, angled inwards nearing the turn to gain some position between rivals, then shifted to the inside late while
finishing evenly. RELISHMENT was settled between foes in the opening stages, then angled to the rail, saved ground through the turn but had no closing
bid. HE'S ROYALTY tracked off the second flight racing four wide in early stages but, faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HOMBRAZO, never far back, stalked just off the pacesetter between rivals under light reserve racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid moving
to terms with that foe on the far turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch and edged forward under left handed pressure while jumping tire tracks nearing
the wire. SUMMER ASSAULT sped to the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch, dictated the pace on a narrow margin into the far turn, dueled for
command on a narrow advantage into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. FROSTED ROSE angled inwards tracking just off the leaders
racing to the backstretch, continued inside a rival into the far turn and steadily faded while shifting out racing into upper stretch. ROCK THE PARK ducked
outwards a bit at the start, was righted to track just off the leaders three deep racing into the backstretch but gave way racing into the far turn.

SO CUNNING exchanged contact with HEATHER HILLS while off a step behind the leaders, pulled her way to contention while angling to the inside under
firm rating racing into the turn, continued under light reserve awaiting an opening nearing upper stretch, was roused through inside foes to wrest command
entering upper stretch, shifted out leaving the furlong marker but steadily extended her advantage under firm hand urging. NAUGHTY SHIRLEY broke
sharply, was rated tracking just off the leader racing three deep to the turn, was prompted to advance in that path racing into upper stretch challenging for
command, shifted inwards under right handed pressure, then was steadied leaving midstretch to avoid contact with the winner and proved best of the
others. G Q GIRL, restless in the gate, hopped at the start while breaking slowly, switched outside foes tracking off the second flight racing to the turn,
improved her position advancing four wide between foes nearing upper stretch and edged a rival for a share. HEATHER HILLS shifted out exchanging
contact with the eventual winner at the start, sped clear of her rivals while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail
into the turn, then gave way between foes leaving midstretch. ADONAI BLESS tracked the leaders from out of striking distance five wide in the opening
stages, was fanned five wide racing into the stretch and steadily faded. TOLLY HO, prominent along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside the
pacesetter after the opening furlong while being urged to prompt that rival between foes racing into the turn but gave way after a half. FOLLOWING THE
RACE THE RIDER OF NAUGHTY SHIRLEY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE
THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN WARRIOR tracked the leaders from out of striking distance racing five wide off the second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to
advance four wide on the bend to challenge for command racing into upper stretch and took over in the closing stages under some right handed
encouragement. GIANT TRICK broke sharply, raced on terms with a rival disputing the pace just outside that foe to the turn, dispatched that foe nearing
upper stretch, then shifted out while briefly resisting the winner's challenge but proved only second best. THE EXCEPTION tracked off the first flight
between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the turn, briefly awaited an opening, shifted out, then was momentarily taken in hand when
caught in close quarters but continued with interest once clear to gain position between foes to the end. YOUNG AMERICAN tracked off the first flight three
wide between foes racing to the turn, was urged to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch and proved empty late. MR JOSHUA broke awkwardly, was urged
inside rivals pressing the pace racing into the turn and gave way into the stretch. MY LITTLE ROCKSTAR, forwardly placed outside foes tracking just off the
first flight racing to the turn, gave way early. WILKO FREEWAY was settled last and failed to menace. MONEY BROKER proved no factor.

KING CAUSE broke readily to gain the advantage, dictated the pace racing just off the rail into the backstretch, held sway into the far turn, drifted out
nearing midstretch despite right handed pressure but held LONTANI on a safe margin to the end under pressure. The latter was fractious when being
saddled in the paddock, tracked just outside the pacesetter under light rating racing to the backstretch, was prompted to close the gap on that foe nearing
upper stretch, altered course while continuing in pursuit inside the winner in the closing stages but couldn't gain terms with that rival. AMERICANDY broke
slowly, regained position to track just off the leaders between foes racing to the far turn and gained some position late while no menace to the top pair.
JIMMY D angled to the inside early tracking just off the leaders racing to the far turn and faded into the stretch. A GIRLS BESTFRIEND tracked the leaders
three wide in second flight racing to the far turn and gave way.

WHISTLE ME HOME broke readily to dictate the pace on a narrow margin just off the inside racing into the backstretch, continued to dictate terms to the
second bend, then was roused clear under firm left handed encouragement through upper stretch and was taken in hand late once the issue was decided.
CROWN TO THE GOLD broke slowly losing position to the field, angled nearer the inside tracking well out of striking distance in the opening half, gathered
momentum racing into the far turn, shifted out to split rivals nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the place honors in
time. DON'S MARSH angled to the rail in early stages tracking just off the pacesetter, continued under light rating to the second bend, was prompted to
advance while shifting out racing into upper stretch but had no late bid. PERP tracked off the first flight outside a rival, shifted out four wide on the
backstretch, continued in that path to upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. HILLS POND was urged to terms from the
outset prompting the pacesetter racing to the far turn, then gave way into the stretch. MEILLEUR, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just off the
pacesetter, gave way entering the far turn, then shifted to the inside in late stages. TO YOUR HEALTH broke slowly and trailed throughout.
