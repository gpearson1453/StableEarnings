Footnotes
DUCHESS OF SUSSEX vied for command outside LA BABIA from the start, edged away with a sixteenth remaining and held off CAT LADY to the wire.
CAT LADY got bumped hard by DUR A CUIRE into the first turn causing the rider to lose the right iron out in the six-path, regrouped to a stalking position
outside the leaders entering the backstretch, bid three wide into the lane and finished gamely outside the winner. LA BABIA broke alertly and contested the
pace inside DUCHESS OF SUSSEX, battled on through the furlong grounds and weakened late. TIS A PITY saved ground to the far turn, moved to the
two-path approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly for a share. WICKED MERCURY brushed with FLY FIGHT WIN heading to the first turn, was well
placed inside for six furlongs, and lacked the needed late response. HEAVENLY PEACE was squeezed back at the start between MIDNIGHT MARVEL and
REDEMPTION DAY, saved ground early, went four wide on the far turn and could not threaten. REDEMPTION DAY bumped with HEAVENLY PEACE at
the start, steadied midway on the first turn, and never factored. DUR A CUIRE was bumped hard by FLY FIGHT WIN and knocked into CAT LADY while five
wide entering the first turn, was forced to take up behind FLY FIGHT WIN shortly after that, and could not recover. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) wound up four
wide around the first turn, and was always outrun. MIDNIGHT MARVEL bumped with HEAVENLY PEACE at the start, and was always outrun. FLY FIGHT
WIN became rank behind horses entering the first turn, brushed with WICKED MERCURY and shifted out slamming into DUR A CUIRE, continued
extremely difficult to handle forcing the latter to take up midway on that turn, and faltered after six furlongs. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE RUN AROUND THE FIRST TURN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID raced seven paths wide and settled in early stages then launched five wide bid near the three eighths pole, quickly advanced to command
near the quarter pole, stayed sharp in response under right handed pressure upper stretch and continued to pull away while ridden out in final sixteenth.
DEXTER ROAD tracked the pace down the backstretch then hustled along three wide around the far turn, kept under a drive five wide in stretch run and
cleared second best. TAKEDOWN led the way out of the chute then challenged by inside running WW CONCERTO mid-way down the backstretch, vied for
the lead into the turn, began to move away from rival while under attack from TRAPPEZOID, could not move on with eventual winner near the quarter pole
then stayed on to collect a share. W W CONCERTO steadily advanced up the rail and challenged TAKEDOWN for the lead mid-way down the backstretch,
vied into the turn then failed to move on for the lead mid-turn, stayed on with response near the inside in stretch then faded in late stages. RIVER OF
DREAMS raced in range along the outside, prompted four wide around the turn but failed to move on. SUMMER SPICE raced off the early pace and saved
ground into upper stretch, angled out a couple paths and lacked a needed rally. ROYALSTON raced off the early pace and four wide leaving the
backstretch, hustled along under steady pressure around the turn but failed to respond. GRAY DUDE raced in close contention and tracked the pace to the
far turn then faded.

Footnotes
SWEET YARE N DIRA got off to a hesitant start several lengths behind the others, split horses into the turn getting back in the game, checked at the top of
the stretch unsuccessfully trying to get through inside POCKET OF CANDY, altered course to the three-path for the drive, overtook the leaders under hand
urging and was wrapped up nearing the finish. SOME SAY SO was edgy in the gate prior to the start, leapt in the air at the break while getting away alertly,
chased outside POCKET OF CANDY around the turn, wrested the lead away from that rival through the furlong grounds, but could not contain the winner.
POCKET OF CANDY sprinted clear early and moved inside, dug in battling with SOME SAY SO turning for home, and yielded through the final stages on
the rail. BRIGHT VENEZUELAN chased three wide to the quarter-pole, and could not gain on the far outside late. VINYARDNINA was slow into stride, and
never reached contention. DIABLO'S DARLING was finished early inside.

Footnotes
SPARTANKA tracked the embattled pair down the backstretch then advanced three wide to challenge for the lead entering the turn, vied three deep then
continued to battle with PLEASANT ORB in stretch run, dug in gamely and edged away deep stretch. PLEASANT ORB vied for the lead with HAPPY BEE
down the backstretch then took on the added challenge of SPARTANKA around the turn, fought back gamely for the lead with SPARTANKA in stretch run
then had no closing kick left in reserve. RISK MODEL bobbled a step out of the gate, raced off the top two flights positioned near the inside, prompted four
wide around the turn, continued a steady outside bid through the lane and secured show. LOW PRESSURE ZONE raced widest down the backstretch then
roused to pick up the pace entering the turn, kept under steady pressure, shifted wider mid-stretch and stayed on evenly. GENEALOGIST tracked on the
inside through early stages, continued to save ground on the turn then steadily weakened in the lane. HAPPY BEE vied for the lead with PLEASANT ORB
down the backstretch, continued to battle back around the turn then came up tired at head of the lane. EMPIRE LADY raced off the early pace and four wide
leaving the backstretch, moved into stretch run four wide under steady pressure and failed to move on. SHE THROWS HEAT raced in or near the back and
saved ground to no avail. DOUBLE LINE dropped back early, raced wide and eased up in the lane.

Footnotes
BALLIE'S DREAM bumped lightly with CORY GAL at the start, tucked in behind the leaders on the rail for three furlongs, found an ample opening in the
two-path turning for home and wore down the pacesetter from outside late. CORY GAL bumped lightly with the eventual winner at the start, sprinted to the
lead inside, was clear through mid stretch, could not stave off the top one on the wrong lead, and saved the place. MOON EYES raced four wide around the
turn, and rallied mildly. NO SE VENDE broke a couple lengths slow, advanced a bit around the turn three wide, and gained to the finish on the far outside.
BROADWAY PEGGY cut the corner advancing off the turn, but flattened out past the eighth-pole. ZIP IT JESS raced between horses in the second flight to
the stretch, and was no menace. ALPILLES pressed the early pace outside CORY GAL, and faded in the three-path into the stretch. CHIC AND SEXY gave
chase three wide into the turn, and weakened after three-eighths of a mile.

Footnotes
FINDING FAME bumped with EMMA ROSE at the start, hustled along behind the leading foursome into the turn, swung out four wide approaching the
stretch, reached the front and drew clear through the furlong grounds, and had enough to preserve the decision. PRIMACY was a bit edgy in the gate,
lagged well back for the first half-mile, angled to the far outside coming off the turn, uncorked a solid rally and was gradually getting to the winner late.
TESTIMONIAL bumped with GOLDEN STAR LADY at the start, shifted out lodging a bid outside FINDING FAME at the top of the stretch, and needed more
through the late stages. ASSUME contested the pace between horses three wide, gained command near the quarter-pole, but faded through the drive.
EMMA ROSE bumped with FINDING FAME at the start, angled four wide rallying through some traffic between horses in upper stretch, and flattened out.
KISS THEORY was edgy in the gate prior to the start, bumped with DISTINCTLY SASSY coming out, trailed far back for a half, and passed tired horses. A
LOOKER saved ground to no avail. LIAM'S LOOKOUT dueled for the lead inside a trio of opponents, and gave way soon after going after a half. GOLDEN
STAR LADY bumped with TESTIMONIAL at the start, pressed the pace outside rivals four wide for a half, and steadily gave way. MISS T TOO battled up
front between horses in the two-path, and began dropping back with a quarter-mile remaining. MIXTECA broke slowly and was never prominent.
DISTINCTLY SASSY bumped with KISS THEORY at the start, and was finished early three wide.

FLORA FANTASY advanced to contention late on the turn, shifted to the five-path rallying through mid stretch, neglected to change leads but wore down
SHES ALL WOMAN from outside to win going away. SHES ALL WOMAN was never far back, bid three wide after a half-mile, reached the front outside R
NEXT ROLL through mid stretch, drifted out and could not withstand the winner. ARCELOR loomed on the rail behind the leaders awaiting room at the top
of the lane, found clearance in the two-path coming past the furlong marker and finished willingly. SKY CHASER moved up outside the leaders four wide a
quarter-mile from home, but flattened out in upper stretch. R NEXT ROLL sped clear early inside, and gave way after five furlongs. TIZ POSSIBLE DEAR
raced two to three wide to the stretch and was not a factor. FOGGY FLIGHT prompted the early pace outside R NEXT ROLL under a firm hold, and was
empty before reaching the stretch.

forward under right handed pressure, finished determinedly and got up late. ZABAVA saved ground on the first turn, stayed inside and tracked the top two
leaders down the backstretch, began to edge up closer late far turn then given cue top of the lane, advanced to duel for late lead with WHISPERING
BEAUTY then got outkicked deep stretch. WHISPERING BEAUTY bumped with foe at the start then stalked the top two leaders through early stages, raced
three wide in aim for the lead at the quarter pole, took command upper stretch but quickly came under attack from ZABAVA, fought back briefly then lacked
the closing kick to move on. DYNA PASSER raced between foes around the first turn, continued to settle off the early pace, launched a bid near the quarter
pole, raced six wide into the lane, stayed on with interest but needed more for late impact. I AM MAGICAL (GB) held a slim lead around the first turn, raced
along the rail and set a pressured early pace, vied for the lead with EQUAL MEASURE around the final turn then got collared top stretch and gave way.
EQUAL MEASURE was forwardly placed in opening stages then applied pace pressure to I AM MAGICAL down the backstretch, vied for the lead around
the turn then tired in the drive. HUNTING SEASON took a solid bump between foes at the start, moved up three wide around the first turn, remained in

Footnotes
LA FLAMENCA broke alertly and gained command, rated along removed from the rail, edged away around the turn, settled into the stretch well in control,
shortened stride switching back to her left lead late and held on. BOSS WIFE was crowded a bit after the start at the back, swung wide rallying off the turn,
and was getting to the winner in the closing stages. SIGNING BONUS made her way inside up the backstretch, had aim turning for home but lacked a
serious bid on the rail. STAMINA PRINCESS was outrun early, came five wide into the stretch and improved mildly on the far outside. DIXIELAND DREAM
broke out bumping and pushing out WICKET HOPE, pressed the pace four wide, and weakened after six furlongs. MUSIC CITY WOLF was crowded after
the start, settled in the middle of the pack two wide, and made no impact. AWESOME EVIL pressed the pace outside LA FLAMENCA to the turn, and began
to fade approaching the stretch. FLAT OUT COOL was outrun throughout. LET'S GO LUNA was pushed out at the start, raced four wide, and tired before
reaching the stretch. ZANGARVA was floated out at the start, chased after the leaders four wide to the turn, and faded steadily. WICKET HOPE was
bumped and pushed out by DIXIELAND DREAM at the start, and dropped far back leaving the turn.
