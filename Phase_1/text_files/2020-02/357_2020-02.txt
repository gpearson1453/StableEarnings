Footnotes

stretch coming on belatedly on the rail for place. LADY DAVID tracked the pace hustling inside on the turn bidding in the three path down the lane hanging
late. IVORY NOT WHITE raced evenly to upper stretch gaining then holding position there. EOWYN'S PARADISE slow early was no menace passing tired
ones to improve. BLESSINGSOFLIBERTY chased to upper stretch fading late. DEEPLY DEVOTED raced mid pack tiring to upper stretch.
GONEWITHTHEBREEZE pressed the early pace giving way to upper stretch. CINDY B faded on the turn. WHAT'S THE LINE was never involved. GET
NAUTI folded up on the turn. ORIENTAL TALE was always outrun.
