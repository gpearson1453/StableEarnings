win. BRAVE CINDERELLA was void of any early speed, circled six wide into the second turn, made a bid in early stretch on the winner, dueled to late
stretch and finished a clear second best. DYNASTY OF HER OWN pressed the early pace, took a lead into the home turn, met the bid of the winner,

BLAZING NAVARONE set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, opened up into the home turn, drifted out and edged clear for the win. RIG TIME lost footing
at the start, was void of any early speed, circled seven wide through the second turn, drifted in through the stretch and finished second best. GO FOR A
STROLL was unhurried early, made a middle move into the final turn, angled out in early stretch and flattened out in the drive. THUNDER DOME tracked
the early pace, went five wide into the turn and was empty late. STREAKS BRO followed the early pace, raced between rivals, drifted in and faded. YANO'S
WAY was reserved off the pace, raced six wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. SHINING SOURCE was allowed to settle early, went three
wide into the second turn and gave way.

Footnotes
SIR RICK was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with TOP DRAW, vied with that rival through the opening six furlongs, drifted out slightly
entering the stretch, opened a clear margin and drew off with complete authority. TOP DRAW was off a step slow then rushed to vie with the winner, raced
along the inside throughout, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished with good courage to be clearly second best. STACKIN SILVER was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but failed to gain on the top pair late. TAPPIN
FORA DANCE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gradually gave way. JUNGLE RUNNER showed no early speed,
raced three-wide through the second turn and dropped far back into the stretch.

EFFORT N RESULTS raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths pole, drifted in
slightly and held EVACUEE safe to the wire. EVACUEE was off slow then allowed to settle, advanced four-wide through the second turn, angled out into the
stretch drifted inward through the lane and finished with good courage. CERVEZA disputed the pace with SHAME ON POWERS while racing from off the
rail, checked nearing the half, dropped back, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths marker, reached a striking position but failed to gain late. WEST DAWN
settled off the leaders from the inside, moved up to engage nearing the three-eighths pole, vied and gave way after going three-quarters. SHAME ON
POWERS was away in good order to duel for the lead with CERVEZA while racing three-wide, responded when challenged by WEST DAWN nearing the
three-eighths marker and gave way into the stretch. ANCIENT LAND was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pacesetters from the inside, angled out
nearing quarter, angled in with a furlong to run and lacked racing room late. GO NOW GO was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn
and was not a factor. ON A WARPATH was bumped soon after the start, showed brief speed and weakened. MORE ACTION was checked nearing the
thirteen-sixteenths pole, lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not reach contention. PARTY KING broke sharply to chase the
leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.
