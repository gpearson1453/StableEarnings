NO raced within striking distance, moved up between rivals around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. TIZ A
SECRET raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and proved third best. GET IT TO GEAUX unhurried in the beginning, made a mild bid, but
was no factor, while finishing wide. SIMBA'S PRIDE void of early speed and was never a threat. FAMILIAR RHYTHM raced evenly near the back and was
outrun. MADDY'S PRO went to the front, drove clear and was finished early. RAISE EM UP raced near the middle of the field in the early part and retreated
to the rear.

with SHANGROYAL in the early part, proved no match late for STRONG SIDE, but held on for second. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY raced near the back in
the early part, made a late bid and finished willingly. SHANGROYAL challenged for the early lead, saved ground and lacked a late kick. GIANT MESA broke
a step slow, moved up, but was no factor. HAYNESVILLE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground the turn, weakened and finished evenly. D'TUFF

Footnotes
LAST DESTINY went to the front, drove clear, lost the advantage at the head of the stretch, but came back and proved the best. MISS MANASSAS raced in
the middle of the field, made a late bid, finished willingly and was a clear second. SALT LIFE ANGEL vied for the early advantage, took command and
weakened before the wire. HOLY SONG lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, moved up and finished evenly. ROYAL SASS dueled for
the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. BOSTON BABY broke out, racing near the back, came around the first turn wide, moved
up, but was no factor. LADY KING raced in the back of the pack in the beginning and passed tired ones. SMOOTH RAPIDS raced within contention, came
around the first turn wide and faded. RED REBEL STAR lacked early speed, raced wide around the first turn and was never close. OURS TO HOLD was an
early factor, dropped back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
SUCCESSFUL RYKER dueled for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout and proved the best late. MAN CAMP pressed the pace, raced inside
around the turn, steadied, blocked, angled out at the head of the stretch, rallied and was getting to leaders. ALLURING ACTOR vied for the early lead, raced
close throughout and was outfinished by the top two. HUFFS TAZ A BOO lacked early speed, raced outside around the turn and made a steady wide gain.
BAYOU BODE lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, improved position, but was no factor. FUELINJECTEDPRAYER raced in the middle of the
field in the beginning, made a bid and weakened. SONG N A CAT checked start, getting in tight quarters and was never a threat. CHARLIES TICKET raced
evenly near the back and was never a factor. D'DAWSON raced within striking distance and dropped back. DISCREETLY D challenged for the early lead
and stopped.

Footnotes
SHREW GRIT went to the front, drove clear, pulled away and proved much the best. MISS MABELEE raced within striking distance, made a late bid, proved
no match for the winner, but got up for second. BANKERS HONOUR pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second.
DIAMOND FOR CRIDER was an early factor, raced close throughout and lacked a late kick. TEN TAP DANCES stumbled at the start, ducked in, had a
wide trip, moved up, but was no factor. SMOOTHOUTTHETRACK lacked early speed and was never a threat. OUR LADY'S PRAYER raced in the middle
of the field in the early going and faded. OH MY GOSH BECKY void of early speed and was outrun.

NINEONEONEPRAYER sprinted to the front, opened up on the field, was all out and just held on for the win. GOLDEN SMILES raced in the middle of the
field, made a late inside bid and needed more ground. ROSE CROWN raced within striking distance, made a wide and was outfinished by the top two.
AWISHFORGREELEY pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout and hung late. DREAMING OF CURLIN broke out, pressed the pace and
weakened. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH lacked early speed, moved up and finished evenly. SHA U CUTE bothered and shut off at the break and was never a
threat. BOSSY'S TROUBLE bothered and shuffled back at the start and was never close. ENOUGH HEART broke in, raced near the middle of the pack in
the early part and faded.

Footnotes
AROUND THE DIAL challenged for the early lead, drove clear and won under steady urging. ALPHA TO OMEGA went to the front, saved ground around
the final turn, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. MISTAKE PRESENT raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn
and proved no match for the top two. MILTONTOWN raced in the middle of the field, drifted out around the first turn, made a mild bid and was outfinished
for third. NOMO RON raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. PLEASANT D'ORO lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor.
GRACIDA raced in the back of the pack and was never a threat. PLOT TWIST always raced near the back and was outrun. MOST MISCHIEF had an
awkward start, pressed the early pace and was finished early.
