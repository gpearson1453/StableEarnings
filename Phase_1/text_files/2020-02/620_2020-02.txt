DUSTY MILLER perfect position to the turn, went to leader in hand and drew off as much the best. IMAJIMMYCREED slow into stride at the start, advanced
steadily wide for the place spot while no match. RUN LIKE REV avoided trouble start, sprinted to lead, collard stretch game third. ANALYZE THIS CAT
raced back to turn, asked quarter pole wide with no late gain. TARNISH bounced around at the start, rushed outside to quarter pole, fade. TALK GAME no
speed throughout, floated widest into stretch to pass a few. THE ASH FACTOR brief foot, with no response from the turn. RED JERSEY stayed close while
chasing to quarter pole, came up empty, faded. BOOMERANG BABY brief foot inside to turn, gave way readily thereafter. KITTY ZIP between horses early,
went wrong and dropped back to a gallop past the wire. EASTER WEEKEND troubled early on with KITTY ZIP and dropped back suddenly.

for place. SOCIAL CIRCLE close to the pace to turn, short lead into stretch, missed place. AIKEN FOR GOLD raced evenly just off rail, rallied to just miss
show late. SHE'S ALOTTA WOMAN in tight early on, far back to the half, improved position gamely. E Z BONUS steadied and bothered at the start,
improved position thereafter. LADY VOODOO chased leader to quarter pole, emptied out, dropped back. MISS HOLIDAY (ARG) never a factor. B DEB'S
