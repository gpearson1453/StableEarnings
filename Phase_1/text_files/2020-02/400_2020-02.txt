Footnotes
MEGAMEISTER was on the pace from the outset, drifted out a few paths at the five eighths, was taken back in and dueled two wide to the stretch then
responded when set down and drove clear to the line. KONA SKYE hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the second turn, responded to stay with the
winner to mid stretch then was outfinished but saved the place. PRAISE LOUDLY had no speed, shifted off the rail on the second turn but could not make
an impact on the winner and just missed second. ENOS SLAUGHTER had no speed, settled to the second turn, made a bid two then three wide to the
stretch but got outkicked to mid stretch and weakened. AWAY HE GOES was chasing to the second turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch then came up
empty in the drive. TRIBAL IMPACT also chased the pace for a half mile, stopped on the second turn then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
ARDENLEE STAR had the best speed, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded when set down and held driving. DIRT ROAD RED was
outrun to the half, raced two wide into the second turn, swung out four wide into the stretch and closed steadily for second. DEEPINGREEN tracked the
pace to the second turn, came two wide to the stretch then responded in the drive but was outfinished for second. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE settled mid pack
to the half, saved ground to the stretch then finished evenly in the final furlong. TIZ EMMA trailed to the second turn, raced two wide to the stretch and
closed some ground belatedly. CREATIVE BULL tracked the pace to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then did not have a late response.
PIVO pressed the winner for six furlongs then gave way. MR. VITAMIN was crowded early, checked into the first turn then had no speed and was not a
factor.

TIZ FAKE NEWS set the pace in hand to the second turn, responded when roused for the drive, switched to a left lead a sixteenth out but remained clear.
MIDNIGHT SUNRISE pressed the winner throughout, could not impact that one but was second best. MOLLIE O ' MCEVOY broke a bit slow, trailed to the
second turn, came four wide to the stretch but was never a serious threat. SHANGHAI KEELY chased the winner to the second turn, was fanned four wide
to the stretch then did not rally. AUGURE had no speed and saved ground to no avail.

DESIRE stalked the pace from the rail to the stretch, checked off of TOMLIN'S heels in mid stretch then resumed her rally and just missed the win while
getting the nod for second. VRONILLA PARFAIT was outrun to the turn, raced three wide to the stretch then shifted out in upper stretch, rallied when clear
and closed steadily to the line. TOMLIN pressed the winner two wide to the stretch, loomed a threat to mid stretch but was outkicked in the late stages.
MOTHER OF DRAGONS also was stalking the winner to the turn, got fanned four wide to the stretch but was outrun to mid stretch and finished evenly.
SPRING HEAT had no speed, raced two then three wide on the turn, shifted out in the drive and closed a gap without threatening.

SHERILINDA was under urging to press the pace, raced two then three wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and pushed to the front driving. ZAKAR
pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, disposed of DESERT FOG in upper stretch then could not stall the winner while saving second. TROUBLE N
PARADISE tracked the pace to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but battled late to get the nod for the show.
MIME settled mid pack to the turn, was two then three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch but was showing some late interest. DOGGY
DREAMS was outsprinted to the turn, raced three then four wide to the stretch but failed to rally in the drive. FOGGY BOTTOM had no speed and was not a
factor. MOON OVER MAG BAY got outsprinted and saved ground to no avail. ANGELS HOLIDAY was always outrun. DESERT FOG was reluctant to load
then hustled to the front, set the pace to the quarter pole but tired and stopped in the final furlong.
