Footnotes
DESERT DANGER tracked the early pace, went four wide into the turn, took control at the eight pole and edged clear for the win. RECORDER was allowed
to settle early, went six wide into the turn, was no match late and finished second best. RIO CUTIE was outrun early, circled seven wide through the turn
and offered a mild late rally. EMPEROR'S CHOICE stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn and finished evenly late. BLACK EYED
BANDIT set a pressured early pace, raced off the rail into the turn and weakened. AUSTIN'S ACE was unhurried early, raced between rivals into the turn
and offered no late rally. ICED was taken back early, went five wide into the turn and never fired. FIELD GENERAL was void of any early speed and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
MCFANCY was reserved just off the leaders early, advanced five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew off. REBEL
RYETTE was never far back while racing from off the rail, moved up to engage nearing the quarter, gained a brief lead but could not match strides with the
winner late. NAVARONES SPARKLE settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished
willingly. LEIGH WHO was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, opened a clear lead nearing the seven-sixteenths pole,
drifted out approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. SELL BABY SELL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. THREE
CHIPS lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. HOLE IN ONE was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn
and did not menace. SASSY QUEENIE was off slow, lagged early, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. DEHERES SAINT showed brief
speed and weakened.
