Footnotes
KICKIN KIMBERLY good speed to the front, set all pace and stayed well clear as much the best while well handled. SWEET ROCK squeezed at the start,
trailed early, rallied for place outside while no match for the winner. MY LADY DOWRY unhurried from outside steady advance for the show spot. MY AUNT
TILLIE void of speed to far turn, improved position while no real threat. I GOT IT raced evenly with no late response when needed. FASHION ENVY chased
winner throughout to no avail, faded in the stretch. HERO OF THE BEST never a real threat. AIR TURBULENCE well placed for three quarters, came up
empty from there. EMMY SHIMMY failed to menace.
