Footnotes
FRENCH GETAWAY bobbled at the start as the ground broke out behind, angled in and saved ground, steadied briefly in a bit tight leaving the first turn,
continued inside, came out into the stretch and again in upper stretch and rallied under some urging with the whip turned down and energetic handling to
gain the lead while drifting in some in deep stretch and was under a hold in the final strides. START A RUNNIN stumbled at the start, had speed between
foes then angled in, tugged some and dueled inside, regained the advantage in the stretch, fought back, drifted out a bit from the whip past midstretch and
held second between foes late. IMPLICITLY pulled some and dueled outside the runner-up, fought back in the stretch then between foes in deep stretch
and held third between rivals. TOUGH IT OUT pulled and chased outside a rival and was in a bit tight leaving the first turn, went three deep into and out of
the second turn and was edged for the show four wide on the line. TEQUILA JOE tugged along the inside stalking the pace, came out a bit into the stretch
then angled inward in deep stretch and finished with interest inside. SWAMP SOUFFLE chased outside a rival then between horses on the second turn and
into the stretch, was between foes through much of the drive and in tight late. BUSTER DOUGLAS (BRZ) came a bit off the rail on the first turn, chased
outside a rival on the backstretch and three deep into the second turn, bid three wide leaving that turn and into the stretch, also was in tight in deep stretch
while weakening late.

along the inside then stalked a bit off the rail leaving the first turn, bid alongside the pacesetter leaving the backstretch, put a head in front on the second

PRINCEOFTHENORTH broke slowly, settled off the rail, came three deep into the stretch, bid three wide in midstretch, while lugging in from the whip,
battled outside the runner-up in deep stretch while drifting in some and gamely prevailed under left handed urging. LEATHERNECK had speed inside then
stalked just off the rail, angled in on the backstretch, came out on the turn, bid three wide leaving the turn, to gain the lead into the stretch, battled outside a
rival in upper stretch and between foes in midstretch, also drifted in late and continued willlingly. PAPA TONY between horses early, angled in and set the
pace inside, fought back along the rail in the stretch, was not a match for the top pair in the final sixteenth but saved the show. BAD BEAT had speed three
deep then stalked off the rail, continued a bit off the rail on the turn, bid between foes past the quarter pole and into the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong.

SKY JUMPER stalked outside a rival, bid alongside the pacesetter leaving the turn to take the lead into the stretch, battled outside that one in midstretch
then between horses in deep stretch and gamely prevailed under left handed urging. ME MACHO saved ground stalking the pace, came out into the stretch
and again in upper stretch, bid three wide in deep stretch and continued willingly outside the winner to the wire. TAILBACK sped to the early lead, set the
pace off the rail then angled in, fought back inside the winner leaving the turn and a bit off the rail in the stretch and held third. TYRANNICAL REX stalked
outside a rival on the backstretch and turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. STREET DEMAND chased outside, came four
wide into the stretch and could not offer the necessary response. CAPE POINT bobbled at the start, saved ground chasing the pace, continued inside on the
turn and in the stretch and did not rally.
