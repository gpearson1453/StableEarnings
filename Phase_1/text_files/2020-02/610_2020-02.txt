Footnotes
BOOTYTAMA veered in at the gap, set the pace, bore out on the turn and drew off in the drive to win handily. STREET FLYER challenged two across on
the turn, was carried out, angled back in, leveled off and was no match for the winner. COLLECTING STARS raced outside, went nine wide at the top of the
stretch, offered a mild bid only and got up for show. TOTALLY NORMAL trailed the field and improved position in a steady effort. XYLINA'S ART raced
inside, showed speed to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. VERY BOISTEROUS saved ground, bid along the rail on the turn, had nothing
left and gave way.

three across on the turn, fell back, went five wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and didn't have enough late. MONTANA JACK saved ground, bid inside
on the turn and failed to rally despite steady urging. ITS ALL ON SLEW raced close to the pace, weent seven wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid.
THE FIDDLERS GREEN veered in at the start, raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. KINSALE WARRIOR stumbled and was impeded at
the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. EVA'S ROCK set the pace to the turn and stopped. CHICOTE refused. The stewards' posted in inquiry
concerning the start. No change was made.
