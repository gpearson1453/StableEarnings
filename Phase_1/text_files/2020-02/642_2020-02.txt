POPCORN FOR EDDIE pressed the pace from the outside, raced two wide in the drive and got up under strong pressure. LOVETHATCAUSE showed
good speed along the inside and finished second best. TEXAS TROUBADOR stalked the pace, raced three deep and had no final winning bid. ROCK
RIVER was off slowly, raced along the inside and never was a factor. WILDINTHECITY settled off the early pace, drifted on the turns, lost his irons at the
three eighths pole and never was a serious threat. LUCK CHECK dropped back early and failed to have a response. Due to a timer malfunction the
five-eighths fraction was unavailable.

LOVE AT NIGHT came in a bit at the break, vied for the early lead and prevailed under all out pressure. WANDERNINTHEFOREST came in at the break,
dueled for the early lead and weakened a bit late to be second best. Wanderintheforest was disqualified for interference for coming down soon after break
and placed fourth. EXTREME CAUTION raced in tight at the break, raced four wide in the lane and closed in on the latter stages. HONEY HEARTS took up
at the start, raced along the inside and never was a factor. INDY N ROSES dropped back early, raced three deep and never was a factor. A BUNCH FOR
LUNCH took up at the break, saved ground and never was a factor. CALIFORNIASUMMER failed to respond.
