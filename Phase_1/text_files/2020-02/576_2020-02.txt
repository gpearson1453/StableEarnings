APPEALING JULIA good break to set all pace well handled, held to wire in a game effort. PAIGE'S STAR inside to turn, angled out rallied late for place,
coming on. MY AUNT TILLIE never far back to the stretch, rallied up inside cutting gap. SHAMELESSFI no speed to the stretch, outside run in the stretch
late. PROM THEME steadily faded. BARONET unhurried to the turn, improved position inside, no threat. PERSONAL CAT pushed the winner to the quarter
pole, gave way in the stretch. DA MRS. through early, dropped back. WILLIN' GRACE never a factor.

the stretch, came in and bumped VALYCOVE near the sixteenth pole and did not have enough for place in the final stages. VALYCOVE chased the pace
early, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch, was bumped by ALL HANDS ON DECK near the sixteenth pole then was checked hard
