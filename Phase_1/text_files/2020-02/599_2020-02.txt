Footnotes
MEET ME HALF WAY stalked the pace edging closer to loom in upper stretch surging late between horses to prevail. MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE sent clear set
the pace opening a clear margin on the backside, felt pressure leaving the far turn digging in near the rail ceding grudgingly late. LORAN HOLIDAY (ARG)
gained on the backside bidding three deep in upper stretch wavering late in the four path. NATIVE WAHOO raced evenly coming five wide into upper stretch
lacking late response. MONSOON RAIN failed to respond. SWEETALKINGJUSTICE slipped leaving the gate, was always outrun. GENTLE KISS folded up
early.

Footnotes
PEGGY'S COVE well placed sat patient off modest splits pressing in bid on the far turn dueling abreast foe down the lane extending clear late. BEAUTIFUL
CREATURE prompted the early pace measuring a short edge to the far turn, engaged there dueled inside of foe down the lane ceding grudgingly at the
end. AILIS laid close up chasing on the far turn, extended in the three path upper stretch would angle out ending up in the six path giving an even finish.
DIAMOND DARLIN raced mid pack giving chase to upper stretch , was carried out to the seven path in mid stretch by an angling AILIS weakening the final
sixteenth. MOONRAGS gave a prompted middle move pressing on the far turn before flattening out in upper stretch. PEEPER played no factor.
SCHLEPROCK TOWN was never involved. KINZUA raced mid pack early then gave way on the far turn.

Footnotes
ESKENDULCE settled off the pace early gave a quick move to threaten on the far turn drawing even abreast foe in upper stretch edging clear in the final
yards. DRENA'S BULLET sent clear set the pace on soft splits saving ground to upper stretch dueling on the inside there holding well while ceding late.
DOUBLE THE LAUGH broke slowly, raced mid pack to the far turn rallying in the three path to upper stretch angling out a bit late while holding spot.
LEVANTO (ARG) slow early gained on the outside on the far turn losing ground to upper stretch hanging there in the six path. GONE TOO SOON slow early
lagged to upper stretch gaining belatedly in the six path. LET'SCALLITEVEN played no factor. ROLLIN WAY OVER tracked the early pace then gave way
on the far turn. SHAKURR stalked the pace giving chase on the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. FUNNEL CAKE stalked for half a mile then wilted on
the far turn.
