Footnotes
CURRENCY CHROME was urged inside the pacesetter prompting that rival racing into the turn, took over leaving the midway point of the bend, then held
safe the challenge of YEI YEI through the lane to prove best under firm hand urging. The latter tracked the leaders outside a rival from just out of striking
distance, advanced three wide on the turn to challenge the pacesetter in upper stretch but proved only second best. LEAVING HOME, slow into stride,
angled four wide racing into the lane and displayed some late interest to prevail for a share. ELVIS COLE tracked off the first flight inside a rival racing into
the turn and came up empty nearing the lane. ARCHIVERO dropped off the second flight in early stages and offered no rally. TAXMAN was hustled forcing
the pace outside the eventual winner on a narrow advantage racing into the turn but gave way early.

GIANT TRICK stalked just off the first flight along the rail under light reserve in the opening half, was prompted to bid for command inside rivals racing into
upper stretch, gained the advantage entering the lane and maintained a narrow advantage to the end under hand urging to prevail. HEBGONE tracked off
the first flight four wide in the opening stages, steadily gained terms with the first flight between foes in that path racing into the turn, bid for command
nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to the end while just outkicked. BROWNS GAP joined the pace outside a rival prompting the issue through the
backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into upper stretch and continued willingly while just failing to contain the top pair. YOUNG AMERICAN tracked
off the second flight between foes, shifted out six wide entering the lane and improved position. THE WAYNE FACTOR tracked off the second flight outside
foes through the backstretch, raced five wide into the turn making some brief progress but had no closing bid. DEVASTATING MOVE tracked off the first
flight between foes racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. NOMINAL DOLLARS tracked off the second flight near the inside to the turn and
came up empty nearing the lane. CALL ME HANDSOME urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing a bit off the rail, dueled between foes into the turn,
gave way into upper stretch and was gathered up in the closing stages.

Footnotes
TABLED tracked off the second flight outside a rival in the opening half, advanced on the pacesetter in tandem with several rivals racing four wide into the
far turn, wrested the advantage nearing upper stretch and drove clear. HARD N'SWEET, very reluctant to load, settled outside foes to the backstretch,
swung out four wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, lugged in racing into upper stretch but continued well enough to prove best of the
others. VALUABLE PILLOW tracked just off the second flight near the inside, shifted out to bid three wide between foes in tandem with the eventual winner
midway through the far turn but flattened out. FLORIDA EXPRESS settled last along the inside, switched outside foes on the backstretch, was fanned five
wide into the lane but continued to improve position. POZNAN tracked off the second flight near the inside, switched out nearing the far turn while making
brief progress but proved empty in the drive. ANDREZ CONQUIST settled along the inside and never gained contention. ROGUE RAGE tracked off the
second flight inside a rival to the far turn and came up empty. DON H sprinted clear of the field, was getting out racing into the backstretch and gave way
midway through the far turn. BUMPA tracked the leader as part of the second flight, was urged to make a brief bid between foes entering the far turn but
steadily faded between foes into the stretch. LASTFORTINOFAMILY dropped out early.

Footnotes
DYNAMITE KARMA tracked the leaders between foes as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the leaders three
deep racing into the far turn, was fanned four wide leaving midstretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail under firm handling.
MAMAIGOTTHIS, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance while angling to the rail entering the far turn,
advanced inside the leaders to bid for command leaving midstretch but was outkicked. ONE MORE DRINK tracked off the first flight along the inside racing
to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch while being prompted to terms with the pacesetter in the three path after a half, pressed the issue
outside that foe to upper stretch and faltered late. WICKED WEDNESDAY, caught five wide racing to the backstretch, continued four wide through the far
turn to upper stretch and gained some position. JUST SHOOT ALREADY, urged to the lead from between foes racing a bit off the rail into the backstretch,
dueled for command inside a rival into the far turn and gave way near midstretch. GALAXY INVASION, caught four wide between foes while going a bit
erratically through the first turn, offered no rally. NO LOOK BACK, urged to gain a forward placing along the rail racing into the first turn, emptied out after a
half. COOL RIVER DS swerved out at the break bumping SALLY'S SALUTE, was settled and never gained contention. SALLY'S SALUTE broke slowly,
then was bumped at the start and never menaced thereafter. COOLISTHERULE urged in pursuit of the pacesetter three wide into the first turn, shifted in
entering the backstretch and gave way early.

Footnotes
NATIVE LION, forwardly placed stalking the pacesetter under light reserve racing to the far turn, took over entering upper stretch and went clear under firm
encouragement. STORMY D tracked off the second flight under light reserve in the opening half, angled out six wide in upper stretch and continued with a
steady effort to gain the place honors. COLONELS DAUGHTER tracked off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, shifted out racing into the
far turn, shifted out five wide to bid between rivals in upper stretch and was just outkicked for second. SUNDRENCHED tracked the leaders between foes in
second flight, angled in racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, switched outside a tiring foe to bid between foes just off the inside but
lacked the needed final kick. MOONLIGHT RAIN tracked the leaders three deep between foes in second flight, was prompted to make brief progress
between foes racing through the far turn but flattened out midstretch. TOUCHET tracked the leaders four wide in second flight to the first turn, was prompted
to make brief progress outside foes on the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. BETTER YET tracked the leaders as part of the second flight while
angling to the inside early but emptied out racing into the far turn. CHA CHA HEELS, bumped, then held up out of tight quarters just after the start, settled
outside foes, raced four wide into the far turn and had no rally. LUNA settled along the inside early and never gained contention. CALLIE CALIFORNIA sped
to the fore along the rail, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, then gave out nearing midstretch after being headed by the winner.

CANDY FOR ALL tracked off the second flight dropping out of striking distance racing through the backstretch, split foes entering the far turn commencing
her advance, rallied smartly three deep nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage entering the lane, went well clear under pressure and was taken in
hand nearing the wire once the issue was decided. KOA KANI settled outside foes in the opening half, steadily gained position four wide through the turn to
upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. EARTHA, forwardly placed prompting the pacesetter racing to the
turn, couldn't match the winner's bid and was just collared for second. I AM A. LURING was briskly roused in the opening stages pursuing the leaders four
wide between foes to the turn and gave way. MIGHTY FROSTY settled outside foes in early stages and improved position racing five wide into the stretch.
LEMON WATER, urged along inside foes pursuing the leaders through the backstretch, emptied out early. TIME SHIFT, restless in the gate, broke slowly
and never gained contention. AMERICA'S QUEEN, urged to the lead along the rail in the opening half, gave way into the stretch. FREIGHT TRAIN LANE
broke awkwardly and never menaced thereafter. TESSIE'S RED SOX broke through the gate before the start, flashed brief pace between foes but emptied
out entering the turn. INCA PRINCESS was a brief factor five wide while being prompted to contend in second flight but emptied out early. AWESOME
DREAM trailed throughout.

HOPE AGAIN (GB) was firmly rated along the inside just off the second flight racing to the first turn, switched outside foes midway through the backstretch
to track the leaders three deep racing into the far turn, was prompted to advance in that path to bid for command between foes racing into upper stretch and
narrowly prevailed on the wire under firm left handed encouragement. BOURBON EXTENSION angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter between foes
into the backstretch, continued under light rating through the backstretch, was urged to split foes just off the inside to challenge for command in upper
stretch and grudgingly contested the issue to the end to just miss. ONAROCK, reserved off the second flight along the inside in the opening stages, swung
out four wide on the far turn and continued willingly in that path to the end to challenge for command late. FAST FIRE settled last along the inside racing to
the backstretch, angled out five wide in upper stretch and made solid progress with a belated effort. PROQUESTOR, off a step slow, settled outside foes in
the last flight and improved position racing six wide in the closing stages. SMALL HOPE tracked off the second flight between foes, shifted out racing into
the lane but had no rally. QUALITY STEP, off a step slowly, gained a position three deep in second flight racing to the first turn, steadily moved to terms with
the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue through the far turn and emptied out between foes nearing midstretch. PADDY O'DINI
pulled his way to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn, briefly resisted a rival's challenge but gave way
racing into the lane. DOMAIN angled to the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, was steadied in close quarters entering the backstretch, was prompted to
advance along the rail nearing upper stretch, steadied again out of tight quarters midstretch and quickly came up empty.

Footnotes
AUNT BETTY tracked the leaders from out of striking distance racing four wide through the backstretch, angled inwards nearing the lane steadily gaining
position between foes, shifted to the rail nearing midstretch to strike the front and prevailed under sustained right handed encouragement.
SHARPERTHANME, forwardly placed outside foes in the first flight in the opening stages, was eased off the pace racing through the backstretch, steadily
advanced on the leaders three deep racing through the turn, bid for command in that path near midstretch and was just outkicked. OURHANDSOMEGAL
settled between foes tracking well off the second flight early, shifted out four wide nearing the lane and continued with interest to improve position. SWEET
GELATO, urged to terms forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset, pressed the issue through the turn to gain a brief advantage in upper stretch but
gave way once headed by the top pair. A TOAST TO KAY settled between foes in early stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn to make some brief
progress but had no closing bid. PASS IT ON tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn and faded after a half. MISS LOTUS FLOWER,
held up avoiding close quarters just after the start, never gained contention. FEBRUARYSEXCLUSIVE was urged to dispute the pace a bit off the rail from
the outset, dueled for command into the turn and gave way into the stretch. SKY RUN broke in the air while ducking outwards at the start, was righted to
make brief pursuit between foes in second flight but came up empty entering the turn. QUEENS WORLD proved no factor.

Footnotes
PURE LUCK threw his head at the start while breaking a step slowly, settled out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance on
the far turn while shifting out four wide nearing upper stretch, then continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and maintain a safe margin
to the end under firm handling. JACK THE CAT, reserved near the inside racing to the first turn, switched out entering the backstretch, was prompted to
advance outside foes on the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap. HONEY DONT, restless in the gate, broke
readily to gain a forward placing, stalked the pacesetter under firm restraint into the backstretch, was prompted to wrest the advantage leaving the far turn,
resisted the winner's challenge but weakened late. FADE AWAY settled in hand outside a rival racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper
stretch and found his best stride late to gain position to the end. FALSE INFO tracked the pacesetter along the rail as part of the second flight, shifted out
three deep nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid but flattened late. PARADISE ISLAND tracked just off the second flight along the inside racing to the
backstretch, shifted out racing into the lane while being urged to advance but had no late bid. AMERICA'S SIMMARD, held up out of tight quarters at the
start, settled along the inside and proved no threat. MR STARK tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch and faded early.
LOCANO sprinted clear of the field while angling to the rail, held sway to the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.
