Footnotes
SONNY SMACK behind the pace inside, continued behind some traffic through the second turn in the two path, split foes turning for home, drove clear.
GANGLY within striking distance toward the inside early, ranged up three wide to challenge in the second turn, vied into the lane outside the winner, proved
no match for that one late, clearly second best. HARD TO PARK in the second group while racing off the inside, moved with the runner up toward the fore
midway on the final bend, flattened out in the drive, saved the show. ALEX'S STRIKE last away, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals,
slowly gaining for the show late. CHANNEL CROSSING away in good order, alternated up front in the two path, faltered in the drive. MUTINEER dueled up
front along the inside, gave way in the second turn, continued to weaken through the stretch.

Footnotes
CINNAFRIJOLE away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, well clear past the furlong marker,
enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MILLIE'S AN ANGEL back off the the early pace after breaking with the field, steadied slightly behind a foe into
the turn, moved out, came five wide out of the turn when rallying, slowly getting to the winner late. DENA'S BOLD MOVE fell back after the start, raced off
the inside, staged a mild rally in the three path, no match top two. WILD DEZ went one paced while racing just off the inside. BONITA'S GOLD off slowly,
saved ground, improved slightly while not a serious threat. SCIOTO'S SHOES dueled up front off the inside, gave way. through the stretch.
CLOUDYWITHACHANCE broke back, moved up a bit and settled off the two leaders, had little left for the drive. RIVER GODDESS tired while racing three
wide. HAMAZING MARNIE finished early, far back. SHADYNGRAY stumbled badly at the start and unseated rider.

stretch, drove well clear. FRONT DOOR chased the leader just off the inside, moved closer in the two path late in the second turn, proved no match for the
winner in the drive clearly second best. TAPITOR off step slow, trailed much of the way, came four wide when staging a mild rally into the stretch, finished
up best of the rest. ADULATOR sprinted clear to set the pace, faltered when headed. GOOD GOOD lacked early foot, improved three wide into the stretch,
flattened out in the final furlong to lose some position. HERE'S CARLOS went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. DYNAMITE DAN within
striking distance, gave way in the drive. HOLD ON ANGEL had nothing for the stretch.

Footnotes
COUNTRY DREAM forwardly placed early toward the inside, fell back a bit in the turn, moved out, four wide turning for home, outside bid, drove clear.
LANEYS LOVE settled off the early pace, dropped inside to save ground in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, clearly second best. LINE OF FAITH
within striking distance early, advanced three wide to challenge in the turn, briefly clear when straightened for home, proved no match for the top two in the
late going, clearly second best. ARKANSAS INVASION fell back just after the start, continued to lack speed in the run up the backstretch, improved while
five to six wide exiting the turn, flattened out in the final furlong. SAILAWAY AND HIDE went evenly in the three out to the five path late in the turn, lacked
response in the drive. CYBERBURG moved up the rail to be clear early, showed the way into and through the turn, gave way in the drive. DIXIE LOVING off
a step slow, remained always back. RICH PRINCESS chased early, advanced, vied through the turn, backed up in the drive. DRAMATIC ENTRANCE off a
step slow, remained always back. DADDY'S ANGEL four wide when with the main body through the turn, tired.

Footnotes
CANDY STORE stalked the early leader off the inside, continued to race forwardly in the two path, fell back in the second turn, moved out a bit for the drive,
rebid late, drew clear. NEW COLOSSUS moved out when off the pace early, advanced with a middle move while continuing off the inside, well clear in the
final turn and into the lane, could not contain the winner late, held sway for the place. COLONEL TALBOT got clear up front into the first turn, rated in
showing the way up the backstretch, offered little resistance to the runner up when headed by that one into the far turn, chased that same rival into the
stretch, could not get back to that rival nor contain the runner up, narrowly saved the show. STARRING JOHN WAIN settled off the early pace, dropped
inside to save some ground in the second turn, modest late interest, not enough for the show. HONORING MAJOR lacked early foot toward the inside, two
path through the second turn, made little impact in the drive. MICA BAY last away, moved up to be forwardly placed early along the inside, continued to
save ground while falling back the middle half mile, went evenly in the drive while continuing inside. COWBOYS DREAM failed to menace while racing three
wide. NAPOLEON'S EMPIRE was never a serious threat.

Footnotes
FAYETTE WARRIOR stalked inside, continued to save ground through most of the second turn, moved out a bit for room turning for home, outside bid,
edging clear. LADDIE BOY back off the early pace while out in the strip, steady advance while four wide through the second turn, mild challenge to the
winner with a sixteenth remaining, could not get to that one late. MIRACLE MARCH broke in good order, set the pace along the inside, could not repel the
top two the final furlong, saved the show. MUCHO MACHO DAN rank in the first turn inside, settled in the run up the backstretch, raced in some traffic
through the second bend then displayed some mild interest to improve slightly. LOOKIE LOO shuffled back soon after the start, raced unhurried and three
wide through the first turn, remained outside, was five wide through the second turn, went evenly in the drive in failing to make an impact. WILD ABOUT
YOU last to leave, raced well back in the two path, passed tiring rivals to improve position. HYNDFORD settled in mid pack, dropped inside in the second
turn, failed to muster a rally. STORMINSIDE forwardly placed just off the inside, had little left for the drive. OPPORTUNISTIC void of early foot, never a
factor. PARK RIDGE BENNY chased the leader for a half outside and gave way.

Footnotes
BULLION in the second flight early outside four wide through the turn, advanced and challenged in upper stretch, long drive, proved best in a game effort.
AQWAAM moved up inside to set the pace, dueled through the turn, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, held the place. WICKED INDEED forwardly
placed early along the inside, in some traffic through the turn while continuing to save some ground turn, shifted out when straightened for home, up for the
show late. BOX OF CHOCOLATES in the two path and second flight early, also encountered some traffic late in the turn, improved slightly in the late going
while between horses. ONE FOR RICHIE off step slow, traffic into the turn, continued toward the inside, moved out for the drive, improved slightly while also
between horses at the wire. NOLA WIN washy, raced in the second group off the inside, moved closer in the three path late in the turn, challenged inside
the winner with a furlong remaining, hung in the late going to lose position. SPEAKER VAN lacked speed, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a late
punch. MAJORS VINDICATION remained always back off the inside. RAILMAN was finished after a half while racing wide. DEFLATER dueled up front for
four furlongs in the two path, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
JOY IN THE JOURNEY within striking distance early off the inside, advanced to challenge three wide late in the turn, shook clear when straightened for
home, maintained a daylight advantage the final furlong under brisk handling. FLORIDA BIRD off a step slow, raced back and off the rail, came three wide
into the lane, slowly gaining on the winner late, gleaned the nod for the place. ALL ABOUT CLARA in mid pack early toward the inside in the two path
through the turn, asked along, split foes with a quarter mild remaining, some gain, missed the nod for the place at the wire. JERI BELLA off slowly, trailed
early, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, improved position through some traffic. SAVEDBYANANGEL stalked the first flight in the
run up the backstretch, angled four wide into the stretch, came up empty for the stretch run. FLATOUTANDFOXY lacked speed after breaking a step slow,
five wide midway on the turn when moving slowly closer, lacked a further response. OOCHIE dueled up front in the two path into the turn, faltered in the
drive. TIDDLY in mid pack out in the strip, four wide turn, failed to muster a closing response. FLORA GROVE settled early off the pace, began a steady
fade before a half. WILLOW MOON broke alertly, cleared to the inside before a furlong, dueled into the turn along the inside and stopped.

ROARING RULE off the pace and the inside, two path turn, moved out three wide for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time. CHIEF OF STAFF
vied early from between horses, dueled through the turn, garnered a slightly larger advantage past midstretch, just failed to hold the runner up safe while
once again between horses at the wire. BUBBAS DIXIE off a step slow, lacked early foot, inside, continued to save ground when advancing late in the turn,
challenged inside the runner up with a furlong remaining, outkicked by that rival and the winner to the wire. SUSPECT A STORM off slowly to spot the field
a couple of lengths, raced back, two path into the lane, mild late interest while not a threat to the top three. GET THE BLING raced back and inside,
continued to save ground into the stretch, altered course to the outside with a furlong remaining, improved slightly. SPEEDY DANSMERE broke sharp, vied
early three wide, dueled through the turn, weakened in the drive. PLUMBAGO pinched then took up at the start, raced back in the three path, traffic,
bothered a furlong out, remained back. HAMAZINGLY RICH within striking distance early, began to fade before a half. FLAT OUT MINE flashed brief speed
along the inside, backed up.
