Footnotes
CHERRY WAY broke sharply to chase the leaders from the inside, angled out five-wide nearing the five-sixteenths marker, reached the fore with a furlong
to run and was fully extended to hold LONNIE TON safe late. LONNIE TON was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch, could not reach the winner late but finished with good courage. GET ER DONE settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn, split rivals in mid-stretch but failed to gain on the top pair late. SENOR PABLO raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide
through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. PACK 'N GOLD was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing
four-wide and gave way after going a half. SILVER SECRET R F dueled for the early advantage from the inside and gave way through the final furlong.
HAPPY HENNESSY hopped at the start, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. DANI'S CHOICE lagged early,
raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten. STORM THE BEACH was void of early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the
stretch and did not offer a bid. PERSONAL GUARANTEE vied for the lead from between foes and weakened after a half.
