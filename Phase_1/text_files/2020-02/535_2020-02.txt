Footnotes
BAD BEAT BRIAN broke to the lead inside, rated along and edged clear through the middle stages, dug in getting bumped solidly in mid stretch by
RHYTHM SECTION, received another whack from that foe nearing the wire and held on gamely. RHYTHM SECTION broke in bumping with JACK'S
ADVANTAGE at the start, steadied behind SMOKE ALARM heading to the first turn, raced three wide moving to contention after six furlongs, lugged in and
slammed BAD BEAT BRIAN while challenging under pressure through the furlong grounds, got pulled off, then lugged in greenly again giving that adversary
another hip check near the finish, and could not get by. BUDGET BUSTER bobbled at the start but came away alertly, tucked in just off the leaders, moved
off the rail near the quarter-pole and could not gain under pressure. LE COSTE raced three to four wide throughout, and finished one-paced. DECLARE
UNION raced four wide on the turns, and passed tired horses. DEGAS settled in the middle of the pack for six furlongs, and could not gain inside through
the lane. FIRST IN LINE saved ground early near the back, came four wide off the far turn and posed no threat. EMBRACE MY UNCLE broke out bumping
TRAPPED INSIDE solidly after the start, saved ground and was finished before completing six furlongs. JACK'S ADVANTAGE was bumped and jostled
around between horses at the start, took up behind SMOKE ALARM going to the first turn, and never got close. TRAPPED INSIDE bumped with SMOKE
ALARM at the break, then was mashed between horses as EMBRACE MY UNCLE came over to visit, and was far back throughout. SMOKE ALARM was
bumped between TRAPPED INSIDE and RHYTHM SECTION at the start, bulled his way out keyed up going to the first turn impeding rivals, pulled his way
through the first turn four wide to press BAD BEAT BRIAN from outside, settled down a bit up the backstretch, but was finished before reaching the stretch.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
GRAND MORELAND vied for the lead with GANGSTER OF LOVE in opening quarter then cleared on top, widened advantage with willingly response
around the turn, came out wider when asked left handed in stretch run, switched sticks, straightened out, remain sharp while well clear and finished in hand.
PURECRAZIDUDE raced six wide off the early pace, coaxed along the outside around the turn, responded racing wide in the lane and rallied up to clear
place. MOZANO raced in range through early stages, gained position racing three wide around the turn then continued a steady even bid through the lane
and secured show. MIGHTY FAST chased the top two leaders into the turn, was under a drive along inside at the quarter pole, stayed on with interest then
flattened near mid-stretch. GANGSTER OF LOVE was off to a good start and briefly held a slim lead, matched strides with the winner then conceded
position entering the turn, stayed on with response, hustled up between foes at the quarter pole to upper stretch then gave way in final furlong. PUT IT ON
DETTI was hustled along four wide through early stages, kept under a drive into upper stretch and lacked the needed response for impact. CHADS CHOICE
raced under steady pressure and raced off the second flight around the turn, raced four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response for impact.
FORT OF AVON switched in a few paths in opening stages and raced three wide off the early speed, coaxed along around the turn then raced seven wide
top stretch and lacked a needed rally. MOUNTAIN TREE raced off the pace and saved ground throughout without gaining a threatening position. ALL
POWER raced near midpack along inside down the backstretch, failed to move on under pressure around the turn then faded in the lane. ELECTRIC HEAT
raced widest and reserved near the rear and failed to produce a bid. SEE THE SONG came away last at the start, raced two wide near throughout and
never reached contention.

Footnotes
SAMOA sprinted clear early inside, fought off an initial challenge from KEILANI late on the far turn, went clear again through upper stretch, drifted out as the
rider switched to a left-handed stick outside the sixteenth-pole, and held sway. KEILANI stalked outside SAMOA, bid for command but was repelled going
by the quarter-pole, kept to task challenging again entering the final furlong, steadied twice behind her nemesis shortly thereafter, and ran on second best.
LOOKING FOR MORE was driven for a response three wide before reaching the stretch, and continued on one-paced to the finish. KAUFY FUTURES
bumped lightly with MADELYN'S DANCER at the start, chased inside for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and could not gain. MIA ANGELINA was
outrun inside for nearly six furlongs, and made no late headway on the far outside. MADELYN'S DANCER bumped lightly with KAUFY FUTURES at the
start, and failed to threaten three wide. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF KEILANI AGAINST SAMOA, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
INDIAN COUNSELOR was allowed to settle while saving ground on the first turn, stayed inside and rated not too far off the early pace, switched out a path
and picked up the tempo mid-way around the turn, was set down driving four wide with a furlong left to run, dug in determinedly and got by in final strides.
FLAME ZAPPER secured inside position around the first turn and tracked the pace along inside through early stages, prompted along the rail near the
quarter pole, came out briefly two wide top stretch then darted back to the inside, moved up to battle for the lead with PROPENSITY, dug in gamely deep
stretch and got edged for victory in final strides. PROPENSITY led the way on the first turn and set the pace down the backstretch, held a slim lead over
challenge's around the final turn then raced two wide into the lane, came under attack from rail running FLAME ZAPPER, battled back gamely in final stages
and got outkicked nearing the wire. HOLY MEISTER was forwardly placed around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter down the backstretch, launched
a two wide bid for command on the final turn, continued a bid in striking range at the furlong marker then gave way in final sixteenth. ISLAND BOY settled
nicely and rated through early stages, prompted for response around the final turn, continued three wide under pressure in stretch run and lacked the
needed response for impact. UP AND ONWARD tracked the early pace, hustled up around the far turn but failed to respond and gave way. CUZZN DOUG
raced in the back throughout, saved ground on the final turn, prompted right handed upper stretch but had no response.

Footnotes
MONTANA MAN tracked the battling leaders three wide for six furlongs, rallied determinedly through the stretch and forged past RATIFY from outside in the
closing yards. RATIFY vied for the lead outside HELL BENT for six furlongs, wrested command through upper stretch and edged away, but could not
withstand the top one late. LETS PLAY HARDBALL advanced to contention midway on the far turn, paused behind the leaders awaiting an opening at the
top of the stretch, split horses and bid along the rail past the furlong marker and did not have enough. TOLKIEN saved ground reserved early, advanced
between horses around the far turn, and gained mildly outside late. SEE THE PYRAMIDS was outrun for six furlongs, cut the corner into the stretch and
passed tired horses. HELL BENT vied up front inside RATIFY, and weakened after straightening away for the drive. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM broke slowly,
and improved a bit late while never prominent. THRESHOLD was forwardly placed inside early, but tired before reaching the stretch. KHOZY MY BOY
raced five wide into the first turn, remained well out in the course and never became a factor. RANGE OF MOTION steadied along the inside soon after
entering the far turn, moved to the two-path and was empty. RODEO RED was three wide on the turns and never factored.

Footnotes
STORMY NELLY held a slim lead out of the gate then cleared on top and took the rail position, remained on top while confidently handled around the turn,
turned for home two to three wide, came out a couple paths wider when prompted left handed, remained sharp on top and finished going away while ridden
out in late stages. LITTLE BELLA advanced between foes entering the turn and moved up to race behind the leader, was no match for pulling away foe but
stayed on with steady response through the lane for place honors. LADY NOY raced in close contention two wide in pursuit of the early leader, saved
ground out of the turn then continued a bid up the inside and prevailed for a share. CAVERNNDCHIPMUNKS (FR) was not too far back in early stages and
chased around the turn, continued a steady four to five wide bid in the lane but needed more for late impact. SUSIE'S MEMORY raced in range then
steadied between foes near three eighths pole and lost position, was under a ride racing widest in the lane and lacked a needed rally. R KISS EM
GOODBYE raced in range along the rail then steadied near three eighths pole, stayed inside then angled out three wide top of the lane and lacked the
needed response for impact. TWICE AROUND raced in back along rail in opening stages, angled out around the turn, switched in a couple paths and raced
three to four wide under pressure in final furlong but failed to move on. TAKE CHARGE AGAIN broke out, brushed with foe then momentarily a bit tight and
dropped back, raced near then in the back and failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
BABY ICE moved closest to SALSA RITA three wide around the turn, rallied steadily to take over outside that rival a sixteenth out and drew clear. SALSA
RITA took over inside FANCY FOX midway up the backstretch, rated along clear to the eighth-pole, drifted out from there and was able to save the place.
SHALL RETURN was outrun inside to the turn, stayed on the rail through the drive and rallied mildly just missing second. WORTH AVENUE saved ground
through the opening half-mile, angled out at the top of the stretch and had no meaningful response. MARY LEE AND ME raced four wide around the turn,
and could not reach contention. LEDECKY brushed the right side of the gate coming out, lagged well back for a half, and could not gain widest late.
DURLYN gave chase to the far turn, and dropped back between horses. FANCY FOX led for the first sixteenth of a mile or so before deferring to SALSA
RITA, stayed on the chase to the end of the turn and faltered.

MEMORABLE ELECTION held a slim lead out of the gate then vied inside of GOLDENLINEOF around the turn, continued to battle back gamely in the lane,
held a slight edge and refused to let rival by. GOLDENLINEOF raced up close while ridden along out of the gate then raced on equal terms with
MEMORABLE ELECTION around the turn, fought back gamely through the lane but could not get by tenacious winner. SHANGHAI LEVI raced off the early
speed and switched inside to save ground around the turn, quickly shifted out top of the lane, responded under a drive and advanced to prevail for a share.
SIR SEAMUS raced inside off the top flight around the turn, continued a bid near inside upper stretch then came out a couple paths and ran on evenly in the
final furlong. REGGAE PIRATE raced two wide off the top pair around the turn, stayed on with response under right handed pressure upper stretch then
flattened in final furlong. BROADCAST TIME raced off the early pace and saved ground, shifted out top stretch and lacked a needed rally. MR. EDGAR
never got untracked during any portion of the race, pulled up near top stretch and walked off under no visible distress.

Footnotes
FLAT AWESOME JENNY came under a ride within striking range after a half-mile, rallied outside rivals through the stretch in the four-path, collared
FREUDIAN FINISH a sixteenth out and drew clear under a mild drive. FREUDIAN FINISH set the pace inside while pressed by R PREROGATIVE and MY
SARASOTA STAR, fought those two off through mid stretch, could not deny the top one but stayed clear for the place. R PREROGATIVE pressed the pace
between horses, could not kick on with the top two through the furlong grounds but ran on with good courage. MY SARASOTA STAR veered out at the start
while breaking alertly, chased after the leaders three wide, had the rider drop the whip at the top of the stretch, and weakened through the last eighth of a
mile with the rider using goggles for encouragement. LADY FIORELLA stayed in range early inside, but could not keep pace around the turn. KATALUST
raced in the second flight to the stretch, and was empty on the far outside. SANITY showed little inside. BONES was always outrun.

Footnotes
SAVVY CAIRO was reserved and raced in the back near the inside down the backstretch, remained patiently handled then angled out and headed in pursuit
late far turn, was set down five wide in the drive, continued in game pursuit of PRINCESS CRYSTAL and nailed foe in final strides. PRINCESA CRYSTAL
(GB) was unhurried and saved ground to the far turn, angled out and picked up the pace near the quarter pole then took command near the furlong marker,
continued on top under steady pressure and got caught in final strides. BIT COIN QUEEN rated off the top trio and saved ground down the backstretch, was
patiently handled and waited near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out leaving the far turn, roused forward three wide, raced in close contention then
continued a even three wide bid in late stages and cleared share. BULLDAT was forwardly positioned and prompted the pace to the far turn, moved up and
took a slim lead past the quarter pole, continued on top upper stretch then got collared by PRINCESS CRYSTAL near the furlong grounds and gave way.
ROSASPARKS led the way around the first turn and set the pace down the backstretch, vied for the lead around the far turn then tired in the drive. ALWAYS
LUCKY rated off the top trio to the far turn, coaxed four wide near the quarter pole, came out wide under left handed pressure entering top stretch then had
no late response. TAPIZAR GIRL got bumped at the start, raced off the pace then urged five wide on the final turn and failed to move into contention. WILD
ABOUT THIS was forwardly placed and raced in striking range through early stages, vied three wide for the lead at the quarter pole then faded in the lane.
