Footnotes
AGAVE QUEEN with the early pace, gradually cleared to the inside in the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when confronted by the
runner up in upper stretch, held that foe at bay in the run to the wire under firm handling. QUIET DAWN vied up front along the inside, moved out and
stalked the winner up the backstretch, asked along into the stretch, lodged a mild bid nearing midstretch, could not get by. SPECTACULAR TEMPER void
of early foot, closer inside the third quarter, flattened out in the drive, moved out, much the best of the rest. DARK SARCASM went one paced throughout.
MEBS WEB lacked speed, failed to menace. SWEET KALA forwardly placed off the inside in the early going, had little left for the drive. MIXTAPE last to
leave, was never close while toward the inside.

Footnotes
DREXEL settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, late bid outside, fully extended to narrowly prevail. PEARLTHIRTYEIGHT in mid
pack for a half off the inside, advanced toward the rail in upper stretch, steered out past the furlong marker for room, challenged between rivals, led late,
missed in a good effort. GRAHAMSTAN broke back, four wide trip through the turn, rallied for the show and was slowly getting to the top pair late while well
out in the strip. RANDOM AFFAIR broke sharp, dueled early, showed the way through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, vied past the
furlong marker then faltered. AGAVE KID within striking distance off the inside, came up empty for the drive. UNBRIDLED SHOES void of speed, raced well
out in the strip, four wide turn, remained wide in the drive, improved position while not a serious threat. ARKANSAS RED lacked speed, raced three wide
through the turn, continued to race back, checked up in some traffic midstretch, improved slightly. MY SUGAR TOWN in mid pack inside, remained always
back. AFRICAN WARRIOR pressed the leader from off the inside, between rivals through the turn, gave way in the drive. PRINCE LEO reluctant to load, off
a step slow, saved ground to no avail. OFFICER DONELL forwardly placed early inside, began a steady retreat in the turn.

furlong marker, drove clear. C H JAY closest to the leader in the two path, moved to challenge with the winner inside that one and between horses late in
the final turn, dueled with the winner in upper stretch then could not match strides. CADDO DADDO settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through
the final turn, staged a mild rally to be along for the show, no threat to the top twol. OCTOBER SKY lacked speed inside, moved a bit closer in the two path
into the stretch, closest to the top pair with a furlong to run, flattened out to be caught for the show. SUSPICIOUS EYES broke out, bumped, washy while

Footnotes
BACKSEAT PROMISES off a step slow, raced well back, moved outside, late surged when widest in the drive, up in time. RANSOMED stalked the early
leader off the inside, advanced and took over into the lane, led late, drifted out when clear, nipped at the wire. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF CAN'T TOUCH ME AGAINST RANSOMED FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. CAN'T
TOUCH ME settled off the pace, moved closer three wide in upper stretch, altered course inside a drifting leader, outkicked in the late going. MY DARLING
SOFIA behind the pace toward the inside, in some traffic late in the turn, came up empty when called on for run while between horses. OUR GIRL ABBY
shook clear in the early going, raced inside, weakened. WENEEDTOTALK lacked speed, saved ground to no avail. WAY TOO SMARTE lacked speed,
backed up off the inside, vanned off.

Footnotes
BANK MAN dwelt at the start to spot the field several lengths, began to move in the three path early in the turn, circled six wide into the stretch, finished with
good energy down the middle of the strip to win going away. LEO DEL REO forwardly placed early toward the inside, came three wide into the lane when
advancing, took over, clear with a furlong remaining, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. THE DEVIL'S DADDY in mid pack in the run up
the backstretch, three wide out to four wide turn, staged a mild rally to finish best of the rest. ROCK CITY ROCKET within striking distance early, two path
when evenly paced through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. SEQUENCE lacked speed, raced four wide through the turn, improved slightly while
also not a serious threat. THERUNAWAYROCKET vied up front while racing toward the inside, gave way. BACK ROAD OUTLAW failed to menace three
wide. HOLY TRUTH off slowly, remained back. MARCO'S DREAM narrowly set the pace off the inside for a half and gave way. MY LITTLE TIP in mid pack
and off the inside, four wide turn, tired in the drive. SUMMERTIMER off slowly, always outrun. SHAMEFUL PREACHER staged a steady retreat.

Footnotes
MOONLIGHT TRAIN prompted the pace off the inside, ranged up to challenge in the three path in the second turn, narrowly showed the way upper stretch,
held sway late under firm handling. COWGIRL CALLIE pressured the leader from the outside, challenged between horses in the second turn, showed the
way into the lane, long drive, gave ground grudgingly to the winner the final furlong. FROZEN HANNAH settled off the pace and the inside, moved a bit
closer in some traffic in the second turn, went evenly in the drive. COOK MEMORIES lacked speed, in the two path through the second turn, also went one
paced through the lane. DARING off a step slow, raced back, ranged up four wide in the second turn to become a forward factor, flattened out in the drive.
HONOR WITH PRIDE away in good order, showed the way along the inside in hand, briefly vied when confronted in the second turn, gave way when
headed soon after. BUTTON MUSHROOM finished early, fell well back, dull effort.

Footnotes
NAUGHTY ALFRED within striking distance inside, advanced along the rail to lodge a bid turning for home, kicked clear, steady handling. TEMPLE BAR
back off the pace outside, raced four wide through the turn when moving closer, proved no match for the winner, long drive for the place. FEELING IT
prompted the winner from the outside, came three wide as the winner was challenging along the rail into the stretch, also proved no match for that one in the
run to the wire, outkicked late for the place spot. THE DEVILS BACK in the second flight early between horses, shuffled back to lose some position into the
turn, remained back through the bend, asked along into the stretch, improved position a bit with some mild late interest. PERFECT RUSH away in good
order, sprinted clear soon after, set the pace in the two path, gave way when headed entering the stretch. T C'S IMAGE saved ground to no avail.
VIOLATOR back off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, failed to rally. RASSLIN last away, trailed early and was never a factor. AH YEAH was
always outrun. DIFFERENT DAYS settled off the pace, was backing up when pulled up in apparent distress in midstretch, vanned off.

Footnotes
WHOLEHEARTED behind the pace toward the inside, continued behind traffic late in the turn, got through along the inside entering the stretch, edged clear
under pressure. EMBOLDENED off a step slow, lacked room in traffic late in the turn, swung out widest for the drive, finished up willingly to be slowly getting
to the winner late. HEAVENS WHISPER also back off the early pace, came four wide into the lane, briefly challenged outside the winner midstretch, proved
not match for that one or the runner up kin the late going. FULL OF GRACE forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch run.
SUMMER STORM narrowly set the pace in the two path, faltered in the drive. SARA SEA pressed the pace for a half three wide and gave way. HOPTOWN
HONEY showed speed early along the inside, began to give way late in the turn.

Footnotes
ICECAP broke well, raced forwardly early toward the inside, moved closer along the rail late in the final turn, moved out slightly and got through into the
lane, outside bid, wore down foe late. INSTIGATED broke well, allowed the leader to go early, moved on that one and took over into the far turn, showed the
way into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to that rival, well clear of the others. LIDO LEGACY back off the pace and the inside, continued outside, four wide
through the second turn, staged a mild rally to annex the show, not a threat to the top two. NO BAD DAYS forwardly placed early, moved with the runner up
outside that one in the far turn, flattened out in the drive to lose the show. SON OF GA GA settled off the pace, turned in an even effort in lacking a late bid.
HEROS REWARD in mid pack while for wide in the first turn, four wide into the far turn, three wide into the lane, failed to muster a rally. CATHOLIC GUILT
in tight and very rank in steadying early, raced back, four wide into the far turn, lacked kick in the drive. MEGA MAX settled early, fell back, failed to menace.
HIGH TONE back off the pace, steadied repeatedly in the first turn, remained back. SELLECK sprinted clear soon after the start, stopped in the far turn
when headed by the runner up. DAZZLING REUNION fell far back, always outrun.
