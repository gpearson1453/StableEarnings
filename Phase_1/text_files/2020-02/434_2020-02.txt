Footnotes
CADILLAC CHROME veered in after the start, awaited room on the turn, closed willingly and got up in the final strides. LIL BIT OF THUNDER bumped and
was checked after the start, challenged between horses on the turn, was carried out, fell back, closed once straightened, got up past the sixteenth pole and
was caught late. IN CONTROL broke slowly, rallied four across on the turn, bore out, dropped back and held for show. VIDAKS BACK was checked after
the start, advanced to the turn was carried ten wide, closed well and gained late. KNIGHT SOLAIRE was checked at the start, went ten wide at the top of
the stretch and closed well. GO YOUR OWN WAY was steadied after the start, got through along the rail on the turn, led to deep stretch and faltered.
SURFING ANGEL came out at the start, led to the turn, bore out and stopped near the eighth pole. Following a stewards' inquiry, CADILLAC CHROME was
disqualified and placed fifth for causing interference after the start.

Footnotes
AGENT GIBBS broke awkwardly, set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and just lasted. BUBBA BAY raced in the back, got through along the rail
on the turn, closed willingly, was gaining late and just missed at the wire. MIDNIGHT ZITHER was never far back, went seven wide at the top of the stretch,
finished well, gained late and was vanned off. BRAVE HELIOS lagged early, raced outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed to narrow
the gap. KIJANI raced inside while close to the pace, lacked a late response and hung late. MAGNETAR pressed the pace to the turn and gave way.
COUNT HU had brief speed only.

PLAYOFF BOUND stalked the pace, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, closed under urging, got up near the sixteenth pole and drew off. REAL LUTE
was rated early, raced in the back outside, went nine wide at the top of the stretch, closed well and got up near the wire for place. TIGER BY HIS TAIL
dueled along the rail to the second turn, inched clear into the stretch, faltered near the sixteenth pole and held for show. CHRISTINE'S JACK dueled three
across to the second turn, fell back entering the stretch and hung late. STORMY SAILOR broke awkwardly and was steadied at the start, stalked the pace
while racing inside and lacked the needed stretch response. STORMCHASER dueled between horses to the second turn, stopped, was eased and walked
off.

Footnotes
ROCKY BOY INDIAN stalked the pace while racing inside, awaited room on the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up in the
final strides. NIGHT AT THE OPERA pressed the pace, dueled through the stretch, had the lead late and was caught. MR VIEW pressed the pace, fell back
on the turn, bid five wide and got up late for show in a steady effort. FLY FIRST CLASS set a pressured pace, dueled through the stretch, faltered past the
sixteenth pole and lost position. ZERO SUM GAME pressed the pace, went six wide entering the stretch, continued in a steady effort and didn't have
enough late. THIRTY SECONDS OUT saved ground, got through along the rail on the turn to contend for the lead and faltered near the sixteenth pole.
HUNTINGTONS RITHM was not a factor. MAXUM was outrun.

SASSY MISS raced close to the pace, rallied three across on the turn, closed steadily and got up at the wire. TOMORROW'S MINE dueled inside to the
turn, inched clear and was caught at the wire to just miss. SINGLEFORTHESUMMER stalked the pace, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and
finished well to earn show. SOPHIE T was never far back and improved position in a steady effort. ME FIRST in close, dueled to the upper stretch and was
unable to sustain her bid. BRIARTIC GAL was not a factor. ALOHA SPIRIT raced inside, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

SUMMER BUDDHA set the pace, drew off entering the stretch and extended his lead while kept to task. SAVAGE WARRIOR was never far back, went
eight wide at the top of the stretch and closed to get up for place while no threat to the winner. AT TWILIGHT TIME raced close to the pace outside, went
seven wide at the top of the stretch and offered a mild bid only. HOLLYWOOD DREAMER stalked the pace, rallied on the turn to loom a threat, fell back and
leveled off. DANTHEMANLEVITAN was void of early speed, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and improved position. LICORICE DROP POPS
chased the pace to the second turn and flattened out. ENOUGH OF THAT broke slowly, raced wide and did not threaten. PAPA JOE saved ground, lacked
a bid and did not threaten. THAT DOG WILL HUNT was not a factor. ELUSIVE FLAME was steadied along the rail on the backstretch fell back and not
urged through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOB'S ALL IN stalked the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly, got up past the eighth pole and drew off. OUR
DANDY'S BOY was unhurried early, advanced to the turn, bid eight wide and got up for place while no threat to the winner. SAND HARBOR was never far
back, rallied into the turn to challenge for the lead, dueled past the eighth pole, was unable to sustain his bid and settled for show. SPIRIT MISSION
challenged along the backstretch, dueled past the eighth pole, weakened and lost position. WATER WAGON saved ground, offered a mild bid only and did
not threaten. WISE MARKET led around the first turn, vied inside to the second turn, tired and gave way. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was through after a half.
EYE OF THE HUNTER raced mid pack in an even effort, lacked a bid and showed little. KODIAK KING was outrun and not urged through the stretch.
THISONESFORJAMES failed to contend.
