Footnotes
PIONEER DANCER saved ground confidently to far turn, angled out, prevailed late. ROCK ON KITTEN unhurried early, rushed to duel into turn, cleared,
run down. RUSSIAN TO TAPIT no speed to far turn, circled field widest to move up for show. PROMONTORY up close inside, shuffled back at the half,
rallied back late. CHAMPAGNE CHILLS good position from inside, dueled quarter pole, faltered in drive. RUN THIS TOWN rambunctious in the gate, never
really menaced. REGAL MOON speed to the lead, stayed to the half, gave way readily. LUCKY LOOKIN brief speed to the half, caved and backed up
steadily. WHO'SYOURFAVORITE never a factor. HE'S THUNDER failed to menace.

JEWELL unhurried backstretch, steadied along briefly, run on for show. DIXIE MOLL in tight backstretch, squeezed back sharply, settled in and
improved.through the stretch run ATALANTA BELLE raced evenly from inside throughout with no late kick. BLUNT BRUNETTE never far back to turn,
contended stretch, faded back late. CALABRISELLA never a real threat throughout. CASHMEIFUCAN pressed pace to turn, gave way readily.
WHODUNNITANDRAN widest trip never a menace. MADABOUTHER always outrun. ONE LAST CAT through early, dropped back. DELANEY FERRY
close up early on with a steady retreat. A claim of foul by the fourth place finisher against the third place finisher for interference on the backstretch was

Footnotes
FLASH N' DANCE chased the pace early from the outside, was in the five path into the lane, lugged in during the upper stretch, came in again and bumped
NOVELLA nearing the sixteenth pole, drove past and cleared the field in the final stages. NOVELLA came out at the start, tracked the pace early, was in the
three path into the lane, inched ahead near the eighth pole, was bumped by FLASH N' DANCE nearing the sixteenth pole and yielded in the final stages.
KOJO'S QUEEN stalked the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but hung in the late stages. I LIKEM was bumped at the
start, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and finished willingly late in the stretch run. GIRLS GOT TRACK set the pace early, was off
the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. DANCE THE DAY AWAY was back early on, raced off the rail into the lane, made a bid in the
stretch but weakened late in the drive. GOING TO TEMPLE was on the inside into the lane and lacked a rally down the lane. POSITIVE VIBES was never a
factor. HYDRA'S HOPE was bumped at the start and was no threat. CURLIN COED was done early. COURT THE STORM had early speed then folded up.
