Footnotes
DEALIN' STELEN broke in good order, narrowly showed the way into the first turn while between rivals, continued to show the way up the backstretch,
responded when challenged in midstretch, kicked clear under steady handling. MOOSE GOT EVEN lacked speed, dropped in to save ground, angled out,
willingly, clear for the place. WRITTEN PERMISSION pressed the winner in the three path early, continued to force the issue through the second bend,
drew alongside with a furlong remaining, turned back, last place. HIGHLIGHT REEL four wide in the first turn when with the second flight, advanced outside
into contention late in the final turn, flattened out in the drive. ARGUTO in the second flight toward the inside, went evenly. GEORGIA DEPUTY with the
early pace along the inside, began to retreat after a half. GOLDEN RULE HAVEN off a step slow, failed to menace. EMPTY NESTR also broke slowly,
remained always back. NIALL steadily faded while racing off the inside. ENJOY THE JOURNEY sluggish from the start, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
GOOD JUDGMENT broke well, allowed the leaders to go into the turn, moved out three wide when moving to challenge turning for home, put a head in front
upper stretch then kicked clear. MY BOY LOLLIPOP void of speed, rallied three wide into the lane, finished willingly for the place, proved no match for the
winner. MAINFRAME JUDY away in good order, dueled into the turn closest to the inside, narrowly lead late in the turn, faltered in the drive when headed.
TEMPLE BAR settled off the pace in the three path, continued in even fashion while continuing outside. THE DEVILS BACK off the pace and the inside,
came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing response. TWIN TURBO broke alertly, fell back before quarter, weakened in the drive while off the inside.
PLEASE THE COURT void of speed, passed some tiring rivals while never a threat. AH YEAH off slowly, failed to menace. FEELING IT dueled up front off
the inside, stopped in the drive. ELITE AND BIG bobbled, steadied start, moved up while being asked, gave way late in the turn.

HAMAZING WISDOM lacked early foot outside, four wide through the turn, rallied into the stretch while continuing outside, finished with good energy to win
going away. IMPLICATOR settled off the early pace toward the inside, steered out to be four wide turning for home when advancing, steered back toward
the inside past the furlong marker, finished willingly to be clear for the place. MOONSHINE MOMENT broke back, steadied five furlongs out in some traffic,
recovered to race three wide through the turn, also staged a rally to be up for the show. RADICATOR broke well to vie for the early lead, got clear in the turn
and into the stretch, continued to hold a daylight advantage past the furlong marker, caved in the late going. EXOTIC PEGASUS fractious in the gate prior to
the start, broke sharp, vied up front while between horses, began to gradually weaken in the turn. SMARTY GRIMES broke in, bumped foe, was
straightened to race in mid pack off the inside, lacked a response in the drive.. BOO BE RIGHT within striking distance while racing three wide, had little left
for the drive. DEMIGOD sluggish at the start, trailed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. RANDOM AFFAIR vied up front early
along the inside, backed up. AGAVE KID raced in mid pack early, steadied into the turn, remained back. AFRICAN WARRIOR in the main body early,
shuffled back into the turn, continued to fade. HUMMEL ONE jostled at the start, remained always back.

Footnotes
VIOLENT RIDGE broke alertly, set the early pace, disposed of the other speed after a half, well clear upper stretch, continued to steady increased
advantage under steady handling. FAYETTE WARRIOR pressured the winner from the outside early, crept closer to that rival late in the turn, proved no
match in the. CALCULATING KING reluctant to load, raced forwardly and three wide, had little for the top two in the drive, finished best of the rest. COME
ON DOVER settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide into the lane, went evenly in the run to the wire. DARREN'S FORTUNE pressured the pace
on the far outside in the run up the backstretch, five wide into the turn, four wide exiting, weakened through the stretch. TOWN DRUNK pressured the pace
while racing in the four path, tired in the stretch. BLENDED LUTE raced back off the early pace, steadied to avoid a stricken foe midway up the backstretch,
lacked a bid in the drive. BAQUERO FLIES off a step slow, raced back, also steadied with a half mile remaining, also failed to respond in the drive. POP
LIFE off a step slow, was never involved. DRUNKEN FRIDAYS void of speed inside, bothered slightly backstretch, was outrun. FRONT PAGE also lacked
speed, was racing back when checked up past a stricken rival with just over a half mile remaining, well back. SPIROGYRA within striking distance inside,
appeared injured and fell with four furlongs to run, vanned off.

NASHVEGAS broke alertly, showed the way in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the turn, clear again when straightened for home, larger lead
midstretch, enough left to just last. FLEXATI in mid pack early, came three wide into the lane, roused, late burst to be rapidly getting to the winner, just
missed. MR. SCISSORS forwardly placed while racing outside, rank and very wide into the turn, settled, closest to the winner with a furlong remaining, had
little left late but managed to saved the show. WICKED CITI lacked speed while racing outside, lacked a serious response in the drive, improved position
slightly. ON TILT forwardly placed just off the inside, moved closer and lodged a brief bid outside the winner in the turn, faltered in the drive. WILSHIRE
DIAMOND reluctant to load, off a step slow, raced back, steered out in some traffic midstretch, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. AXIS in the
second flight off the inside, came up empty for the drive. NO PROBLEMO in the second flight along the inside, gave way in the drive. ALASKAN FLYER off
a step slow, remained always back. CLOCK IT was not involved while racing three wide. IN THE DEEP settled off the pace and the inside, gave way late in
the turn, pulled up stretch, walked off.

Footnotes
GETRIDOFWHATAILESU unhurried in the early going, swept up into contention four wide late in the final turn, challenged soon after, kicked strongly clear.
ROCKIN READY forwardly placed off the inside, advanced three wide in the second turn, briefly dueled with the winner upper stretch, proved no match for
the winner the final furlong, clear second. CRYSTAL LAKE steadied at the start to be off slowly, steadied again in traffic first turn, second flight middle half,
traffic again into the far turn, staged a mild rally when clear for the drive, up for the show. GRANDEZZA void of early foot, four wide through the final turn,
improved position, not enough for the show. MARATHON QUEEN prompted the pace for five furlongs, lodged a brief bid in the final turn, faltered in the
drive. SUMMER STORM forwardly placed into the first turn along the rail, steadied when in tight, continued within striking distance, had little left for the
stretch run. JO MARIE broke back, trailed early, passed tiring rivals while not a serious threat. MUCHA MEZQUINA broke alertly, set the pace toward the
inside for six furlongs, gave way when headed. ITS COLD IN DEHERE in mid pack much of the way, had nothing for the drive. BRIGHTER IDEAS finished
early, far back.

Footnotes
FULLY AWARE broke alertly, raced with the early pace three wide and between rivals, edged away closest to the inside into the stretch, drew out through
the lane under steady handling. GRAYSONSMACHO GAL void of speed, three wide in the turn when beginning to advance, continued to rally through the
stretch to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. LIL RED VETTE within striking distance in the early going, moved closer while four wide early in the
turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could not contain the runner up, remained clear for the place. MI BELLA settled in mid pack toward the
inside, improved a bit in the drive, never dangerous. GOLDEN LILY bothered at the start to be last away, trailed, four wide through the turn, showed some
belated interest to improve position. SHACKADELIC with the early pace while between rivals, gave way late in the turn. AGAVE QUEEN broke out to bother
an outer rival, raced in mid pack and turned in an even effort. RED LINGERIE flashed brief speed early along the inside, gave way in the turn. WHOVILLE
forwardly placed, five wide into the turn, backed up soon after. DARK SARCASM broke back, was never a factor. CRUZIN COMO tired while racing just off
the inside. PRO SHOP JUNKIE faded while racing four wide.

Footnotes
LITTLE MENACE broke well, fell back off the leaders before a quarter, tilted out four wide exiting the turn for racing room, challenged on the outside nearing
the furlong grounds, long drive, proved best in a game effort. AMERICAN BUTTERFLY behind the pace while racing inside, continued to save ground into
the stretch, lodged a rail bid with a furlong remaining, narrowly missed. MARVIN broke outward, raced forwardly and outside, four wide through the turn,
three wide bid between rivals upper stretch, also narrowly missed in a solid effort. ANCIENT WARRIOR broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch
inside, continued to set the pace turn and into the lane, allowed the runner up the inside, weakened in the late going. SCORING within striking distance off
the inside, four wide exiting the turn, lacked the necessary closing response. CREEKMORE off a step slow, improved, no real threat. BENNY CHANG broke
well, pressed the pace from off the inside for a half and gave way. CROCKETTS BLUFF saved ground to no avail. TICK TACK MO void of speed, remained
always back. NAUGHTY ALFRED steadily faded three wide.

Footnotes
JERI BELLA outrun in the early going off the inside, rallied on the outside turning for home, five wide into the lane, full of run down the middle of the strip to
be in time. BLUSHING BELLA within striking distance off the inside, in some traffic in the turn, steadied late in the bend, bid, took over, clear, caught.
FLORIDA BIRD lacked speed, continued back through much of the turn, waited midway on the bend, clear for the drive, finished up willingly to be clear of
the others. ROCKING SHOES broke sharp, set the pace for five furlongs, weakened when headed the final eighth. SATTERSFIELD void of speed, saved
ground turn and improved position up the rail with some mild, belated interest. SHE'S TOO COOL within striking distance for four furlongs, came up empty
for the drive. SHE'S A QUEEN away in good order, pressed while being asked for a half, gave way in the drive. BUTTON MUSHROOM well back for a half,
four wide into the lane, improved position while remaining out in the strip. SEASIDE SURPRISE settled off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane,
failed to muster a rally. TEDDERS ANGEL failed to menace with a four wide trip. SPUNKY TOWN forwardly placed for a half, gave way suddenly late in the
turn, pulled up, vanned off.
