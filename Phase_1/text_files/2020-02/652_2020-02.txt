Footnotes
PAPPA ROX settled outside, made a strong three wide run around the turn, was brushed while vying outside the early leader into the final furlong, drew out
approaching the final sixteenth and was best under a brisk hand ride. CURRENT ENERGY pressed two wide outside the early leader, moved clear
approaching the quarter pole, bore out into the winner entering the final furlong then weakened. GIO LUCKY ducked out leaving the gate, was bumped
repeatedly while between horses nearing the end of the backstretch, raced two wide around the turn, bumped with SR.'S THRILL in midstretch and
continued evenly. SR.'S THRILL repeatedly bore out into GIO LUCKY nearing the end of the backstretch, swung out leaving the turn, bumped with that rival
through midstretch and lacked a strong closing. COOL YOUR BOOTS bobbled, came out, bumped QUEEN'S BIRD twice leaving the gate, lagged into the
stretch then made a belated run along the rail. QUEEN'S BIRD was bumped twice leaving the gate, recovered to make the early pace along the rail into the
turn then tired. FOXY B was outrun after a slow break.

Footnotes
FU MAN SUE set a pressured pace along the inside, kicked clear turning for home, and held sway under driving pressure. TIP FOR TAP split foes three
wide around the turn to make a place bid in upper stretch, and rallied mildly to prevail for that position at the wire. JOHNNY CAB was forwardly placed two
wide between horses, came under coaxing into the turn, lacked a kick to split foes three wide at the five sixteenths pole, angled to the rail at the quarter pole
and forged place turning for home, dug in inside of multiple rivals through the lane while proving no match for the leader, but was nipped at the wire for
place. GREAT AGAIN vied three to two wide into the turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader turning for home, then gave way between horses through
the final sixteenth. LITERALLY broke inwards and was off slowly, saved ground while trailing the field through the turn, angled four wide passing the three
sixteenths pole, but lacked the needed kick to get involved. LORD WINSALOT reared twice in the gate due to spooking from the assistant starters
encouraging DREAMING OF LOVE to load, then stalked four wide, but weakened turning for home. DREAMING OF LOVE was reluctant to load, race five
wide while off of the pace, and weakened.

Footnotes
SCRAP IRON PHIL stalked from the four, then three, path around the first turn, bid for the lead and took over into the far turn, drew off turning for home, and
held sway through the lane. HOLY SNIP raced far off of the pace three wide around the first turn, advanced five wide around the far turn while being floated
to the seven path, then rallied willingly through the lane while drifting in to prove second best. RIDE THIS TRAIN raced far off the pace two wide between
horses early on, shifted to the inside into the far turn, split tiring rivals two wide approaching the furlong pole, and improved position along the rail in the late
stages. CANT STOP THE RAIN broke inwards, saved ground while forwardly placed, shifted off of the rail to pass the tiring early leader around the far turn,
but failed to keep pace with SCRAP IRON PHIL turning for home, then got outfinished for minor rewards in the late stages. SCURLIN stalked two wide
between horses, then three wide between horses around the far turn, but weakened through the lane. GOURMET DELIGHT was jostled between horses at
the start, tracked three to four wide from midpack, drifted to the six path turning for home, and failed to make a bid. TINTO MESA trailed early on, had the
rider lose his irons entering the backstretch, but kept on thereafter, but failed to factor. SMOOTH TALK was forced inwards at the start causing him to bump
a foe, recovered to set the pace, built a clear lead early on, but was challenged by SCRAP IRON PHIL into the far turn, offered little resistance, then wilted
thereafter.

Footnotes
MR. ROUNDTREE vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, forged a clear advantage turning for home, and drew off readily with a strong
finish. DONTMESAWITHSISTER hopped at the start and trailed the field early, got rank when running up behind rivals into the far turn, shifted to the five
path and advanced outside of horses around the bend, sustained his rally through the lane, but was only second best. UNSUNG HERO stalked along the
inside before shifting to the three path into the turn, lacked a kick to make a bid before shifting back to the inside in upper stretch, but was no match for the
leader and got outfinished for place. SKY SOLO advanced to a three wide stalking position early on, continued his advance to bid for, and grab, the lead into
the far turn, but was put to a drive at the five sixteenths pole, weakened turning for home, and tired. PURRS WELL retreated to trail the field in the two path
into the turn, then improved position in upper stretch without menacing. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL was fractious in the gate, then hopped at the start,
advanced to midpack, attempted a four wide rally around the turn, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole. CARRIER TOMCAT set the pace
outside of MR. ROUNDTREE early on, but weakened between horses as SKY SOLO made a bid into the turn, retreated quickly around the turn, and was
eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ORBITING THE SKY stalked four wide, inched forward at the quarter pole, but failed to keep pace with SPECIAL POWER in upper stretch as that foe
quickened, but kept on through the lane and wore down that foe at the sixteenth pole. SPECIAL POWER vied along the inside, inched forward to grab the
lead into the turn, quickened turning for home and drew clear in upper stretch, but tired late and was worn down at the sixteenth pole. COIN OPERATED
made up ground by saving it around the turn, then willingly produced a rail rally through the lane. BARKER LANE set the pace between horses early on, but
lost the lead when put to a drive into the turn, and failed to keep pace turning for home. SINGING THE BLUES trailed early on, saved ground around the
turn, and rallied mildly inside of horses through the lane. SANSA raced five wide in midpack and failed to make a bid. TRIBAL PRINCESS was bumped by
an inner foe at the start, raced far off of the pace in the six path around the turn, and failed to menace. DOODLE DANDY broke outwards into a rival, took
the turn in the four path while far off of the pace, and was no factor. SPEAK YOUR TRUTH stalked along the inside, shifted to the two to three path turning
for home, but stopped. FLY TIME chased three wide, but weakened between horses into the turn, then faded around the bend.
