WAR OF THE NORTH, unhurried racing just off rail, angled widest into stretch and closed determinedly to be up in the final stride. INSPIRING JUSTICE set
the pace four path, drifted out through stretch and was nailed on the wire. GRAYS THE BAR broke slowly, raced wide and rallied too late. DOUGIE ducked
out leaving the gate, raced three wide and failed to menace. TRAFFIC COUNT chased from the four path, drifted in entering stretch and tired. HIBACHI had
his head turned to the left at the break, was outside and no real threat.

Footnotes
WOMAN FLYER ran freely in front in the four path, was never seriously challenged and won under strong handling. DEAREST ELLA was extremely wide
while just off the pace, moved in a bit on the turn and was slowly gaining. IT'S A SHAW THING chased racing in the four path, drifted wider through stretch
and weakened. VALIANT SPIRIT raced three wide on the turn, split rivals stretch, steadied briefly in deep stretch. BAAQEYA was very wide early, also split
rivals in the stretch and had no rally. FROSTY FRIEND, bumped in leaving the gate, raced inside and showed little. POINT LOCKOUT was in motion in the
starting gate and broke slowly then failed to menace. SKOOKIE came in leaving the gate causing crowding, saved ground, eased out in stretch and was
being eased through the final sixteenth. DANCINGTHEHNYDAWAY, bothered badly leaving the gate, never threatened. SUNNY MY WAY failed to menace.
GEMODIXIE came out leaving the gate, saved ground and tired. GRANDMA GERTIE, wide, failed to menace.

improved effort. SMART RAGS dueled for command three wide, took the lead leaving the turn but was unable to match strides late. A J'S WAY, broke
alertly after another lengthy gate load but then fell back, split rivals on the turn, angled wide through stretch and closed well. RIDE ON FAITH saved ground
disputing the pace and held on well. SMOOTH DON B, racing in the four path, failed to menace. KEEPING THE PEACE dueled for command between foes
then tired. BROTHER TEZ saved ground and tired. KRAKOV broke slowly and raced very wide. HESGOTAWAYWITHWRDS raced outside while just off the
pace then tired. VIZCAINO broke slowly and showed nothing.

Footnotes
TAPETE CLAIRE chased between rivals, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied three wide into the lane, dueled with MAD MARY and drew clear, driving.
MAD MARY chased close up inside, was in a bit tight entering the turn, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, dueled with the winner and dug in gamely inside
to the finish. RISQUE EXPRESS raced off the rail, off the pace, between rivals on the turn, rallied mildly and got the nod for third. MORISSETTE hopped at
the start, chased three wide, went four wide on the turn, rallied mildly outside and missed for the show spot. LIGHTS DOWN LOW was reluctant to load,
raced off the pace inside and had no rally. TRUE UPGRADE chased four wide early, three wide on the turn and weakened. TRAPPS STAR was a bit
reluctant to load, quickly showed in front, set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled briefly and gave way.
