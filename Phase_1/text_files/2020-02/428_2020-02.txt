GOOD FOR NOW stalked the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, waited for room into the turn, found room and was up in time for the win.
DARK DOM set a pressured early pace, went four wide into the turn, took a brief lead in mid stretch, couldn't hold off the winner and finished second best.
MCFANCY was outrun early, circled nine wide through the turn, was gaining late and needed more room. DEVON'S CHOICE chased the early pace, raced
off the rail into the turn and tired. SPOKEN PROMISE was taken back early, went three wide into the turn, angled out and offered a mild late rally.
NAVARONES SPARKLE was unhurried early, raced between rivals into the turn and never fired. DANI'S CAT tracked the early pace, went six wide into the
turn and was empty late. SWEETHEART GO HOME trailed throughout.

Footnotes
QUIEN ES tracked the leaders from the inside, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. SOME ASSEMBLY REQD was off slow, settled off the
leaders, advanced three-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, angled out further nearing the quarter, moved between rivals with a
sixteenth run and finished with good courage. LOOSEWHEELSLOUIE set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final furlong.
E BAR WAY lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with some late run. THE GREAT DOME chased
the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way after going a half. MALUSITA TOWER raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and
failed to menace. RISK IT ALL lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention. ON THE LOW DOWN was away in good order
to press the pace while racing three-wide from between foes and weakened after going a half. SEA MERMAN broke sharply to press the pace while racing
four-wide, weakened after going three furlongs, was pulled up and vanned off.
