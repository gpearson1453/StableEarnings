Footnotes
BLUE STEEL went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace under a snug hold on an easy lead, vied inside to
the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at the three-sixteenths and held under a strong hand ride. OVERZEALOUS was last to commence,
went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up four wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch before being straightened by the
rider, made an outside bid under a right-handed whip approaching the eighth-pole, battled with the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished while clear
for the place. CURLIN GREY saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while two then three wide on the far turn, angled six wide
into upper stretch then drifted out under a left-handed whip, was straightened by the rider outside the furlong marker then switched to a right-handed whip
inside that marker and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. GOT GOLD went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was
asked while three wide on the far turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and tired. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE went around the first turn in
the two path while directly behind the winner, was rated just off the pace, came up empty along the rail on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the
final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
WOOD BEE bumped with a rival at the start, was kept in the four path by the leader on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the
three path early on the far turn, floated five wide while taking the lead at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, tipped out a path
after turning into the stretch then came under a right-handed whip, switched to a left-handed whip in pursuit of the runner-up outside the furlong marker,
swapped back to a right-handed whip while gaining outside the sixteenth-pole and got up in the final five strides under good handling. ILLUSIONISTA came
outward just after the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, ranged up four wide early on the far turn, was asked inside the
three-eighths, made a bid while carried six wide at the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, drifted in while moving clear under a
left-handed whip in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed whip at the furlong marker, shortened stride into the final sixteenth, swapped back to a
left-handed whip late and was overtaken while well clear for the place. SENSE OF SELF broke out and bumped with a foe, moved out into the first turn,
rounded that bend in the three path, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths,
lost the lead shortly thereafter, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. DIAMOND AND SILKS had a shoe repaired in the paddock, saved ground on the
first turn, settled at the rear of the quartet while on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, moved to the two path early on the far turn then
the three path outside the five-sixteenths, was put to the whip shortly thereafter and failed to respond.

Footnotes
V TACH M. D. exchanged a very light brush at the start and readily sped clear under his own volition, was guided to the rail up the backstretch, extended
the margin leaving the turn and into upper stretch, the rider looked back for competition at the furlong marker and merely raised the reins a couple times
throughout the length of the stretch while winning handily. SPARKYS SURPRISE settled mid-pack shifting in to enter the turn in the two path, angled out
about the three-sixteenths, secured the place while no late threat to the winner. DRUNKEN FRIDAYS was outpaced early racing inside, went on or just off
the rail through the turn inside a rival and coming out to about the three path by the top of the stretch, angled in at the three-sixteenths as the
aforementioned rival moved out and could not get past that one for the place. CARTER CAT broke outwardly, raced outside a rival in the three path through
the turn, was guided about six wide in upper stretch and ran on. HEART WARRIOR exchanged a light brush with the winner at the start, switched outside
that rival one path up the backstretch, went four to five deep through the turn in pursuit and came up empty in the lane. WORTHY switched outside the
winner as that one moved to the rail midway up the backstretch, was encouraged along at that juncture chasing from about the three path into and on the
turn, faded in the lane.

Footnotes
MAGIC VOW went five wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, chased the runner-up under a
drive into upper stretch, gained the lead coming to the furlong marker then edged clear under strong urging. JUS DREAM BIG went four wide on the first
turn, moved to the lead passing the three-quarter pole, set the pace while outside of foes, vied in the two path while just outside of MUCH CLASS on the far
turn, bumped hard with that foe and was turned sideways at the five-sixteenths, was set down in upper stretch, lost the lead near the furlong marker and
was outfinished while just able to get the place. LUCKY ANDY broke out and brushed with a foe, angled in nearing the first turn then was taken in hand,
raced inside to the two path on that bend under restraint, was hard held while rated off the pace, came under urging while three then four wide on the far
turn, gained five wide into the stretch, chased outside under a drive into the final furlong and was out-kicked then just missed the place while well clear for
the show. LOUISIANA MOON went two then three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was urged
along while four then five wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. MUCH CLASS brushed with a rival at the
start, raced in the three path on the first turn, moved up between horses near the five-eighths pole to contest the pace, was asked leaving the backstretch,
vied against the rail while inside of JUS DREAM BIG under urging on the far turn, bumped hard with that rival at the five-sixteenths then checked and had
nothing left. LOOKING FOR BULL set the early pace on the inside, lost the lead early on the backstretch, dropped back near the seven-sixteenths and
faded. Following a stewards' inquiry, JUS DREAM BIG was disqualified from second and placed fifth for interference at the five-sixteenths.

Footnotes
QUIKFAST N AHURRY was forced out just a bit at the start, settled between runners into the first turn easing back and shifting in from the three to the two
path on that bend emerging near the rail for the run up the backstretch, took closer order heading to the far turn and switched out a path before entering the
far turn, tracked behind foes two to three deep on that bend, found room in upper stretch, gained slowly and steadily inside foes to strike the front nearing
the sixteenth pole and edged clear thereafter. GILDED APPLE was lightly brushed at the break but still forwardly placed inside heading to the first turn
moving out a path late on that bend, switched out early up the backstretch to stalk from outside about four to five deep, edged closer commencing a bid still
four to five wide on the far turn, asked for run by upper stretch taking a narrow lead past the three-sixteenths but was overtaken nearing the sixteenth pole.
GREAT IN RED stalked the pacesetter outside four wide on the first turn and up the backstretch, edged closer four wide on the far turn coming in a bit while
making a bid near the five-sixteenths and drawing on even terms, was in contention between runners in mid-stretch but lacked the needed late kick.
STREETTALKINHOTTIE brushed the outside rival at the start, raced off the leaders in the two path moving out a path midway on the first turn, raced in
behind off the fence before moving in a bit as the eventual winner moved out leaving the backstretch, continued in the two to three path on the far turn but
made no bids. MY BABY BELE was just a bit fractious in the gate then broke inwardly correcting to move out a stride later, moved forward to set the pace
racing in the three path then the two path through the first turn, was in the clear up the backstretch, challenged by outside rivals on the far turn still racing a
path removed from the rail then gave way in upper stretch. MONEY FOR MAMA raced outside foes four wide through the first turn in the back part of the
field, continued four wide into the far turn and asked for run three furlongs out, moved in a path and had no response to said asking and was empty
thereafter. LIL ASHLEY B. was forced out just a hair at the break, was unhurried at the rear racing just off the fence, moved nearer the rail entering the far
turn and was never near enough to threaten.

MAYBE I CAN was hustled to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a rival, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was set down at the
three-sixteenths then shook clear, responded well in the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. NEWELLTON settled at the rear of the field,
raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths, gained between
horses into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy for the place. WHIMSICAL MUSE broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was coaxed along
while inside to the two path on the turn, came under stronger encouragement into upper stretch, was put to the whip inside the three-sixteenths and finished
with late energy to garner the show. GLAMOUR GAL settled on the outside, was urged along while three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the
stretch, angled out under a drive near the three-sixteenths and improved position. DESTINY'S DARLING moved out while off the pace, chased four wide on
the turn, was asked for more outside the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. MALIBU DAWN was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two
path on the turn, altered course twice from the quarter-pole to the three-sixteenths while lacking room, dropped back under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. HAVE NO FEAR moved up on the outside to dispute the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch
and tired. SAVVY ALLY settled off the early pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went three to four wide on the turn, moved out under a drive
in upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
COOL QUARTET was urged at the break to gain a forward position, switched outside the leader to stalk from the three path into the turn, began to edge
closer leaving that bend, took over just about the three-sixteenths and edged clear by mid-stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging through late stretch
but held sway. CANIHAVEITLIKETHAT bumped the outside foe at the start, stalked the leaders in behind but off the fence going in the four path through the
turn, was slowly gaining late but was not enough. TOMMYTOSHORT raced mid-pack between rivals into the turn, went in the four path through that bend,
ran on in the lane to get up for show honors over RUNAWAY WIND, who was lightly bumped at the start but quickly moved clear and angled in, dictated
terms from the two path into and on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch and steadily weakened thereafter. NICE OF ME raced outside foes mid-pack
five wide through the turn and encouraged along leaving that bend but failed to rally. HE'S THE SOUPERWON tracked the leaders from off the fence in
about the three path heading into the turn, shifted in to save ground through that turn on or just off the rail, came out a bit for the stretch run but offered no
late threat. LAUGHING BOBBY moved in after the start while in the rear half of the field, raced between rivals two to three wide heading into the turn,
continued in about the two path through that bend and was never a threat. SLICK DUDE was ridden along early at the rear, went in the three to four path on
the turn still trailing but moving outside a foe while swinging six deep coming past the quarter pole but failed to threaten. TEXAS TROUBADOR broke just a
bit awkwardly and was urged forward, chased inside briefly then dropped back and faded. ASHLEE'S REWARD raced inside rivals up the backstretch, lost
ground and position leaving the backstretch and switched out to the two to three path, was not a threat.

Footnotes
LONELY PRIVATE chased the pace on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, gained five wide into upper stretch, took the lead passing the
three-sixteenths, was put to a right-handed whip while moving clear outside the furlong marker then drifted in, switched to a left-handed whip outside the
sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. SCHMOOZIN was urged along on the outside, dropped from the three path to the rail early on the turn, saved
ground from that point into the stretch, moved out under a drive at the furlong marker and finished with good courage for the place. DIGITAL STAR was well
placed just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, was ridden along in the two path on the turn then driven three wide into the stretch, moved
out under a drive around the three-sixteenths then drifted out some near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while able to get the show.
DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS was urged along at the rear, moved out leaving the backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, drifted in suddenly near the
furlong marker and failed to threaten. BREEZY MONEY was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and
gave way. HURRICANE PARTY dropped back early then settled in the middle of the field, was urged along while four to five wide on the turn, moved out
under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. MUSCADINE was urged along near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn, took an awkward
stride near the rail in upper stretch, moved out inside the furlong marker then drifted out from that point to the wire and was no factor.
