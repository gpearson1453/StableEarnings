Footnotes
BOLT quickly scampered to the front clearing to the two-path, moved inside turning for home and held on under a drive. CALL CURT absorbed a solid bump
from CHARLY JESUS' TEAM at the start and was well back early, cut the corner coming off the turn, moved out through the furlong grounds and closed in
steadily outside rivals. TEMPESTA raced in the middle of the field early, came four wide into the stretch, finished willingly between the top two finishers,
then had the rider dismount on the gallop-out and was escorted back by an outrider. DANZO chased outside the winner to deep stretch, and was outkicked
for larger shares. NEXTSTOP POKIPC lacked room between TEMPESTA and MONETIZED at the start and was off last, circled five wide approaching the
stretch, and gained too late on the far outside. SULTANNES CROWN had the two-path on the turn, and lacked a solid response. PUMP ROOM gained
mildly along the rail around the turn, but flattened out. ALITE chased along the inside, and faded after three furlongs. MONETIZED was bumped solidly by
MIA'S EXTORTIONIST and forced in a path at the start, saved ground on the turn and was never close. CHARLY JESUS' TEAM broke out giving CALL
CURT a solid bump at the start, and was through early. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST broke in bumping MONETIZED at the start, and was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
ROAD TO PEACE took over the lead shortly after the start and held a narrow margin over KING WADE, held firm over challenger's around the turn then
widened advantage top of the lane and remained clear under steady encouragement. SWEET GIANT steadied along the rail in early stages and remained a
bit tight until the turn, was under a drive two wide at the quarter pole, remained in steady pursuit along inside in stretch run and prevailed for place. WAR
ACT steadily advanced into closer contention down the backstretch then circled up into strong contention near the quarter pole, hustled along five wide
entering the lane and stayed on with response to clear show. PINK LEMONADE clipped heels after the start, recovered quickly then steadied repeatedly
through the backstretch, got clear and roused around the turn then flattened in the lane. KING WADE was forwardly placed racing in striking range of the
leader, could not reach ROAD TO PEACE around the turn then gave way in the lane. TRINNI TRICKS chased the pace racing in early contention then
flattened near mid-turn and offered no late rally. BRAVELY BOLD raced off the early pace, moved into stretch six wide and failed to move into contention.
SEVERUS showed response through the backstretch then faded around the turn. OLD NEWS hustled along under steady pressure through early stages but
failed to move into contention then faltered on the turn.

Footnotes
DIXIE MO was outrun to the stretch toward the inside, settled suddenly just past the furlong marker and charged through between horses in the two-path to
be along in time. PALACE TWO STEP hit the left side of the gate and brushed with SECRET MISS at the start, stayed in range early two wide behind the
leaders, altered course tipping just outside SECRET MISS in deep stretch, finished well outside DIXIE MO but was edged to the wire by that one. SECRET
MISS brushed with PALACE TWO STEP at the start, chased outside FLASH MONEY for three furlongs, challenged from the top of the lane to deep stretch
and was outfinished from both flanks by the top two. PICK UP THE FONE raced three wide around the turn, and could only gain mildly late on the far
outside. FLASH MONEY sprinted clear early, got collared through mid stretch and weakened on the rail. TANGLED TALE saved ground on the turn, and
failed to menace. ONE HOT DRAMA trailed throughout and was not pressured when hopelessly beaten.

Footnotes
LORILOUPIES roused forward to apply pace pressure to UNCAPTURED RUBY in opening stages, raced in aim under slight restraint then cleared on top
still unasked near three eighths pole, let out a notch and drew off to a commanding lead, saved ground turning for home and remained well clear under
steady urging. FANCIFIED hustled along the inside down the backstretch, angled out leaving the quarter pole then stayed on with response three wide in
stretch run and finished second best. COMMANDING LADY raced four wide leaving the backstretch then chased around the turn, remained in steady
pursuit along the outside in stretch and prevailed for a share. EBONY BAY lacked early speed and raced in the last flight along the inside, angled out around
the turn then shifted out wider upper stretch and gained position. TREVESS hustled along and raced between foes at the half mile marker, chased two wide
around the turn then flattened out upper stretch. SHINING COLORS raced off the clear top two leaders through early stages, chased on into stretch run then
faded near the furlong marker. NO BULL JACK got bumped off stride at the start, moved inside to save ground late backstretch then shifted back out around
the turn, raced wide entering top stretch then lugged in under left handed pressure upper stretch and offered no late bid. FLORADO bumped with foe at the
start, raced off the pace and wide into stretch to no avail. LUCY'S INTEREST broke out and bumped with foe at the start, lacked speed and raced near the
rear, moved into upper stretch three wide and failed to move into contention. LADY LARKO bumped with foe at the start, hustled along the outside and
failed to gain a threatening position. UNCAPTURED RUBY broke alertly from the outside, cleared on top and crossed over to the inside, quickly came under
pressure from eventual winner, was no match for rival past three eighths pole, chased on around the turn then tired in the drive. FASHION FRAME dropped
back after the opening quarter, pulled up in stretch then walked off after the race.

Footnotes
MACHIAVELLI saved ground unhurried for six furlongs, moved off the rail past the quarter-pole, tipped to the far outside for the stretch drive and closed
relentlessly to overhaul MONTATHAM in time. MONTATHAM contested the pace inside PREACHER POWER for six furlongs, disposed of that one into the
stretch and moved well clear, but could not contain the top one in the last 70 yards. BYE BYE MAN hugged the rail on the turns, moved out through the
furlong grounds and closed ground under mild hand urging. LUCKY MIKE followed behind the leaders positioned outside JUSTCALLMENORMAN for six
furlongs, and was one-paced through the lane. VOLUBILE raced in the second flight two wide for six furlongs, lodged a mild bid in the three-path through
mid stretch, but flattened out. PREACHER POWER alternated for the lead outside MONTATHAM from the outset, and gave way turning for home.
JUSTCALLMENORMAN tracked the leaders inside early, and faded after six furlongs. The stall between BYE BYE MAN and VOLUBILE was left empty.

TOP SEED was off to a good start and positioned just of DARK WEB in opening stages, forced the pace to the turn then dueled for the lead racing two wide,
continued to battle outside of DARK WEB through stretch run, dug in determinedly and edged away in the final sixteenth. DARK WEB held a slim lead over
TOP SPEED in opening stages then dueled for command around the turn, battled back gamely along the rail past the furlong marker then failed to match in
the final sixteenth. PARKLAND STRONG raced in a forward position along the inside then switched out a path and given cue midway around the turn,
remained in pursuit three wide under a drive through stretch run and cleared show. GHOST ON A MISSION was ridden along in opening stages not far off
the early pace then lost kick and weakened near the half mile marker, shifted to the inside upper stretch and gained position without threatening.
ANNUALIZED raced in range two wide through early stages, failed to move on under a ride on the turn then faded along in the lane. PROPENSITY raced
along the outside not far off the early pace, remained a strong contender off top pair at the five sixteenths pole then lacked response when prompted and
dropped back. PUNCHLINE was off slow at the start, raced in the back near the inside and had no response.

Footnotes
HOTTY TODDY trailed for six furlongs in the two-path, angled four wide getting in gear leaving the far turn, and closed steadily outside to overtake
BAHAMA KITTEN in time. The latter set the pace inside, remained clear to deep stretch but could not hang on. SPICY NELLY saved ground throughout,
loomed a threat turning for home but lacked a solid response. ISADORABLE AIDA prompted the pace outside BAHAMA KITTEN for six furlongs, and had
no late bid. RETRO STREET was three wide early in the second flight, and did not menace through an even effort. MUCH ABOUT IT stayed in range three
wide to the top of the stretch, and weakened. VINYARDNINA saved ground for six furlongs, moved out in the stretch and made no headway. VENEZUELAN
FOREVER was reserved early in the two-path, and came up empty when roused. CAPE MIST was four wide on the first turn, moved inward and had
nothing when roused on the far turn.

Footnotes
R BOY EVENS sped to the lead and angled closer to the inside then held firm around the turn, came out turning for home and widened to a clear advantage
then kept to task. BOURBON CURRENCY raced off the early pace and prompted two wide near the quarter pole, gathered momentum under steady
pressure and finished with solid response for place. WONDER IN raced widest in opening stages and continued to chase along the outside entering top
stretch, stayed on with response in the final furlong and produced a mild rally for show. ISLAND TAP hustled up from the get-go and raced in range around
the turn, continued a four to five wide bid in stretch run then evened out in late stages. AWESOME ACTION was away in good order then dropped inside
and chased the top pair around the turn, continued a bid up the inside upper stretch then flattened in late stages. SMELL OF ROSES raced off the pace
along the inside, switched out three to four wide and needed more for late Impact. LOUIE'S KINGDOM was forwardly placed and chased the leader around
the turn then weakened in the lane. SUMMER BEACH raced in the back then six wide upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. BIG SPENDER briefly in a
bit tight along rail early, failed to advance position under pressure around the turn then gave way.

SMASH FACTOR broke alertly and moved inside with the lead, set a pressured pace hounded by CONQUEST DAY, dug in through a long drive and was
edging away late. CONQUEST DAY got sandwiched at the break between CARPE OMNIOUS and MYSTIC LANCELOT, hustled up to press SMASH
FACTOR from outside, reached even terms leaving the turn, was outdueled through the furlong grounds and held the place. CARPE OMNIOUS broke out
bumping CONQUEST DAY at the start, then bumped lightly with LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE, was ridden along for response heading into the turn without
making headway, had the two-path into the lane and gained belatedly. MYSTIC LANCELOT bumped with CONQUEST DAY at the start, tracked the battling
leaders in the clear three wide to the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. LIVEYOURBEASTLIFE broke out and bumped lightly with CARPE OMNIOUS after the
start, came three wide into the stretch and posed no threat with a mild gain. SMALL REASON became edgy in the gate prior to the start, and was outrun
inside.

YEAR around the far turn, continued a steady effort through the lane and secured place. RAGS FOR BRITCHES raced off the pace then responded when
prompted and gained position around the far turn, kept under a drive five wide into the lane and gained a share. WINNING FACTOR rated near mid-range
through early stages, launched a bid around the far turn, kept on with response upper stretch then flattened in final furlong. EXTRA EXTRA got bumped
then forced to steady at the start, was reserved racing in the back then raced wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. RIGHT ON KID settled off the early
pace, was put to a drive five wide entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. LONGSHIPS took a solid bump at the start then raced off the pace and saved
ground down the backstretch, was put to a drive three wide entering the lane and failed to move on. EMBELLISHER set the pace down the backstretch, got
collared by winner near the three eighths pole then steadily faded. KINGS HIGHWAY settled and saved ground down the backstretch then failed to respond
around the far turn. CASTILLETE broke out and bumped with rival at the start, raced off the pace and failed to respond when called upon. COOL HAND
COOP secured inside position and stalked in close contention through early stages, ridden up the inside then steadied slightly late turn and dropped back.
IMPERIAL GREATNESS was forwardly placed through early stages then quickly retreated on the final turn. Due to a timer malfunction the race was hand
timed.
