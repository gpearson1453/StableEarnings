Footnotes
CHAYSENBRYN , bumped at the break, settled off the pace while between runners early, advanced to the inside of a rival nearing the lane, worked
between foes when gathering momentum past the furlong grounds, shifted out to continue progress on her left lead while under left handed pressure,
collared the leader inside the sixteenth pole, forged to command late and held sway. ELOQUENT LADY , away alertly, prompted the pace two to three wide,
was put to solid urging past the five sixteenths, came four wide for the drive, moved to a slim lead in mid stretch, edged clear, dug in when confronted but
wasn't quite good enough late. DID I STUTTER , bumped and squeezed back at the break, recovered and edged up between horses, chased three wide
mid turn, angled in, advanced to loom a danger in mid stretch but failed to seriously sustain. DEVILISH AFFAIR rated outside rivals while off the pace into
the turn, circled the turn, five wide, moved up in mid stretch but flattened out. ROCKIN ANNA ROLLIN broke outward and bumped a rival, straightened and
sped clear, set a rated pace towards the inside, was taken three wide into the lane and put to pressure, lost the lead a furlong out and weakened in the final
seventy yards. BOTTLE COURAGE , off the pace while saving ground, angled out for the drive but lacked a solid kick. SECRET ARCHANGEL , between
runners early, raced three to four wide around the turn and weakened. PEARLYVILLE chased in the two path, faltered mid turn and was eased in the final
three sixteenths.

Footnotes
PRETTY GOOD YEAR rated inside, edged up nearing the half mile marker, had aim off of the duel that developed leaving the far turn, swung out five wide
and was put to solild pressure approaching the stretch, ranged up under left handed asking to take command outside MORETTI leaving the eighth pole,
battled with that one for a bit then edged clear under a steady hand ride. MORETTI was guided three wide when going clear into the first turn, set a slower
pace off the inside, was joined by SPARTY near the far turn, sparred inside that rival as the pace quickened past the three eighths, held a slim advantage
under a hearty ride into the lane, could not resist the winner past the furlong grounds, faded late but remained clear for the place. OVER SENSUAL settled
in the clear near the five eighths marker, moved up wide into the far turn, chased but lacked a solid finish. SPARTY , four wide into the first turn, tracked
MORETTI, bid outside that one approaching the far turn, gained a short lead while dueling mid way on the final turn, relinquished command soon into the
lane then weakened in the final furlong. CROUCHELLI saved some ground early and failed to menace. JUMP JIVE AN WAIL stalked outside a rival, failed
to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BODEFLEX vied two wide down the backstretch, cleared and angled in near the half-mile pole, set a clear pace along the rail and held well clear under a
drive. CAREY TIMES vied inside of the winner early, steadied nearing the half-mile pole, angled out to stalk two wide and finished willingly while unable to
threaten the winner. JUSTWAVEANDSMILE lagged well back inside, swung out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. TWIXY CAT chased the pace
three wide, came four wide into the lane, continued on the left lead and came up empty. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE saved ground in range, angled three
wide to bid between foes near the quarter pole but faded through the lane. WHISKEY AND YOU lacked speed while racing two wide, angled widest turning
for home and lacked a response.

COFFEE PLEASE rated kindly, angled out a bit past the three quarter pole, moved menacingly and under confident handling mid turn, took command four
wide outside LEADING MAN entering the lane, drifted in a bit before opening up under left handed rousing then continued to widen while kept alert.
PERFECT HEIR , off the pace and between foes early, circled four to five wide into the lane, edged up past mid stretch and continued willingly while gaining
the place. LEADING MAN sped clear early, set a strong pace while getting out some near the five eighths, dropped in a bit near the far turn, saw his lead
dwindle mid turn, ceded to the winner approaching the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DAPER'S DRINK , off the pace, moved up between rivals
mid turn but failed to sustain in the drive. SPIRITUS bobbled at the break, lost ground four to five wide and failed to menace. THEKIDSBACK lacked speed
while saving ground into the turn, swung wide for the drive but failed to respond. BLADE O saved ground and faltered. BERRINCHE vied outside a rival,
dropped in past the five eighths, chased and faltered past the three eighths.

DEGROM stalked the pace four wide around the first turn, bid in the three path around the far turn, seized command near the three-sixteenths pole and
drew off under a drive. TATTOOED settled off the pace along the inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. KING KOA set the
pace in the two path, was collared in upper stretch, weakened and lost second late. BOBBY G raced off the pace three wide, inched closer under urging
while still three wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. TAPPIN CAT had early speed three wide between foes, angled to the rail nearing
the far turn and faded. BRIGHTON LANE steadied midway around the first turn, saved ground and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BUDDY'S RUN stalked the pace three wide, responded and moved to engage the leader soon into the lane, gained command a furlong out and drew clear
under a drive. MILITARY HOP rated to the inside of a rival, eased out past the three eighths, raced three to four wide in upper stretch, finished willingly and
was along for the place. ZIGGY MON , quickly went clear, set a rated pace in about the two path, dug in when confronted near the three sixteenths, battled
past mid stretch then faded late. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace, eased out in the drive but lacked a solid bid.
SUCCESSFUL ZIP bobbled at the break, regrouped and moved up three wide, chased and failed to respond. BOZZINI , wide and off the pace, was put to
pressure leaving the far turn but failed to muster up a kick.
