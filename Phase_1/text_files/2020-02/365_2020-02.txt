Footnotes
HERO OF HAVEN prompted the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, dropped inside in upper stretch, was headed by the runner up before the
furlong marker, dug in gamely under a strong hand ride and back back up in time. PAMIR stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the
lead in upper stretch, battled two wide through the final furlong and just failed. ANGEL'S KNIGHT trailed for nearly six furlongs then closed some ground late
in the four path through the stretch. TUBA broke in front, set the pace into the second turn along the inside, had speed until the furlong marker then
weakened. NED DEVINE well placed, failed to respond. JUMPN' JAMES was through after half, stopped and jogged to wire.

Footnotes
TRUE CINDER vied for the lead along the rail into the turn, slipped through to gain command near the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and drew
away late under right handed urging. EMMY'S CANDY never far back, offered a bid four wide into the stretch and finished second best. PAINT DAKOTA bid
three wide on the turn, shifted out near the furlong marker and finished with good courage in the five path. HIDATSA PARK trailed into the stretch then
passed tiring rivals. ALMIGHTY STORM made the lead soon after the start, set the pace in the two path for nearly a half then gradually weakened.
ANNIVERSARY ROSE well placed, failed to respond. MERADA failed to menace.

IMMACULATE HEART unhurried, advanced steadily two wide on the turn and into the stretch, made the lead past the sixteenth pole, the rider lost his whip
fifty yards from the wire and won under a hand ride. ETHEL EILEEN away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. IS THAT
MAGIC never far back, finished determinedly. ROSES FOR MARTINA dropped back from a sharp beginning, swung wide and came on again through the
stretch. WAKEETA chased the pace into the stretch and faded late. VALID INTEREST moved up four wide on the turn then leveled off. PEBBLE SLINGER
was no factor. CELEBRATEME was no threat. GLORIOUS FREEDOM had brief speed. SHEFLEW was hustled from the gate, steadied along the rail near
the five furlong pole, had speed into the stretch then weakened. ZOE MY LOVE was through after a half. PURDY BIRDIE had speed into the turn then gave
way.

Footnotes
DANCIN' ROSIE matched strides for the lead between horses early, dropped back a bit and dropped inside on the turn, came on again through deep stretch
and proved best in a stretch long drive. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE battled for the early lead three wide, shook clear on the turn, set the pace until deep
stretch then couldn't handle the winner in the final stages. FORTUNATE GINA stalked the pace and finished with good courage in the five path. CUT
RATES never far back, went evenly in the three path. STORMY JUSTICE failed to menace. SINCERE DEVOTION passed tiring rivals. FLASHY G was no
factor. GYDA DDAWN was no threat. JEZABEL'S CHARM advanced in the five path on the turn then came up empty. ANGEL'S STORMIN was through
early. CELTIC DREAM showed little. OPULENT contested the early lead along the inside, stopped on the turn and jogged to the wire.
