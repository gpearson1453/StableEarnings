sent clear soon after, stayed out from the rail around the turn and widened under brisk urging. FAST INTENTIONS chased outside the winner in the three
path into the final furlong then weakened. ECLIPTICALS DANCER hit the inside door while slow leaving the gate, lagged early, raced wide around the turn
and outfinished tired ones while no threat. SNIPER SIS wasn't far back in the three path into the turn then stopped in the lane. FOXY HIYA raced the three
path into the turn, angled in sharply approaching the lane, angled out sharply in early stretch and failed to menace. PAJAMA TOPS was outrun. DANCE
LIGHTLY came in, bumped with the winner leaving the gate, fell back, was hustled inside early, began to fade entering the turn then stopped. Post time was
delayed seven minutes with the riders left on their horses.

Footnotes
MISS DILLINGHAM was bumped soundly by an inner rival, forced into her outer foe, and was jostled between them twice at the start, advanced out of last
between horses down the backstretch, split foes two wide at the five sixteenth pole to be loaded behind the leader at the quarter pole, angled inward turning
for home as that foe drifted out, and surged up the rail to draw off through the final furlong. GUILTYWITHANEXCUSE rallied four wide and outside of horses
around the turn to make a bid for the lead turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rival at the furlong pole, and held place. VENUS RAMEY stalked
three wide, but got outmoved between horses at the quarter pole, shifted to the five path under a drive, and made a late surge, but missed place.
WARFRONT PEACE RVF trailed early on, shifted to the four path into the turn, then to the six path turning for home, and offered a mild kick to pass tired
rivals for a minor reward. AUSSIE MIST bumped an outer foe at the start, vied for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.
GAMBIT'S GIRL set the pace along the inside, held a lead while drifting to the two path turning for home, but by doing so allowed racing room for MISS
DILLINGHAM, was surpassed by that foe in upper stretch, and subsequently weakened. ZIPPY JO raced close to the pace inside of rivals early on, but
faltered into the turn, and weakened thereafter.

BELLOWS settled inside, began to advance into the far turn, angled out, vied three wide into the stretch, moved clear into the final sixteenth and widened
under urging. MAJESTIC CALLING was unhurried two wide, angled to the outside while making a run in early stretch but lacked the needed closing
response. BIG CITY BLUES made the early pace inside, was displaced nearing the end of the backstretch, regained command midway on the final turn
then weakened in the drive. THE ACCUSER chased early, was sent between horses to a short lead nearing the end of the backstretch, remained prominent
inside the winner into midstretch then weakened. HERE COMES GARY had his head turned to the inside at the break, raced wide around the first turn,
advanced outside early on the backstretch to join the leaders, remained prominent three wide in the first flight around the final turn, ran out entering the
stretch and stopped. STONE CRAZY stayed inside, failed to menace and was eased up late. HASTA AHORA was outrun. RUN FOR ZACH was close up
while three wide around the first turn, stayed close for about five furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
LOOKIN AT BLESSING shifted three wide from midpack into the turn, rallied to bid for the lead turning for home, dueled as his inner foe dug in, but edged
away from that rival approaching the sixteenth pole, and held RYDELL at by to the wire. RYDELL had an awkward start between horses, raced far off of the
collapsing pace, advanced three to four wide around the far turn to produce a rally outside of rivals through the lane, but was fended off by LOOKING AT
BLESSING through the final sixteenth. HASHTAG WINNING was fractious in the gate before it opened, stalked along the inside early on, shifted off the rail
into the far turn to split horses, then came into the lane in the three path between the leaders, but lacked a kick to split them. SUPER VISION stalked three
wide through the first turn, made a two wide bid for the lead into the far turn, forged a lead away from his weakening inner rival, but was met with a
challenge from LOOKIN AT BLESSING at the quarter pole, dug in through the lane while on his left lead, but was headed by that foe approaching the
furlong pole, and weakened in the late stages. RICK'S SURPRISE was a bit antsy in the gate, came out a step slow and was pinched between horses, then
trailed the field around both turns and passed eased foes through the lane. TUFF DUFF vied two wide through the first turn, inherited a lead from his inner
weakening foe approaching the five furlong pole, but came under a drive to hold an advantage into the far turn, failed to do so, weakened, and was eased
through the lane. COUNTRY SQUIRE set the pace along the inside through the first turn, but weakened at the eleven sixteenths pole, steadily faded
thereafter, and was eased through the lane.

DI wasn't far back outside early, rallied four wide around the turn, took over from the outside just before five furlongs, drew clear leaving the furlong grounds
then held under steady urging. CUCKOO FORCONONUTS began a run into the turn, steadied in tight two wide between rivals leaving the quarter pole,
angled to the outside entering the final furlong and closed a gap in the final yards. RAG TOP broke slowly, lagged into the stretch then made a belated run
between rivals. CHARITY STRIPE bobbled leaving the gate, was sent between rivals to press the early leader, moved two wide to the front early on the turn
then weakened in the drive. TAKE ME HOME was rated outside early, steadied in tight three wide between rivals leaving the quarter pole then faded in the
lane. SWEET DANCER was fractious in the gate then was outrun. LITTLEBITALILY opened a short lead soon after the break, angled to the rail on the turn
then stopped in the lane. CACTUS COPY was fractious in the gate, advanced inside early, faded on the turn then stopped in the lane.

HIDE THE CANDY set the pace on a clear lead in the two path around the turn, and held sway safely through the lane under driving pressure. FOREST
PARK trailed early on, advanced to a two wide stalking position between horses around the turn, shifted in turning for home to make a rail bid, but was
unable to catch the strong finishing leader. OWIN chased the loose leader from the three path around the turn, but failed to make headway through the lane
after losing place passing the furlong pole. PURE SPRING retreated to trail the field in the two path into the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and
passed tired rivals without threatening. SENOR RICCI hopped at the start and was off slowly, advanced subtly in the four path around the turn, but
weakened through the lane. MANATEE stalked along the inside, but was driven to keep pace into the turn, failed to do so, and weakened.

Footnotes
ALLTHERIGHTBULLETS set the pace inside of FIREINTHEPULPIT around the turn while staying a bit off of the rail, dug in as that foe made a bid turning
for home, dueled gamely, and prevailed in the late stages. FIREINTHEPULPIT prompted the pace setter while being kept in the three path by that rival, bid
for the lead turning for home and commenced a duel, but got outdueled. OFFENDER stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch to be
outside of the leaders, but had no kick, and weakened on his left lead. JASPER K was bumped by an inner foe at the start, saved ground while trailing
around the turn, and made mild rally without threatening. BUILT BETTER tracked from midpack in the two path, but failed to menace. THE LAST
YANNUZZI raced outside of rivals in the four path, but weakened turning for home.
