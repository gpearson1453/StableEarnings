Footnotes
STONE BANDIT set the pace in four path, drifted out leaving the turn and held on. OFF DUTY, just off the rail and just off pace, closed with a rush and
finished a dead heat with NIKO STRONG. NIKO STRONG stalked lapped on winner, also drifted out leaving the turn, battled gamely to the wire and finished
on even terms with OFF DUTY. HE'S GOT TALENT, three wide and just off the pace, finished well. DRAXHALL WOODS WAS carried out a bit early then
was steered to the rail and failed to menace. WAITIN ON ONE broke slowly, raced between second flight then tired. SUNSHINE WILD, fractious in the gate,
lunged slightly breaking slowly then was never a factor. REFUNDED, very wide throughout, was no factor.

Footnotes
OFFERHECANTREFUSE, racing in the five path while unhurried, remained out and launched his bid on the final turn, took the lead leaving furlong ground
and while drifting out, drew off. MUNTAHEZ, in the three path while unhurried, split rivals into stretch and gained place. LEGENDARY JACK, a bit rank
under rating early, saved ground, steadied near the quarter pole and was up for show. ALWAYS FREE raced three wide rounding the first turn and into
backstretch, moved closer to the rail setting the pace and had little left. CATAPULT JACK raced wide, offered a mild bid on the final turn then gave way.
BRADSHAW chased the leader racing from the four path then tired. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN, between top flight, had little left. DE PUNTA A PUNTA saved
ground and stopped.
