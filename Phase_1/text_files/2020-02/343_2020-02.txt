Footnotes
DAVID'S GEM broke in at the start bumping FIRST DEGREE into THIN SPACES, raced latched on the leader early on in the two path before advancing to
take over narrow command near the nine-sixteenths, showed the way through the turn between rivals both applying some pressure from their flanking
positions, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under
a near sided stick and shied out a sixteenth out before being corrected and held well to prevail clear at the finish. FIRST DEGREE got bumped at the start
by DAVID'S GEM who broke inwards and in turn bumped THIN SPACES, raced briefly in the two path before tipping three wide five and a half furlongs out
placed to coaxing to advance and stack outside the top pair, prompted the leader from the outside through the turn coaxed along, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home while safe for the place honors. CAUSE I SAID SO bobbled at the start getting away last but conceding at
most about two lengths to the front, chased four wide under coaxing from the get go, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to
be along well clear of the rest for the show honors. FULFILL showed the way early on along the inside before being headed for command near the
nine-sixteenths, prompted the leader along his inside through the turn put to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. THIN SPACES brushed the off side stall at the start getting away a beat slow, then got bumped by FIRST DEGREE due to pressure from
DAVID'S GEM and was forced to steady briefly conceding an additional two lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased just off the
inside down the backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside placed to coaxing half a mile from home, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
TWO GRACES recovered shortly after some bumping at the start to assume the advantage, glided into the two path, showed the way, rated along, got cued
up spinning into the lane, lengthened away, kept busy to the end. LADY CAT underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, fanned out five to six wide racing
down the lane, becoming the widest of all, rallied well enough to procure the place. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH departed the backstretch from path three, was
already been asked for more by by midpoint on the turn, stepped into the stretch and lacked a solid closing punch. SANDER'S EMPIRE raced three to four
wide after making contact with the winner at the start, failed to make its presence felt. LA RUBIA tracked the winner from along the inside route, was put to a
ride on the turn, stayed within striking distance for three-quarters and gave way. EMERALD ICE squeezed after coming out of the gate in an awkward
manner, cut over to the inside and went on to save ground to no avail.

Footnotes
FOREVER WICKED five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
knocking heads with MY SACRED PLACE through the final furlong issuing a challenge to FORT MCHENRY, took over command seventy yards from home
and prevailed on the wire. MY SACRED PLACE coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the
inside for home, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe through the final furlong overtaking the leader in tandem seventy yards from home but
was ultimately bested by the top one while up for the place honors. FORT MCHENRY stumbled at the start recovering outwards into TIGER ROAD, showed
the way in hand three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, cut the
corner into upper stretch, dug in coming under threat and lugged in towards the rail scraping the paint and unwilling to switch to the correct lead while under
off sided stick work, clung to the front until displaced seventy yards from home, came under a near sided stick and drifted out late bobbling as he switched
leads in the last jumps to the wire. KING OF AMERICAN devoid of speed, grew detached at the tail of the field while just off the inside, tucked to the rail
through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild kick closing in belatedly for the last
major share. TIGER ROAD bumped at the start by FORT MCHENRY who recovered outwards from a stumble, chased four to five wide down the
backstretch before darting to the two path at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. GLENN
LIKES GIN four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide for home and made no impact.

Footnotes
ABRAXAN established the top in short order, was left unattended showing the way from path two, turned into the lane with none having hitched up, was
switched over to stronger handling at the three-sixteenths pole, responded to remain well in the clear. CAIRO QUEEN took up the chase from midpack on
the backstretch, angled over to the inside route at the top of the turn, effecting MINIT MAUS enough so as to cause its pilot to check the mount, tracked the
front runners afterwards hand urged, tipped back into the two path at the head of the stretch, rallied for the place. TELETYPE stalked ABRAXAN from the
three path, albeit too far back to apply any real pressure, got set down in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, entered the stretch and was outfinished.
KATHY'S CAUSE kept watch on the winner primarily from the two path, inched over to the rail late on the bend in time to cut the corner into the stretch,
weakened in the last sixteenth. OUR TICKET travelled two to three wide on the turn, angled into path four spinning into the lane, lacked the necessary
response. MOON HEIST guided over to the inside after losing her footing springing from the starting gate, faltered off the ground-saving journey that
followed. MINIT MAUS yanked over to the rail after the field had been sent off and running, got checked when cut off by a maneuvering CAIRO QUEEN at
the top of the turn, never made her presence while falling back steadily afterwards.

Footnotes
SHADOW RIDER four to five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, went three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch overthrowing the leader in tandem with ORPHEUS, dueled through the length of the stretch with that rival and was just up to prevail
on the wire. ORPHEUS (ARG) coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch taking over command, dug in dueling through the length of the stretch clinging to the
lead with the aforementioned foe and was nailed and bested at the finish. AUTOSTRADE three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. MONTELEONE coaxed from the gate, raced five wide in
closest aim of the leader, had that rival float outwards approaching the half mile pole and was briefly carried six wide into the turn before tucking to the four
path as GUNS OF STEEL tucked three wide, assumed the front with seven-sixteenths to go and angled inwards to the two path near the five-sixteenths
under his own power and unasked, spun just off the inside for home being flashed the stick to the off side and was overhauled straightened away, folded,
then continued under his own power to the finish striding poorly while flashed the stick to the off side. HARDCORE FOLKLORE seven paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
GUNS OF STEEL coaxed from the gate, showed brief speed three wide down the backstretch, began to drift out near the half mile pole and went five wide
into the turn carrying MONTELEONE six wide before tucking to the three path when succumbing on the lead with seven-sixteenths to go, retreated to the
rear through the bend and went four wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
HAY FIELD kept watch on the pace from path three on the backstretch, slid into the two path at the top of the turn, went on to apply some pressure on the
second place finisher, spun into the lane, was given her cue challenging in earnest at the three-sixteenths pole, out-dueled the second place finisher during
the ensuing furlong then edged away. PUFFERY went at it with PRAIRIE FIRE from the outside proceeding along the backstretch, put away that foe and
moved much closer to the raill at the top of the turn, gained no respite with a dispute with the eventual winner having gotten ignited instead, raced on near
terms with the opponent throughout the trip on the bend, got asked for more cutting the corner into the lane, relinquished at the furlong grounds, fought
onward until right around the sixteenth pole, weakened but easily salvaged second. PRAIRIE FIRE remained stationed along the rail after the field had been
sent off and running, argued for control matched up with PUFFERY during the opening phases, got shaken off nearing the conclusion of the backstretch,
chased the pace thereafter while continuing to take the inside route, stepped into the lane, backed away but held the show. SWEET MEADOW MIST settled
at the back of the pack, was along the inside route travelling on the turn, angled three wide exiting it, lacked the necessary stretch response. FLAT CALM
sighted about two wide and under a ride on the turn, folded.

Footnotes
HARVEY'S LIL GOIL tossed her head and got away awkwardly at the tail of the field, raced four wide through the opening bend before taking to the five
path down the backstretch and settling in range of the front, steadily advanced under her own power to be just off the pace tucked four wide nearing the half
mile pole, advanced on the front three wide into the far turn taking over command at the three-eighths, came under coaxing and began to shake away at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, shied in slightly under an off sided stick while drawing clear, got corrected near the sixteenth marker
under a near sided stick and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. WATER WHITE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing
tipped three wide at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to safely secure the
place honors. FIFTYSHAYS OFGREEN away well, established the front crossing to show the way in hand along the inside through the first turn before
taking to the two path down the backstretch through sensible splits and under no pressure until nearing the half mile pole, tucked inside at that station and
came under pressing from a pair to the outside, got displaced from the front three furlongs out, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in
the final furlong while along clear for the show honors. PERSISTO bobbled at the start, raced forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn before
taking to the three path down the backstretch in closest aim of the leader, began to advance on that rival with nine-sixteenths to go tucking back to the two
path half a mile from home placed to coaxing as the eventual winner ranged up outside, got ridden along in tight between rivals at the three-eighths, spun
just off the inside for home and tired. ANKLE MONITOR just off the inside through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then
two to three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. TRUTH HURTS broke in at the
start and was corrected, raced three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing four wide three
furlongs from home, cornered four wide into upper stretch and tired.

QUICKFLASH assumed the role of primary pursuer after an apparent clean getaway, stalked the runaway leader from afar while travelling two wide, came
up to the three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, overpowered STEP TO THE BANK in short order, drifted about late but held sway. KID D'ORO saved
ground for nearly a half, tipped out for the stretch run, shifted out four to five wide racing down the lane rallying for the place. FREUDIAN FATE came in just
enough so as to get entangled in a three-way bumping incident in the shadow of the starting gate, needed a few jumps to recover and get going, underwent
a two wide pursuit on the turn, angled approximately four wide into the stretch, closed in to be along for the show. APEX PREDATOR took up position in
midpack after the start, raced three wide on the turn, as the outermost of all, commenced the stretch a couple of paths farther off the rail, flattened out
leaving the eighth pole. KINGFISH squeezed at the start, went on to take up the chase from the two path, swung out five wide into the lane, never reached a
contending position. STEP TO THE BANK appearing a bit keen, sprinted off from the competition, showed the way leading by a healthy margin for the
opening half, stepped into the lane, proved powerless when confronted by the top one soon afterwards, steadily backed away after yielding. NARCISSISTIC
checked after being bumped soundly right after the field had been sent on its way failed to menace off the ground-saving journey that followed.
