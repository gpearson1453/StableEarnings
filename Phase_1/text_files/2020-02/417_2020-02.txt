Footnotes
BROWN EYED BOY showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, edged away under a drive to the eighth
pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. BANK GALA four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, got shaken off to the eighth pole, ran on to close the gap to the finish while along for the place honors. GOLCONDA broke out at the start, chased
two then three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, got let out angled five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to
procure the show honors. TRY'N SMART'N UP chased four to five wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, came under coaxing
three furlongs out, swung four wide for home and weakened. TALESPIN chased along the inside placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for
home and tired. UNLIKELY chased just off the inside until tucked to the rail half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and tired. EL SANGRU brushed the near side stall at the start, strode choppy and sluggish soon after the break and was put to a
protective hold growing a bit rank and tossing his head, got pulled up with six and a half furlongs remaining, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
DESERT LIGHTS away cleanly, sat reserved three wide for the much of the opening half, angled one path farther off the rail entering the stretch, kicked into
his best and chopped away at the deficit, ventured onward resolutely stealing away the verdict in the last jump. BUSTIN THE RULES vied for control from
along the inside route, settled into upper stretch before getting turned loose, dug in with good determination only to get nailed right at the wire. TAKE IT TO
SCALE sparred for the advantage from the two path, got staved off but had enough left to salvage the show. QUEST FOR FIRE pursued the front runners
two to three wide, was more the latter spinning into the lane, made no headway. CALL THE CAT rode the rail for a half, swung three wide into the lane,
made no impact. FLEET WARRIOR took up the chase two wide, lacked the necessary stretch response. OUR HONOR dwelt at the start, gradually got
going proceeding along the backstretch, was three wide entering the turn and sent out four wide exiting it, never made its presence felt.

Footnotes
DOVEY LOVEY chased along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced and angled three to four wide into upper
stretch taking over the front, drew clear under a drive to the finish kept to task. FAIR LASSIE bobbled at the break recovering inwards and bumping DIRTY
BIRD, chased three then two wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home, kept on to secure the place honors. DIRTY
BIRD bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe who recovered inwards from a bobble, chased just off the inside under coaxing with three furlongs
remaining, spun just off the inside for home and improved position for the show honors. OVERTIME OLIVIA four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed
along with five-sixteenths to go, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CALINAS SONG prompted the pace of MISS HOT STONES along the
inside before knocking heads with that foe from the nine-sixteenths to the three-eighths, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in the midst of being
shaken off, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. TIZ A KITTEN chased two to three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide
into upper stretch and tired. MISS HOT STONES lunged at the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from CALINAS SONG to her
inside, had that foe advance and dueled through the turn before beginning to shake away five-sixteenths from home, came under threat to the outside and
yielded spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, then folded in the drive.

Footnotes
HOROSCOPE went on to attain the advantage travelling along the chute, showed the way shadowed by SAN JUAN DIEGO to the outside, felt an uptick in
pressure as its fellow in-the-money-finishers were both closing the gap late on the bend, turned into the stretch under stronger handling, clung to the lead,
crossed over into the two path in midstretch after left side stick work, displayed an inclination to drift out yet some more beginning a sixteenth down the road,
had it countered with a snug grip on the left side by the pilot, dug in gamely maintaining a true course hounded by a pair to the outside the final sixteenth,
got the job done. CONTROL GROUP was allowed to settle into a stalking role after the start, departed the backstretch from the three path, increased his
presence when let out a notch at the five-sixteenths pole, was called upon for more for the drive home, inched his way up to the winner, took aim from the
sixteenth pole onward only to get staved off by a resolute rival. SHAMROCK KID off the inside throughout, underwent a four wide pursuit on the turn, rallied
in tandem with the second place finisher springing from the five-sixteenths marker, spun off the turn still stationed in the four path and took off in earnest
after the one to catch, closed in enough so as to be bearing down hard within striking distance with a sixteenth to go, displayed some willingness to the end
but couldn't go past the determined winner. PETER'S PROJECT chased the pace from the two path on the turn, fanned out into path five from upper to
midlane becoming the widest of all, lacked the needed response. SAN JUAN DIEGO sparred with the winner from the two path for nearly three-quarters
before giving way. BLAME THE THIEF cut over to the inside route at the half mile pole, got set down a furlong later, cut the corner into the lane and failed to
fire appreciably.

Footnotes
BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive in behind rivals
and tipped out shouldering JOE'S SMOKIN GUN out of the way to make a lane for himself just inside the eighth pole, rallied to issue a challenge through to
the finish drifting out slightly forcing JOE'S SMOKIN GUN to be taken in hand and was up in the last jumps to prevail. DANEBURY four then three wide in
closest aim of the leader, advanced through the latter portion of the turn and got set down spinning five wide into upper stretch on near even terms for
command, took over narrowly straightened away, dug in head to head with BUSTIN SHOUT, shook off that rival near the sixteenth marker and was collared
in the last strides to the finish. JOE'S SMOKIN GUN bumped at the start by STORM PROPHET who broke outwards, chased five to six wide down the
backstretch and then five wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was
shouldered out by BLUGRASCAT'S SMILE just inside the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and paused late as that same rival drifted outwards slightly while
keeping on to secure the show honors. BUSTIN SHOUT showed the way in hand just off the inside through sensible splits under little pressure until midway
on the turn, came under threat nearing the quarter pole, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away, dug in to the
eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. STORM PROPHET broke out at the start bumping JOE'S SMOKIN GUN, chased five then four wide coaxed
along from the three-eighths, swung six to seven wide for home and weakened. VINCENTO chased three to four wide from the tail of the field, came under
brief coaxing at the three-eighths, got placed to a protective hold at the five-sixteenths, went five to six wide for home, got eased through to the finish while
trailing throughout.

Footnotes
LOCAL HERO procured a prominent position after the field had been sent off and running, appeared keen heading onto the backstretch, was given some
rein and tipped to the outside as the first fraction was being finalized, hitched up to the leader a few jumps later, was in the two path contending for the top
matched up with BRIMSTONE to his inside, kicked free of that opponent during the run around the bend, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole
when turned loose, began the last eighth leading by its largest margin, remained sufficiently in the clear. SHALAKO took up position in midpack, travelled
three wide on the turn, angled one wider for the drive home, gained on the winner flashing some late energy. PROUD ENOUGH worked out a tuck into the
two path at the seven-sixteenths pole, was still in it entering the stretch, had no rally. SANDY LANE in the two path entering the turn, was sent out four wide
exiting it, improved in the lane without impact. MILLS pinched early on the chute, cut over to the inside route, faltered off the ground-saving journey that
followed. GYPSUM JOHNNY took up the chase from path four on the turn, went one father off the rail spinning into the lane, had no response. BRIMSTONE
guided over to the inside with the advantage, was joined by the top one shortly after the initial split had been posted, failed to keep pace on the turn,
stepped into the lane and steadily backed away. EDEN RIDGE brought up the back of pack while racing three wide for nearly three-quarters, was moved
out into the four path at the head of the stretch, never made his presence felt.

a mile pole and tipped three wide through the turn now giving chase as his main prompter waltzed away, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining to come again and take command seventy yards from home, then held off a late closing
rival to prevail. VORTICITY chased just off the inside, drifted slightly three wide at the seven-sixteenths before being angled back to the two path three
furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in late but missed at
the end. CHATEAU three wide in aim of the backstretch, advanced to take over the front at the half mile pole, shook away through the turn to a safe lead,
spun just off the inside for home, got roused at the eighth pole, dug in under threat and was collared seventy yards from home and forced to settle for the
show honors at the end. THE SICARII chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a
mild bid. PIVEN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals. HIS NAME IS SUE five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, continued five wide into upper stretch and weakened. FUEL THE BERN

Footnotes
MORE MISCHIEF along the outside throughout, was pulling on the bit during the initial stages, departed the backstretch from path three, got switched over
to a brisk hand ride at the three-eighths pole, narrowed in, was given her cue challenging as the widest of three front runners entering the turn, emerged at
the eighth pole barely ahead, out-dueled NEWLY MINTED during the next sixteenth and edged away. NEWLY MINTED cut over to the inside with the
advantage, showed the way leading by a slim margin, saw NO HAYNE NO GAYNE assumed the role of primary pursuer as the half was being completed,
held that opponent at bay, felt the presence of the winner by the end of the bend, got let loose stepping into the stretch, relinquished in midstretch, fought on
with distinction for another sixteenth before finally having to settle for second. NO HAYNE NO GAYNE moved up in path two to take on NEWLY MINTED
after the initial split had been posted, kept the pressure on the aforementioned opponent all the way to the end of the bend, was set down spinning into the
lane, vied from between rivals from that juncture until the furlong grounds, gave way in the final furlong. ESPRESSO SHOT strung out four wide on the turn,
made no impact. OUR SUPER NOVA underwent a two wide pursuit for six furlongs, angled into the five path coming into the lane, lacked the needed
response. MRS. ORB saved ground for the opening three-quarters, tipped into the two path for the drive home, had no offering. HELD ACCOUNTABLE
disputed the pace to the outside of the runner up during the opening phases, went on take up the chase three wide on the turn after being shaken off,
fanned out into path six from upper to midstretch, backed away.
